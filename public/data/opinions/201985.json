He now appeals, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying his motion to suppress a confession\n\nhe made to federal agents because the agents violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel.        We affirm.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n            In the early morning hours of July 28, 2002, a fire broke\n\nout inside an apartment building located at 43 High Rock Street in\n\nLynn, Massachusetts.    Police officers and firefighters arriving at\n\nthe scene found that a glass panel on the front door of the\n\napartment    building   had   been    shattered.      After   firefighters\n\nextinguished the fire, the officers determined that three small\n\nfires had been set inside the building.            They also found what\n\nappeared to be a Molotov cocktail in the hallway of the third floor\n\nof   the   building.    The   officers     interviewed   residents   of   the\n\nbuilding, two of whom stated that they had seen a black male, who\n\nhad been driving a Nissan sports car with a T-roof,1 standing on\n\nthe sidewalk outside the building yelling up at an apartment on the\n\nthird floor.    This man entered and exited the building just before\n\nthe residents noticed the smell of smoke.        One of the witnesses saw\n\n\n1\n   According to Wikipedia, a free-content online encyclopedia, T-\nroofs \"open a vehicle roof to the side windows, providing a wider\nopening than other sunroofs. [They] have two removable glass\npanels, and leave a T-shaped structural brace in the roof center.\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunroof (last visited Oct. 27, 2005).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fa straw hat in the man's car, while the other observed the man\n\ncarrying a baseball bat.2\n\n           Based on these statements, police issued a \"be-on-the-\n\nlookout\"   (\"BOLO\")   call   for     a    man   fitting   the   witnesses'\n\ndescription.    Shortly thereafter, two officers responding to an\n\nunrelated noise disturbance complaint a short distance from High\n\nRock Street saw Coker sitting in a Nissan sports car that matched\n\nthe description in the BOLO.       The officers approached the car and\n\nsaw a straw hat and silver baseball bat in the front seat.3            The\n\nofficers later found a pair of rubber gloves and a butane lighter\n\nin the center console.\n\n           The officers detained Coker and arranged for a \"show-up\"\n\nidentification, meaning that they arranged for the two witnesses to\n\nbe brought to Coker's location and tell the police whether he was\n\nthe man they had seen.   Both witnesses identified Coker as the man\n\nthey had seen yelling and entering the building just before the\n\nfire started.   Coker was then placed under arrest.\n\n           Coker was booked at the Lynn Police Department and\n\ncharged with burning or aiding in the burning of a dwelling house,\n\nin violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 1, and malicious or\n\n\n\n2\n   We discuss exactly what the witnesses saw and heard in more\ndetail in Part II.B., infra.\n3\n   The baseball bat had pieces of glass embedded in it.      These\npieces of glass were later matched to the glass from the shattered\ndoor panel at 43 High Rock Street.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwanton injuries to personal property, in violation of Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 266, § 127.        On July 31, 2002, Coker was arraigned in\n\nstate district court, had an attorney appointed, and was released\n\non personal recognizance.\n\n            Between July 28 and July 31, the Lynn Fire Department\n\nnotified the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"BATF\") of\n\nthe incident because it had found what appeared to be a Molotov\n\ncocktail in the apartment building.4         BATF Agent Konstantinos Balos\n\n(\"Agent Balos\") began an investigation to determine if the incident\n\ninvolved a federal crime.          See 18 U.S.C. § 844.         Agent Balos\n\ninterviewed a number of witnesses to the alleged arson.             Several\n\nLynn    police   officers   were   present    at   these   interviews.   On\n\nAugust 8, 2002, Agent Balos and another BATF agent went to Coker's\n\nhouse and asked him to consent to an interview.               At this time,\n\nAgent Balos knew that Coker was represented by counsel in the state\n\ncase.    Coker agreed to the interview and, driving his own car,\n\nfollowed the agents to the Lynn Fire Department, where the BATF\n\nmaintains a satellite office.         The agents brought Coker into a\n\nroom, gave him a seat nearest an unlocked door, told him that he\n\nwas not under arrest and was free to leave at any time, but\n\nnevertheless read Coker his Miranda rights, and gave him a copy of\n\nthose rights.      During the interview, which lasted around ninety\n\n\n\n4\n   The device was submitted to a federal forensics laboratory and\neventually determined to be a fake.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fminutes, Coker confessed to setting fire to the High Rock Street\n\napartment building.5     Towards the end of the interview, Coker\n\nbecame emotional, stating that he regretted setting the fire and\n\nfelt like killing himself.      Coker told the agents that he wanted to\n\nend the interview and left the station.\n\n             In April 2003, a federal grand jury indicted Coker,\n\ncharging him with one count of attempted arson in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 844(i).    Coker filed a motion to suppress the confession,\n\narguing that the federal agents had violated his Sixth Amendment\n\nright   to   counsel.   The    district    court   denied   the   motion   to\n\nsuppress.    On May 9, 2004, following a three-day jury trial, Coker\n\nwas convicted.     He was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment.            He\n\nnow appeals, arguing that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to suppress.\n\n                              II.   Discussion\n\nA.   Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel\n\n             We use a bifurcated standard in reviewing a district\n\ncourt's ruling on a motion to suppress, reviewing factual rulings\n\nfor clear error and legal rulings de novo.              United States v.\n\nPardue, 385 F.3d 101, 104 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Evidently, Coker had offered a resident of the building, Edith\nDrame, $40 for a bag of marijuana. Drame said she could get him\nthe marijuana, took the money, and entered her apartment with no\nintention of coming back out. It was Drame's apartment that Coker\nwas yelling at when the two witnesses saw him.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f               Under    the    Sixth      Amendment,     \"[i]n       all     criminal\n\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the\n\nAssistance of Counsel for his defence.\"                 U.S. Const. amend. VI.\n\nThis right to counsel \"does not attach until a prosecution is\n\ncommenced,      that    is,   at   or   after   the   initiation      of   adversary\n\njudicial criminal proceedings -- whether by way of formal charge,\n\npreliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"\n\nMcNeil    v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 175 (1991) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).             The Supreme Court has held that \"if\n\npolice initiate interrogation after a defendant's assertion, at an\n\narraignment or similar proceeding, of his right to counsel, any\n\nwaiver    of    the    defendant's      right   to   counsel   for    that    police-\n\ninitiated interrogation is invalid.\" Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S.\n\n625, 636 (1986).\n\n               In the instant case, we agree with the district court\n\nthat \"there is no dispute[] that Coker's Sixth Amendment right to\n\ncounsel had attached as to the state charges at least by July 31,\n\n2002, the date of his arraignment in state court, and that he did\n\nnot validly waive that right before\" his confession to the BATF\n\nagents.    United States v. Coker, 298 F. Supp. 2d 184, 189 (D. Mass.\n\n2003). Thus, there is no dispute that Coker's confession would not\n\nhave been admissible in the state prosecution.\n\n               The Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he Sixth Amendment\n\nright [to counsel] . . . is offense specific.              It cannot be invoked\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fonce for all future prosecutions.\"     McNeil, 501 U.S. at 175.    The\n\nissue currently before us is whether the uncharged federal arson\n\noffense was the same offense as the state arson offense for Sixth\n\nAmendment purposes when Coker confessed to the BATF agents.         As\n\nCoker notes, both offenses involved the same essential elements of\n\nproof.   If the two offenses were the same, then Coker's Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel had attached to the federal offense and\n\nwas violated when the federal agents interviewed him.\n\n          Our resolution of this issue turns on our interpretation\n\nof Texas v. Cobb, 532 U.S. 162 (2001), in which the Supreme Court\n\nclarified the meaning of \"offense\" in the Sixth Amendment context.\n\nIn Cobb, the defendant confessed to a home burglary but denied\n\nknowledge of the simultaneous disappearances of a woman and child\n\nfrom the burglarized home.    Id. at 165.    He was indicted for the\n\nburglary, had an attorney appointed, and was released on bond. Id.\n\nOver a year later, while the burglary charges were still pending,\n\nthe defendant confessed to his father that he had killed the woman\n\nand her child.   Id.   His father informed the police, who arrested\n\nthe defendant and advised him of his Miranda rights.         Id.   The\n\ndefendant waived these rights, confessed to the murders, and was\n\neventually convicted of capital murder.     Id. at 165-66.   The Texas\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction, finding that\n\n\"the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel had attached on the capital\n\nmurder charge even though [the defendant] had not yet been charged\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fwith   that    offense\"      because     the    murder   charge    was   \"factually\n\ninterwoven with the burglary.\"                 Id. at 166 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).6      The court found that the defendant had asserted\n\nhis Sixth Amendment right to counsel by accepting appointment of\n\ncounsel in the burglary case, and therefore deemed the confession\n\ninadmissible.       Id.\n\n              The Supreme Court reversed, rejecting the \"factually\n\nrelated\" exception to the offense-specific rule.                   Id. at 172-73.\n\nThe Court re-emphasized that the Sixth Amendment is offense-\n\nspecific      and   looked    to   its    Fifth    Amendment      double   jeopardy\n\njurisprudence to define the term \"offense\" in the Sixth Amendment\n\ncontext.      Id.   The Court applied a test it had articulated in the\n\ndouble jeopardy context in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S.\n\n299, 304 (1932): \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a\n\nviolation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be\n\napplied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is\n\nwhether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other\n\ndoes not.\"      Cobb, 532 U.S. at 173 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).        The burglary and murder charges were separate\n\noffenses under the Blockburger test. The Court thus found that the\n\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached to\n\nthe murder charge.        Id.\n\n\n6\n    Following McNeil, some courts \"read into McNeil's offense-\nspecific definition an exception for crimes that are 'factually\nrelated' to a charged offense.\" Cobb, 532 U.S. at 168.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f             In the instant case, the state and federal arson charges\n\ncontained the same essential elements.            Thus, one might conclude\n\nthat,   under   Cobb      and   Blockburger,   Coker's     federal   and   state\n\noffenses     were   the   same   for   Sixth   Amendment    right    to   counsel\n\npurposes.     However, of significant importance to the present case\n\nis the fact that the Court in Cobb stated that \"[w]e see no\n\nconstitutional difference between the meaning of the term 'offense'\n\nin the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.\"\n\nId.   In its double jeopardy jurisprudence, the Court has held that\n\na defendant's conduct in violation of two separate sovereigns (\"the\n\ndual sovereignty doctrine\") constitutes two distinct offenses.\n\nSee, e.g., Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 87-93 (1985).                     Thus,\n\nunder the dual sovereignty doctrine, Coker's federal offense would\n\nbe considered separate from his state offense for double jeopardy\n\npurposes.7\n\n             The question thus becomes whether the Court in Cobb\n\nincorporated all of its double jeopardy jurisprudence (including\n\nthe dual sovereignty doctrine) or merely the Blockburger test into\n\nits Sixth Amendment right to counsel jurisprudence.                  The Second\n\nCircuit has held that the Court incorporated only the Blockburger\n\ntest into its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and that the dual\n\nsovereignty doctrine does not apply in the Sixth Amendment context.\n\n\n\n7\n   There is an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine that we\ndiscuss below.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fSee United States v. Mills, 412 F.3d 325 (2d Cir. 2005).          In Mills,\n\nan information issued charging the defendant with multiple state\n\nfirearms violations.       Id. at 327.       After the information had\n\nissued, local police officers interviewed the defendant without\n\ncounsel present.     Id.    The parties did not dispute that this\n\ninterview violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel\n\nas to any subsequent state prosecution.       Id. at 328.      However, the\n\nfederal government attempted to use Mills's statements to the local\n\npolice in a subsequent federal prosecution for an offense with same\n\nelements as the state offense.    Id.    The Second Circuit held that,\n\nbecause the two offenses were the same under the Blockburger test,\n\nMills's statements were inadmissible in the federal prosecution.\n\nId. at 330.    The court rejected the government's argument that,\n\nunder Cobb, the doctrine of dual sovereignty applied in the Sixth\n\nAmendment context.      Id. (\"The fact that Cobb appropriates the\n\nBlockburger test, applied initially in the double jeopardy context,\n\ndoes not demonstrate that Cobb incorporates the dual sovereignty\n\ndoctrine.\").    Coker   argues   that   we   should   follow    the   Second\n\nCircuit's rationale.\n\n          The Fifth Circuit, along with the district court in the\n\ninstant case, has taken the position that the dual sovereignty\n\ndoctrine should be applied in the Sixth Amendment context.              See\n\nUnited States v. Avants, 278 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2002).           In Avants,\n\nthe defendant was indicted in 1967 on Mississippi state murder\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcharges related to the killing of African-American sharecropper\n\nnamed Ben White.      Id. at 513.          He was provided with counsel and\n\nreleased on bond.          Id.     While out on bond, the defendant was\n\ninterviewed without counsel by FBI agents who were investigating a\n\nseparate   murder.        Id.      During    the   interview,    the   defendant\n\nconfessed to killing White.         Id.     The FBI agents did not follow up\n\non the confession because they were not investigating White's\n\nmurder.    Id. at 513-14.        The defendant was later acquitted of the\n\nstate murder charges.       Id. at 514.      In June 2000, the defendant was\n\nindicted for the murder by a federal grand jury and moved to\n\nsuppress the confession he had made to the FBI agents.                  Id.     The\n\nFifth   Circuit    held     that    \"the    Supreme     Court   [in    Cobb]   has\n\nincorporated      double     jeopardy       analysis,    including     the     dual\n\nsovereignty doctrine, into its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.\" Id.\n\nat 517.     It therefore found that the defendant's uncounseled\n\nconfession to federal agents was admissible in the federal trial.\n\nId. at 522.    The government argues that we should follow the Fifth\n\nCircuit's rationale.\n\n            After carefully examining Cobb, we conclude that the dual\n\nsovereignty doctrine applies for the purposes of defining what\n\nconstitutes the same offense in the Sixth Amendment right to\n\ncounsel context.      In doing so, we reject the reasoning of the\n\nSecond Circuit in Mills and adopt the reasoning of the Fifth\n\nCircuit in Avants.        The court in Mills stated that \"[n]owhere in\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fCobb, either explicitly or by imputation, is there support for a\n\ndual sovereignty exception\" in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\n\ncontext.   Mills, 412 F.3d at 330.    This statement, in our view,\n\ndoes not give adequate consideration to the Court's statement that\n\nit saw \"no constitutional difference between the meaning of the\n\nterm 'offense' in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right\n\nto counsel.\"   Cobb, 532 U.S. at 173.    If the Court intended to\n\nincorporate only the Blockburger test into its Sixth Amendment\n\njurisprudence, then its statement in Cobb would make no sense, as\n\nthere would be a difference in the meaning of the term \"offense\" in\n\nthe contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.8\n\n           This conclusion is bolstered by a footnote in Cobb, in\n\nwhich the Court stated that \"we could just as easily describe the\n\nSixth Amendment as 'prosecution specific,' insofar as it prevents\n\ndiscussion of charged offenses as well as offenses that, under\n\nBlockburger, could not be the subject of a later prosecution.\" Id.\n\nat 173 n.3.    While the Court referenced only Blockburger, the\n\nstatement indicates that the Court was referring to Blockburger in\n\nthe context of its general double jeopardy jurisprudence. In other\n\nwords, we understand the Court to have meant that if the government\n\ncould not prosecute a defendant for an offense due to double\n\n\n8\n   The difference, of course, would be that offenses with the same\nessential elements under the laws of two separate sovereigns would\nnot constitute the \"same offense\" for double jeopardy purposes,\nwhile they would constitute the \"same offense\" for right to counsel\npurposes.\n\n                               -12-\n\fjeopardy principles, then it could not question the defendant about\n\nthat offense without implicating his Sixth Amendment right to\n\ncounsel, even if the defendant had not yet been charged with the\n\noffense.   In this case, double jeopardy principles would not have\n\nprevented the federal government from prosecuting Coker because of\n\nthe dual sovereignty doctrine.9            Therefore, because Coker was\n\nproperly subject to a later federal prosecution, it follows from\n\nthe Court's statement that the Sixth Amendment did not prevent\n\ndiscussion of the uncharged federal offense.\n\n           Coker argues that applying the dual sovereignty doctrine\n\nto cases such as his will permit law enforcement to perform an end\n\nrun around a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.           As the\n\ngovernment   notes,   a   similar   argument   was   raised   in   Cobb   and\n\nrejected by a majority of the Supreme Court.         The defendant in Cobb\n\nhad argued that applying the offense-specific rule in the Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel context \"will prove disastrous to\n\nsuspects' constitutional rights and will permit law enforcement\n\nofficers almost complete and total license to conduct unwanted and\n\nuncounseled interrogations.\"        Cobb, 532 U.S. at 171 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).      In rejecting this argument, the Court\n\n\n\n9\n    In this sense, the dual sovereignty doctrine serves as an\nexception to the Blockburger test. Given the Court's statement in\nCobb that it saw no difference between the term \"offense\" in the\ndouble jeopardy and right to counsel contexts, we see no reason why\nthe dual sovereignty doctrine would not serve as an exception to\nthe Blockburger test in the right to counsel context.\n\n                                    -13-\n\femphasized     that   it   failed    adequately       to   appreciate      two\n\nconsiderations:\n\n             First, there can be no doubt that a suspect\n             must be apprised of his rights against\n             compulsory self-incrimination and to consult\n             with an attorney before authorities may\n             conduct custodial interrogation . . . Second,\n             it   is  critical   to    recognize that   the\n             Constitution   does    not   negate  society's\n             interest in the ability of police to talk to\n             witnesses and suspects, even those who have\n             been charged with other offenses.\n\nId. at 171-72.    These considerations apply with equal force to the\n\ninstant case, especially given the fact that Coker was given and\n\nwaived his Miranda rights.      See id. at 172 n.2 (\"Even though the\n\nSixth Amendment right to counsel has not attached to uncharged\n\noffenses, defendants retain the ability under Miranda to refuse any\n\npolice questioning . . . .\").        Further, any concerns we may have\n\nabout potential \"end runs\" around the Sixth Amendment's protections\n\nare mitigated by an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine\n\nfirst recognized by this court in United States v. Guzmán, 85 F.3d\n\n823 (1st Cir. 1996). In Guzmán, we interpreted certain language of\n\nthe Supreme Court in Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959), to\n\nmean that an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine (the\n\n\"Bartkus exception\") exists where \"one sovereign so thoroughly\n\ndominates or manipulates the prosecutorial machinery of another\n\nthat   the   latter   retains   little     or   no   volition   in   its   own\n\nproceedings.\" Id. at 827. This exception applies with equal force\n\nin the Sixth Amendment context.            Thus, if it appears that one\n\n                                    -14-\n\fsovereign is controlling the prosecution of another merely to\n\ncircumvent the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, under\n\nthe Bartkus exception the dual sovereignty doctrine will not apply.\n\nWe believe that this exception will help prevent law enforcement\n\nofficials from making an end run around the right to counsel.\n\n          Coker next argues that, in the event we find that the\n\ndual sovereignty doctrine applies in the Sixth Amendment right to\n\ncounsel context, we should apply the Bartkus exception to his case\n\nbecause the federal and state investigations were inextricably\n\nintertwined and because the federal agents were aware of the state\n\ncharges and that Coker had a lawyer for those charges when they\n\ninterviewed him.\n\n          In Guzmán, we stated that a defendant arguing for the\n\nexception to the dual sovereignty doctrine \"must proffer evidence\n\nsufficient   to    establish   a   prima   facie   case    that   the   two\n\nprosecutions were for the same offense.\"           Id.    In other words,\n\nCoker \"must produce some evidence tending to prove that . . . one\n\nsovereign was a pawn of the other, with the result that the notion\n\nof two supposedly independent prosecutions is merely a sham.\"           Id.\n\nCoker has failed to carry this entry-level burden.\n\n          The district court found that\n\n          [t]he state authorities began an investigation\n          and interviewed witnesses on the day of the\n          incident. Within a day or two, they notified\n          the BATF of the possibility of a federal\n          crime, and for a time the two sovereigns\n          continued the investigation in parallel.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f            Shortly after the BATF became involved,\n            however, the state effectively ended its\n            investigation.    The federal investigation\n            continued, Coker was indicted by a federal\n            grand jury, and the state charges against him\n            were dropped.\n\nCoker, 298 F. Supp. 2d at 192.           We find no clear error in these\n\nfactual determinations made by the district court, nor do we\n\nbelieve that Coker has pointed to any evidence tending to show that\n\none of the prosecutions was a sham.                Rather, the \"facts show\n\nnothing   more   than    the   rendering    of    routine    intergovernmental\n\nassistance.       Cooperative      law      enforcement      efforts    between\n\nindependent sovereigns are commendable, and, without more, such\n\nefforts will not furnish a legally adequate basis for invoking the\n\n. . . exception to the dual sovereign rule.\"                Guzmán, 85 F.3d at\n\n828.\n\n            Coker relies heavily on the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n\nUnited States v. Red Bird, 287 F.3d 709 (8th Cir. 2002).                 In Red\n\nBird, the defendant was alleged to have committed a rape on a\n\nNative American reservation.         Id. at 711.      He was arraigned in a\n\ntribal court and had an attorney appointed to assist in his\n\nrepresentation.    Id.     The FBI was informed of the charge, and a\n\ntribal    investigator    assisted    an    FBI    agent     in   locating   and\n\ninterviewing the defendant without counsel's presence.                 Id.   The\n\ndefendant was later prosecuted on federal rape charges.                 Id. at\n\n712. The Eighth Circuit rejected the government's dual sovereignty\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fargument and found that evidence obtained from the interview was\n\ninadmissible.       Id. at 714-15.\n\n               The basis for the court's decision in Red Bird is not\n\nentirely clear.       On the one hand, the court looked to Cobb and,\n\nusing the Blockburger test, determined that the tribal and federal\n\noffenses were the same for Sixth Amendment purposes because they\n\ncontained the same essential elements.              Id. at 715.   In so doing,\n\nthe    court    rejected   the    government's      argument    that   the    dual\n\nsovereignty doctrine applied in the Sixth Amendment context.                    On\n\nthe     other      hand,    the      court    repeatedly       emphasized      the\n\ninterconnectedness of the tribal and federal investigations as a\n\nreason for finding that the dual sovereignty doctrine did not\n\napply.      For example, the court noted that tribal governments and\n\nfederal authorities commonly worked together in investigating and\n\nprosecuting crimes committed on reservations and that \"tribal\n\nsovereignty is unique and limited.\"                Id. at 713, 715 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n               Coker argues that Red Bird represents an exception to the\n\ndual sovereignty doctrine.         While we think that Red Bird is not as\n\nclear as Coker believes, to the extent that Red Bird represents\n\nsuch   an    exception,    Coker's    case    is   distinguishable.      As    the\n\ngovernment points out, the relationship between the state and\n\nfederal investigations in Coker's case is different from the\n\nrelationship between the tribal and federal investigations in Red\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fBird.   In Red Bird, there was evidence that tribal and federal\n\nauthorities commonly cooperated in investigations.                In Coker's\n\ncase,   although      there   was   a      certain    amount     of   routine\n\nintergovernmental assistance, there was no evidence that the two\n\nsovereigns   consistently     worked       together    in     investigations.\n\nFurther, there was no evidence here to suggest that one of the\n\nprosecutions was a sham or that one of the sovereigns was the pawn\n\nof the other, while in Red Bird, the limited and unique nature of\n\ntribal sovereignty caused the court's concern.              We therefore find\n\nthat the exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine does not apply\n\nto Coker's case.\n\n           In sum, we hold that, as a result of the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Cobb, the dual sovereignty doctrine applies in the\n\nSixth Amendment right to counsel context.             The state and federal\n\noffenses in Coker's case were thus different offenses for Sixth\n\nAmendment purposes and Coker's right to counsel had not attached to\n\nthe uncharged federal offense when he was interviewed by the\n\nfederal agents.    The district court did not err in denying Coker's\n\nmotion to suppress.\n\nB.   Harmless Error\n\n           Even if we were to find that the district court erred in\n\ndenying Coker's motion to suppress, any error would be harmless at\n\nbest.   Since the issue in this case is constitutional in nature,\n\nthe government would have the burden of proving harmless error\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Ventura-Cruel, 356\n\nF.3d 55, 64 n.12 (1st Cir. 2003).            In other words, the government\n\nwould have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Coker would have\n\nbeen convicted even if his confession had not been admitted into\n\nevidence.\n\n              Coker    correctly     notes   that    we    have   stated   that\n\n\"[c]onfessions are by nature highly probative and likely to be at\n\nthe center of the jury's attention.\"             Id. at 64 (quoting United\n\nStates   v.    León-Delfis,    203    F.3d   103,    112   (1st   Cir.   2000)).\n\nHowever, having reviewed the record, we are convinced that, even in\n\nthe absence of the confession, the evidence against Coker was so\n\noverwhelming that he would have been convicted.\n\n              The government presented the testimony of two residents\n\nof the apartment building who witnessed Coker yelling outside of\n\nthe building and entering and exiting the building just before the\n\nfire started.         The first witness, April Loftman, lived on the\n\nsecond floor of the apartment building.             On the night in question,\n\nLoftman was awake feeding her baby when she heard someone screaming\n\noutside of her window.        Loftman looked out of her front window and\n\nsaw a man on the sidewalk in front of the building, pacing back and\n\nforth, yelling and pointing at Edith Drame's window, which was on\n\nthe third floor of the building just above Loftman's apartment.\n\nThe man was standing just beneath her window, and Loftman testified\n\nthat the area was well-lit.          Loftman heard the man say that \"you\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fplayed the wrong person\" and that he was going to \"blaze this\n\nmother fucker up.\"    Loftman also noticed a Nissan 280Z with a T-\n\nroof parked in the street facing the wrong direction.             She saw a\n\nstraw hat on the front passenger seat.\n\n           Loftman saw the man enter the building.       She went to her\n\nfront door and looked through her peephole to see where the man was\n\ngoing.   She saw the man walk past her door and heard him walk up\n\nthe stairs to the third floor.   She heard the man bang on a door on\n\nthe third floor and then heard him walk back down the stairs.            When\n\nLoftman heard the door to the building open and shut, she returned\n\nto her window.     She observed the same man standing outside and\n\nscreaming.    The man eventually went to his car, the Nissan with a\n\nT-roof, at which time another man driving a Volkswagen pulled up to\n\nthe   building.    Loftman   recognized   the   driver   as   a    man   who\n\nfrequented the third floor to engage in drug activity. This second\n\nman entered the building, and the first man followed shortly\n\nthereafter.   Loftman heard the second man go to the third floor and\n\nthen she heard a door slam shut.    Loftman then heard the first man\n\ncome up the stairs and jiggle the door handle to her apartment,\n\napparently searching for the second man.         Loftman panicked and\n\ncalled the Lynn Police Department, who told her to call back if\n\nanything else happened.\n\n           Loftman heard the upstairs door shut and heard footsteps\n\non the stairs.     She went back to the window and saw both men\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\foutside of the building.    It appeared to Loftman that the men had\n\na brief conversation before the man in the Volkswagen got into his\n\ncar and drove off.     Loftman then saw the first man re-enter the\n\nbuilding and heard him go upstairs and knock on Edith Drame's door.\n\nWhen he got no answer, the man left the building.            Loftman\n\ntestified that the man again said that he was going to blaze the\n\nbuilding before getting into his car and leaving.\n\n            About ten minutes later, Loftman heard a car door slam in\n\nfront of the building.    She looked out her window and saw the same\n\nNissan 280Z and the same man.     The man got out, opened his trunk\n\nand entered the building.10    Loftman listened carefully but heard\n\nno   footsteps.   Shortly thereafter, she heard the front door shut\n\nagain and saw the man go directly to his car and leave.      Loftman\n\nthen went back to her peephole but could see only darkness.      She\n\nopened her door and saw that the hallway was full of smoke.\n\n            The second witness, Bill Terrell, also lived on the\n\nsecond floor.     He testified that on the night in question he was\n\nawakened by the sounds of a man yelling in the street.     He looked\n\nout his window and saw a man standing outside yelling at the\n\nbuilding.    This man was the only person that Terrell saw outside.\n\nTerrell testified that he heard the man state that \"you beat the\n\nwrong person.     I'm going to come back and I'm going to blaze this\n\n\n\n10\n   At some point, Loftman heard the sound of glass breaking but was\nunable to recall when exactly she heard this.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fwhole spot up.\"   The man eventually ran into the building.   Terrell\n\nwent to his front door and heard the man running up the stairs\n\nyelling \"I'm going to fucking kill you.\"\n\n          As the man exited the building, Terrell heard a smash.\n\nHe stuck his body halfway out of his window and saw the man holding\n\na metal bat.   Terrell saw the man go to his car, which he described\n\nas a sports car with a T-roof, throw the bat inside, and drive off.\n\nAfter five to eight minutes, Terrell heard a car door slam.       He\n\nlooked out the window and saw the same car parked outside.    Terrell\n\ndid not see anyone around the car but heard the sounds of someone\n\nin the hallway.   He called Loftman, who told him that she thought\n\nshe smelled smoke.     Terrell then opened his door and saw a big\n\ncloud of smoke in the hallway.\n\n          As we noted earlier, Coker was found driving a Nissan\n\nsports car with a T-roof.    A straw hat and metal bat with glass\n\nembedded in it was found in his car, as were a pair of rubber\n\ngloves and a butane lighter. In addition, both Loftman and Terrell\n\nidentified Coker that evening as the man they had seen outside of\n\ntheir building.    At trial, Loftman again identified Coker as the\n\nman she had seen outside of her window.   Terrell was unable to make\n\nan in-court identification because he could no longer remember what\n\nthe man looked like.    However, he testified that he was certain\n\nthat the man he had identified the morning of the fire was the man\n\nhe had seen in front of his building.\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f            In sum, the government had the testimony of two witnesses\n\nwho saw Coker outside of the building yelling and making threats,\n\nincluding that he was going to kill someone and that he was going\n\nto \"blaze\" this building.       They saw Coker enter the building and\n\nexit just before they noticed smoke.          They also identified Coker's\n\ncar, as well as objects in the car.           Based on this testimony and\n\nthe corroborating physical evidence, we are convinced that a jury\n\nwould   have      convicted   Coker    even   without   evidence   of     the\n\nconfession.11      Therefore, any possible error from admitting the\n\nconfession was harmless at best.\n\n                              III.    Conclusion\n\n            For    the   foregoing    reasons,     Coker's   conviction    is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n11\n    Coker argues that his counsel did not attempt to impeach the\nidentification testimony given by Loftman and Terrell at trial\nbecause it would have been useless given the confession. Coker\nargues that, if the confession had been suppressed, he would have\nimpeached the identification testimony with evidence that (1)\nLoftman and Terrell were driven together to the scene of the show-\nup identification, (2) Loftman and Terrell spoke about the case as\nthey were being driven, and (3) Terrell identified Coker only after\nLoftman identified Coker.       Having considered the witnesses'\ntestimony and the \"impeachment evidence\" that Coker mentions, we\nbelieve that a jury would have reached the same result even if\nCoker's counsel had attempted to impeach the identification\ntestimony. Coker also argues that without the confession, he could\nhave attempted to focus the jury on the man in the Volkswagen as a\npossible suspect. However, Loftman testified that the man in the\nVolkswagen left the scene well before the fire began and did not\nreturn. Also, the testimony of both Loftman and Terrell showed\nthat Coker was the only person who entered and exited the building\njust before the fire. We do not believe that a jury would have\nbeen convinced by Coker's argument, given the testimony of the two\nwitnesses and the corroborating physical evidence.\n\n                                      -23-\n\f\"Concurring opinions follows.\"\n\n\n\n\n             -24-\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge (Concurring).                   The admission\n\ninto evidence of the Coker confession violated the Sixth Amendment\n\nright to have counsel present during the post-indictment interview.\n\nI would affirm on the ground that the violation was harmless beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.        I write separately, since I am unable to agree\n\nwith the panel decision that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred,\n\nand I am concerned that its alternate holding may invite serious\n\nprecedential consequences.            See California v. United States, 438\n\nU.S. 645, 689 n.10 (1978) (stating that court's alternate holdings\n\nare not obiter dicta, but have full precedential effect); Natural\n\nRes. Def. Council, Inc. v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 216 F.3d\n\n1180, 1189 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (same).\n\n           Prior      to   Cobb,   there   was      no    question   but   that   the\n\n\"separate sovereign\" doctrine, pursuant to which federal and state\n\nprosecutions for the same offense were not deemed offensive to the\n\nFifth Amendment double jeopardy clause, had no application outside\n\nthe double jeopardy context.           For instance, the separate sovereign\n\ndoctrine neither applies to the Fourth Amendment protection from\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures, see Elkins v. United States,\n\n364 U.S. 206, 208 (1960) (\"[A]rticles obtained as a result of an\n\nunreasonable     search      and   seizure     by    state     officers,    without\n\ninvolvement of federal officers,\" cannot \"be introduced in evidence\n\nagainst a defendant over his timely objection in a federal criminal\n\ntrial\"),   nor   to    the    Fifth    Amendment         privilege   against   self-\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\fincrimination, see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of N.Y. Harbor, 378\n\nU.S. 52, 55 (1964) (stating that the policy reasons underlying the\n\nself-incrimination prohibition are \"defeated when a witness can be\n\nwhipsawed into incriminating himself under both state and federal\n\nlaw   even     though    the     constitutional    privilege    against   self-\n\nincrimination is applicable to each\").              Elkins and Murphy wisely\n\nrecognized that allowing the separate sovereign doctrine to operate\n\nin the context of these important constitutional protections would\n\nencourage collusion between the federal and state sovereigns, one\n\nsovereign      obtaining        evidence   in     violation    of   defendants'\n\nconstitutional rights, then passing the evidence on a \"silver\n\nplatter\" to the other sovereign, which would then be free to\n\nutilize the tainted evidence in its own prosecution with no risk of\n\nsuppression.         Elkins, 364 U.S. at 208.       Obviously, no comparable\n\npolicy concerns regarding evidence-gathering are presented in the\n\ndouble jeopardy context.\n\n              Read properly, Cobb does not compel the anomaly which the\n\nmajority now countenances, viz., permitting federal and state\n\nauthorities to violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to\n\ncounsel      where    they     are   prohibited   from   undertaking   similar\n\ncollusive actions with respect to Fourth Amendment and Fifth\n\nAmendment rights. Indeed, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has\n\nbeen long recognized as among the constitutional protections most\n\ncritical to ensuring the conduct of fair criminal trials.                   See\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fMassiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 205 (1964); Gideon v.\n\nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 343-44 (1963); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\n\nU.S. 459, 462-63 (1938).       In Cobb, the federal government was not\n\ninvolved.    Rather, the State indicted Cobb for burglary, later\n\ninterrogated him, without the aid of counsel, concerning a murder\n\ncommitted    during   that    burglary,    and    used   his   incriminating\n\nstatements during that post-indictment interview to indict him for\n\nthat murder.   On appeal, the question was whether the burglary and\n\nmurder were the same \"offense.\"       Although some courts had devised\n\na test which considered two crimes the same if they were factually\n\nrelated (e.g., committed on the same day), the Court imported the\n\nBlockburger test from the double jeopardy definition of \"offense,\"\n\nand held that two offenses are not the same for Sixth Amendment\n\npurposes if each requires proof of a fact that the other does not.\n\nCobb, 532 U.S. at 173.       It was in this straitened context that the\n\nCourt stated that \"[w]e see no constitutional difference between\n\nthe meaning of the term 'offense' in the contexts of double\n\njeopardy and of the right to counsel.\"           Id.\n\n            Here, there is no question but that Coker was questioned\n\nafter his indictment regarding the \"same offense,\" and under Cobb\n\nand the Blockburger test, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had\n\nattached.    In order to find otherwise, one must assume that the\n\nCourt held that, the particular facts of the case before it\n\nnotwithstanding, it meant to decide that henceforth there would be\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fno conceivable differences between the term \"offense\" in the double\n\njeopardy and Sixth Amendment contexts.               The Court in Cobb did not\n\neven consider the policy issues raised in Elkins and Murray, for a\n\nsimple    reason:   the    case   before      it   did   not    involve   separate\n\nsovereigns.\n\n            'If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted\n            than   any    other    in    the    process   of\n            constitutional adjudication, it is that we\n            ought   not    to   pass    on    questions   of\n            constitutionality    .    .    .   unless   such\n            adjudication is unavoidable.' . . . It has\n            long been the Court's 'considered practice not\n            to decide abstract, hypothetical or contingent\n            questions   .    .   .   or    to   decide   any\n            constitutional question in advance of the\n            necessity for its decision . . . or to\n            formulate a rule of constitutional law broader\n            than is required by the precise facts to which\n            it is to be applied . . . or to decide any\n            constitutional question except with reference\n            to the particular facts to which it is to be\n            applied.'\n\nClinton   v.   Jones,     520   U.S.   681,    690    n.11     (1997)   (citations\n\nomitted).      Especially in light of Elkins and Murray, and their\n\nfocus upon the important policy of preventing collusive end-runs\n\naround constitutional safeguards, there remains considerable doubt\n\nwhether the Court, if and when confronted with a separate sovereign\n\ncase, would hold that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel should\n\nbe treated less cordially than the Fourth and Fifth Amendment\n\nrights, absent some compelling reason for doing so.                     See United\n\nStates v. Mills, 412 F.3d 325, 329-30 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that\n\nCobb did not intend to import separate sovereign doctrine into\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fSixth Amendment context); cf. United States v. Red Bird, 287 F.3d\n\n709, 715 (8th Cir. 2002) (refusing to apply separate sovereign\n\ndoctrine to Sixth Amendment right to counsel in joint federal-\n\ntribal crime investigation).\n\n          These policy concerns cannot be fully assuaged simply by\n\nresort to the Bartkus exception to the separate sovereign doctrine\n\nin the double jeopardy context, since it is \"limited to situations\n\nin which one sovereign so thoroughly dominates or manipulates the\n\nprosecutorial machinery of another that the latter retains little\n\nor no volition in the proceedings.\"          United States v. Guzmán, 85\n\nF.3d 823, 827 (1st Cir. 1996).       Obviously, this leaves out much of\n\nthe mutual collusion of independent sovereigns which is the subject\n\nof Elkins and Murray, and creates a portentous risk of abuse in\n\nthis age of increasing federal-state cooperation.              See United\n\nStates v. Martínez, 972 F.2d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir. 1992).          I see no\n\nprincipled reason that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel ought\n\nto be subject to the separate sovereign doctrine when the Fourth\n\nAmendment and Fifth Amendment self-incrimination rights are not.\n\n          Nor can I agree with my colleague's co-concurrence, which\n\nfinds this overly broad interpretation of Cobb consonant with the\n\nCourt's decisions not unnecessarily to thwart police investigations\n\nof crime, for the argument improperly demotes Sixth Amendment\n\nprotection   from   substance   to    mere    form,   and   overlooks   the\n\ncountervailing policy interests discussed in Elkins and Murray.\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fThe   Sixth    Amendment   right   to   counsel   already   has   built-in\n\nsafeguards: the right can be invoked only for the offense for which\n\ndefendant is under indictment, not for \"new or additional crimes,\"\n\nMaine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 179 (1985), and \"cannot be invoked\n\nonce for all future prosecutions,\"        McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S.\n\n171, 175 (1991).      The rationale advocated by the co-concurrence\n\nwould render Sixth Amendment protections essentially meaningless,\n\nsubject to the most blatant and irremediable manipulation.            See\n\nCobb, 532 U.S. at 168 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\"The Constitution\n\ndoes not take away with one hand what it gives with the other.\").12\n\n              For these reasons, I do not join in the alternative\n\nholding that the police interview with Coker did not violate his\n\nSixth Amendment right to counsel.         At the very least, prudence\n\ncounsels that we refrain from deciding this difficult and important\n\nconstitutional issue. See Bellville v. Town of Northboro, 375 F.3d\n\n25, 30 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Normally, we endeavor to avoid deciding\n\nconstitutional issues and attempt to decide cases on the narrowest\n\ngrounds possible.\").       However, I do agree with my colleagues in\n\ntheir alternative holding: that any Sixth Amendment violation was\n\n\n12\n   My concurring colleague also advances his Cobb interpretation\nas affording police officers the advantage of a clear bright-line\nrule, but the same can be said of a rule which does not allow any\ninvocation of the separate sovereign doctrine as a justification\nfor a post-indictment interview concerning the offense of\nindictment.   Be that as it may, clarity has never been the\nparamount benchmark of constitutional interpretation, which often\nrequires difficult judgment calls by law enforcement officials in\nthe field.\n\n                                   -30-\n\fharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.   Although I recognize that a\n\nconfession normally carries great evidentiary heft, see United\n\nStates v. Carpenter, 403 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 125\n\nS. Ct. 2284 (2005), the other circumstances of this case persuade\n\nme that the error was harmless, see, e.g., United States v. Downs-\n\nMoses, 329 F.3d 253, 267-68 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Ward-\n\nO'Neill v. United States, 540 U.S. 916 (2003).\n\n\n\n                  \"Concurring opinion follows.\"\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge (Concurring).          I agree with Judge\n\nTorruella that the government did not violate defendant Edward\n\nCoker's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and that Texas v. Cobb,\n\n532 U.S. 162 (2001), is instructive as to why.           Coker argues that\n\nthe interests protected by the prohibition against government\n\ncontact with an accused after the right to counsel has attached\n\nwould be undermined if federal authorities, investigating whether\n\nan incident that already has given rise to state charges also\n\nshould be charged as a parallel federal offense, were permitted to\n\nquestion the accused without first approaching his lawyer in the\n\nstate proceeding. The argument is a classic one for substance over\n\nform:   the substance of the right to counsel would be unduly\n\ncompromised if, under these circumstances, the court were to accord\n\ndispositive significance to the fact that the federal crime being\n\ninvestigated, while containing the same elements as the charged\n\nstate crime, is formally distinct because it is a crime against a\n\nseparate sovereign.\n\n           The problem with Coker's argument is that, sometimes, a\n\nformalist approach itself serves substantive interests.             In this\n\ncase, the formalist approach urged by the government will serve an\n\ninterest in permitting investigating authorities to talk with\n\nwitnesses and suspects who have been charged with formally distinct\n\noffenses   --   even   those   arising   from   the   same   incident   under\n\ninvestigation.    And it will do so by means of a bright-line rule\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fthat   eliminates    the   need    for     judgment   calls   about   where\n\nconstitutional boundaries might lie.         As Judge Torruella explains,\n\na majority of the Supreme Court -- albeit a slim one -- has in no\n\nless compelling circumstances favored the investigative interest\n\nover the admittedly substantial interests invoked by Coker.             See\n\nCobb, 532 U.S. at 171-72.         Having constructed and justified the\n\nformalist approach, the Court should be the source of any change in\n\nlegal direction.13\n\n\n\n\n13\n    I acknowledge the merit of our concurring colleague's well\narticulated prudential concerns, but I cannot join his analysis of\nwhether there has been a Sixth Amendment violation, because the\nanalysis is in my view argumentum ad consequentiam.\n\n                                    -33-\n\f",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of July 28, 2002, a fire broke out inside an apartment building located at 43 High Rock Street in Lynn, Massachusetts. Police officers and firefighters arriving at the scene found that a glass panel on the front door of the apartment building had been shattered. After firefighters extinguished the fire, the officers determined that three small fires had been set inside the building. They also found what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail in the hallway of the third floor of the building. The officers interviewed residents of the building, two of whom stated that they had seen a black male, who had been driving a Nissan sports car with a T-roof,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> standing on the sidewalk outside the building yelling up at an apartment on the third floor. This man entered and exited the building just before the residents noticed the smell of smoke. One of the witnesses saw a straw hat in the man's car, while the other observed the man carrying a baseball bat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these statements, police issued a \"be-on-the-lookout\" (\"BOLO\") call for a man fitting the witnesses' description. Shortly thereafter, two officers responding to an unrelated noise disturbance complaint a short distance from High Rock Street saw Coker sitting in a Nissan sports car that matched the description in the BOLO. The officers approached the car and saw a straw hat and silver baseball bat in the front seat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The officers later found a pair of rubber gloves and a butane lighter in the center console.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers detained Coker and arranged for a \"show-up\" identification, meaning that they arranged for the two witnesses to be brought to Coker's location and tell the police whether he was the man they had seen. Both witnesses identified Coker as the man they had seen yelling and entering the building just before the fire started. Coker was then placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker was booked at the Lynn Police Department and charged with burning or aiding in the burning of a dwelling house, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 1, and malicious or wanton injuries to personal property, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 127. On July 31, 2002, Coker was arraigned in state district court, had an attorney appointed, and was released on personal recognizance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between July 28 and July 31, the Lynn Fire Department notified the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"BATF\") of the incident because it had found what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail in the apartment building.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> BATF Agent Konstantinos Balos (\"Agent Balos\") began an investigation to determine if the incident involved a federal crime. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844. Agent Balos interviewed a number of witnesses to the alleged arson. Several Lynn police officers were present at these interviews. On August 8, 2002, Agent Balos and another BATF agent went to Coker's house and asked him to consent to an interview. At this time, Agent Balos knew that Coker was represented by counsel in the state case. Coker agreed to the interview and, driving his own car, followed the agents to the Lynn Fire Department, where the BATF maintains a satellite office. The agents brought Coker into a room, gave him a seat nearest an unlocked door, told him that he was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time, but nevertheless read Coker his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and gave him a copy of those rights. During the interview, which lasted around ninety minutes, Coker confessed to setting fire to the High Rock Street apartment building.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Towards the end of the interview, Coker became emotional, stating that he regretted setting the fire and felt like killing himself. Coker told the agents that he wanted to end the interview and left the station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2003, a federal grand jury indicted Coker, charging him with one count of attempted arson in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). Coker filed a motion to suppress the confession, arguing that the federal agents had violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The district court denied the motion to suppress. On May 9, 2004, following a three-day jury trial, Coker was convicted. He was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment. He now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

This right to counsel \"does not attach until a prosecution is commenced, that is, at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings &#8212; whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\" <i>McNeil v. Wisconsin,</i> 501 U.S. 171, 175, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Supreme Court has held that \"if police initiate interrogation after a defendant's assertion, at an arraignment or similar proceeding, of his right to counsel, any waiver of the defendant's right to counsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.\" <i>Michigan v. Jackson,</i> 475 U.S. 625, 636, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, we agree with the district court that \"there is no dispute[ ] that Coker's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached as to the state charges at least by July 31, 2002, the date of his arraignment in state court, and that he did not validly waive that right before\" his confession to the BATF agents. <i>United States v. Coker,</i> 298 F.Supp.2d 184, 189 (D.Mass.2003). Thus, there is no dispute that Coker's confession would not have been admissible in the state prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he Sixth Amendment right [to counsel] . . . is offense specific. It cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions.\" <i>McNeil,</i> 501 U.S. at 175, 111 S.Ct. 2204. The issue currently before us is whether the uncharged federal arson offense was the same offense as the state arson offense for Sixth Amendment purposes when Coker confessed to the BATF agents. As Coker notes, both offenses involved the same essential elements of proof. If the two offenses were the same, then Coker's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached to the federal offense and was violated when the federal agents interviewed him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of this issue turns on our interpretation of <i>Texas v. Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. 162, 121 S.Ct. 1335, 149 L.Ed.2d 321 (2001), in which the Supreme Court clarified the meaning of \"offense\" in the Sixth Amendment context. In <i>Cobb,</i> the defendant confessed to a home burglary but denied knowledge of the simultaneous disappearances of a woman and child from the burglarized home. <i>Id.</i> at 165, 121 S.Ct. 1335. He was indicted for the burglary, had an attorney appointed, and was released on bond. <i>Id.</i> Over a year later, while the burglary charges were still pending, the defendant confessed to his father that he had killed the woman and her child. <i>Id.</i> His father informed the police, who arrested the defendant and advised him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>Id.</i> The defendant waived these rights, confessed to the murders, and was eventually convicted of capital murder. <i>Id.</i> at 165-66, 121 S.Ct. 1335. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction, finding that \"the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel had attached on the capital murder charge even though [the defendant] had not yet been charged with that offense\" because the murder charge was \"factually interwoven with the burglary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 166, 121 S.Ct. 1335 (internal quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court found that the defendant had asserted his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by accepting appointment of counsel in the burglary case, and therefore deemed the confession inadmissible. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court reversed, rejecting the \"factually related\" exception to the offense-specific rule. <i>Id.</i> at 172-73, 121 S.Ct. 1335. The Court re-emphasized that the Sixth Amendment is offense-specific and looked to its Fifth Amendment double jeopardy jurisprudence to define the term \"offense\" in the Sixth Amendment context. <i>Id.</i> The Court applied a test it had articulated in the double jeopardy context in <i>Blockburger v. United States,</i> 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932): \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\" <i>Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 173, 121 S.Ct. 1335 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The burglary and murder charges were separate offenses under the <i>Blockburger</i> test. The Court thus found that the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached to the murder charge. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the state and federal arson charges contained the same essential elements. Thus, one might conclude that, under <i>Cobb</i> and <i>Blockburger,</i> Coker's federal and state offenses were the same for Sixth Amendment right to counsel purposes. However, of significant importance to the present case is the fact that the Court in <i>Cobb</i> stated that \"[w]e see no constitutional difference between the meaning of the term `offense' in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.\" <i>Id.</i> In its double jeopardy jurisprudence, the Court has held that a defendant's conduct in violation of two separate sovereigns (\"the dual sovereignty doctrine\") constitutes two distinct offenses. <i>See, e.g., Heath v. Alabama,</i> 474 U.S. 82, 87-93, 106 S.Ct. 433, 88 L.Ed.2d 387 (1985). Thus, under the dual sovereignty doctrine, Coker's federal offense would be considered separate from his state offense for double jeopardy purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question thus becomes whether the Court in <i>Cobb</i> incorporated all of its double jeopardy jurisprudence (including the dual sovereignty doctrine) or merely the <i>Blockburger</i> test into its Sixth Amendment right to counsel jurisprudence. The Second Circuit has held that the Court incorporated only the <i>Blockburger</i> test into its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and that the dual sovereignty doctrine does not apply in the Sixth Amendment context. <i>See United States v. Mills,</i> 412 F.3d 325 (2d Cir.2005). In <i>Mills,</i> an information issued charging the defendant with multiple state firearms violations. <i>Id.</i> at 327. After the information had issued, local police officers interviewed the defendant without counsel present. <i>Id.</i> The parties did not dispute that this interview violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel as to any subsequent state prosecution. <i>Id.</i> at 328. However, the federal government attempted to use Mills's statements to the local police in a subsequent federal prosecution for an offense with same elements as the state offense. <i>Id.</i> The Second Circuit held that, because the two offenses were the same under the <i>Blockburger</i> test, Mills's statements were inadmissible in the federal prosecution. <i>Id.</i> at 330. The court rejected the government's argument that, under <i>Cobb,</i> the doctrine of dual sovereignty applied in the Sixth Amendment context. <i>Id.</i> (\"The fact that <i>Cobb</i> appropriates the <i>Blockburger</i> test, applied initially in the double jeopardy context, does not demonstrate that <i>Cobb</i> incorporates the dual sovereignty doctrine.\"). Coker argues that we should follow the Second Circuit's rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit, along with the district court in the instant case, has taken the position that the dual sovereignty doctrine should be applied in the Sixth Amendment context. <i>See United States v. Avants,</i> 278 F.3d 510 (5th Cir.2002). In <i>Avants,</i> the defendant was indicted in 1967 on Mississippi state murder charges related to the killing of African-American sharecropper named Ben White. <i>Id.</i> at 513. He was provided with counsel and released on bond. <i>Id.</i> While out on bond, the defendant was interviewed without counsel by FBI agents who were investigating a separate murder. <i>Id.</i> During the interview, the defendant confessed to killing White. <i>Id.</i> The FBI agents did not follow up on the confession because they were not investigating White's murder. <i>Id.</i> at 513-14. The defendant was later acquitted of the state murder charges. <i>Id.</i> at 514. In June 2000, the defendant was indicted for the murder by a federal grand jury and moved to suppress the confession he had made to the FBI agents. <i>Id.</i> The Fifth Circuit held that \"the Supreme Court [in <i>Cobb</i>] has incorporated double jeopardy analysis, including the dual sovereignty doctrine, into its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 517. It therefore found that the defendant's uncounseled confession to federal agents was admissible in the federal trial. <i>Id.</i> at 522. The government argues that we should follow the Fifth Circuit's rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After carefully examining <i>Cobb,</i> we conclude that the dual sovereignty doctrine applies for the purposes of defining what constitutes the same offense in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context. In doing so, we reject the reasoning of the Second Circuit in <i>Mills</i> and adopt the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in <i>Avants.</i> The court in <i>Mills</i> stated that \"[n]owhere in <i>Cobb,</i> either explicitly or by imputation, is there support for a dual sovereignty exception\" in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context. <i>Mills,</i> 412 F.3d at 330. This statement, in our view, does not give adequate consideration to the Court's statement that it saw \"no constitutional difference between the meaning of the term `offense' in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.\" <i>Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 173, 121 S.Ct. 1335. If the Court intended to incorporate only the <i>Blockburger</i> test into its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, then its statement in <i>Cobb</i> would make no sense, as there would be a difference in the meaning of the term \"offense\" in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is bolstered by a footnote in <i>Cobb,</i> in which the Court stated that \"we could just as easily describe the Sixth Amendment as `prosecution specific,' insofar as it prevents discussion of charged offenses as well as offenses that, under <i>Blockburger,</i> could not be the subject of a later prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 173 n. 3, 121 S.Ct. 1335. While the Court referenced only <i>Blockburger,</i> the statement indicates that the Court was referring to <i>Blockburger</i> in the context of its general double jeopardy jurisprudence. In other words, we understand the Court to have meant that if the government could not prosecute a defendant for an offense due to double jeopardy principles, then it could not question the defendant about that offense without implicating his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, even if the defendant had not yet been charged with the offense. In this case, double jeopardy principles would not have prevented the federal government from prosecuting Coker because of the dual sovereignty doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Therefore, because Coker was properly subject to a later federal prosecution, it follows from the Court's statement that the Sixth Amendment did not prevent discussion of the uncharged federal offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker argues that applying the dual sovereignty doctrine to cases such as his will permit law enforcement to perform an end run around a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As the government notes, a similar argument was raised in <i>Cobb</i> and rejected by a majority of the Supreme Court. The defendant in <i>Cobb</i> had argued that applying the offense-specific rule in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context \"will prove disastrous to suspects' constitutional rights and will permit law enforcement officers almost complete and total license to conduct unwanted and uncounseled interrogations.\" <i>Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 171, 121 S.Ct. 1335 (internal quotation marks omitted). In rejecting this argument, the Court emphasized that it failed adequately to appreciate two considerations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there can be no doubt that a suspect must be apprised of his rights against compulsory self-incrimination and to consult with an attorney before authorities may conduct custodial interrogation . . . Second, it is critical to recognize that the Constitution does not negate society's interest in the ability of police to talk to witnesses and suspects, even those who have been charged with other offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 171-72, 121 S.Ct. 1335. These considerations apply with equal force to the instant case, especially given the fact that Coker was given and waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>See id.</i> at 172 n. 2, 121 S.Ct. 1335 (\"Even though the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has not attached to uncharged offenses, defendants retain the ability under <i>Miranda</i> to refuse any police questioning. . . .\"). Further, any concerns we may have about potential \"end runs\" around the Sixth Amendment's protections are mitigated by an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine first recognized by this court in <i>United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> 85 F.3d 823 (1st Cir.1996). In <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> we interpreted certain language of the Supreme Court in <i>Bartkus v. Illinois,</i> 359 U.S. 121, 79 S.Ct. 676, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959), to mean that an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine (the \"<i>Bartkus</i> exception\") exists where \"one sovereign so thoroughly dominates or manipulates the prosecutorial machinery of another that the latter retains little or no volition in its own proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 827. This exception applies with equal force in the Sixth Amendment context. Thus, if it appears that one sovereign is controlling the prosecution of another merely to circumvent the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, under the <i>Bartkus</i> exception the dual sovereignty doctrine will not apply. We believe that this exception will help prevent law enforcement officials from making an end run around the right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker next argues that, in the event we find that the dual sovereignty doctrine applies in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context, we should apply the <i>Bartkus</i> exception to his case because the federal and state investigations were inextricably intertwined and because the federal agents were aware of the state charges and that Coker had a lawyer for those charges when they interviewed him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> we stated that a defendant arguing for the exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine \"must proffer evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case that the two prosecutions were for the same offense.\" <i>Id.</i> In other words, Coker \"must produce some evidence tending to prove that . . . one sovereign was a pawn of the other, with the result that the notion of two supposedly independent prosecutions is merely a sham.\" <i>Id.</i> Coker has failed to carry this entry-level burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he state authorities began an investigation and interviewed witnesses on the day of the incident. Within a day or two, they notified the BATF of the possibility of a federal crime, and for a time the two sovereigns continued the investigation in parallel. Shortly after the BATF became involved, however, the state effectively ended its investigation. The federal investigation continued, Coker was indicted by a federal grand jury, and the state charges against him were dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Coker,</i> 298 F.Supp.2d at 192. We find no clear error in these factual determinations made by the district court, nor do we believe that Coker has pointed to any evidence tending to show that one of the prosecutions was a sham. Rather, the \"facts show nothing more than the rendering of routine intergovernmental assistance. Cooperative law enforcement efforts between independent sovereigns are commendable, and, without more, such efforts will not furnish a legally adequate basis for invoking the. . . exception to the dual sovereign rule.\" <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> 85 F.3d at 828.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker relies heavily on the Eighth Circuit's decision in <i>United States v. Red Bird,</i> 287 F.3d 709 (8th Cir.2002). In <i>Red Bird,</i> the defendant was alleged to have committed a rape on a Native American reservation. <i>Id.</i> at 711. He was arraigned in a tribal court and had an attorney appointed to assist in his representation. <i>Id.</i> The FBI was informed of the charge, and a tribal investigator assisted an FBI agent in locating and interviewing the defendant without counsel's presence. <i>Id.</i> The defendant was later prosecuted on federal rape charges. <i>Id.</i> at 712. The Eighth Circuit rejected the government's dual sovereignty argument and found that evidence obtained from the interview was inadmissible. <i>Id.</i> at 714-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basis for the court's decision in <i>Red Bird</i> is not entirely clear. On the one hand, the court looked to <i>Cobb</i> and, using the <i>Blockburger</i> test, determined that the tribal and federal offenses were the same for Sixth Amendment purposes because they contained the same essential elements. <i>Id.</i> at 715. In so doing, the court rejected the government's argument that the dual sovereignty doctrine applied in the Sixth Amendment context. On the other hand, the court repeatedly emphasized the interconnectedness of the tribal and federal investigations as a reason for finding that the dual sovereignty doctrine did not apply. For example, the court noted that tribal governments and federal authorities commonly worked together in investigating and prosecuting crimes committed on reservations and that \"tribal sovereignty is unique and limited.\" <i>Id.</i> at 713, 715 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker argues that <i>Red Bird</i> represents an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine. While we think that <i>Red Bird</i> is not as clear as Coker believes, to the extent that <i>Red Bird</i> represents such an exception, Coker's case is distinguishable. As the government points out, the relationship between the state and federal investigations in Coker's case is different from the relationship between the tribal and federal investigations in <i>Red Bird.</i> In <i>Red Bird,</i> there was evidence that tribal and federal authorities commonly cooperated in investigations. In Coker's case, although there was a certain amount of routine intergovernmental assistance, there was no evidence that the two sovereigns consistently worked together in investigations. Further, there was no evidence here to suggest that one of the prosecutions was a sham or that one of the sovereigns was the pawn of the other, while in <i>Red Bird,</i> the limited and unique nature of tribal sovereignty caused the court's concern. We therefore find that the exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine does not apply to Coker's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we hold that, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Cobb,</i> the dual sovereignty doctrine applies in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context. The state and federal offenses in Coker's case were thus different offenses for Sixth Amendment purposes and Coker's right to counsel had not attached to the uncharged federal offense when he was interviewed by the federal agents. The district court did not err in denying Coker's motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Harmless Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to find that the district court erred in denying Coker's motion to suppress, any error would be harmless at best. Since the issue in this case is constitutional in nature, the government would have the burden of proving harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See United States v. Ventura-Cruel,</i> 356 F.3d 55, 64 n. 12 (1st Cir.2003). In other words, the government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Coker would have been convicted even if his confession had not been admitted into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker correctly notes that we have stated that \"[c]onfessions are by nature highly probative and likely to be at the center of the jury's attention.\" <i>Id.</i> at 64 (quoting <i>United States v. Le&#243;n-Delfis,</i> 203 F.3d 103, 112 (1st Cir.2000)). However, having reviewed the record, we are convinced that, even in the absence of the confession, the evidence against Coker was so overwhelming that he would have been convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presented the testimony of two residents of the apartment building who witnessed Coker yelling outside of the building and entering and exiting the building just before the fire started. The first witness, April Loftman, lived on the second floor of the apartment building. On the night in question, Loftman was awake feeding her baby when she heard someone screaming outside of her window. Loftman looked out of her front window and saw a man on the sidewalk in front of the building, pacing back and forth, yelling and pointing at Edith Drame's window, which was on the third floor of the building just above Loftman's apartment. The man was standing just beneath her window, and Loftman testified that the area was well-lit. Loftman heard the man say that \"you played the wrong person\" and that he was going to \"blaze this mother fucker up.\" Loftman also noticed a Nissan 280Z with a T-roof parked in the street facing the wrong direction. She saw a straw hat on the front passenger seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loftman saw the man enter the building. She went to her front door and looked through her peephole to see where the man was going. She saw the man walk past her door and heard him walk up the stairs to the third floor. She heard the man bang on a door on the third floor and then heard him walk back down the stairs. When Loftman heard the door to the building open and shut, she returned to her window. She observed the same man standing outside and screaming. The man eventually went to his car, the Nissan with a T-roof, at which time another man driving a Volkswagen pulled up to the building. Loftman recognized the driver as a man who frequented the third floor to engage in drug activity. This second man entered the building, and the first man followed shortly thereafter. Loftman heard the second man go to the third floor and then she heard a door slam shut. Loftman then heard the first man come up the stairs and jiggle the door handle to her apartment, apparently searching for the second man. Loftman panicked and called the Lynn Police Department, who told her to call back if anything else happened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loftman heard the upstairs door shut and heard footsteps on the stairs. She went back to the window and saw both men outside of the building. It appeared to Loftman that the men had a brief conversation before the man in the Volkswagen got into his car and drove off. Loftman then saw the first man re-enter the building and heard him go upstairs and knock on Edith Drame's door. When he got no answer, the man left the building. Loftman testified that the man again said that he was going to blaze the building before getting into his car and leaving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About ten minutes later, Loftman heard a car door slam in front of the building. She looked out her window and saw the same Nissan 280Z and the same man. The man got out, opened his trunk and entered the building.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Loftman listened carefully but heard no footsteps. Shortly thereafter, she heard the front door shut again and saw the man go directly to his car and leave. Loftman then went back to her peephole but could see only darkness. She opened her door and saw that the hallway was full of smoke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second witness, Bill Terrell, also lived on the second floor. He testified that on the night in question he was awakened by the sounds of a man yelling in the street. He looked out his window and saw a man standing outside yelling at the building. This man was the only person that Terrell saw outside. Terrell testified that he heard the man state that \"you beat the wrong person. I'm going to come back and I'm going to blaze this whole spot up.\" The man eventually ran into the building. Terrell went to his front door and heard the man running up the stairs yelling \"I'm going to fucking kill you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the man exited the building, Terrell heard a smash. He stuck his body halfway out of his window and saw the man holding a metal bat. Terrell saw the man go to his car, which he described as a sports car with a T-roof, throw the bat inside, and drive off. After five to eight minutes, Terrell heard a car door slam. He looked out the window and saw the same car parked outside. Terrell did not see anyone around the car but heard the sounds of someone in the hallway. He called Loftman, who told him that she thought she smelled smoke. Terrell then opened his door and saw a big cloud of smoke in the hallway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted earlier, Coker was found driving a Nissan sports car with a T-roof. A straw hat and metal bat with glass embedded in it was found in his car, as were a pair of rubber gloves and a butane lighter. In addition, both Loftman and Terrell identified Coker that evening as the man they had seen outside of their building. At trial, Loftman again identified Coker as the man she had seen outside of her window. Terrell was unable to make an in-court identification because he could no longer remember what the man looked like. However, he testified that he was certain that the man he had identified the morning of the fire was the man he had seen in front of his building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the government had the testimony of two witnesses who saw Coker outside of the building yelling and making threats, including that he was going to kill someone and that he was going to \"blaze\" this building. They saw Coker enter the building and exit just before they noticed smoke. They also identified Coker's car, as well as objects in the car. Based on this testimony and the corroborating physical evidence, we are convinced that a jury would have convicted Coker even without evidence of the confession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Therefore, any possible error from admitting the confession was harmless at best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, Coker's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to<i>Wikipedia,</i> a free-content online encyclopedia, T-roofs \"open a vehicle roof to the side windows, providing a wider opening than other sunroofs.

Coker argues that, if the confession had been suppressed, he would have impeached the identification testimony with evidence that (1) Loftman and Terrell were driven together to the scene of the show-up identification, (2) Loftman and Terrell spoke about the case as they were being driven, and (3) Terrell identified Coker only after Loftman identified Coker. Having considered the witnesses' testimony and the \"impeachment evidence\" that Coker mentions, we believe that a jury would have reached the same result even if Coker's counsel had attempted to impeach the identification testimony. Coker also argues that without the confession, he could have attempted to focus the jury on the man in the Volkswagen as a possible suspect. However, Loftman testified that the man in the Volkswagen left the scene well before the fire began and did not return. Also, the testimony of both Loftman and Terrell showed that Coker was the only person who entered and exited the building just before the fire. We do not believe that a jury would have been convinced by Coker's argument, given the testimony of the two witnesses and the corroborating physical evidence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CYR, Senior Circuit Judge (Concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The admission into evidence of the Coker confession violated the Sixth Amendment right to have counsel present during the post-indictment interview. I would affirm on the ground that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I write separately, since I am unable to agree with the panel decision that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred, and I am concerned that its alternate holding may invite serious precedential consequences. <i>See California v. United States,</i> 438 U.S. 645, 689 n. 10, 98 S.Ct. 2985, 57 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1978) (stating that court's alternate holdings are not <i>obiter dicta,</i> but have full precedential effect); <i>Natural Res.

For instance, the separate sovereign doctrine neither applies to the Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable searches and seizures, <i>see Elkins v. United States,</i> 364 U.S. 206, 208, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960) (\"[A]rticles obtained as a result of an unreasonable search and seizure by state officers, without involvement of federal officers,\" cannot \"be introduced in evidence against a defendant over his timely objection in a federal criminal trial\"), nor to the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, <i>see Murphy v.

Indeed, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has been long recognized as among the constitutional protections most critical to ensuring the conduct of fair criminal trials. <i>See Massiah v. United States,</i> 377 U.S. 201, 205, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964); <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> 372 U.S. 335, 343-44, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); <i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> 304 U.S. 458, 462-63, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). In <i>Cobb,</i> the federal government was <i>not</i> involved. Rather, the State indicted Cobb for burglary, later interrogated him, without the aid of counsel, concerning a murder committed during that burglary, and used his incriminating statements during that post-indictment interview to indict him for that murder. On appeal, the question was whether the burglary and murder were the same \"offense.\" Although some courts had devised a test which considered two crimes the same if they were factually related (<i>e.g.,</i> committed on the same day), the Court imported the <i>Blockburger</i> test from the double jeopardy definition of \"offense,\" and held that two offenses are not the same for Sixth Amendment purposes if each requires proof of a fact that the other does not. <i>Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 173, 121 S.Ct. 1335. It was in this straitened context that the Court stated that \"[w]e see no constitutional difference between the meaning of the term `offense' in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is no question but that Coker was questioned after his indictment regarding the \"same offense,\" and under <i>Cobb</i> and the <i>Blockburger</i> test, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached. In order to find otherwise, one must assume that the Court held that, the particular facts of the case before it notwithstanding, it meant to decide that henceforth there would be no conceivable differences between the term \"offense\" in the double jeopardy and Sixth Amendment contexts. The Court in <i>Cobb</i> did not even consider the policy issues raised in <i>Elkins</i> and <i>Murphy,</i> for a simple reason: the case before it did not involve separate sovereigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">`If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality... unless such adjudication is unavoidable.' . . . It has long been the Court's `considered practice not to decide abstract, hypothetical or contingent questions ... or to decide any constitutional question in advance of the necessity for its decision . . . or to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied . . . or to decide any constitutional question except with reference to the particular facts to which it is to be applied.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Clinton v. Jones,</i> 520 U.S. 681, 690 n. 11, 117 S.Ct. 1636, 137 L.Ed.2d 945 (1997) (citations omitted). Especially in light of <i>Elkins</i> and <i>Murphy,</i> and their focus upon the important policy of preventing collusive end-runs around constitutional safeguards, there remains considerable doubt whether the Court, if and when confronted with a separate sovereign case, would hold that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel should be treated less cordially than the Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, absent some compelling reason for doing so. <i>See United States v. Mills,</i> 412 F.3d 325, 329-30 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that <i>Cobb</i> did not intend to import separate sovereign doctrine into Sixth Amendment context); <i>cf. United States v. Red Bird,</i> 287 F.3d 709, 715 (8th Cir.2002) (refusing to apply separate sovereign doctrine to Sixth Amendment right to counsel in joint federal-tribal crime investigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These policy concerns cannot be fully assuaged simply by resort to the <i>Bartkus</i> exception to the separate sovereign doctrine in the double jeopardy context, since it is \"limited to situations in which one sovereign so thoroughly dominates or manipulates the prosecutorial machinery of another that the latter retains little or no volition in the proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> 85 F.3d 823, 827 (1st Cir.1996). Obviously, this leaves out much of the mutual collusion of independent sovereigns which is the subject of <i>Elkins</i> and <i>Murphy,</i> and creates a portentous risk of abuse in this age of increasing federal-state cooperation. <i>See United States v. Mart&#237;nez,</i> 972 F.2d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.1992). I see no principled reason that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel ought to be subject to the separate sovereign doctrine when the Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment self-incrimination rights are not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can I agree with my colleague's co-concurrence, which finds this overly broad interpretation of <i>Cobb</i> consonant with the Court's decisions not unnecessarily to thwart police investigations of crime, for the argument improperly demotes Sixth Amendment protection from substance to mere form, and overlooks the countervailing policy interests discussed in <i>Elkins</i> and <i>Murphy.</i> The Sixth Amendment right to counsel already has built-in safeguards: the right can be invoked only for the offense for which defendant is under indictment, not for \"new or additional crimes,\" <i>Maine v. Moulton,</i> 474 U.S. 159, 179, 106 S.Ct. 477, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), and \"cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions,\" <i>McNeil v. Wisconsin,</i> 501 U.S. 171, 175, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991). The rationale advocated by the co-concurrence would render Sixth Amendment protections essentially meaningless, subject to the most blatant and irremediable manipulation. <i>See Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 168, 121 S.Ct. 1335 (<i>Breyer,</i> J., dissenting) (\"The Constitution does not take away with one hand what it gives with the other.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, I do not join in the alternative holding that the police interview with Coker did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. At the very least, prudence counsels that we refrain from deciding this difficult and important constitutional issue. <i>See Bellville v. Town of Northboro,</i> 375 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.2004) (\"Normally, we endeavor to avoid deciding constitutional issues and attempt to decide cases on the narrowest grounds possible.\"). However, I do agree with my colleagues in their alternative holding: that any Sixth Amendment violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Although I recognize that a confession normally carries great evidentiary heft, <i>see United States v. Carpenter,</i> 403 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 2284, 161 L.Ed.2d 1076 (2005), the other circumstances of this case persuade me that the error was harmless, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Downs-Moses,</i> 329 F.3d 253, 267-68 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied sub nom. Ward-O'Neill v.

Be that as it may, clarity has never been the paramount benchmark of constitutional interpretation, which often requires difficult judgment calls by law enforcement officials in the field.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HOWARD, Circuit Judge (Concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with Judge Torruella that the government did not violate defendant Edward Coker's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and that <i>Texas v. Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. 162, 121 S.Ct. 1335, 149 L.Ed.2d 321 (2001), is instructive as to why. Coker argues that the interests protected by the prohibition against government contact with an accused after the right to counsel has attached would be undermined if federal authorities, investigating whether an incident that already has given rise to state charges also should be charged as a parallel federal offense, were permitted to question the accused without first approaching his lawyer in the state proceeding. The argument is a classic one for substance over form: the substance of the right to counsel would be unduly compromised if, under these circumstances, the court were to accord dispositive significance to the fact that the federal crime being investigated, while containing the same elements as the charged state crime, is formally distinct because it is a crime against a separate sovereign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with Coker's argument is that, sometimes, a formalist approach itself serves substantive interests. In this case, the formalist approach urged by the government will serve an interest in permitting investigating authorities to talk with witnesses and suspects who have been charged with formally distinct offenses &#8212; even those arising from the same incident under investigation. And it will do so by means of a bright-line rule that eliminates the need for judgment calls about where constitutional boundaries might lie. As Judge Torruella explains, a majority of the Supreme Court &#8212; albeit a slim one &#8212; has in no less compelling circumstances favored the investigative interest over the admittedly substantial interests invoked by Coker. <i>See Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 171-72, 121 S.Ct. 1335. Having constructed and justified the formalist approach, the Court should be the source of any change in legal direction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> I acknowledge the merit of our concurring colleague's well articulated prudential concerns, but I cannot join his analysis of whether there has been a Sixth Amendment violation, because the analysis is in my view<i>argumentum ad consequentiam.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Police officers and firefighters arriving at the scene found that a glass panel on the front door of the apartment building had been shattered. After firefighters extinguished the fire, the officers determined that three small fires had been set inside the building. They also found what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail in the hallway of the third floor of the building. The officers interviewed residents of the building, two of whom stated that they had seen a black male, who had been driving a Nissan sports car with a T-roof,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> standing on the sidewalk outside the building yelling up at an apartment on the third floor. This man entered and exited the building just before the residents noticed the smell of smoke. One of the witnesses saw a straw hat in the man's car, while the other observed the man carrying a baseball bat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these statements, police issued a \"be-on-the-lookout\" (\"BOLO\") call for a man fitting the witnesses' description. Shortly thereafter, two officers responding to an unrelated noise disturbance complaint a short distance from High Rock Street saw Coker sitting in a Nissan sports car that matched the description in the BOLO. The officers approached the car and saw a straw hat and silver baseball bat in the front seat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The officers later found a pair of rubber gloves and a butane lighter in the center console.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers detained Coker and arranged for a \"show-up\" identification, meaning that they arranged for the two witnesses to be brought to Coker's location and tell the police whether he was the man they had seen. Both witnesses identified Coker as the man they had seen yelling and entering the building just before the fire started. Coker was then placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker was booked at the Lynn Police Department and charged with burning or aiding in the burning of a dwelling house, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 1, and malicious or wanton injuries to personal property, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 127. On July 31, 2002, Coker was arraigned in state district court, had an attorney appointed, and was released on personal recognizance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between July 28 and July 31, the Lynn Fire Department notified the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"BATF\") of the incident because it had found what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail in the apartment building.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> BATF Agent Konstantinos Balos (\"Agent Balos\") began an investigation to determine if the incident involved a federal crime. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844. Agent Balos interviewed a number of witnesses to the alleged arson. Several Lynn police officers were present at these interviews. On August 8, 2002, Agent Balos and another BATF agent went to Coker's house and asked him to consent to an interview. At this time, Agent Balos knew that Coker was represented by counsel in the state case. Coker agreed to the interview and, driving his own car, followed the agents to the Lynn Fire Department, where the BATF maintains a satellite office. The agents brought Coker into a room, gave him a seat nearest an unlocked door, told him that he was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time, but nevertheless read Coker his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and gave him a copy of those rights. During the interview, which lasted around ninety minutes, Coker confessed to setting fire to the High Rock Street apartment building.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Towards the end of the interview, Coker became emotional, stating that he regretted setting the fire and felt like killing himself.

Coker filed a motion to suppress the confession, arguing that the federal agents had violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The district court denied the motion to suppress. On May 9, 2004, following a three-day jury trial, Coker was convicted. He was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></span> (1932): \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\" <i>Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 173, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court thus found that the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached to the murder charge. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the state and federal arson charges contained the same essential elements. Thus, one might conclude that, under <i>Cobb</i> and <i>Blockburger,</i> Coker's federal and state offenses were the same for Sixth Amendment right to counsel purposes. However, of significant importance to the present case is the fact that the Court in <i>Cobb</i> stated that \"[w]e see no constitutional difference between the meaning of the term `offense' in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.\" <i>Id.</i> In its double jeopardy jurisprudence, the Court has held that a defendant's conduct in violation of two separate sovereigns (\"the dual sovereignty doctrine\") constitutes two distinct offenses. <i>See, e.g., Heath v. Alabama,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111541\"><a href=\"/opinion/111541/heath-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 87-93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111541\"><a href=\"/opinion/111541/heath-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span> (1985). Thus, under the dual sovereignty doctrine, Coker's federal offense would be considered separate from his state offense for double jeopardy purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question thus becomes whether the Court in <i>Cobb</i> incorporated all of its double jeopardy jurisprudence (including the dual sovereignty doctrine) or merely the <i>Blockburger</i> test into its Sixth Amendment right to counsel jurisprudence. The Second Circuit has held that the Court incorporated only the <i>Blockburger</i> test into its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and that the dual sovereignty doctrine does not apply in the Sixth Amendment context. <i>See United States v. Mills,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790691\"><a href=\"/opinion/790691/united-states-v-gary-mills/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span> (2d Cir.2005). In <i>Mills,</i> an information issued charging the defendant with multiple state firearms violations. <i>Id.</i> at 327. After the information had issued, local police officers interviewed the defendant without counsel present. <i>Id.</i> The parties did not dispute that this interview violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel as to any subsequent state prosecution. <i>Id.</i> at 328. However, the federal government attempted to use Mills's statements to the local police in a subsequent federal prosecution for an offense with same elements as the state offense. <i>Id.</i> The Second Circuit held that, because the two offenses were the same under the <i>Blockburger</i> test, Mills's statements were inadmissible in the federal prosecution. <i>Id.</i> at 330. The court rejected the government's argument that, under <i>Cobb,</i> the doctrine of dual sovereignty applied in the Sixth Amendment context. <i>Id.</i> (\"The fact that <i>Cobb</i> appropriates the <i>Blockburger</i> test, applied initially in the double jeopardy context, does not demonstrate that <i>Cobb</i> incorporates the dual sovereignty doctrine.\"). Coker argues that we should follow the Second Circuit's rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit, along with the district court in the instant case, has taken the position that the dual sovereignty doctrine should be applied in the Sixth Amendment context. <i>See United States v. Avants,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"26090\"><a href=\"/opinion/26090/united-states-v-avants/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span> (5th Cir.2002). In <i>Avants,</i> the defendant was indicted in 1967 on Mississippi state murder charges related to the killing of African-American sharecropper named Ben White. <i>Id.</i> at 513. He was provided with counsel and released on bond. <i>Id.</i> While out on bond, the defendant was interviewed without counsel by FBI agents who were investigating a separate murder. <i>Id.</i> During the interview, the defendant confessed to killing White. <i>Id.</i> The FBI agents did not follow up on the confession because they were not investigating White's murder. <i>Id.</i> at 513-14. The defendant was later acquitted of the state murder charges. <i>Id.</i> at 514. In June 2000, the defendant was indicted for the murder by a federal grand jury and moved to suppress the confession he had made to the FBI agents. <i>Id.</i> The Fifth Circuit held that \"the Supreme Court [in <i>Cobb</i>] has incorporated double jeopardy analysis, including the dual sovereignty doctrine, into its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 517. It therefore found that the defendant's uncounseled confession to federal agents was admissible in the federal trial. <i>Id.</i> at 522. The government argues that we should follow the Fifth Circuit's rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After carefully examining <i>Cobb,</i> we conclude that the dual sovereignty doctrine applies for the purposes of defining what constitutes the same offense in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context. In doing so, we reject the reasoning of the Second Circuit in <i>Mills</i> and adopt the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in <i>Avants.</i> The court in <i>Mills</i> stated that \"[n]owhere in <i>Cobb,</i> either explicitly or by imputation, is there support for a dual sovereignty exception\" in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context. <i>Mills,</i> 412 F.3d at 330. This statement, in our view, does not give adequate consideration to the Court's statement that it saw \"no constitutional difference between the meaning of the term `offense' in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.\" <i>Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 173, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>. If the Court intended to incorporate only the <i>Blockburger</i> test into its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, then its statement in <i>Cobb</i> would make no sense, as there would be a difference in the meaning of the term \"offense\" in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is bolstered by a footnote in <i>Cobb,</i> in which the Court stated that \"we could just as easily describe the Sixth Amendment as `prosecution specific,' insofar as it prevents discussion of charged offenses as well as offenses that, under <i>Blockburger,</i> could not be the subject of a later prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 173 n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>. While the Court referenced only <i>Blockburger,</i> the statement indicates that the Court was referring to <i>Blockburger</i> in the context of its general double jeopardy jurisprudence. In other words, we understand the Court to have meant that if the government could not prosecute a defendant for an offense due to double jeopardy principles, then it could not question the defendant about that offense without implicating his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, even if the defendant had not yet been charged with the offense. In this case, double jeopardy principles would not have prevented the federal government from prosecuting Coker because of the dual sovereignty doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Therefore, because Coker was properly subject to a later federal prosecution, it follows from the Court's statement that the Sixth Amendment did not prevent discussion of the uncharged federal offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker argues that applying the dual sovereignty doctrine to cases such as his will permit law enforcement to perform an end run around a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As the government notes, a similar argument was raised in <i>Cobb</i> and rejected by a majority of the Supreme Court. The defendant in <i>Cobb</i> had argued that applying the offense-specific rule in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context \"will prove disastrous to suspects' constitutional rights and will permit law enforcement officers almost complete and total license to conduct unwanted and uncounseled interrogations.\" <i>Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 171, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span> (internal quotation marks omitted). In rejecting this argument, the Court emphasized that it failed adequately to appreciate two considerations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there can be no doubt that a suspect must be apprised of his rights against compulsory self-incrimination and to consult with an attorney before authorities may conduct custodial interrogation . . . Second, it is critical to recognize that the Constitution does not negate society's interest in the ability of police to talk to witnesses and suspects, even those who have been charged with other offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 171-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>. These considerations apply with equal force to the instant case, especially given the fact that Coker was given and waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>See id.</i> at 172 n. 2, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span> (\"Even though the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has not attached to uncharged offenses, defendants retain the ability under <i>Miranda</i> to refuse any police questioning. . . .\"). Further, any concerns we may have about potential \"end runs\" around the Sixth Amendment's protections are mitigated by an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine first recognized by this court in <i>United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196808\"><a href=\"/opinion/196808/united-states-v-guzman-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996). In <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> we interpreted certain language of the Supreme Court in <i>Bartkus v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105857\"><a href=\"/opinion/105857/bartkus-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105857\"><a href=\"/opinion/105857/bartkus-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span> (1959), to mean that an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine (the \"<i>Bartkus</i> exception\") exists where \"one sovereign so thoroughly dominates or manipulates the prosecutorial machinery of another that the latter retains little or no volition in its own proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 827. This exception applies with equal force in the Sixth Amendment context. Thus, if it appears that one sovereign is controlling the prosecution of another merely to circumvent the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, under the <i>Bartkus</i> exception the dual sovereignty doctrine will not apply. We believe that this exception will help prevent law enforcement officials from making an end run around the right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker next argues that, in the event we find that the dual sovereignty doctrine applies in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context, we should apply the <i>Bartkus</i> exception to his case because the federal and state investigations were inextricably intertwined and because the federal agents were aware of the state charges and that Coker had a lawyer for those charges when they interviewed him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> we stated that a defendant arguing for the exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine \"must proffer evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case that the two prosecutions were for the same offense.\" <i>Id.</i> In other words, Coker \"must produce some evidence tending to prove that . . . one sovereign was a pawn of the other, with the result that the notion of two supposedly independent prosecutions is merely a sham.\" <i>Id.</i> Coker has failed to carry this entry-level burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he state authorities began an investigation and interviewed witnesses on the day of the incident. Within a day or two, they notified the BATF of the possibility of a federal crime, and for a time the two sovereigns continued the investigation in parallel. Shortly after the BATF became involved, however, the state effectively ended its investigation. The federal investigation continued, Coker was indicted by a federal grand jury, and the state charges against him were dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Coker,</i> 298 F.Supp.2d at 192. We find no clear error in these factual determinations made by the district court, nor do we believe that Coker has pointed to any evidence tending to show that one of the prosecutions was a sham. Rather, the \"facts show nothing more than the rendering of routine intergovernmental assistance. Cooperative law enforcement efforts between independent sovereigns are commendable, and, without more, such efforts will not furnish a legally adequate basis for invoking the. . . exception to the dual sovereign rule.\" <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> 85 F.3d at 828.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker relies heavily on the Eighth Circuit's decision in <i>United States v. Red Bird,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777367\"><a href=\"/opinion/777367/united-states-v-andrew-red-bird/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2002). In <i>Red Bird,</i> the defendant was alleged to have committed a rape on a Native American reservation. <i>Id.</i> at 711. He was arraigned in a tribal court and had an attorney appointed to assist in his representation. <i>Id.</i> The FBI was informed of the charge, and a tribal investigator assisted an FBI agent in locating and interviewing the defendant without counsel's presence. <i>Id.</i> The defendant was later prosecuted on federal rape charges. <i>Id.</i> at 712. The Eighth Circuit rejected the government's dual sovereignty argument and found that evidence obtained from the interview was inadmissible. <i>Id.</i> at 714-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basis for the court's decision in <i>Red Bird</i> is not entirely clear. On the one hand, the court looked to <i>Cobb</i> and, using the <i>Blockburger</i> test, determined that the tribal and federal offenses were the same for Sixth Amendment purposes because they contained the same essential elements. <i>Id.</i> at 715. In so doing, the court rejected the government's argument that the dual sovereignty doctrine applied in the Sixth Amendment context. On the other hand, the court repeatedly emphasized the interconnectedness of the tribal and federal investigations as a reason for finding that the dual sovereignty doctrine did not apply. For example, the court noted that tribal governments and federal authorities commonly worked together in investigating and prosecuting crimes committed on reservations and that \"tribal sovereignty is unique and limited.\" <i>Id.</i> at 713, 715 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker argues that <i>Red Bird</i> represents an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine. While we think that <i>Red Bird</i> is not as clear as Coker believes, to the extent that <i>Red Bird</i> represents such an exception, Coker's case is distinguishable. As the government points out, the relationship between the state and federal investigations in Coker's case is different from the relationship between the tribal and federal investigations in <i>Red Bird.</i> In <i>Red Bird,</i> there was evidence that tribal and federal authorities commonly cooperated in investigations. In Coker's case, although there was a certain amount of routine intergovernmental assistance, there was no evidence that the two sovereigns consistently worked together in investigations. Further, there was no evidence here to suggest that one of the prosecutions was a sham or that one of the sovereigns was the pawn of the other, while in <i>Red Bird,</i> the limited and unique nature of tribal sovereignty caused the court's concern. We therefore find that the exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine does not apply to Coker's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we hold that, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Cobb,</i> the dual sovereignty doctrine applies in the Sixth Amendment right to counsel context. The state and federal offenses in Coker's case were thus different offenses for Sixth Amendment purposes and Coker's right to counsel had not attached to the uncharged federal offense when he was interviewed by the federal agents. The district court did not err in denying Coker's motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Harmless Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to find that the district court erred in denying Coker's motion to suppress, any error would be harmless at best. Since the issue in this case is constitutional in nature, the government would have the burden of proving harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See United States v. Ventura-Cruel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200774\"><a href=\"/opinion/200774/united-states-v-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 64 n. 12 (1st Cir.2003). In other words, the government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Coker would have been convicted even if his confession had not been admitted into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coker correctly notes that we have stated that \"[c]onfessions are by nature highly probative and likely to be at the center of the jury's attention.\" <i>Id.</i> at 64 (quoting <i>United States v.

However, having reviewed the record, we are convinced that, even in the absence of the confession, the evidence against Coker was so overwhelming that he would have been convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presented the testimony of two residents of the apartment building who witnessed Coker yelling outside of the building and entering and exiting the building just before the fire started. The first witness, April Loftman, lived on the second floor of the apartment building. On the night in question, Loftman was awake feeding her baby when she heard someone screaming outside of her window. Loftman looked out of her front window and saw a man on the sidewalk in front of the building, pacing back and forth, yelling and pointing at Edith Drame's window, which was on the third floor of the building just above Loftman's apartment. The man was standing just beneath her window, and Loftman testified that the area was well-lit. Loftman heard the man say that \"you played the wrong person\" and that he was going to \"blaze this mother fucker up.\" Loftman also noticed a Nissan 280Z with a T-roof parked in the street facing the wrong direction. She saw a straw hat on the front passenger seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loftman saw the man enter the building. She went to her front door and looked through her peephole to see where the man was going. She saw the man walk past her door and heard him walk up the stairs to the third floor. She heard the man bang on a door on the third floor and then heard him walk back down the stairs. When Loftman heard the door to the building open and shut, she returned to her window. She observed the same man standing outside and screaming. The man eventually went to his car, the Nissan with a T-roof, at which time another man driving a Volkswagen pulled up to the building. Loftman recognized the driver as a man who frequented the third floor to engage in drug activity. This second man entered the building, and the first man followed shortly thereafter. Loftman heard the second man go to the third floor and then she heard a door slam shut. Loftman then heard the first man come up the stairs and jiggle the door handle to her apartment, apparently searching for the second man. Loftman panicked and called the Lynn Police Department, who told her to call back if anything else happened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loftman heard the upstairs door shut and heard footsteps on the stairs. She went back to the window and saw both men outside of the building. It appeared to Loftman that the men had a brief conversation before the man in the Volkswagen got into his car and drove off. Loftman then saw the first man re-enter the building and heard him go upstairs and knock on Edith Drame's door. When he got no answer, the man left the building. Loftman testified that the man again said that he was going to blaze the building before getting into his car and leaving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About ten minutes later, Loftman heard a car door slam in front of the building. She looked out her window and saw the same Nissan 280Z and the same man. The man got out, opened his trunk and entered the building.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Loftman listened carefully but heard no footsteps. Shortly thereafter, she heard the front door shut again and saw the man go directly to his car and leave. Loftman then went back to her peephole but could see only darkness. She opened her door and saw that the hallway was full of smoke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second witness, Bill Terrell, also lived on the second floor. He testified that on the night in question he was awakened by the sounds of a man yelling in the street. He looked out his window and saw a man standing outside yelling at the building. This man was the only person that Terrell saw outside. Terrell testified that he heard the man state that \"you beat the wrong person. I'm going to come back and I'm going to blaze this whole spot up.\" The man eventually ran into the building. Terrell went to his front door and heard the man running up the stairs yelling \"I'm going to fucking kill you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the man exited the building, Terrell heard a smash. He stuck his body halfway out of his window and saw the man holding a metal bat. Terrell saw the man go to his car, which he described as a sports car with a T-roof, throw the bat inside, and drive off. After five to eight minutes, Terrell heard a car door slam. He looked out the window and saw the same car parked outside. Terrell did not see anyone around the car but heard the sounds of someone in the hallway. He called Loftman, who told him that she thought she smelled smoke. Terrell then opened his door and saw a big cloud of smoke in the hallway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted earlier, Coker was found driving a Nissan sports car with a T-roof. A straw hat and metal bat with glass embedded in it was found in his car, as were a pair of rubber gloves and a butane lighter. In addition, both Loftman and Terrell identified Coker that evening as the man they had seen outside of their building. At trial, Loftman again identified Coker as the man she had seen outside of her window. Terrell was unable to make an in-court identification because he could no longer remember what the man looked like.

On appeal, the question was whether the burglary and murder were the same \"offense.\" Although some courts had devised a test which considered two crimes the same if they were factually related (<i>e.g.,</i> committed on the same day), the Court imported the <i>Blockburger</i> test from the double jeopardy definition of \"offense,\" and held that two offenses are not the same for Sixth Amendment purposes if each requires proof of a fact that the other does not. <i>Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 173, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Be that as it may, clarity has never been the paramount benchmark of constitutional interpretation, which often requires difficult judgment calls by law enforcement officials in the field.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HOWARD, Circuit Judge (Concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with Judge Torruella that the government did not violate defendant Edward Coker's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and that <i>Texas v. Cobb,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span> (2001), is instructive as to why. Coker argues that the interests protected by the prohibition against government contact with an accused after the right to counsel has attached would be undermined if federal authorities, investigating whether an incident that already has given rise to state charges also should be charged as a parallel federal offense, were permitted to question the accused without first approaching his lawyer in the state proceeding. The argument is a classic one for substance over form: the substance of the right to counsel would be unduly compromised if, under these circumstances, the court were to accord dispositive significance to the fact that the federal crime being investigated, while containing the same elements as the charged state crime, is formally distinct because it is a crime against a separate sovereign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with Coker's argument is that, sometimes, a formalist approach itself serves substantive interests. In this case, the formalist approach urged by the government will serve an interest in permitting investigating authorities to talk with witnesses and suspects who have been charged with formally distinct offenses &#8212; even those arising from the same incident under investigation. And it will do so by means of a bright-line rule that eliminates the need for judgment calls about where constitutional boundaries might lie. As Judge Torruella explains, a majority of the Supreme Court &#8212; albeit a slim one &#8212; has in no less compelling circumstances favored the investigative interest over the admittedly substantial interests invoked by Coker. <i>See Cobb,</i> 532 U.S. at 171-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118417\"><a href=\"/opinion/118417/texas-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>. Having constructed and justified the formalist approach, the Court should be the source of any change in legal direction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> I acknowledge the merit of our concurring colleague's well articulated prudential concerns, but I cannot join his analysis of whether there has been a Sixth Amendment violation, because the analysis is in my view<i>argumentum ad consequentiam.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
