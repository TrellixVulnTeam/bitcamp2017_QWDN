Martinez, 125 S. Ct. 716 (2005). On May 13,\n2005, petitioner was released from custody, prompting the respondents to\nmove to dismiss the habeas petition as moot. On July 18, 2005, without\nruling on the motion to dismiss, the district court transferred the case\nto this court, purportedly under the Real ID Act. Because we conclude\nthat the jurisdiction-stripping and transfer provisions of the Real ID\nAct do not apply to this petition, which challenges only the\npetitioner's detention rather than his removal (no administrative\nremoval order has issued), we direct the Clerk to transfer this case\nback to the district court.\n\n     The Real ID Act deprives the district courts of habeas jurisdiction\n\n\n1\n In 1980, approximately 120,000 Cubans left the Mariel harbor in Cuba\nand crossed to the United States by boat.\n\fto review orders of removal, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5), as added by §\n106(a)(1)(B) of the Real ID Act, Pub. L. 109-13, and further provides\nthat habeas cases \"challenging a final administrative order of removal\"\nbe transferred to the courts of appeals to be treated as petitions for\njudicial review,\"     Real ID Act, § 106(c).       As indicated in the\nlegislative history of the Act, those provisions were not intended to\n\"preclude habeas review over challenges to detention that are\nindependent of challenges to removal orders.\" H.R. Cong. Rep. No. 109-\n72, at 2873 (May 3, 2005). Courts that have considered this issue have\nreached the same conclusion. See Sissoko v. Rocha, 412 F.3d 1021, 1033\n(9th Cir. 2005); Ahmad v. Chertoff, 2005 WL 1799752, at *1-*2 (W.D. Wash.\nJuly 27, 2005); Kanteh v. Ridge, 2005 WL 1719217, at *1, *3 (D. Minn.\nJune 30, 2005), report and recommendation adopted, 2005 WL 1705526 (D.\nMinn.
