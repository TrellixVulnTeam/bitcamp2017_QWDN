J. DEROSA, WARDEN, FCI, FT. DIX,\n\n                           Respondent.\n\n\n            APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A SECOND OR\n         SUCCESSIVE MOTION PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Abelardo Cuevas pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Dina Michael\nChaitowitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney.\n\n\n\n                        October 22, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam.   Petitioner seeks leave to file a second or\n\nsuccessive habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255.   As the\n\nground for the present petition, petitioner relies on the recent\n\nUnited States Supreme Court decision in Blakely v. Washington, 124\n\nS. Ct. 2531 (2004).\n\n     Under the relevant gatekeeping provision, a new rule of law\n\ncan form the basis for a second or successive habeas petition only\n\nif that rule is \"made retroactive to cases on collateral review by\n\nthe Supreme Court.\"   28 U.S.C. ยง 2255, para. 8(2).   To date, the\n\nSupreme Court has not decided whether Blakely is even applicable to\n\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, see Blakely, 124 S. Ct. at 2538\n\nn.9 (\"The Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no\n\nopinion on them.\"), much less declared its ruling in Blakely to be\n\nretroactive to cases on collateral review.   Therefore, petitioner\n\nmay not rely on Blakely as a ground for filing a second or\n\nsuccessive petition to vacate his federal sentence.    See Simpson\n\nv. United States, 376 F.3d 679, 681-82 (7th Cir. 2004); In re Dean,\n\n375 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir. 2004); see generally Tyler v. Cain,\n\n533 U.S. 656, 663 (2001) (explaining that \"a new rule is not 'made\n\nretroactive to cases on collateral review' unless the Supreme Court\n\nholds it to be retroactive\").\n\n     Of course, if the Supreme Court in the future makes Blakely\n\nretroactive, the petitioner may at that time attempt to assert a\n\nclaim by means of a second or successive ยง 2255 petition.     See,\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fe.g., Sustache-Rivera v. United States, 221 F.3d 8, 16-17 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   Until that time, however, the instant application must be\n\nconsidered premature.   See id. at 15 n.12.\n\n     The application is denied without prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
