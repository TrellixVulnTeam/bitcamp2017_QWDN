William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Robert L. Sheketoff on brief for appellant.\n     Michael J.

This sentencing appeal raises three issues.\n\nEach of them may be summarily dispatched.\n\n            First, the appellant claims that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing at\n\nsentencing.       We do not agree:            evidentiary hearings at sentencing\n\nare the exception, not the rule.                    A party seeking such a hearing\n\n\"must carry a formidable burden of persuasion.\"                           United States v.\n\nMcAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 280 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            In this case, the appellant could have put forth a\n\ndifferent    version        of       the   disputed    point       (drug     quantity)      by\n\naffidavit.       He did not do so.            Given that omission, the court had\n\nconsiderable      latitude           to    decide   that     the    appellant        had   not\n\nsatisfied his entry-level burden of showing that material facts\n\nwere genuinely in dispute.                  \"A district court need not grant an\n\nevidentiary hearing . . . merely because a defendant's hopes spring\n\neternal     or    because        a    defendant      wishes    to        mount   a   fishing\n\nexpedition.\"          Id.\n\n            The        second    issue       relates    to    the     district       court's\n\nimposition       of     a   role-in-the-offense            enhancement.          See       USSG\n\n§3B1.1(a).            The   appellant        charges    that       the    district     court\n\nmisapplied the guideline.\n\n            As we predicted in United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70,\n\n75 (1st Cir. 1995), role-in-the-offense inquiries are necessarily\n\nfact-specific and battles over the propriety of enhancements \"will\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\falmost always be won or lost in the district court.\"   So here:   the\n\nrecord does not bear out the appellant's charge.\n\n          The sentencing transcript satisfies us that the court\n\nunderstood the nature and purpose of the enhancement, correctly\n\ndelineated its contours,1 and applied it appropriately to the facts\n\nas found. Since these findings of fact were not clearly erroneous,\n\nsee United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc),\n\nwe uphold the enhancement.\n\n          The third, and final, issue devolves from the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n\nIn Booker — a case decided after sentencing in this case had taken\n\nplace — the Court invalidated those provisions of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act that made the federal sentencing guidelines mandatory.\n\nId. at 764-65.   We have since held that the error described in\n\nBooker \"is that the defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed\n\nunder a mandatory system.\"     United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          We are dealing here with an unpreserved Booker error.\n\nNonetheless, we have held, in similar circumstances, that if a\n\ndefendant can show, \"either in the existing record or by plausible\n\n\n\n     1\n      In a fruitless attempt to show that the district court\napplied the wrong legal framework, the appellant cites our decision\nin United States v. Coviello, 225 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 2000). The\nCoviello decision deals with mitigating role adjustments under a\ndifferently worded guideline, id. at 67, and is, therefore,\ninapposite.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fproffer,\" some \"reasonable indication that the district judge might\n\nwell have reached a different [sentencing outcome] under advisory\n\nguidelines,\" he is entitled to resentencing.                United States v.\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).            One way to make this\n\nshowing (although certainly not the only way) is by reference to\n\nwhat the sentencing judge said at the disposition hearing. See id.\n\n          In this case, the sentencing judge's comments furnish a\n\nbasis for finding a reasonable probability that, if asked to\n\nsentence anew under a purely advisory regime, he would impose a\n\nmore lenient sentence.       The government, to its credit, concedes as\n\nmuch.   Consequently, resentencing is in order.\n\n           We   need   go    no   further.   We    vacate      the   appellant's\n\nsentence and    remand      for   resentencing    in   light    of   Booker and\n\nAntonakopoulos.    We intimate no view as to what sentence should be\n\nimposed on remand.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
