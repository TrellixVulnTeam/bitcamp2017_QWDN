Evans   Cabinet     Corporation\n\n(“Evans”) instituted this diversity action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts against Kitchen\n\nInternational, Inc. for breach of contract and quantum meruit.1\n\nKitchen International filed a motion to dismiss based on res\n\njudicata.   It claimed that the action was foreclosed because of an\n\nearlier judgment entered by the Superior Court of Québec.           After a\n\nhearing on the motion to dismiss, the district court determined\n\nthat the arguments went beyond the pleadings.              After allowing\n\nlimited discovery and converting the motion to one for summary\n\njudgment, the court entered judgment for Kitchen International.\n\nEvans filed a timely appeal to this court.2\n\n            For the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we\n\nreverse   the   judgment   of   the    district   court   and   remand   for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        The district court had diversity jurisdiction over this\ncontract dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Evans is a Georgia\ncorporation with its principal place of business in Dublin,\nGeorgia. Kitchen International is a Louisiana corporation with its\nprincipal place of business in Montreal, Québec.\n     2\n       This court has jurisdiction over the final decision of the\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                 I\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n           According to the allegations of the complaint, Kitchen\n\nInternational and Evans entered into a contract in 2004.3     Evans\n\nagreed to supply Kitchen International with manufactured cabinetry\n\nfor several residential construction sites on the East Coast of the\n\nUnited States.   Kitchen International placed these orders from its\n\nheadquarters in Montreal with the Georgia offices of Evans.    The\n\nmaterials were shipped directly to the construction sites.\n\n           According to Kitchen International, in 2004, the two\n\nparties also agreed that they would create a products showroom at\n\nKitchen International’s office in Montreal.   Kitchen International\n\nclaims that Paul Gatti of Evans approved the design and layout of\n\nthe showroom. According to Kitchen International, later that year,\n\nEvans manufactured and shipped cabinetry, related products and\n\nsales and promotional materials to Québec for use in the showroom.\n\nEvans denies the existence of such an agreement; it claims that it\n\nnever authorized Kitchen International to build a showroom and that\n\nit did not supply products to Kitchen International for that\n\npurpose.\n\n           Various issues arose about the quality and conformity of\n\nthe products that Evans had shipped to the East Coast projects.\n\n\n\n     3\n       The record does not include a copy of this contract or any\ninformation about the circumstances surrounding its formation.\n\n                                -3-\n\fConsequently, in May 2006, Kitchen International engaged a Canadian\n\nattorney to file suit against Evans in the Superior Court of Québec\n\nfor breach of contract arising from the materials supplied by\n\nEvans.   Evans was served with process and given notice of this\n\nproceeding.        Evans did not answer or otherwise respond to the\n\naction, and, consequently, on May 31, 2007, the Superior Court of\n\nQuébec entered a default judgment against Evans in the amount of\n\n$149,354.74.\n\n             On April 23, 2007, Evans instituted this action for\n\nbreach of contract and quantum meruit in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.               Kitchen International\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss on the ground that the action was barred\n\nby res judicata by virtue of the Canadian judgment against Evans.\n\nEvans opposed the motion on the ground that the Superior Court of\n\nQuébec had lacked jurisdiction over it, and, therefore, the Québec\n\njudgment could not be recognized by the district court.\n\n             During a hearing on Kitchen International’s motion to\n\ndismiss, the district court realized that the issues being argued\n\nwent beyond the pleadings.         It therefore stated that the motion\n\nshould be converted to one for summary judgment and allowed the\n\nparties ninety days to conduct limited discovery on the issue of\n\nthe Superior Court of Québec’s jurisdiction over Evans.             On March\n\n4,   2008,   the    district   court   resumed   the    hearing.   The   only\n\nadditional documents supplied by either party were affidavits from\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\ftheir       principals.      On   November    4,    2008,   the   district   court\n\nconverted Kitchen International’s motion to a motion for summary\n\njudgment and dismissed the case.             The court first determined that,\n\nbecause       it   was     sitting    in     diversity,      it    should    apply\n\nMassachusetts’s version of the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments\n\nRecognition Act (“Recognition Act”) to determine whether it should\n\nenforce the Québec judgment.4         In order to enforce a judgment under\n\nthe Recognition Act, the court continued, the Québec court must\n\nhave been able to exercise personal jurisdiction over Evans.\n\n               At the beginning of its analysis, the district court\n\nobserved that “jurisdictions have split over whether to apply the\n\npersonal jurisdiction law of the rendering country, the forum\n\nstate, or both.”          Evans Cabinet Corp. v. Kitchen Int’l, Inc., 584\n\nF. Supp. 2d 410, 414 (D. Mass. 2008).              Because the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt of Massachusetts had not chosen between these views, the\n\ndistrict court decided that it would scrutinize the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Québec court under both the law of Québec and the law of\n\nMassachusetts.       Turning first to the law of Québec, the district\n\ncourt noted that Kitchen International had attached the affidavit\n\nof its Canadian attorney to establish that Québec’s exercise of\n\njurisdiction was appropriate.          The district court determined that\n\nthe affidavit clearly established that Kitchen International had\n\n\n        4\n       Massachusetts’s version of the Recognition Act is codified\nat Massachusetts General Laws chapter 235, § 23A. The statute is\nreprinted in the attached appendix.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe right to institute a lawsuit in Québec.              However, it found the\n\naffidavit deficient on the issue of “whether the Quebec Superior\n\nCourt   properly     exercised    personal       jurisdiction       over   [Evans]\n\npursuant to article 3136 of the Civil Code of Quebec.”                Id. at 415.\n\nIt noted, however, that the United States District Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York had determined that the Québec court\n\ncould exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the\n\ncontract at issue had been “‘concluded in Quebec or if the cause of\n\naction arose in Quebec.’”        Id. (quoting Canadian Imperial Bank of\n\nCommerce v. Saxony Carpet Co., 899 F. Supp. 1248, 1253 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n1995) (emphasis in original)).                Based on that authority, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the Superior Court of Québec properly\n\nhad exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans pursuant to the law\n\nof Québec.\n\n            The    district     court     then       turned    to   the    law    of\n\nMassachusetts. The court first noted that Massachusetts courts had\n\ninterpreted the Commonwealth’s long-arm statute “as an assertion of\n\njurisdiction      over   the   person    to    the    limits    allowed    by    the\n\nConstitution of the United States.”            Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    The district court then held:\n\n                    The Quebec Superior Court’s exercise of\n            personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff did not\n            contravene traditional notions of fair play\n            and substantial justice.         Plaintiff had\n            several contacts with Quebec. All the orders,\n            communications, payments, correspondence and\n            dealings    between   [the]   Parties  occurred\n            through      Defendant’s    Montreal    office.\n\n                                        -6-\n\f          Moreover, Parties agreed to create a product\n          showroom at Defendant’s Montreal office, which\n          was ultimately constructed.    The purpose of\n          this showroom was to display Plaintiff’s\n          products to potential customers and sales\n          agents from Canada and New England. Because\n          under either Quebec or Massachusetts law the\n          Quebec Superior Court properly exercised\n          personal    jurisdiction    over    Plaintiff,\n          Plaintiff’s argument that the Quebec default\n          judgment is not conclusive fails.\n\nId. at 416 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          The court then turned to the question of whether Evans’s\n\nclaims were barred by the Québec judgment.       The district court\n\ndetermined that, although Massachusetts supplies the applicable res\n\njudicata law, “a Massachusetts court must give a prior judgment the\n\nsame finality it would receive in the rendering jurisdiction.” Id.\n\nat 417.   Consequently, the court employed Québec rules of res\n\njudicata to determine whether the default judgment should be given\n\npreclusive effect.   Id. (citing Québec civil code and a Supreme\n\nCourt of Canada decision).   The court then concluded that Evans’s\n\nsuit was barred by these rules:\n\n                 Here, the Quebec default judgment\n          precludes the relitigation of Plaintiff’s\n          claim. Because a default judgment is a final\n          judgment under the Recognition Act, the Quebec\n          default judgment qualifies for res judicata\n          treatment.   First, this action involves the\n          same cause of action--breach of contract--as\n          the Quebec proceeding.       Second, as both\n          Parties stipulated in open court, this action\n          involves the same construction projects as\n          were at issue in the Quebec proceeding.\n          Third, the parties to this action were the\n          same parties to the Quebec proceeding, with\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f              the only difference being that Plaintiff here\n              was the defendant in Quebec.\n\nId.     The    district    court,    therefore,    held    that   res   judicata\n\nprecluded the present action and entered summary judgment for\n\nKitchen International.\n\n                                        II\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Contentions of the Parties\n\n              Evans submits that the district court erred in holding\n\nthat its claim for damages for breach of contract or in quantum\n\nmeruit were barred because of the prior default judgment entered\n\nagainst it by the Superior Court of Québec.               In Evans’s view, the\n\nSuperior Court of Québec lacked personal jurisdiction over it, and,\n\nconsequently,     the     default   judgment     was   unenforceable     and   not\n\nsubject to recognition by the district court.                 Noting that the\n\ndistrict court applied a summary judgment standard in determining\n\nwhether the Québec court properly exercised jurisdiction, Evans\n\nsubmits that there are significant unresolved factual questions\n\nconcerning     the   nature   of    Evans’s    relevant    contacts     with   the\n\nProvince of Québec. Evans contends that, if the district court had\n\ntaken the facts in the light most favorable to its position, as the\n\ndistrict court must do in the context of summary judgment, there\n\nwould be no basis for concluding that the Québec court could\n\nexercise personal jurisdiction over it.\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f           Kitchen International takes a decidedly different view.\n\nIt   submits   that   the   Québec   judgment    must   be   recognized   and\n\nprecludes the present suit.           Focusing on the summary judgment\n\nmotion, it notes that the district court characterized its evidence\n\nthat Evans had purposeful contacts with Québec as “overwhelming.”\n\nSee Evans Cabinet, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 416.              By contrast, Evans\n\nsubmitted only the affidavits of Mark Trexler, Evans’s CEO, who, in\n\nKitchen International’s view, could show no involvement in the\n\nparties’ agreements.\n\nB.   Threshold Matters\n\n           We review de novo a grant of summary judgment.            Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of any\n\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).        In assessing the merits of\n\nsuch a motion, the court must consider the record in the light most\n\nfavorable to the party opposing the motion and must indulge in all\n\ninferences favorable to that party.         Kunelius v. Town of Stow, 588\n\nF.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2009).         We also must keep in mind, however,\n\nthat the role of summary judgment is to “pierce the pleadings” and\n\nto determine whether there is a genuine need for trial.           Garside v.\n\nOsco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1990).            The moving party\n\nmust “put the ball in play” by averring the absence of any genuine\n\nissue of fact.    Id. at 48.    Once the ball is in play, however, the\n\nnon-moving party must come forward with competent evidence to rebut\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthe assertion of the moving party.       Id.; see also Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett,   477   U.S.   317,   323-24    (1986).   Not   every   factual\n\ndiscrepancy is sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\n\n“[E]vidence that ‘is merely colorable or is not significantly\n\nprobative’” cannot defeat the motion.       Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,\n\n950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986)).5\n\n           When sitting in diversity and asked to recognize and\n\nenforce a foreign country judgment, federal courts tend to apply\n\n\n\n     5\n        Evans notes that, in determining the jurisdiction of the\nQuébec court, the district court did not employ any of the\nmethodologies set out in Boit v. Gar-Tec Products, Inc., 967 F.2d\n671, 674-78 (1st Cir. 1992).     See also Foster-Miller, Inc. v.\nBabcock & Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d 138, 144-49 (1st Cir. 1995). We\nagree with Evans that the district court correctly proceeded in\nthis regard. The approaches set forth in Foster-Miller and in Boit\nare designed to assist the district court in investigating the\nbasis of its own jurisdiction in the suit before it.       They are\ndesigned to reconcile the sometimes competing interests of fairness\nto the parties and considerations of judicial economy that often\narise in that context.\n     Here, the jurisdictional issue is raised in a very different\ncontext.   Kitchen   International’s    motion   to   dismiss   the\nMassachusetts action did not attempt simply to bar the prosecution\nof the current action in Massachusetts on the ground that the\ndistrict court lacked authority to adjudicate Evans’s present\ncontract claim there. Rather, it was a motion addressed to the\nmerits of the Massachusetts action. It sought a ruling that Evans\nwas precluded from obtaining the substantive relief that it sought\nin the Massachusetts action because an earlier judgment obtained in\nanother court precluded any further litigation of the matter. As\npart of that assertion, Kitchen International submits that the\nearlier judgment was rendered by a court that had personal\njurisdiction over the defendant in that action, Evans. Evans takes\nthe opposite view. This is a merits dispute properly analyzed at\nthis stage of the proceedings by conventional summary judgment\nanalysis.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthe law of recognition and enforcement of the state in which they\n\nsit, as required by Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64\n\n(1938).6 However, some courts and commentators have suggested that\n\nrecognition and enforcement of foreign country judgments deserves\n\napplication of a uniform federal body of law because suits of this\n\nnature necessarily implicate the foreign relations of the United\n\nStates.7   This question has not been decided definitively in this\n\n\n     6\n        See, e.g., Sarl Louis Feraud Int’l v. Viewfinder, Inc., 489\nF.3d 474, 477-78 (2d Cir. 2007); Soc’y of Lloyd’s v. Siemon-Netto,\n457 F.3d 94, 98-99 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Sw. Livestock & Trucking Co.\nv.

Khreich, 915 F.2d 1000, 1003 n.1 (5th Cir. 1990)\n(“Commentators have argued that the enforceability of a foreign\njudgment in United States’ courts should [] be governed by\nreference to a general rule of federal law.”); Tahan v. Hodgson,\n662 F.2d 862, 868 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (“[N]otwithstanding Erie\nRailroad Co. v. Tompkins, the issue seems to be national rather\nthan state.”); see also Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws\n§ 98 cmt. c (“[I]t seems probable that federal law would be applied\nto prevent application of a State rule on the recognition of\nforeign nation judgments if such application would result in the\ndisruption or embarrassment of the foreign relations of the United\nStates.” (citing Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429 (1968))); Ronald\nA. Brand, Enforcement of Foreign Money-Judgments in the United\nStates: In Search of Uniformity and International Acceptance, 67\nNotre Dame L. Rev. 253, 301-18 (1991) (suggesting that federal\ncommon law may supplant state laws on the recognition and\n\n                               -11-\n\fcircuit.   In John Sanderson (Wool) Pty. Ltd. v. Ludlow Jute Co.,\n\n569 F.2d 696, 697 n.1 (1st Cir. 1978), we left the question open,\n\nnoting that there was no reason to decide the matter under the\n\nfacts of that case because there was no appreciable difference\n\nbetween the federal and the state rules.   We shall follow the same\n\ncourse in this case because we need not resolve the matter here.\n\nNeither party has suggested that the district court ought to have\n\nfollowed a rule other than that of Massachusetts.    In any event,\n\neven if the reciprocity rule of Hilton v. Guyot were applicable\n\nunder the facts of this case, the Massachusetts rule of recognition\n\n\n\nenforcement of foreign country judgments).\n     Proponents of this view note that a federal rule of\nrecognition and enforcement of foreign country judgments may\nalready exist, as established by the Supreme Court in Hilton v.\nGuyot, 159 U.S. 113 (1895).     When a federal court is asked to\nrecognize and enforce a foreign country judgment in an action where\nthe court’s subject matter jurisdiction is based not on diversity,\nbut on 28 U.S.C. § 1331 or some other source of federal\njurisdiction, the federal rule of recognition and enforcement would\ngovern. See, e.g., Gordon & Breach Sci. Publishers S.A. v. Am.\nInst. of Physics, 905 F. Supp. 169, 178-79 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)\n(applying the federal rule in a Lanham Act case). See generally\nBrand, supra, at 262 n.32 (discussing non-diversity cases applying\nfederal rules).\n     According to Hilton, a diversity case from the pre-Erie era,\nforeign judgments shall be recognized so long as the rendering\ncourt afforded an opportunity for full and fair proceedings; the\ncourt was of competent jurisdiction over the persons and subject\nmatter; the court conducted regular proceedings, which afforded due\nnotice of appearance to adversary parties; and the court afforded\na system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial\nadministration of justice between the citizens of its own country\nand those of other countries. See 159 U.S. at 202-03. The Hilton\nrule also requires reciprocity in the recognition and enforcement\nof United States judgments from the jurisdiction of the rendering\ncourt. Id. at 210, 226-27.\n\n                               -12-\n\fand enforcement also contains a reciprocity requirement. See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 235, § 235A (subsection (7) of third paragraph); see\n\nalso John Sanderson, 569 F.2d at 697.\n\nC.   Massachusetts Law on the Recognition of Foreign Country\n     Judgments\n\n\n            With     respect    to    the   recognition   of   foreign   country\n\njudgments, Massachusetts, like many other states of the Union, has\n\nenacted a version of the Recognition Act.8                 The Massachusetts\n\nversion of that Act is codified at Massachusetts General Laws\n\nchapter    235   §   23A.9     This   section   clearly   requires   that   the\n\nrendering court have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in\n\norder for the resulting judgment to be recognized in Massachusetts.\n\n\n      8\n         The parties do not question that the Recognition Act\napplies not only to enforcement actions but also to the recognition\nof the foreign judgments to preclude further litigation. See 18B\nC. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§ 4473 n.7 (“The inclusion of at least the core of claim preclusion\nin   Section   3   [of  the   Recognition    Act]   is  noted   [by\ncommentators].”); see also Brand, supra, at 265-66 & n.43\n(“‘Whether a foreign judgment should be recognized, may be in\nissue, however, not only in enforcement . . . but in other\ncontexts, for example where the defendant seeks to rely on a prior\nadjudication   of   a  controversy   (res   judicata).’”   (quoting\nRestatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law § 481 cmt. b (1986))).\nOf course, in the case of recognition to preclude further\nlitigation, once the foreign judgment is deemed entitled to\nrecognition under the Recognition Act, the extent of the foreign\njudgment’s preclusive effect still must be determined.          See\ngenerally Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws § 98 cmt. g\n(rev. 1988). In this case, we need not address that issue because\nEvans has waived any argument that the Québec judgment is entitled\nto less res judicata effect than what the district court gave it.\nSee infra note 18.\n      9\n          See the statutory appendix to this opinion.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fThe   statute   does   not   state   explicitly,   however,   whether   the\n\ncorrectness of that exercise of jurisdiction by the rendering court\n\nought to be determined according to the law of the rendering or the\n\nenforcing jurisdiction. The district court suggested that there is\n\ncurrently a division of authority on this question among the states\n\nthat have enacted a form of the Recognition Act.10            The district\n\n\n      10\n         Some states have concluded that the relevant question is\nonly whether personal jurisdiction would have been present had the\nrendering court applied the law of the enforcing state. See, e.g.,\nGenujo Lok Beteiligungs GmbH v. Zorn, 943 A.2d 573, 580 (Me. 2008)\n(looking only to whether the foreign jurisdiction could have\nestablished personal jurisdiction under Maine law); Sung Hwan Co.\nv. Rite Aid Corp., 850 N.E.2d 647, 650-51 (N.Y. 2006) (interpreting\nthe term “personal jurisdiction” as used in an analogous New York\nstatute to mean “whether exercise of jurisdiction by the foreign\ncourt comports with New York’s concept of personal jurisdiction”\nand omitting any analysis of foreign law).\n     Other state courts instead have concluded that the proper\ninterpretation is to ascertain first whether the rendering court\ncould exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant under its\nown laws. They then look to whether the rendering court could have\nexercised personal jurisdiction under the law of the forum state.\nThe purpose of this second step is to ensure that the rendering\ncourt not only possessed jurisdiction at the time of judgment but\nalso that the rendering court’s procedures comported with United\nStates due process standards. Under this approach, both of these\nrequirements are necessary for a rendering court to have personal\njurisdiction over the defendant within the meaning of the\nRecognition Act. See, e.g., Monks Own, Ltd. v. Monastery of Christ\nin the Desert, 168 P.3d 121, 124-27 (N.M. 2007) (adopting the\napproach of first ascertaining whether personal jurisdiction was\nsatisfied under the law of the rendering foreign jurisdiction and\nthen determining whether the judgment debtor’s applicable contacts\nwith the rendering jurisdiction satisfy the United States\nconstitutional due process minimum); Vrozos v. Sarantopoulos, 552\nN.E.2d 1093, 1099-1100 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990) (reviewing a trial\ncourt decision concluding that a Canadian court had personal\njurisdiction over the judgment debtor pursuant to United States\nprinciples of due process and remanding for consideration of\nwhether the Canadian court also had personal jurisdiction pursuant\nto Canadian law of service of summons). Federal courts applying\n\n                                     -14-\n\fcourt also noted that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\n\nhas not yet spoken squarely on the matter.11\n\n          The district court, faced with the ambiguity about the\n\nprevailing rule in Massachusetts with respect to the law governing\n\npersonal jurisdiction in the rendering court, explicitly declined\n\nto resolve the matter and instead applied the governing rule of\n\nboth jurisdictions.   On appeal, neither party has contended that\n\nthe district court erred in this regard.       Nor has either party\n\nargued that Massachusetts would apply any other rule.   Under these\n\ncircumstances, we must conclude that the parties have waived any\n\nreliance on another rule and that we must decide this case by\n\nassessing the facts in light of the personal jurisdiction law of\n\nboth the Province of Québec and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\nanalogous state recognition acts also have adopted this approach.\nSee K & R Robinson Enters. Ltd. v. Asian Exp. Material Supply Co.,\n178 F.R.D. 332, 339-42 (D. Mass. 1998). See generally Royal Bank\nof Canada v. Trentham Corp., 491 F. Supp. 404, 408-10 (S.D. Tex.\n1980), vacated by, 665 F.2d 515 (5th Cir. 1981). The American Law\nInstitute adopts this approach in its model federal statute on the\nrecognition of foreign money judgments.         See American Law\nInstitute, Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments:\nAnalysis and Proposed Federal Statute § 3 & cmt. c (2006).\n     11\n        In Manches & Co. v. Gilbey, 646 N.E.2d 86 (Mass. 1995), the\nSupreme Judicial Court decided that an English default judgment was\nworthy of recognition in Massachusetts. It reviewed the English\njudgment employing the criteria stated in the Massachusetts version\nof the Recognition Act.    However the court did not rule on the\nquestion of whether the actual exercise of jurisdiction by the\nEnglish court ought to be measured solely by the law of England or\nMassachusetts or both.\n\n                               -15-\n\f1.   The Jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Québec under the\n     Law of Québec\n\n                We    turn,    then,    to    the    question    of   whether      Kitchen\n\nInternational             established   that     the   Superior       Court   of    Québec\n\nproperly exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans.12                              In the\n\ndistrict court, Kitchen International submitted the affidavit of a\n\nCanadian        attorney      and    argued    that    the   Québec    court       properly\n\nexercised jurisdiction under Article 3136 of the Québec Civil Code.\n\nThat provision states:\n\n                Even though a Québec authority has no\n                jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may hear\n                it, if the dispute has a sufficient connection\n                with Québec, where proceedings cannot possibly\n                be instituted outside Québec or where the\n                institution of such proceedings outside Québec\n                cannot reasonably be required.\n\nCivil        Code    of    Québec,   R.S.Q.,     ch.   64,   art.     3136.        From   an\n\nexamination of the record in its entirety, it does not appear that\n\nKitchen International relied upon any other particular provision of\n\nthe Code.           Moreover, the opinion of the district court appears to\n\nhave     interpreted         Kitchen    International’s         position      as   relying\n\nentirely on this provision.                   The district court took the view,\n\nalbeit in conclusory fashion, that this provision applied because\n\n“‘the contract [at issue] was concluded in Quebec or [] the cause\n\nof action arose in Quebec.’”             Evans Cabinet, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 415\n\n\n        12\n        The Superior Court of Québec is the court of general trial\njurisdiction in the Province of Québec. See F. Pearl Eliadis &\nFrance Allard, The Legal System in Quebec, in Gerald Gall, The\nCanadian Legal System 277 (5th ed. 2004).\n\n                                              -16-\n\f(quoting Canadian Imperial Bank, 899 F. Supp. at 1253 (emphasis and\n\nfirst alteration in original)).\n\n               There are two problems with this analysis.               First, the\n\nQuébec provision relied upon by Kitchen International, Article\n\n3136, is clearly a provision that permits Québec courts to assume\n\npersonal jurisdiction over parties in exceptional cases when there\n\nis    no    other   available    jurisdiction      to    which   the   parties   may\n\nlitigate their dispute.          See GreCon Dimter, Inc. v. J.R. Normand,\n\nInc., [2005] 2 S.C.R. 401 para 33.13              Such a situation is clearly\n\nnot the case here.        The litigants are American corporations which\n\nare amenable to suit in the state of their corporate domicile and,\n\nwith respect to particular transactions, in the states where they\n\nhave the requisite minimum contacts with the other party and with\n\nthe transaction at issue in the lawsuit.                 Because there obviously\n\nare    other    forums   quite    able   to     assume   jurisdiction     over   the\n\nparties, we must conclude that Kitchen International has not\n\ncarried its burden of establishing that this provision can serve as\n\nan adequate basis for jurisdiction over Evans in the courts of that\n\nprovince. Cf. Bouchard v. Ventes de Vehicules Mitsubishi du Canada\n\nInc., [2008] Q.J. No. 13487, 2008 QCCS 6033 para. 22 (holding that\n\nthe statute does not apply because “all Respondents are domiciled\n\nin countries with sophisticated court systems which apply the rule\n\n\n       13\n         Other provisions of the code, however, would have been\ninvoked more appropriately. See the statutory appendix to this\nopinion.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fof law”).       The second infirmity with the district court’s reliance\n\non Article 3136 is that Canadian Imperial Bank does not indicate\n\nthat the parties in that case, or the district court in that case,\n\nwere relying on this provision of Québec law.               Nor does Canadian\n\nImperial Bank identify what provision of Québec law the court\n\nbelieved supported an exercise of personal jurisdiction in that\n\ncase.     899 F. Supp. at 1253.              Thus, simply invoking Canadian\n\nImperial Bank does not prove that the Superior Court of Québec\n\nproperly exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans pursuant to\n\nQuébec law.\n\n            Under these circumstances, we normally would have little\n\ndifficulty in concluding that Kitchen International had not met its\n\nburden    of     establishing      that    the   Québec   court    had     personal\n\njurisdiction over Evans on the basis of Article 3136 and, moreover,\n\nthat    Kitchen       International   had    waived   reliance    on     any    other\n\nprovision of Québec law by its failure to raise any other provision\n\nin the district court.             However, several considerations make a\n\ndetermination of waiver inappropriate under the circumstances of\n\nthis case.       First, although relying on the wrong section of the\n\nCode, the district court indicated to the parties that it believed\n\nQuébec’s Code authorized jurisdiction if the contract had been made\n\nin     Québec    or     if   the   cause    of   action   had     arisen       there.\n\nAdditionally, Evans, far from relying on a waiver on the part of\n\nKitchen International, explicitly admits in its brief before this\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fcourt that the Québec court could have had jurisdiction if the\n\ncontract had been concluded in Québec or if the cause of action\n\narose in Québec.      Appellant’s Br. 16 (citing Canadian Imperial\n\nBank).14   Under these circumstances, we must conclude that Kitchen\n\nInternational may be able to demonstrate that the Québec court was\n\nauthorized to exercise jurisdiction if it can demonstrate that a\n\ncontractual relationship was established with Evans in Québec or\n\nthat there was a breach of that agreement in Québec or that one of\n\nthe obligations arising from the contract was to be performed in\n\nthe Province.     A provision of the Civil Code of Québec authorizes\n\nthe exercise of jurisdiction on these bases.      See Civil Code of\n\nQuébec, R.S.Q., ch. 64, art. 3148.15 Under that provision, a Québec\n\ncourt can exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant\n\nif, inter alia, “a fault was committed in Québec, damage was\n\nsuffered in Québec, an injurious act occurred in Québec or one of\n\nthe obligations arising from a contract was to be performed in\n\nQuébec.”    Id.\n\n            Relying on the affidavit of Ms. Shiell, an officer and\n\nowner of Kitchen International, the district court took the view\n\nthat the authority of Québec to exercise jurisdiction over Evans\n\n\n     14\n          Read in context, it is clear that Evans makes this\nstatement in reference to the district court’s reading of Article\n3136. However, there is no indication that Evans disagrees with\nthat reading or that it believes that Article 3136 is limited to\nthe extraordinary circumstance when there is no other viable forum.\n     15\n           See the statutory appendix to this opinion.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fhad been established because all of the “‘orders, communications,\n\npayments, correspondence and dealings’” between the parties had\n\ntaken place through Kitchen International’s Montreal office. Evans\n\nCabinet, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 416 (quoting Shiell Aff. at 3).                    The\n\ndistrict court also concluded that the parties had agreed to create\n\na   product    showroom   to     display    Evans’s    products   to   potential\n\ncustomers and sales agents from New England and Canada.                 Id.\n\n              An examination of the record makes clear, however, that\n\nthe district court’s factual conclusions were not undisputed.\n\nThrough the affidavit and supplemental affidavit of its CEO, Mark\n\nTrexler,      Evans   disputed    that     it   had   accepted   in   Québec   any\n\ncontractual obligation with Kitchen International or had engaged,\n\nthrough its representatives, in any business in Québec. Indeed, it\n\ndenied the existence of any agreement with Kitchen International\n\nother than various agreements to sell the allegedly defective\n\nmaterial. Evans denied, explicitly, any joint venture to establish\n\na showroom in Montreal.            Indeed, none of the affidavits make\n\nexplicit the precise relationship between the alleged showroom and\n\nthe specific sales of allegedly defective products by Evans. Under\n\nthese circumstances, it is clear that genuine issues of fact remain\n\nto be resolved before the authority of Québec to exercise personal\n\njurisdiction over Evans can be established.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\f2.   The Application of Massachusetts Standards to the Superior\n     Court of Québec’s Exercise of Jurisdiction\n\n             At the outset, we pause to emphasize that the parties do\n\nnot dispute that the district court had personal jurisdiction over\n\nthem in this case.     Here we review its determination of whether the\n\nexercise of personal jurisdiction by the Superior Court of Québec\n\ncomported with Massachusetts and federal standards.\n\n             The exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant\n\nsuch as Evans is governed by the Commonwealth’s long-arm statute\n\ninsofar as the exercise of jurisdiction also comports with the\n\nrequirements of the federal Due Process Clause. Caplan v. Donovan,\n\n879 N.E.2d 117, 120 (Mass. 2008); see also Ticketmaster-New York,\n\nInc.    v.   Alioto,   26   F.3d   201,    204   (1st   Cir.   1994).   The\n\nMassachusetts long-arm statute permits the exercise of personal\n\njurisdiction when a person has transacted business within the\n\nCommonwealth or when the person has contracted to supply services\n\nor things within the Commonwealth.         This conferral of jurisdiction\n\ncreates a specifically affiliating jurisdictional nexus;16 the\n\npersonal jurisdiction conferred is only with respect to litigation\n\narising out of the transaction within the Commonwealth, not with\n\nrespect to the defendant’s transactions that did not take place in\n\n\n\n       16\n        The district court understood Kitchen International to be\narguing that Evans had a specifically affiliating nexus with\nQuébec.    Evans Cabinet, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 415.         Kitchen\nInternational does not dispute that understanding on appeal, and,\nindeed, argues the case on that basis. Appellee’s Br. 13.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fthe Commonwealth.   Here, “[w]e may sidestep the statutory inquiry\n\nand proceed directly to the constitutional analysis . . . because\n\nthe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted the\n\nstate’s long-arm statute as an assertion of jurisdiction over the\n\nperson to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United\n\nStates.”   Daynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole,\n\n290 F.3d 42, 52 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           We have described in earlier cases these constitutional\n\nrequirements:\n\n           “First, the claim underlying the litigation\n           must directly arise out of, or relate to, the\n           defendant’s forum-state activities.    Second,\n           the   defendant’s   in-state   contacts   must\n           represent a purposeful availment of the\n           privilege of conducting activities in the\n           forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and\n           protections of that state’s laws and making\n           the defendant’s involuntary presence before\n           the state’s courts foreseeable.     Third, the\n           exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the\n           Gestalt factors, be reasonable.”\n\nFoster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d 138, 144\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United Elec., Radio and Mach. Workers of\n\nAm. v. 163 Pleasant Street Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1089 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)).    With respect to the “Gestalt factors,” we have observed\n\nthat,\n\n           In constitutional terms, the jurisdictional\n           inquiry is not a mechanical exercise.      The\n           Court has long insisted that concepts of\n           reasonableness   must    inform   a   properly\n           performed minimum contacts analysis.      This\n           means that, even where purposefully generated\n           contacts exist, courts must consider a panoply\n\n                               -22-\n\f            of other factors which bear upon the fairness\n            of subjecting a nonresident to the authority\n            of a foreign tribunal.\n\nTicketmaster-New York, 26 F.3d at 209 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted). The Gestalt factors that a court will consider\n\ninclude:    “(1) the defendant’s burden of appearing, (2) the forum\n\nstate’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) the plaintiff’s\n\ninterest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the\n\njudicial    system’s   interest   in   obtaining   the   most    effective\n\nresolution of the controversy, and (5) the common interests of all\n\nsovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.”           Id.\n\n            In applying these standards, the district court held:\n\n                   The Quebec Superior Court’s exercise of\n            personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff did not\n            contravene traditional notions of fair play\n            and substantial justice.        Plaintiff had\n            several contacts with Quebec. All the orders,\n            communications, payments, correspondence and\n            dealings between Parties occurred through\n            Defendant’s   Montreal   office.     Moreover,\n            Parties agreed to create a product showroom at\n            Defendant’s   Montreal    office,  which   was\n            ultimately constructed. The purpose of this\n            showroom was to display Plaintiff’s products\n            to potential customers and sales agents from\n            Canada and New England.\n\nEvans Cabinet, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 416 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    However, as we have noted in our earlier discussion of\n\nthe Québec jurisdictional statute, the affidavits supplied by the\n\nparties were in conflict.     Evans, through the affidavits of Mr.\n\nTrexler, maintains that there were various contracts for the\n\npurchase of the allegedly defective material, that they were all\n\n                                  -23-\n\fentered into by Evans at its Georgia plant and that Evans did no\n\nbusiness in Québec.    It further claims that it had no agreement\n\nwith Kitchen International with respect to a showroom in Montreal\n\nand therefore, at least implicitly, denies any connection between\n\nsuch a showroom and its contracts to supply the allegedly defective\n\ngoods.    Mark Trexler further stated in his affidavit that, in his\n\nposition as CEO of Evans, he had personal knowledge of Evans’s\n\ncontractual relationships and that he was unaware of any agreement\n\nwith Kitchen International to develop or construct a showroom.\n\nJanet Shiell, one of the principals of Kitchen International, by\n\ncontrast, stated in her affidavit that there was an agreement with\n\nEvans to create a showroom, and she produced paperwork purportedly\n\nrelated to that agreement (but no document embodying the agreement\n\nitself).    Furthermore, she stated in a rebuttal affidavit that\n\nthere was no reason for Trexler to know about the agreement because\n\nshe (and others at Kitchen International) had dealings only with\n\nGatti,17 another employee of Evans.      Kitchen International never\n\nmakes clear the exact relationship between the alleged joint\n\nventure to create a showroom and the agreements to sell the\n\nallegedly defective material.18\n\n\n     17\n        Who Paul Gatti is, and what his position is/was at Evans,\nnever was explained by either party in their submissions.\n     18\n         If the district court were to find that there was no\nconnection between the alleged agreement to establish a showroom in\nMontreal and the agreements to supply the allegedly defective\nmaterial, Kitchen International’s argument for maintaining that the\n\n                                  -24-\n\f          Furthermore, even if such an argument had been made\n\nsuccessfully,19 the district court’s analysis of jurisdiction still\n\n\nQuébec court had jurisdiction over the contracts to supply the\nallegedly defective material would be weakened substantially. See\nLyle Richards Int’l v. Ashworth, Inc., 132 F.3d 111, 114 (1st Cir.\n1997) (discussing application of the “arising from” clause in the\nCommonwealth’s long-arm statute).\n     19\n         Absent the “showroom evidence,” Evans’s contacts with\nCanada are limited to its contractual relationship with Kitchen\nInternational for the supply of cabinetry to various business sites\nin the United States. In Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S.\n462 (1985), the Court explained the “purposeful availment”\nrequirement as it applies to a contractual relationship.         It\nstated:\n\n          This purposeful availment requirement ensures that\n     a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely\n     as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated\n     contacts, or of the unilateral activity of another party\n     or a third person.     Jurisdiction is proper, however,\n     where the contacts proximately result from actions by the\n     defendant himself that create a substantial connection\n     with the forum State.         Thus where the defendant\n     deliberately has engaged in significant activities within\n     a State, or has created continuing obligations between\n     himself and residents of the forum, he manifestly has\n     availed himself of the privilege of conducting business\n     there, and because his activities are shielded by the\n     benefits and protections of the forum’s laws it is\n     presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit\n     to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well.\n          Jurisdiction in these circumstances may not be\n     avoided merely because the defendant did not physically\n     enter the forum State.     Although territorial presence\n     frequently   will   enhance    a  potential   defendant’s\n     affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable\n     foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact\n     of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of\n     business is transacted solely by mail and wire\n     communications across state lines, thus obviating the\n     need for physical presence within a State in which\n     business is conducted. So long as a commercial actor’s\n     efforts are purposefully directed toward residents of\n     another State, we have consistently rejected the notion\n\n                               -25-\n\fis deficient.   Absent from the district court’s analysis is any\n\ndiscussion of the “Gestalt factors,” which, we have made clear, a\n\ncourt must consider to determine the fairness of subjecting the\n\ndefendant to a foreign jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n     that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal\n     jurisdiction there.\n\nId. at 475-76 (internal quotation marks, citations and emphasis\nomitted).\n     In Burger King, although the defendant had no physical ties to\nthe state of Florida, the Court determined nonetheless that he had\nestablished the necessary minimum contacts with that state to be\nhauled into court there. It noted that, in determining that there\nwas a want of jurisdiction, the appellate court had “overlook[ed]\nsubstantial record evidence indicating that Rudzewicz most\ncertainly knew that he was affiliating himself with an enterprise\nbased primarily in Florida.” Id. at 480. It stated:\n\n     The contract documents themselves emphasize that Burger\n     King’s operations are conducted and supervised from the\n     Miami headquarters, that all relevant notices and\n     payments must be sent there, and that the agreements were\n     made in and enforced from Miami. Moreover, the parties’\n     actual course of dealing repeatedly confirmed that\n     decisionmaking authority was vested in the Miami\n     headquarters and that the district office served largely\n     as an intermediate link between the headquarters and the\n     franchisees. When problems arose over building design,\n     site-development fees, rent computation, and the\n     defaulted payments, Rudzewicz and MacShara learned that\n     the Michigan office was powerless to resolve their\n     disputes and could only channel their communications to\n     Miami. Throughout these disputes, the Miami headquarters\n     and the Michigan franchisees carried on a continuous\n     course of direct communications by mail and by telephone,\n     and it was the Miami headquarters that made the key\n     negotiating decisions out of which the instant litigation\n     arose.\n\nId. at 480-81 (internal citations omitted).\n\n                               -26-\n\f            Because the district court resolved material issues of\n\nfact against Evans, the nonmoving party, the judgment must be\n\nreversed.    The controverted issues of fact that Evans has raised\n\nmust be resolved.   Accordingly, the judgment of the district court\n\nis reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.20\n\n            REVERSED and REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n     20\n        Evans did not argue, until the reply brief, that, even if\nthe district court correctly had analyzed the jurisdictional issue,\nit nevertheless erred in holding that its (Evans’s) claims were\nbarred by res judicata because the claim before the district court\nis different from the claim or cause of action before the Québec\ncourt. Because this argument was not raised in its opening brief,\nit is waived. Sandstrom v.

Fallman, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and RIPPLE,<sup>[*]</sup> Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>RIPPLE, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Evans Cabinet Corporation (\"Evans\") instituted this diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Kitchen International, Inc. for breach of contract and quantum meruit.<sup>[1]</sup> Kitchen International filed a motion to dismiss based on res judicata. It claimed that the action was foreclosed because of an earlier judgment entered by the Superior Court of Québec. After a hearing on the motion to dismiss, the district court determined that the arguments went beyond the pleadings. After allowing limited discovery and converting the motion to one for summary judgment, the court entered judgment for Kitchen International. Evans filed a timely appeal to this court.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>According to the allegations of the complaint, Kitchen International and Evans entered into a contract in 2004.<sup>[3]</sup> Evans agreed to supply Kitchen International with manufactured cabinetry for several residential construction sites on the East Coast of the United States. Kitchen International placed these orders from its headquarters in Montreal with the Georgia <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> offices of Evans. The materials were shipped directly to the construction sites.</p>\n<p>According to Kitchen International, in 2004, the two parties also agreed that they would create a products showroom at Kitchen International's office in Montreal. Kitchen International claims that Paul Gatti of Evans approved the design and layout of the showroom. According to Kitchen International, later that year, Evans manufactured and shipped cabinetry, related products and sales and promotional materials to Québec for use in the showroom. Evans denies the existence of such an agreement; it claims that it never authorized Kitchen International to build a showroom and that it did not supply products to Kitchen International for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Various issues arose about the quality and conformity of the products that Evans had shipped to the East Coast projects. Consequently, in May 2006, Kitchen International engaged a Canadian attorney to file suit against Evans in the Superior Court of Québec for breach of contract arising from the materials supplied by Evans. Evans was served with process and given notice of this proceeding. Evans did not answer or otherwise respond to the action, and, consequently, on May 31, 2007, the Superior Court of Québec entered a default judgment against Evans in the amount of $149,354.74.</p>\n<p>On April 23, 2007, Evans instituted this action for breach of contract and quantum meruit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Kitchen International filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the action was barred by res judicata by virtue of the Canadian judgment against Evans. Evans opposed the motion on the ground that the Superior Court of Québec had lacked jurisdiction over it, and, therefore, the Québec judgment could not be recognized by the district court.</p>\n<p>During a hearing on Kitchen International's motion to dismiss, the district court realized that the issues being argued went beyond the pleadings. It therefore stated that the motion should be converted to one for summary judgment and allowed the parties ninety days to conduct limited discovery on the issue of the Superior Court of Québec's jurisdiction over Evans. On March 4, 2008, the district court resumed the hearing. The only additional documents supplied by either party were affidavits from their principals. On November 4, 2008, the district court converted Kitchen International's motion to a motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. The court first determined that, because it was sitting in diversity, it should apply Massachusetts's version of the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (\"Recognition Act\") to determine whether it should enforce the Québec judgment.<sup>[4]</sup> In order to enforce a judgment under the Recognition Act, the court continued, the Québec court must have been able to exercise personal jurisdiction over Evans.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of its analysis, the district court observed that \"jurisdictions have split over whether to apply the personal jurisdiction law of the rendering country, the forum state, or both.\" <i>Evans Cabinet Corp. v. Kitchen Int'l, Inc.,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d 410, 414 (D.Mass.2008). Because the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had not chosen between these views, the district court decided that it would scrutinize the jurisdiction of the Québec court under both the law of Québec and the law of Massachusetts. Turning <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> first to the law of Québec, the district court noted that Kitchen International had attached the affidavit of its Canadian attorney to establish that Québec's exercise of jurisdiction was appropriate. The district court determined that the affidavit clearly established that Kitchen International had the right to institute a lawsuit in Québec. However, it found the affidavit deficient on the issue of \"whether the Quebec Superior Court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over [Evans] pursuant to article 3136 of the Civil Code of Quebec.\" <i>Id.</i> at 415. It noted, however, that the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had determined that the Québec court could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the contract at issue had been \"`concluded in Quebec <i>or</i> if the cause of action arose in Quebec.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Saxony Carpet Co.,</i> 899 F.Supp. 1248, 1253 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (emphasis in original)). Based on that authority, the district court concluded that the Superior Court of Québec properly had exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans pursuant to the law of Québec.</p>\n<p>The district court then turned to the law of Massachusetts. The court first noted that Massachusetts courts had interpreted the Commonwealth's long-arm statute \"as an assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court then held:</p>\n<blockquote>The Quebec Superior Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff did not contravene traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Plaintiff had several contacts with Quebec. All the orders, communications, payments, correspondence and dealings between [the] Parties occurred through Defendant's Montreal office. Moreover, Parties agreed to create a product showroom at Defendant's Montreal office, which was ultimately constructed. The purpose of this showroom was to display Plaintiff's products to potential customers and sales agents from Canada and New England. Because under either Quebec or Massachusetts law the Quebec Superior Court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff, Plaintiff's argument that the Quebec default judgment is not conclusive fails.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 416 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The court then turned to the question of whether Evans's claims were barred by the Québec judgment. The district court determined that, although Massachusetts supplies the applicable res judicata law, \"a Massachusetts court must give a prior judgment the same finality it would receive in the rendering jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 417. Consequently, the court employed Québec rules of res judicata to determine whether the default judgment should be given preclusive effect. <i>Id.</i> (citing Québec civil code and a Supreme Court of Canada decision). The court then concluded that Evans's suit was barred by these rules:</p>\n<blockquote>Here, the Quebec default judgment precludes the relitigation of Plaintiff's claim. Because a default judgment is a final judgment under the Recognition Act, the Quebec default judgment qualifies for res judicata treatment. First, this action involves the same cause of actionbreach of contractas the Quebec proceeding. Second, as both Parties stipulated in open court, this action involves the same construction projects as were at issue in the Quebec proceeding. Third, the parties to this action were the same parties to the Quebec proceeding, with the only difference being that Plaintiff here was the defendant in Quebec.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> The district court, therefore, held that res judicata precluded the present action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> and entered summary judgment for Kitchen International.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Contentions of the Parties</h2>\n<p>Evans submits that the district court erred in holding that its claim for damages for breach of contract or in quantum meruit were barred because of the prior default judgment entered against it by the Superior Court of Québec. In Evans's view, the Superior Court of Québec lacked personal jurisdiction over it, and, consequently, the default judgment was unenforceable and not subject to recognition by the district court. Noting that the district court applied a summary judgment standard in determining whether the Québec court properly exercised jurisdiction, Evans submits that there are significant unresolved factual questions concerning the nature of Evans's relevant contacts with the Province of Québec. Evans contends that, if the district court had taken the facts in the light most favorable to its position, as the district court must do in the context of summary judgment, there would be no basis for concluding that the Québec court could exercise personal jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p>Kitchen International takes a decidedly different view. It submits that the Québec judgment must be recognized and precludes the present suit. Focusing on the summary judgment motion, it notes that the district court characterized its evidence that Evans had purposeful contacts with Québec as \"overwhelming.\" <i>See </i><i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 416. By contrast, Evans submitted only the affidavits of Mark Trexler, Evans's CEO, who, in Kitchen International's view, could show no involvement in the parties' agreements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Threshold Matters</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a grant of summary judgment. Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In assessing the merits of such a motion, the court must consider the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and must indulge in all inferences favorable to that party. <i>Kunelius v. Town of Stow,</i> 588 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.2009). We also must keep in mind, however, that the role of summary judgment is to \"pierce the pleadings\" and to determine whether there is a genuine need for trial. <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir.1990). The moving party must \"put the ball in play\" by averring the absence of any genuine issue of fact. <i>Id.</i> at 48. Once the ball is in play, however, the non-moving party must come forward with competent evidence to rebut the assertion of the moving party. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Not every factual discrepancy is sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. \"[E]vidence that `is merely colorable or is not significantly probative'\" cannot defeat the motion. <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>When sitting in diversity and asked to recognize and enforce a foreign country judgment, federal courts tend to apply the law of recognition and enforcement of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> state in which they sit, as required by <i>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938).<sup>[6]</sup> However, some courts and commentators have suggested that recognition and enforcement of foreign country judgments deserves application of a uniform federal body of law because suits of this nature necessarily implicate the foreign relations of the United States.<sup>[7]</sup> This question has not been decided definitively in this circuit. In <i>John Sanderson (Wool) Pty. Ltd. v. Ludlow Jute Co.,</i> 569 F.2d 696, 697 n. 1 (1st Cir.1978), we left the question open, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> noting that there was no reason to decide the matter under the facts of that case because there was no appreciable difference between the federal and the state rules. We shall follow the same course in this case because we need not resolve the matter here. Neither party has suggested that the district court ought to have followed a rule other than that of Massachusetts. In any event, even if the reciprocity rule of <i>Hilton v. Guyot</i> were applicable under the facts of this case, the Massachusetts rule of recognition and enforcement also contains a reciprocity requirement. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 235, § 235A (subsection (7) of third paragraph); <i>see also </i><i>John Sanderson,</i> 569 F.2d at 697.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Massachusetts Law on the Recognition of Foreign Country Judgments</h2>\n<p>With respect to the recognition of foreign <i>country</i> judgments, Massachusetts, like many other states of the Union, has enacted a version of the Recognition Act.<sup>[8]</sup> The Massachusetts version of that Act is codified at Massachusetts General Laws chapter 235 § 23A.<sup>[9]</sup> This section clearly requires that the <i>rendering</i> court have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in order for the resulting judgment to be recognized in Massachusetts. The statute does not state explicitly, however, whether the correctness of that exercise of jurisdiction by the rendering court ought to be determined according to the law of the rendering or the enforcing jurisdiction. The district court suggested that there is currently a division of authority on this question among the states that have enacted a form of the Recognition Act.<sup>[10]</sup> The district court also noted that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> yet spoken squarely on the matter.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court, faced with the ambiguity about the prevailing rule in Massachusetts with respect to the law governing personal jurisdiction in the rendering court, explicitly declined to resolve the matter and instead applied the governing rule of both jurisdictions. On appeal, neither party has contended that the district court erred in this regard. Nor has either party argued that Massachusetts would apply any other rule. Under these circumstances, we must conclude that the parties have waived any reliance on another rule and that we must decide this case by assessing the facts in light of the personal jurisdiction law of both the Province of Québec and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Québec under the Law of Québec</h2>\n<p>We turn, then, to the question of whether Kitchen International established that the Superior Court of Québec properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans.<sup>[12]</sup> In the district court, Kitchen International <span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> submitted the affidavit of a Canadian attorney and argued that the Québec court properly exercised jurisdiction under Article 3136 of the Québec Civil Code. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote>Even though a Québec authority has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may hear it, if the dispute has a sufficient connection with Québec, where proceedings cannot possibly be instituted outside Québec or where the institution of such proceedings outside Québec cannot reasonably be required.</blockquote>\n<p>Civil Code of Québec, R.S.Q., ch. 64, art. 3136. From an examination of the record in its entirety, it does not appear that Kitchen International relied upon any other particular provision of the Code. Moreover, the opinion of the district court appears to have interpreted Kitchen International's position as relying entirely on this provision. The district court took the view, albeit in conclusory fashion, that this provision applied because \"`the contract [at issue] was concluded in Quebec <i>or</i> [] the cause of action arose in Quebec.'\" <i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 415 (quoting <i>Canadian Imperial Bank,</i> 899 F.Supp. at 1253 (emphasis and first alteration in original)).</p>\n<p>There are two problems with this analysis. First, the Québec provision relied upon by Kitchen International, Article 3136, is clearly a provision that permits Québec courts to assume personal jurisdiction over parties in exceptional cases when there is no other available jurisdiction to which the parties may litigate their dispute. <i>See </i><i>GreCon Dimter, Inc. v. J.R. Normand, Inc.,</i> [2005] 2 S.C.R. 401 para 33.<sup>[13]</sup> Such a situation is clearly not the case here. The litigants are American corporations which are amenable to suit in the state of their corporate domicile and, with respect to particular transactions, in the states where they have the requisite minimum contacts with the other party and with the transaction at issue in the lawsuit. Because there obviously are other forums quite able to assume jurisdiction over the parties, we must conclude that Kitchen International has not carried its burden of establishing that this provision can serve as an adequate basis for jurisdiction over Evans in the courts of that province. <i>Cf. Bouchard v. Ventes de Vehicules Mitsubishi du Canada Inc.,</i> [2008] Q.J. No. 13487, 2008 QCCS 6033 para. 22 (holding that the statute does not apply because \"all Respondents are domiciled in countries with sophisticated court systems which apply the rule of law\"). The second infirmity with the district court's reliance on Article 3136 is that <i>Canadian Imperial Bank</i> does not indicate that the parties in that case, or the district court in that case, were relying on this provision of Québec law. Nor does <i>Canadian Imperial Bank</i> identify what provision of Québec law the court believed supported an exercise of personal jurisdiction in that case. 899 F.Supp. at 1253. Thus, simply invoking <i>Canadian Imperial Bank</i> does not prove that the Superior Court of Québec properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans pursuant to Québec law.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, we normally would have little difficulty in concluding that Kitchen International had not met its burden of establishing that the Québec court had personal jurisdiction over Evans on the basis of Article 3136 and, moreover, that Kitchen International had waived reliance on any other provision of Québec law by its failure to raise any other provision in the district court. However, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> several considerations make a determination of waiver inappropriate under the circumstances of this case. First, although relying on the wrong section of the Code, the district court indicated to the parties that it believed Québec's Code authorized jurisdiction if the contract had been made in Québec or if the cause of action had arisen there. Additionally, Evans, far from relying on a waiver on the part of Kitchen International, explicitly admits in its brief before this court that the Québec court could have had jurisdiction if the contract had been concluded in Québec or if the cause of action arose in Québec. Appellant's Br. 16 (citing <i>Canadian Imperial Bank</i>).<sup>[14]</sup> Under these circumstances, we must conclude that Kitchen International may be able to demonstrate that the Québec court was authorized to exercise jurisdiction <i>if</i> it can demonstrate that a contractual relationship was established with Evans in Québec or that there was a breach of that agreement in Québec or that one of the obligations arising from the contract was to be performed in the Province. A provision of the Civil Code of Québec authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction on these bases. <i>See</i> Civil Code of Québec, R.S.Q., ch. 64, art. 3148.<sup>[15]</sup> Under that provision, a Québec court can exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant if, inter alia, \"a fault was committed in Québec, damage was suffered in Québec, an injurious act occurred in Québec or one of the obligations arising from a contract was to be performed in Québec.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Relying on the affidavit of Ms. Shiell, an officer and owner of Kitchen International, the district court took the view that the authority of Québec to exercise jurisdiction over Evans had been established because all of the \"`orders, communications, payments, correspondence and dealings'\" between the parties had taken place through Kitchen International's Montreal office. <i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 416 (quoting Shiell Aff. at 3). The district court also concluded that the parties had agreed to create a product showroom to display Evans's products to potential customers and sales agents from New England and Canada. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>An examination of the record makes clear, however, that the district court's factual conclusions were not undisputed. Through the affidavit and supplemental affidavit of its CEO, Mark Trexler, Evans disputed that it had accepted in Québec any contractual obligation with Kitchen International or had engaged, through its representatives, in any business in Québec. Indeed, it denied the existence of any agreement with Kitchen International other than various agreements to sell the allegedly defective material. Evans denied, explicitly, any joint venture to establish a showroom in Montreal. Indeed, none of the affidavits make explicit the precise relationship between the alleged showroom and the specific sales of allegedly defective products by Evans. Under these circumstances, it is clear that genuine issues of fact remain to be resolved before the authority of Québec to exercise personal jurisdiction over Evans can be established.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Application of Massachusetts Standards to the Superior Court of Québec's Exercise of Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>At the outset, we pause to emphasize that the parties do not dispute that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> district court had personal jurisdiction over them in this case. Here we review its determination of whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the Superior Court of Québec comported with Massachusetts and federal standards.</p>\n<p>The exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant such as Evans is governed by the Commonwealth's long-arm statute insofar as the exercise of jurisdiction also comports with the requirements of the federal Due Process Clause. <i>Caplan v. Donovan,</i> 450 Mass. 463, 879 N.E.2d 117, 120 (2008); <i>see also </i><i>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto,</i> 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir.1994). The Massachusetts long-arm statute permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction when a person has transacted business within the Commonwealth or when the person has contracted to supply services or things within the Commonwealth. This conferral of jurisdiction creates a specifically affiliating jurisdictional nexus;<sup>[16]</sup> the personal jurisdiction conferred is only with respect to litigation <i>arising out of</i> the transaction within the Commonwealth, not with respect to the defendant's transactions that did not take place in the Commonwealth. Here, \"[w]e may sidestep the statutory inquiry and proceed directly to the constitutional analysis . . . because the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted the state's long-arm statute as an assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.\" <i>Daynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &amp; Poole,</i> 290 F.3d 42, 52 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We have described in earlier cases these constitutional requirements:</p>\n<blockquote>\"First, the claim underlying the litigation must directly arise out of, or relate to, the defendant's forum-state activities. Second, the defendant's in-state contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable. Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada,</i> 46 F.3d 138, 144 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>United Elec., Radio and Mach. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant Street Corp.,</i> 960 F.2d 1080, 1089 (1st Cir.1992)). With respect to the \"Gestalt factors,\" we have observed that,</p>\n<blockquote>In constitutional terms, the jurisdictional inquiry is not a mechanical exercise. The Court has long insisted that concepts of reasonableness must inform a properly performed minimum contacts analysis. This means that, even where purposefully generated contacts exist, courts must consider a panoply of other factors which bear upon the fairness of subjecting a nonresident to the authority of a foreign tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Ticketmaster-New York,</i> 26 F.3d at 209 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Gestalt factors that a court will consider include: \"(1) the defendant's burden of appearing, (2) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy, and (5) the common interests of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> In applying these standards, the district court held:</p>\n<blockquote>The Quebec Superior Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff did not contravene traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Plaintiff had several contacts with Quebec. All the orders, communications, payments, correspondence and dealings between Parties occurred through Defendant's Montreal office. Moreover, Parties agreed to create a product showroom at Defendant's Montreal office, which was ultimately constructed. The purpose of this showroom was to display Plaintiff's products to potential customers and sales agents from Canada and New England.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 416 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, as we have noted in our earlier discussion of the Québec jurisdictional statute, the affidavits supplied by the parties were in conflict. Evans, through the affidavits of Mr. Trexler, maintains that there were various contracts for the purchase of the allegedly defective material, that they were all entered into by Evans at its Georgia plant and that Evans did no business in Québec. It further claims that it had no agreement with Kitchen International with respect to a showroom in Montreal and therefore, at least implicitly, denies any connection between such a showroom and its contracts to supply the allegedly defective goods. Mark Trexler further stated in his affidavit that, in his position as CEO of Evans, he had personal knowledge of Evans's contractual relationships and that he was unaware of any agreement with Kitchen International to develop or construct a showroom. Janet Shiell, one of the principals of Kitchen International, by contrast, stated in her affidavit that there was an agreement with Evans to create a showroom, and she produced paperwork purportedly related to that agreement (but no document embodying the agreement itself). Furthermore, she stated in a rebuttal affidavit that there was no reason for Trexler to know about the agreement because she (and others at Kitchen International) had dealings only with Gatti,<sup>[17]</sup> another employee of Evans. Kitchen International never makes clear the exact relationship between the alleged joint venture to create a showroom and the agreements to sell the allegedly defective material.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if such an argument had been made successfully,<sup>[19]</sup> the district court's analysis of jurisdiction still is deficient. Absent from the district court's analysis is any discussion of the \"Gestalt factors,\" which, we have made clear, a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*148</span> court must consider to determine the fairness of subjecting the defendant to a foreign jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Because the district court resolved material issues of fact against Evans, the nonmoving party, the judgment must be reversed. The controverted issues of fact that Evans has raised must be resolved. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>REVERSED and REMANDED</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Statutory Appendix</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 235, § 23A</h2>\n<blockquote>Except as hereinafter provided, any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*149</span> and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal shall be conclusive between the parties to the extent that it grants or denies recovery of a sum of money.

Evans is a Georgia corporation with its principal place of business in Dublin, Georgia. Kitchen International is a Louisiana corporation with its principal place of business in Montreal, Québec.</p>\n<p>[2]  This court has jurisdiction over the final decision of the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p>[3]  The record does not include a copy of this contract or any information about the circumstances surrounding its formation.</p>\n<p>[4]  Massachusetts's version of the Recognition Act is codified at Massachusetts General Laws chapter 235, § 23A. The statute is reprinted in the attached appendix.</p>\n<p>[5]  Evans notes that, in determining the jurisdiction of the Québec court, the district court did not employ any of the methodologies set out in <i>Boit v. Gar-Tec Products, Inc.,</i> 967 F.2d 671, 674-78 (1st Cir.1992). <i>See also </i><i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada,</i> 46 F.3d 138, 144-49 (1st Cir.1995). We agree with Evans that the district court correctly proceeded in this regard. The approaches set forth in <i>Foster-Miller</i> and in <i>Boit</i> are designed to assist the district court in investigating the basis of its own jurisdiction in the suit before it. They are designed to reconcile the sometimes competing interests of fairness to the parties and considerations of judicial economy that often arise in that context.\n</p>\n<p>Here, the jurisdictional issue is raised in a very different context. Kitchen International's motion to dismiss the Massachusetts action did not attempt simply to bar the prosecution of the current action in Massachusetts on the ground that the district court lacked authority to adjudicate Evans's present contract claim there. Rather, it was a motion addressed to the <i>merits</i> of the Massachusetts action. It sought a ruling that Evans was precluded from obtaining the substantive relief that it sought in the Massachusetts action because an earlier judgment obtained in another court precluded any further litigation of the matter. As part of that assertion, Kitchen International submits that the earlier judgment was rendered by a court that had personal jurisdiction over the defendant in that action, Evans. Evans takes the opposite view. This is a merits dispute properly analyzed at this stage of the proceedings by conventional summary judgment analysis.</p>\n<p>[6]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sarl Louis Feraud Int'l v.

Guyot,</i> 159 U.S. 113, 16 S.Ct. 139, 40 L.Ed. 95 (1895). When a federal court is asked to recognize and enforce a foreign country judgment in an action where the court's subject matter jurisdiction is based not on diversity, but on 28 U.S.C. § 1331 or some other source of federal jurisdiction, the federal rule of recognition and enforcement would govern. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gordon &amp; Breach Sci. Publishers S.A. v. Am. Inst. of Physics,</i> 905 F.Supp. 169, 178-79 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (applying the federal rule in a Lanham Act case). <i>See generally</i> Brand, <i>supra,</i> at 262 n. 32 (discussing non-diversity cases applying federal rules).</p>\n<p>According to <i>Hilton,</i> a diversity case from the pre-<i>Erie</i> era, foreign judgments shall be recognized so long as the rendering court afforded an opportunity for full and fair proceedings; the court was of competent jurisdiction over the persons and subject matter; the court conducted regular proceedings, which afforded due notice of appearance to adversary parties; and the court afforded a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice between the citizens of its own country and those of other countries. <i>See</i> 159 U.S. at 202-03, 16 S.Ct. 139. The <i>Hilton</i> rule also requires reciprocity in the recognition and enforcement of United States judgments from the jurisdiction of the rendering court. <i>Id.</i> at 210, 226-27, 16 S.Ct. 139.</p>\n<p>[8]  The parties do not question that the Recognition Act applies not only to enforcement actions but also to the recognition of the foreign judgments to preclude further litigation. <i>See</i> 18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 4473 n. 7 (\"The inclusion of at least the core of claim preclusion in Section 3 [of the Recognition Act] is noted [by commentators].\"); <i>see also</i> Brand, <i>supra,</i> at 265-66 &amp; n. 43 (\"`Whether a foreign judgment should be recognized, may be in issue, however, not only in enforcement . . . but in other contexts, for example where the defendant seeks to rely on a prior adjudication of a controversy (res judicata).'\" (quoting Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law § 481 cmt. b (1986))). Of course, in the case of recognition to preclude further litigation, once the foreign judgment is deemed entitled to recognition under the Recognition Act, the extent of the foreign judgment's preclusive effect still must be determined. <i>See generally</i> Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws § 98 cmt. g (rev. 1988). In this case, we need not address that issue because Evans has waived any argument that the Québec judgment is entitled to less res judicata effect than what the district court gave it. <i>See infra</i> note 18.</p>\n<p>[9]  See the statutory ix to this opinion.</p>\n<p>[10]  Some states have concluded that the relevant question is only whether personal jurisdiction would have been present had the rendering court applied the law of the enforcing state. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Genujo Lok Beteiligungs GmbH v. Zorn,</i> 943 A.2d 573, 580 (Me.2008) (looking only to whether the foreign jurisdiction could have established personal jurisdiction under Maine law); <i>Sung Hwan Co. v. Rite Aid Corp.,</i> 7 N.Y.3d 78, 817 N.Y.S.2d 600, 850 N.E.2d 647, 650-51 (2006) (interpreting the term \"personal jurisdiction\" as used in an analogous New York statute to mean \"whether exercise of jurisdiction by the foreign court comports with New York's concept of personal jurisdiction\" and omitting any analysis of foreign law).\n</p>\n<p>Other state courts instead have concluded that the proper interpretation is to ascertain first whether the rendering court could exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant under its own laws. They then look to whether the rendering court could have exercised personal jurisdiction under the law of the forum state. The purpose of this second step is to ensure that the rendering court not only possessed jurisdiction at the time of judgment but also that the rendering court's procedures comported with United States due process standards. Under this approach, both of these requirements are necessary for a rendering court to have personal jurisdiction over the defendant within the meaning of the Recognition Act. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Monks Own, Ltd. v. Monastery of Christ in the Desert,</i> 142 N.M. 549, 168 P.3d 121, 124-27 (2007) (adopting the approach of first ascertaining whether personal jurisdiction was satisfied under the law of the rendering foreign jurisdiction and then determining whether the judgment debtor's applicable contacts with the rendering jurisdiction satisfy the United States constitutional due process minimum); <i>Vrozos v. Sarantopoulos,</i> 195 Ill.App.3d 610, 142 Ill.Dec. 352, 552 N.E.2d 1093, 1099-1100 (1990) (reviewing a trial court decision concluding that a Canadian court had personal jurisdiction over the judgment debtor pursuant to United States principles of due process and remanding for consideration of whether the Canadian court also had personal jurisdiction pursuant to Canadian law of service of summons). Federal courts applying analogous state recognition acts also have adopted this approach. <i>See K &amp; R Robinson Enters. Ltd. v. Asian Exp. Material Supply Co.,</i> 178 F.R.D. 332, 339-42 (D.Mass.1998). <i>See generally </i><i>Royal Bank of Canada v. Trentham Corp.,</i> 491 F.Supp. 404, 408-10 (S.D.Tex. 1980), <i>vacated </i><i>by,</i> 665 F.2d 515 (5th Cir.1981). The American Law Institute adopts this approach in its model federal statute on the recognition of foreign money judgments. <i>See</i> American Law Institute, <i>Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments: Analysis and Proposed Federal Statute</i> § 3 &amp; cmt. c (2006).</p>\n<p>[11]  In <i>Manches &amp; Co. v. Gilbey,</i> 419 Mass. 414, 646 N.E.2d 86 (1995), the Supreme Judicial Court decided that an English default judgment was worthy of recognition in Massachusetts. It reviewed the English judgment employing the criteria stated in the Massachusetts version of the Recognition Act. However the court did not rule on the question of whether the actual exercise of jurisdiction by the English court ought to be measured solely by the law of England or Massachusetts or both.</p>\n<p>[12]  The Superior Court of Québec is the court of general trial jurisdiction in the Province of Québec. <i>See</i> F. Pearl Eliadis &amp; France Allard, <i>The Legal System in Quebec, in</i> Gerald Gall, <i>The Canadian Legal System</i> 277 (5th ed.2004).</p>\n<p>[13]  Other provisions of the code, however, would have been invoked more appropriately. See the statutory ix to this opinion.</p>\n<p>[14]  Read in context, it is clear that Evans makes this statement in reference to the district court's reading of Article 3136. However, there is no indication that Evans disagrees with that reading or that it believes that Article 3136 is limited to the extraordinary circumstance when there is no other viable forum.</p>\n<p>[15]  See the statutory ix to this opinion.</p>\n<p>[16]  The district court understood Kitchen International to be arguing that Evans had a specifically affiliating nexus with Québec. <i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 415. Kitchen International does not dispute that understanding on appeal, and, indeed, argues the case on that basis. Appellee's Br. 13.</p>\n<p>[17]  Who Paul Gatti is, and what his position is/was at Evans, never was explained by either party in their submissions.</p>\n<p>[18]  If the district court were to find that there was no connection between the alleged agreement to establish a showroom in Montreal and the agreements to supply the allegedly defective material, Kitchen International's argument for maintaining that the Québec court had jurisdiction over the contracts to supply the allegedly defective material would be weakened substantially. <i>See </i><i>Lyle Richards Int'l v. Ashworth, Inc.,</i> 132 F.3d 111, 114 (1st Cir.1997) (discussing application of the \"arising from\" clause in the Commonwealth's long-arm statute).</p>\n<p>[19]  Absent the \"showroom evidence,\" Evans's contacts with Canada are limited to its contractual relationship with Kitchen International for the supply of cabinetry to various business sites in the United States. In <i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,</i> 471 U.S. 462, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985), the Court explained the \"purposeful availment\" requirement as it applies to a contractual relationship. It stated:\n</p>\n<p>This purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts, or of the unilateral activity of another party or a third person. Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a substantial connection with the forum State. Thus where the defendant deliberately has engaged in significant activities within a State, or has created continuing obligations between himself and residents of the forum, he manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are shielded by the benefits and protections of the forum's laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well.</p>\n<p>Jurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically enter the forum State. Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant's affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which business is conducted. So long as a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed toward residents of another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 475-76, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (internal quotation marks, citations and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>Burger King,</i> although the defendant had no physical ties to the state of Florida, the Court determined nonetheless that he had established the necessary minimum contacts with that state to be hauled into court there. It noted that, in determining that there was a want of jurisdiction, the appellate court had \"overlook[ed] substantial record evidence indicating that Rudzewicz most certainly knew that he was affiliating himself with an enterprise based primarily in Florida.\" <i>Id.</i> at 480, 105 S.Ct. 2174. It stated:</p>\n<p>The contract documents themselves emphasize that Burger King's operations are conducted and supervised from the Miami headquarters, that all relevant notices and payments must be sent there, and that the agreements were made in and enforced from Miami. Moreover, the parties' actual course of dealing repeatedly confirmed that decisionmaking authority was vested in the Miami headquarters and that the district office served largely as an intermediate link between the headquarters and the franchisees. When problems arose over building design, site-development fees, rent computation, and the defaulted payments, Rudzewicz and MacShara learned that the Michigan office was powerless to resolve their disputes and could only channel their communications to Miami. Throughout these disputes, the Miami headquarters and the Michigan franchisees carried on a continuous course of direct communications by mail and by telephone, and it was the Miami headquarters that made the key negotiating decisions out of which the instant litigation arose.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 480-81, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[20]  Evans did not argue, until the reply brief, that, even if the district court correctly had analyzed the jurisdictional issue, it nevertheless erred in holding that its (Evans's) claims were barred by res judicata because the claim before the district court is different from the claim or cause of action before the Québec court. Because this argument was not raised in its opening brief, it is waived. <i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[B]ecause the argument was not made to the district court or in appellant's opening brief, surfacing only in his reply brief, it has been waived.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

Fallman, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and RIPPLE,<sup>[*]</sup> Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>RIPPLE, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Evans Cabinet Corporation (\"Evans\") instituted this diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Kitchen International, Inc. for breach of contract and quantum meruit.<sup>[1]</sup> Kitchen International filed a motion to dismiss based on res judicata. It claimed that the action was foreclosed because of an earlier judgment entered by the Superior Court of Québec. After a hearing on the motion to dismiss, the district court determined that the arguments went beyond the pleadings. After allowing limited discovery and converting the motion to one for summary judgment, the court entered judgment for Kitchen International. Evans filed a timely appeal to this court.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>According to the allegations of the complaint, Kitchen International and Evans entered into a contract in 2004.<sup>[3]</sup> Evans agreed to supply Kitchen International with manufactured cabinetry for several residential construction sites on the East Coast of the United States. Kitchen International placed these orders from its headquarters in Montreal with the Georgia <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> offices of Evans. The materials were shipped directly to the construction sites.</p>\n<p>According to Kitchen International, in 2004, the two parties also agreed that they would create a products showroom at Kitchen International's office in Montreal. Kitchen International claims that Paul Gatti of Evans approved the design and layout of the showroom. According to Kitchen International, later that year, Evans manufactured and shipped cabinetry, related products and sales and promotional materials to Québec for use in the showroom. Evans denies the existence of such an agreement; it claims that it never authorized Kitchen International to build a showroom and that it did not supply products to Kitchen International for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Various issues arose about the quality and conformity of the products that Evans had shipped to the East Coast projects. Consequently, in May 2006, Kitchen International engaged a Canadian attorney to file suit against Evans in the Superior Court of Québec for breach of contract arising from the materials supplied by Evans. Evans was served with process and given notice of this proceeding. Evans did not answer or otherwise respond to the action, and, consequently, on May 31, 2007, the Superior Court of Québec entered a default judgment against Evans in the amount of $149,354.74.</p>\n<p>On April 23, 2007, Evans instituted this action for breach of contract and quantum meruit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Kitchen International filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the action was barred by res judicata by virtue of the Canadian judgment against Evans. Evans opposed the motion on the ground that the Superior Court of Québec had lacked jurisdiction over it, and, therefore, the Québec judgment could not be recognized by the district court.</p>\n<p>During a hearing on Kitchen International's motion to dismiss, the district court realized that the issues being argued went beyond the pleadings. It therefore stated that the motion should be converted to one for summary judgment and allowed the parties ninety days to conduct limited discovery on the issue of the Superior Court of Québec's jurisdiction over Evans. On March 4, 2008, the district court resumed the hearing. The only additional documents supplied by either party were affidavits from their principals. On November 4, 2008, the district court converted Kitchen International's motion to a motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. The court first determined that, because it was sitting in diversity, it should apply Massachusetts's version of the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (\"Recognition Act\") to determine whether it should enforce the Québec judgment.<sup>[4]</sup> In order to enforce a judgment under the Recognition Act, the court continued, the Québec court must have been able to exercise personal jurisdiction over Evans.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of its analysis, the district court observed that \"jurisdictions have split over whether to apply the personal jurisdiction law of the rendering country, the forum state, or both.\" <i>Evans Cabinet Corp. v. Kitchen Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2270890\"><a href=\"/opinion/2270890/evans-cabinet-corp-v-kitchen-intern-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 414 (D.Mass.2008). Because the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had not chosen between these views, the district court decided that it would scrutinize the jurisdiction of the Québec court under both the law of Québec and the law of Massachusetts. Turning <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> first to the law of Québec, the district court noted that Kitchen International had attached the affidavit of its Canadian attorney to establish that Québec's exercise of jurisdiction was appropriate. The district court determined that the affidavit clearly established that Kitchen International had the right to institute a lawsuit in Québec. However, it found the affidavit deficient on the issue of \"whether the Quebec Superior Court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over [Evans] pursuant to article 3136 of the Civil Code of Quebec.\" <i>Id.</i> at 415. It noted, however, that the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had determined that the Québec court could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the contract at issue had been \"`concluded in Quebec <i>or</i> if the cause of action arose in Quebec.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Saxony Carpet Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1670117\"><a href=\"/opinion/1670117/canadian-imperial-bank-v-saxony-carpet-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span>, 1253 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (emphasis in original)). Based on that authority, the district court concluded that the Superior Court of Québec properly had exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans pursuant to the law of Québec.</p>\n<p>The district court then turned to the law of Massachusetts. The court first noted that Massachusetts courts had interpreted the Commonwealth's long-arm statute \"as an assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court then held:</p>\n<blockquote>The Quebec Superior Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff did not contravene traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Plaintiff had several contacts with Quebec. All the orders, communications, payments, correspondence and dealings between [the] Parties occurred through Defendant's Montreal office. Moreover, Parties agreed to create a product showroom at Defendant's Montreal office, which was ultimately constructed. The purpose of this showroom was to display Plaintiff's products to potential customers and sales agents from Canada and New England. Because under either Quebec or Massachusetts law the Quebec Superior Court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff, Plaintiff's argument that the Quebec default judgment is not conclusive fails.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 416 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The court then turned to the question of whether Evans's claims were barred by the Québec judgment. The district court determined that, although Massachusetts supplies the applicable res judicata law, \"a Massachusetts court must give a prior judgment the same finality it would receive in the rendering jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 417. Consequently, the court employed Québec rules of res judicata to determine whether the default judgment should be given preclusive effect. <i>Id.</i> (citing Québec civil code and a Supreme Court of Canada decision). The court then concluded that Evans's suit was barred by these rules:</p>\n<blockquote>Here, the Quebec default judgment precludes the relitigation of Plaintiff's claim. Because a default judgment is a final judgment under the Recognition Act, the Quebec default judgment qualifies for res judicata treatment. First, this action involves the same cause of actionbreach of contractas the Quebec proceeding. Second, as both Parties stipulated in open court, this action involves the same construction projects as were at issue in the Quebec proceeding. Third, the parties to this action were the same parties to the Quebec proceeding, with the only difference being that Plaintiff here was the defendant in Quebec.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> The district court, therefore, held that res judicata precluded the present action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> and entered summary judgment for Kitchen International.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Contentions of the Parties</h2>\n<p>Evans submits that the district court erred in holding that its claim for damages for breach of contract or in quantum meruit were barred because of the prior default judgment entered against it by the Superior Court of Québec. In Evans's view, the Superior Court of Québec lacked personal jurisdiction over it, and, consequently, the default judgment was unenforceable and not subject to recognition by the district court. Noting that the district court applied a summary judgment standard in determining whether the Québec court properly exercised jurisdiction, Evans submits that there are significant unresolved factual questions concerning the nature of Evans's relevant contacts with the Province of Québec. Evans contends that, if the district court had taken the facts in the light most favorable to its position, as the district court must do in the context of summary judgment, there would be no basis for concluding that the Québec court could exercise personal jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p>Kitchen International takes a decidedly different view. It submits that the Québec judgment must be recognized and precludes the present suit. Focusing on the summary judgment motion, it notes that the district court characterized its evidence that Evans had purposeful contacts with Québec as \"overwhelming.\" <i>See </i><i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 416. By contrast, Evans submitted only the affidavits of Mark Trexler, Evans's CEO, who, in Kitchen International's view, could show no involvement in the parties' agreements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Threshold Matters</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a grant of summary judgment. Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In assessing the merits of such a motion, the court must consider the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and must indulge in all inferences favorable to that party. <i>Kunelius v. Town of Stow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204106\"><a href=\"/opinion/204106/kunelius-v-town-of-stow/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir.2009). We also must keep in mind, however, that the role of summary judgment is to \"pierce the pleadings\" and to determine whether there is a genuine need for trial. <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.1990). The moving party must \"put the ball in play\" by averring the absence of any genuine issue of fact. <i>Id.</i> at 48. Once the ball is in play, however, the non-moving party must come forward with competent evidence to rebut the assertion of the moving party. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Celotex Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span> (1986)).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>When sitting in diversity and asked to recognize and enforce a foreign country judgment, federal courts tend to apply the law of recognition and enforcement of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> state in which they sit, as required by <i>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103012\"><a href=\"/opinion/103012/erie-r-co-v-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></span> (1938).<sup>[6]</sup> However, some courts and commentators have suggested that recognition and enforcement of foreign country judgments deserves application of a uniform federal body of law because suits of this nature necessarily implicate the foreign relations of the United States.<sup>[7]</sup> This question has not been decided definitively in this circuit. In <i>John Sanderson (Wool) Pty. Ltd. v. Ludlow Jute Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"352553\"><a href=\"/opinion/352553/john-sanderson-co-wool-pty-ltd-v-ludlow-jute-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span>, 697 n. 1 (1st Cir.1978), we left the question open, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> noting that there was no reason to decide the matter under the facts of that case because there was no appreciable difference between the federal and the state rules. We shall follow the same course in this case because we need not resolve the matter here. Neither party has suggested that the district court ought to have followed a rule other than that of Massachusetts. In any event, even if the reciprocity rule of <i>Hilton v. Guyot</i> were applicable under the facts of this case, the Massachusetts rule of recognition and enforcement also contains a reciprocity requirement. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 235, § 235A (subsection (7) of third paragraph); <i>see also </i><i>John Sanderson,</i> 569 F.2d at 697.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Massachusetts Law on the Recognition of Foreign Country Judgments</h2>\n<p>With respect to the recognition of foreign <i>country</i> judgments, Massachusetts, like many other states of the Union, has enacted a version of the Recognition Act.<sup>[8]</sup> The Massachusetts version of that Act is codified at Massachusetts General Laws chapter 235 § 23A.<sup>[9]</sup> This section clearly requires that the <i>rendering</i> court have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in order for the resulting judgment to be recognized in Massachusetts. The statute does not state explicitly, however, whether the correctness of that exercise of jurisdiction by the rendering court ought to be determined according to the law of the rendering or the enforcing jurisdiction. The district court suggested that there is currently a division of authority on this question among the states that have enacted a form of the Recognition Act.<sup>[10]</sup> The district court also noted that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> yet spoken squarely on the matter.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court, faced with the ambiguity about the prevailing rule in Massachusetts with respect to the law governing personal jurisdiction in the rendering court, explicitly declined to resolve the matter and instead applied the governing rule of both jurisdictions. On appeal, neither party has contended that the district court erred in this regard. Nor has either party argued that Massachusetts would apply any other rule. Under these circumstances, we must conclude that the parties have waived any reliance on another rule and that we must decide this case by assessing the facts in light of the personal jurisdiction law of both the Province of Québec and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Québec under the Law of Québec</h2>\n<p>We turn, then, to the question of whether Kitchen International established that the Superior Court of Québec properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans.<sup>[12]</sup> In the district court, Kitchen International <span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> submitted the affidavit of a Canadian attorney and argued that the Québec court properly exercised jurisdiction under Article 3136 of the Québec Civil Code. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote>Even though a Québec authority has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may hear it, if the dispute has a sufficient connection with Québec, where proceedings cannot possibly be instituted outside Québec or where the institution of such proceedings outside Québec cannot reasonably be required.</blockquote>\n<p>Civil Code of Québec, R.S.Q., ch. 64, art. 3136. From an examination of the record in its entirety, it does not appear that Kitchen International relied upon any other particular provision of the Code. Moreover, the opinion of the district court appears to have interpreted Kitchen International's position as relying entirely on this provision. The district court took the view, albeit in conclusory fashion, that this provision applied because \"`the contract [at issue] was concluded in Quebec <i>or</i> [] the cause of action arose in Quebec.'\" <i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 415 (quoting <i>Canadian Imperial Bank,</i> 899 F.Supp. at 1253 (emphasis and first alteration in original)).</p>\n<p>There are two problems with this analysis. First, the Québec provision relied upon by Kitchen International, Article 3136, is clearly a provision that permits Québec courts to assume personal jurisdiction over parties in exceptional cases when there is no other available jurisdiction to which the parties may litigate their dispute. <i>See </i><i>GreCon Dimter, Inc. v. J.R. Normand, Inc.,</i> [2005] <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></span> para 33.<sup>[13]</sup> Such a situation is clearly not the case here. The litigants are American corporations which are amenable to suit in the state of their corporate domicile and, with respect to particular transactions, in the states where they have the requisite minimum contacts with the other party and with the transaction at issue in the lawsuit. Because there obviously are other forums quite able to assume jurisdiction over the parties, we must conclude that Kitchen International has not carried its burden of establishing that this provision can serve as an adequate basis for jurisdiction over Evans in the courts of that province. <i>Cf. Bouchard v. Ventes de Vehicules Mitsubishi du Canada Inc.,</i> [2008] Q.J. No. 13487, 2008 QCCS 6033 para. 22 (holding that the statute does not apply because \"all Respondents are domiciled in countries with sophisticated court systems which apply the rule of law\"). The second infirmity with the district court's reliance on Article 3136 is that <i>Canadian Imperial Bank</i> does not indicate that the parties in that case, or the district court in that case, were relying on this provision of Québec law. Nor does <i>Canadian Imperial Bank</i> identify what provision of Québec law the court believed supported an exercise of personal jurisdiction in that case. 899 F.Supp. at 1253. Thus, simply invoking <i>Canadian Imperial Bank</i> does not prove that the Superior Court of Québec properly exercised personal jurisdiction over Evans pursuant to Québec law.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, we normally would have little difficulty in concluding that Kitchen International had not met its burden of establishing that the Québec court had personal jurisdiction over Evans on the basis of Article 3136 and, moreover, that Kitchen International had waived reliance on any other provision of Québec law by its failure to raise any other provision in the district court. However, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> several considerations make a determination of waiver inappropriate under the circumstances of this case. First, although relying on the wrong section of the Code, the district court indicated to the parties that it believed Québec's Code authorized jurisdiction if the contract had been made in Québec or if the cause of action had arisen there. Additionally, Evans, far from relying on a waiver on the part of Kitchen International, explicitly admits in its brief before this court that the Québec court could have had jurisdiction if the contract had been concluded in Québec or if the cause of action arose in Québec. Appellant's Br. 16 (citing <i>Canadian Imperial Bank</i>).<sup>[14]</sup> Under these circumstances, we must conclude that Kitchen International may be able to demonstrate that the Québec court was authorized to exercise jurisdiction <i>if</i> it can demonstrate that a contractual relationship was established with Evans in Québec or that there was a breach of that agreement in Québec or that one of the obligations arising from the contract was to be performed in the Province. A provision of the Civil Code of Québec authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction on these bases. <i>See</i> Civil Code of Québec, R.S.Q., ch. 64, art. 3148.<sup>[15]</sup> Under that provision, a Québec court can exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant if, inter alia, \"a fault was committed in Québec, damage was suffered in Québec, an injurious act occurred in Québec or one of the obligations arising from a contract was to be performed in Québec.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Relying on the affidavit of Ms. Shiell, an officer and owner of Kitchen International, the district court took the view that the authority of Québec to exercise jurisdiction over Evans had been established because all of the \"`orders, communications, payments, correspondence and dealings'\" between the parties had taken place through Kitchen International's Montreal office. <i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 416 (quoting Shiell Aff. at 3). The district court also concluded that the parties had agreed to create a product showroom to display Evans's products to potential customers and sales agents from New England and Canada. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>An examination of the record makes clear, however, that the district court's factual conclusions were not undisputed. Through the affidavit and supplemental affidavit of its CEO, Mark Trexler, Evans disputed that it had accepted in Québec any contractual obligation with Kitchen International or had engaged, through its representatives, in any business in Québec. Indeed, it denied the existence of any agreement with Kitchen International other than various agreements to sell the allegedly defective material. Evans denied, explicitly, any joint venture to establish a showroom in Montreal. Indeed, none of the affidavits make explicit the precise relationship between the alleged showroom and the specific sales of allegedly defective products by Evans. Under these circumstances, it is clear that genuine issues of fact remain to be resolved before the authority of Québec to exercise personal jurisdiction over Evans can be established.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Application of Massachusetts Standards to the Superior Court of Québec's Exercise of Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>At the outset, we pause to emphasize that the parties do not dispute that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> district court had personal jurisdiction over them in this case. Here we review its determination of whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the Superior Court of Québec comported with Massachusetts and federal standards.</p>\n<p>The exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant such as Evans is governed by the Commonwealth's long-arm statute insofar as the exercise of jurisdiction also comports with the requirements of the federal Due Process Clause. <i>Caplan v. Donovan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span>, 120 (2008); <i>see also </i><i>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 204 (1st Cir.1994). The Massachusetts long-arm statute permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction when a person has transacted business within the Commonwealth or when the person has contracted to supply services or things within the Commonwealth. This conferral of jurisdiction creates a specifically affiliating jurisdictional nexus;<sup>[16]</sup> the personal jurisdiction conferred is only with respect to litigation <i>arising out of</i> the transaction within the Commonwealth, not with respect to the defendant's transactions that did not take place in the Commonwealth. Here, \"[w]e may sidestep the statutory inquiry and proceed directly to the constitutional analysis . . . because the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted the state's long-arm statute as an assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.\" <i>Daynard v.

Second, the defendant's in-state contacts must represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state's laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable. Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195899\"><a href=\"/opinion/195899/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 144 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>United Elec., Radio and Mach. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant Street Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580868\"><a href=\"/opinion/580868/united-electrical-radio-and-machine-workers-of-america-v-163-pleasant/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1080</span></a></span>, 1089 (1st Cir.1992)). With respect to the \"Gestalt factors,\" we have observed that,</p>\n<blockquote>In constitutional terms, the jurisdictional inquiry is not a mechanical exercise. The Court has long insisted that concepts of reasonableness must inform a properly performed minimum contacts analysis. This means that, even where purposefully generated contacts exist, courts must consider a panoply of other factors which bear upon the fairness of subjecting a nonresident to the authority of a foreign tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Ticketmaster-New York,</i> 26 F.3d at 209 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Gestalt factors that a court will consider include: \"(1) the defendant's burden of appearing, (2) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy, and (5) the common interests of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> In applying these standards, the district court held:</p>\n<blockquote>The Quebec Superior Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over Plaintiff did not contravene traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Plaintiff had several contacts with Quebec. All the orders, communications, payments, correspondence and dealings between Parties occurred through Defendant's Montreal office. Moreover, Parties agreed to create a product showroom at Defendant's Montreal office, which was ultimately constructed. The purpose of this showroom was to display Plaintiff's products to potential customers and sales agents from Canada and New England.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 416 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, as we have noted in our earlier discussion of the Québec jurisdictional statute, the affidavits supplied by the parties were in conflict. Evans, through the affidavits of Mr. Trexler, maintains that there were various contracts for the purchase of the allegedly defective material, that they were all entered into by Evans at its Georgia plant and that Evans did no business in Québec. It further claims that it had no agreement with Kitchen International with respect to a showroom in Montreal and therefore, at least implicitly, denies any connection between such a showroom and its contracts to supply the allegedly defective goods. Mark Trexler further stated in his affidavit that, in his position as CEO of Evans, he had personal knowledge of Evans's contractual relationships and that he was unaware of any agreement with Kitchen International to develop or construct a showroom. Janet Shiell, one of the principals of Kitchen International, by contrast, stated in her affidavit that there was an agreement with Evans to create a showroom, and she produced paperwork purportedly related to that agreement (but no document embodying the agreement itself). Furthermore, she stated in a rebuttal affidavit that there was no reason for Trexler to know about the agreement because she (and others at Kitchen International) had dealings only with Gatti,<sup>[17]</sup> another employee of Evans. Kitchen International never makes clear the exact relationship between the alleged joint venture to create a showroom and the agreements to sell the allegedly defective material.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if such an argument had been made successfully,<sup>[19]</sup> the district court's analysis of jurisdiction still is deficient. Absent from the district court's analysis is any discussion of the \"Gestalt factors,\" which, we have made clear, a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*148</span> court must consider to determine the fairness of subjecting the defendant to a foreign jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Because the district court resolved material issues of fact against Evans, the nonmoving party, the judgment must be reversed. The controverted issues of fact that Evans has raised must be resolved. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>REVERSED and REMANDED</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Statutory Appendix</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 235, § 23A</h2>\n<blockquote>Except as hereinafter provided, any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*149</span> and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal shall be conclusive between the parties to the extent that it grants or denies recovery of a sum of money.

Evans is a Georgia corporation with its principal place of business in Dublin, Georgia. Kitchen International is a Louisiana corporation with its principal place of business in Montreal, Québec.</p>\n<p>[2]  This court has jurisdiction over the final decision of the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p>[3]  The record does not include a copy of this contract or any information about the circumstances surrounding its formation.</p>\n<p>[4]  Massachusetts's version of the Recognition Act is codified at Massachusetts General Laws chapter 235, § 23A. The statute is reprinted in the attached appendix.</p>\n<p>[5]  Evans notes that, in determining the jurisdiction of the Québec court, the district court did not employ any of the methodologies set out in <i>Boit v. Gar-Tec Products, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 674-78 (1st Cir.1992). <i>See also </i><i>Foster-Miller, Inc. v.

We agree with Evans that the district court correctly proceeded in this regard. The approaches set forth in <i>Foster-Miller</i> and in <i>Boit</i> are designed to assist the district court in investigating the basis of its own jurisdiction in the suit before it. They are designed to reconcile the sometimes competing interests of fairness to the parties and considerations of judicial economy that often arise in that context.\n</p>\n<p>Here, the jurisdictional issue is raised in a very different context. Kitchen International's motion to dismiss the Massachusetts action did not attempt simply to bar the prosecution of the current action in Massachusetts on the ground that the district court lacked authority to adjudicate Evans's present contract claim there. Rather, it was a motion addressed to the <i>merits</i> of the Massachusetts action. It sought a ruling that Evans was precluded from obtaining the substantive relief that it sought in the Massachusetts action because an earlier judgment obtained in another court precluded any further litigation of the matter. As part of that assertion, Kitchen International submits that the earlier judgment was rendered by a court that had personal jurisdiction over the defendant in that action, Evans. Evans takes the opposite view. This is a merits dispute properly analyzed at this stage of the proceedings by conventional summary judgment analysis.</p>\n<p>[6]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sarl Louis Feraud Int'l v.

When a federal court is asked to recognize and enforce a foreign country judgment in an action where the court's subject matter jurisdiction is based not on diversity, but on 28 U.S.C. § 1331 or some other source of federal jurisdiction, the federal rule of recognition and enforcement would govern. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gordon &amp; Breach Sci.

Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 4473 n. 7 (\"The inclusion of at least the core of claim preclusion in Section 3 [of the Recognition Act] is noted [by commentators].\"); <i>see also</i> Brand, <i>supra,</i> at 265-66 &amp; n. 43 (\"`Whether a foreign judgment should be recognized, may be in issue, however, not only in enforcement . . . but in other contexts, for example where the defendant seeks to rely on a prior adjudication of a controversy (res judicata).'\" (quoting Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law § 481 cmt. b (1986))). Of course, in the case of recognition to preclude further litigation, once the foreign judgment is deemed entitled to recognition under the Recognition Act, the extent of the foreign judgment's preclusive effect still must be determined. <i>See generally</i> Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws § 98 cmt. g (rev. 1988). In this case, we need not address that issue because Evans has waived any argument that the Québec judgment is entitled to less res judicata effect than what the district court gave it. <i>See infra</i> note 18.</p>\n<p>[9]  See the statutory ix to this opinion.</p>\n<p>[10]  Some states have concluded that the relevant question is only whether personal jurisdiction would have been present had the rendering court applied the law of the enforcing state. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Genujo Lok Beteiligungs GmbH v.

They then look to whether the rendering court could have exercised personal jurisdiction under the law of the forum state. The purpose of this second step is to ensure that the rendering court not only possessed jurisdiction at the time of judgment but also that the rendering court's procedures comported with United States due process standards. Under this approach, both of these requirements are necessary for a rendering court to have personal jurisdiction over the defendant within the meaning of the Recognition Act. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Monks Own, Ltd. v.

See the statutory ix to this opinion.</p>\n<p>[14]  Read in context, it is clear that Evans makes this statement in reference to the district court's reading of Article 3136. However, there is no indication that Evans disagrees with that reading or that it believes that Article 3136 is limited to the extraordinary circumstance when there is no other viable forum.</p>\n<p>[15]  See the statutory ix to this opinion.</p>\n<p>[16]  The district court understood Kitchen International to be arguing that Evans had a specifically affiliating nexus with Québec. <i>Evans Cabinet,</i> 584 F.Supp.2d at 415. Kitchen International does not dispute that understanding on appeal, and, indeed, argues the case on that basis. Appellee's Br. 13.</p>\n<p>[17]  Who Paul Gatti is, and what his position is/was at Evans, never was explained by either party in their submissions.</p>\n<p>[18]  If the district court were to find that there was no connection between the alleged agreement to establish a showroom in Montreal and the agreements to supply the allegedly defective material, Kitchen International's argument for maintaining that the Québec court had jurisdiction over the contracts to supply the allegedly defective material would be weakened substantially. <i>See </i><i>Lyle Richards Int'l v. Ashworth, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197705\"><a href=\"/opinion/197705/lyle-richards-v-ashworth-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 114 (1st Cir.1997) (discussing application of the \"arising from\" clause in the Commonwealth's long-arm statute).</p>\n<p>[19]  Absent the \"showroom evidence,\" Evans's contacts with Canada are limited to its contractual relationship with Kitchen International for the supply of cabinetry to various business sites in the United States. In <i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2174</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span> (1985), the Court explained the \"purposeful availment\" requirement as it applies to a contractual relationship. It stated:\n</p>\n<p>This purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts, or of the unilateral activity of another party or a third person. Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a substantial connection with the forum State. Thus where the defendant deliberately has engaged in significant activities within a State, or has created continuing obligations between himself and residents of the forum, he manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are shielded by the benefits and protections of the forum's laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well.</p>\n<p>Jurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically enter the forum State. Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant's affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which business is conducted. So long as a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed toward residents of another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 475-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2174</span></a></span> (internal quotation marks, citations and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>Burger King,</i> although the defendant had no physical ties to the state of Florida, the Court determined nonetheless that he had established the necessary minimum contacts with that state to be hauled into court there. It noted that, in determining that there was a want of jurisdiction, the appellate court had \"overlook[ed] substantial record evidence indicating that Rudzewicz most certainly knew that he was affiliating himself with an enterprise based primarily in Florida.\" <i>Id.</i> at 480, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2174</span></a></span>. It stated:</p>\n<p>The contract documents themselves emphasize that Burger King's operations are conducted and supervised from the Miami headquarters, that all relevant notices and payments must be sent there, and that the agreements were made in and enforced from Miami. Moreover, the parties' actual course of dealing repeatedly confirmed that decisionmaking authority was vested in the Miami headquarters and that the district office served largely as an intermediate link between the headquarters and the franchisees. When problems arose over building design, site-development fees, rent computation, and the defaulted payments, Rudzewicz and MacShara learned that the Michigan office was powerless to resolve their disputes and could only channel their communications to Miami. Throughout these disputes, the Miami headquarters and the Michigan franchisees carried on a continuous course of direct communications by mail and by telephone, and it was the Miami headquarters that made the key negotiating decisions out of which the instant litigation arose.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 480-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2174</span></a></span> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[20]  Evans did not argue, until the reply brief, that, even if the district court correctly had analyzed the jurisdictional issue, it nevertheless erred in holding that its (Evans's) claims were barred by res judicata because the claim before the district court is different from the claim or cause of action before the Québec court. Because this argument was not raised in its opening brief, it is waived. <i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542293\"><a href=\"/opinion/542293/richard-l-sandstrom-etc-v-chemlawn-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[B]ecause the argument was not made to the district court or in appellant's opening brief, surfacing only in his reply brief, it has been waived.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
