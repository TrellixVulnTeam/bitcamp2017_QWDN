Plaintiff-appellant Mayra Rosario\n\nappeals a district court order granting summary judgment to the\n\nPuerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (\"PRASA\"), Professional\n\nServices Group (\"PSG\"), José Iván Colón, Benjamin Pomales, Perfecto\n\nOcasio and José Nieves on her employment discrimination claims.\n\nThe gravamen of Rosario's complaint was that she was subjected to\n\na hostile work environment because of her religion in violation of\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, and Puerto Rico law.         The district court determined\n\nthat Rosario presented neither viable nor timely Title VII and §\n\n1983 claims, and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n\nover the Commonwealth law claims. We agree and accordingly affirm.\n\n                               I.   Background\n\n              We recount the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nRosario.      Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. v. Travelers Cos., 127 F.3d 136,\n\n137 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              PRASA, a Puerto Rico water utility, hired Rosario in\n\n1979.   Her first few years at PRASA were auspicious:            she competed\n\nfor,    and   was   awarded,   several     promotions   within    the   budget\n\ndepartment, rising from Budget Technician I to Budget Analyst III.\n\nEarly into her tenure at PRASA, Rosario became an adherent of\n\ncharismatic Catholicism, a revival movement within the Catholic\n\nchurch whose members practice an \"intense\" form of Catholicism. As\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fa charismatic Catholic, Rosario's spirituality permeated her life,\n\nincluding her work.\n\n          During her first few years at PRASA, Rosario's workplace\n\nenvironment was \"calm,\" but her \"interior peace\" was disturbed when\n\nLydia Feliciano, and later José Antonio Rivera Bauzó, joined her\n\ndepartment.    Rosario   believed    that    her   tense   relations   with\n\nFeliciano and Rivera stemmed from her outwardly religious outlook\n\nand high expectation of others.        According to Rosario, her co-\n\nworkers discussed religion interminably, criticizing the Catholic\n\nchurch and, in turn, Rosario for her ardent religiosity.\n\n          In   this   environment,   Colón    became   Rosario's   direct\n\nsupervisor in 1992.      Rosario contended that Colón treated her\n\nunfairly: he failed to assign her work, criticized her performance,\n\ndenied her vacation time, did not offer her computer training, and\n\nchanged the lock of the door to the office without giving her a new\n\nkey.   Rosario complained to Colón that her co-workers' conduct\n\noffended her religious beliefs but he failed to pursue the matter.\n\n          According to Rosario, Feliciano was one of the main\n\nactors contributing to the hostile work environment in the budget\n\noffice.   Feliciano persistently offended Rosario's belief system.\n\nShe was tenaciously vulgar, using expletives (some of which were\n\ndirected at Rosario) regularly. When Rosario complained, Feliciano\n\nnicknamed her \"Mother Theresa.\"        Rosario also took fault with\n\nFeliciano's lax work ethic. She recorded in a notebook Feliciano's\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fviolations     of    PRASA's    regulations.      Rosario       believed    that\n\nFeliciano, uncomfortable with Rosario's discipline and religiosity,\n\nmistreated her.\n\n             Rivera also partook in the persistent provocation of\n\nRosario.     Rosario cites several unrelated incidents to make this\n\npoint:     Rivera pounded his fist on her desk yelling at her to get\n\nto work on several occasions, made absurd gestures at her, and\n\nconstantly    directed    inappropriate      comments    towards    her.      On\n\nRosario's birthday, for instance, Rivera gave her a card with a pig\n\nwearing a rosary with her birth date emblazoned at the top.                Rivera\n\nalso directed verbal taunts at Rosario including, \"You've got to\n\nabuse women and hit them hard\"; \"I am going to smack your face\n\nopen\"; and \"You pass your time buying pornographic movies, and\n\nlater you're climbing the walls.\"          Rivera would make such comments\n\nto Rosario in the presence of their co-workers.\n\n             Rosario believed that Colón and her co-workers wanted her\n\ntransferred     to    another    department    because     of    her   fervent\n\nCatholicism.     Indeed, Colón wrote a memorandum to the subdirector\n\nof finance in 1994 requesting Rosario's transfer to another office.\n\nRosario points to the fact that Colón had no good grounds for\n\nseeking that transfer.\n\n             In September 1995, PSG took over PRASA's administrative\n\nand maintenance responsibilities.           Several months later, in May\n\n1996, Colón met with the budget specialists and advised them that\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fone budget specialist would be placed within the jurisdiction of\n\nPSG   because   of   the   administrative    shuffle   caused   by   the   PSG\n\ncontract.    In July 1996, Rosario received a letter notifying her\n\nthat, although she would continue in her present position, she was\n\nthereafter under the supervision of PSG personnel.              Despite this\n\npersonnel change, Rosario remained in the same office with the same\n\nposition.\n\n            In August 1996, Rosario filed an administrative appeal of\n\nher transfer to PSG on the ground that she had seniority over\n\nemployees who were not transferred.         Rosario subsequently met with\n\nPRASA's executive director, Benjamin Pomales, and he assured her\n\nthat, for all practical purposes, PSG was the same as PRASA.\n\nPomales also stated that Colón had informed him that Rosario did\n\nnot have any work to do in her old position.\n\n            Rosario did not believe that her grievances were resolved\n\nfollowing her meeting with Pomales.         Eventually, on September 19,\n\n1997, she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission(\"EEOC\") and the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and\n\nHuman Resources.      Rosario did not make the EEOC complaint part of\n\nthe record, and so the scope of the complaint is not evidence.             The\n\nEEOC issued a right-to-sue letter on June 5, 1998.\n\n            Meanwhile, in March 1998, Rosario received a letter from\n\nJosé Nieves, PRASA's interim human resources manager, informing her\n\nthat she was going to be relocated to another floor.                   After\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fobjecting to this transfer to Nieves, Rosario was moved to a\n\nsmaller office in the finance area.           Along with this physical\n\ntransition, Rosario assumed the temporary position of \"interim\n\nsupervisor\" for the reimbursement area.        Her immediate supervisor\n\nwas   Elizabeth   Romero.   In    the    initial    period   following   her\n\ntransfer, Romero failed to assign Rosario work despite Rosario's\n\nrepeated requests for assignments.        Although she finally received\n\nwork in September 1998, she had neither work nor a computer one\n\nyear later. Rosario claims that she has suffered severe depression\n\nand anxiety because of the harassment at PRASA.\n\n           On September 2, 1998, Rosario commenced this action pro\n\nse pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e\n\net seq., and Commonwealth law, asserting claims for discrimination\n\nin the workplace against PRASA.     Rosario was still employed by PSG\n\nwhen she filed this action.         Prior to serving the complaint,\n\nRosario retained counsel and, on December 29, 1998, amended her\n\ncomplaint to add as defendants PSG, Colón, Pomales, Ocasio and\n\nNieves, and to add claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.            Rosario sought\n\ndamages, a declaratory judgment and an injunction reinstating her\n\nto her former position with PRASA.         Rosario subsequently amended\n\nthe complaint again, charging defendants with religious harassment\n\nand   discriminatory   transfer    under    Title    VII,    and   an   Equal\n\nProtection violation under § 1983.         The religious discrimination\n\ntheory advanced was that the defendants had engaged in a scheme of\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f\"spiritual harassment\" through mockery, vulgar language, and other\n\noffensive      conduct      contrary    to    \"normally     acknowledged        civil\n\nparameters.\"         Such    harassment,     Rosario    contended,         caused    her\n\nprofound mental and moral anguish. She sought damages collectively\n\nexceeding three million dollars to compensate her for her emotional\n\ndistress.\n\n              After the defendants unsuccessfully moved to dismiss,\n\nPSG, and subsequently PRASA and its officers, sought summary\n\njudgment on the grounds that Rosario had not made out a prima facie\n\nclaim under Title VII, and that some of the conduct in question was\n\ntime-barred.     PRASA also challenged Rosario's § 1983 claim on the\n\nground that Rosario had failed to establish that the discrimination\n\nwas pursuant to its custom or policy.                  City of Canton, Ohio v.\n\nHarris, 489 U.S. 378, 389 (1989).\n\n              In two memoranda and orders, the district court granted\n\nthe defendants' motions and ordered Rosario to show cause why her\n\n§ 1983 claim against PSG should not be disposed of on the same\n\nground   as    her   claim    against   PRASA     (based    on   her       failure   to\n\nestablish that a PSG custom or policy violated her constitutional\n\nrights).      The crux of the court's rulings was that there was no\n\ncredible allegation that the charged conduct was motivated by\n\nreligious discrimination. The court stated that the outcome of the\n\ncase   might    be   different     if   Rosario    had     brought     a    sex-based\n\ndiscrimination claim as \"Rivera's comments would be strong evidence\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fto support such a claim.\" The court concluded that Rosario's claim\n\nbased on the July 1996 transfer was time-barred because Rosario,\n\naware of this adverse employment action, had a duty to contest it\n\nwithin the statutorily prescribed period.\n\n            Rosario subsequently moved for reconsideration of the\n\ncourt's order.    She also sought to introduce a claim for sex-based\n\ndiscrimination.    The district court denied the motion and, upon\n\nreceipt of Rosario's response to the show cause order, awarded\n\nsummary judgment to PSG on Rosario's § 1983 claim.                The court\n\nfurther dismissed without prejudice Rosario's Commonwealth law\n\nclaims.   This appeal followed.\n\n                            II.    Discussion\n\n            Rosario argues that there is sufficient record evidence\n\nto support a claim of religious discrimination under Title VII and\n\n§ 1983.   See Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners Local\n\nNo. 33, 921 F.2d 396, 399 (1st Cir. 1990)(\"[O]ur review will be\n\nmost searching in cases, such as this, that turn upon the issue of\n\nmotive or intent.\").    The thrust of her argument, as we understand\n\nit, is that she raised a genuine issue of material fact that she\n\nwas subject to constant harassment in her workplace if not because\n\nof religion then because of her values and upright lifestyle (which\n\nshe maintains is a product of her religion).            Such a proffer,\n\naccording   to   Rosario,   lays   the   necessary   foundation    for   her\n\nreligious discrimination claims under either statute.\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f              Rosario also argues that her claims arising from her July\n\n1996    and   March   1998   transfers   are   not   barred   on   statute   of\n\nlimitations and exhaustion grounds because they were part of a\n\ncontinuing violation. See O'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d\n\n713, 730 (1st Cir. 2001) (describing the continuing violation\n\ndoctrine as an \"equitable exception that allows an employee to seek\n\ndamages for otherwise time-barred allegations if they are deemed\n\npart of an ongoing series of discriminatory acts...\").               Finally,\n\nRosario challenges the district court's refusal to entertain new\n\nevidence and her sexual harassment claim after the entry of partial\n\nsummary judgment.      We first address whether Rosario's claims based\n\non her two transfers are procedurally barred under Title VII, and\n\nthen turn to the substance of her remaining arguments.\n\nA.     The Discriminatory Transfer Claims Under Title VII\n\n              Under Title VII, a plaintiff in a deferral jurisdiction\n\nsuch as Puerto Rico must file a charge with the EEOC within 300\n\ndays after \"the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)(2000).        Rosario filed her charge with the\n\nEEOC on September 19, 1997, more than 300 days after the July 1996\n\ntransfer.      Rosario argues that her Title VII claim based on this\n\ntransfer is nonetheless timely under the \"continuing violation\n\ndoctrine,\" which would allow her to recover for the July 1996\n\ntransfer notwithstanding the limitations period if the transfer is\n\nsufficiently related to acts alleged in a timely charge.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          The \"continuing violation doctrine\" does not preserve\n\nRosario's claim.     The Supreme Court has recently elaborated on the\n\nmeaning of the term \"continuing violation,\" holding that a discrete\n\ndiscriminatory act transpires only at the time it takes place, even\n\nif it was related to acts that were timely filed.           National R.R.\n\nPassenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 2073\n\n(2002).   \"Each discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for\n\nfiling charges alleging that act.        The charge, therefore, must be\n\nfiled within the 180- or 300-day time period after the discrete\n\ndiscriminatory act occurred.\"         Morgan, 122 S.Ct. at 2072.       The\n\nCourt made plain that \"[d]iscrete acts such as termination, failure\n\nto promote, denial of transfer or refusal to hire... constitute[]\n\na separate actionable unlawful employment practice.\"          Id. at 2073\n\n(emphasis added).      The July 1996 transfer is therefore a time-\n\nbarred discrete act. See id.; see also Miller v. N.H. Dep't of\n\nCorr., 296 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The    March   1998   transfer    is   also   a   discrete   act\n\nconstituting    \"a   separate   and   actionable   unlawful    employment\n\npractice.\" Morgan, 122 S.Ct. at 2073.       Yet Morgan does not address\n\nwhether a previously filed EEOC complaint must be amended to\n\nencompass subsequent discrete acts in order to render such acts\n\nsusceptible to judicial review.          We have held that a judicial\n\ncomplaint can encompass discrete acts of retaliation \"reasonably\n\nrelated and grow[ing] out of the discrimination complained of to\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe agency...\"     Clockedile v. N.H. Dep't of Corr., 245 F.3d 1, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).    But in Clockedile we declined to decide whether\n\na judicial complaint also may encompass non-retaliatory but related\n\ndiscrete acts which took place after the discrimination described\n\nin the charge if the plaintiff failed to amend her charge or to\n\nfile a new one detailing the new acts. Id.\n\n            We do not need to decide that question here.             The\n\ndefendants articulated a non-discriminatory reason for the transfer\n\n-- the facilitation of the transition to PSG supervision -- and\n\nRosario has not presented any evidence from which a reasonable fact\n\nfinder could conclude that this explanation is a pretext masking\n\nreligious discrimination.      See, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\n\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973).        Thus, even if we assume\n\narguendo that Rosario was not required to first present the agency\n\nwith her allegation that the 1998 transfer was discriminatory,\n\nRosario's discrimination claim under Title VII fails insofar as it\n\nis based on the 1998 transfer.\n\nB.   Title VII and Hostile Work Environment Claims\n\n            Rosario next challenges the district court's award of\n\nsummary judgment on her hostile work environment claim.       The court\n\nconcluded   that   religious   discrimination   was   not   behind   the\n\noffending conduct because the vast majority of incidents did not\n\ncontain any religious overtones and that animus could not be\n\ninferred from the record.      Rosario responds that the question of\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fwhether her overt religious practice was the source of the hostile\n\nenvironment she experienced is a jury issue.               This argument fails.\n\n               To make out a viable workplace harassment claim based on\n\nreligion, the plaintiff must establish that:                  (1) she is a member\n\nof     a    protected    class;      (2)    she   was   subject       to   uninvited\n\nharassment;(3) the offending conduct was because of her religion;\n\n(4) the harassment was severe and pervasive; (5) the offending\n\nconduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive and (where\n\nemployer liability is sought); (6) there was a basis for such\n\nliability.1      O'Rourke,     235   F.3d    at   728   (emphasis     added);   I.B.\n\nLindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 755-56 (3d\n\ned. 1996).      Here, there is no dispute that Rosario was a member of\n\na protected class.         The defendants also admit that Rosario was\n\nsubject to uninvited \"rude and unprofessional\" conduct which we\n\nassume was severe and pervasive.              We thus turn to whether there is\n\na genuine issue of material fact as to whether the alleged hostile\n\nwork       environment   was   because       of   religion.      On    that   score,\n\nregardless of the evidentiary course the plaintiff charts, she must\n\nshow that alleged discriminatory conduct was not \"merely tinged\"\n\n\n\n       1\n        In support of her claim, Rosario recounted a miscellany of\nincidents of discrimination during the preceding decade.       Such\nalleged discriminatory acts may be considered as background\nevidence even if they fall outside the filing period so long as one\nact supporting the claim occurs within the filing period. Morgan,\n122 S.Ct. at 2072. Given the litany of harassing acts alleged, we\nassume arguendo that Rosario satisfies this test.\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fwith remarks abhorrent to her religion but actually was, in either\n\ncharacter or substance, discrimination because of religion. Oncale\n\nv. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998).\n\n           In arguing that she presented sufficient proof of such\n\ncausation, Rosario points to her co-workers' repeated allusions to\n\nreligion and their persistent taunting and portrayal of her as\n\nself-righteous.   She further contends that the supervisors and, by\n\nextension, the employers involved (i.e., Colón, Pomales, Nieves,\n\nOcasio, PSG and PRASA) are liable because they were well aware of\n\nher predicament but failed to prevent the discrimination and\n\nharassment when it was within their power to do so.         Although the\n\nrecord is not clear as to whether and to what extent each employer\n\nknew about the several incidents of which Rosario complains, we\n\nshall assume that Rosario's employers were aware that her co-\n\nworkers had engaged in inappropriate conduct and mistreated her.\n\nWe turn now to the specifics.\n\n           Rosario   first   points   out   that   her   co-workers   were\n\ncritical of her faith and spirituality.        She states that she was\n\ngiven the nickname \"Mother Theresa\" by Feliciano, who was a co-\n\nworker with less seniority (and not her supervisor).          The record\n\nmakes clear, however, that the nickname was a response to Rosario's\n\nscolding of Feliciano for her constant vulgarity.         Rosario did not\n\nappreciate Feliciano's profanity and she regularly let Feliciano\n\nknow it.   But the evidence simply does not permit an inference that\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fthe tense    relations   between   the    two   was   caused   by   religious\n\ndiscrimination on the part of Feliciano.\n\n            Rosario next complains about a bawdy Christmas carol\n\nmentioning her name and sung to her by Rivera (again a co-worker\n\nwith less seniority).    Rosario asserts that the lyrics of the song\n\nare offensive to her, given her deep religious convictions.             We do\n\nnot doubt this is so.    But the question is not whether a religious\n\nperson could find the song offensive; it is whether religious\n\nanimus prompted Rivera to sing it to her.         And as with the \"Mother\n\nTheresa\" remark, the record does not permit an affirmative response\n\nto this question.     The song was characteristic of the office's\n\nvulgar and unprofessional environment -- an environment to which\n\nall were subjected.      But there is a conceptual gap between an\n\nenvironment that is offensive to a person of strong religious\n\nsensibilities and an environment that is offensive because of\n\nhostility to the religion guiding those sensibilities. Rosario has\n\nnot provided us with evidence or argument sufficient to bridge that\n\ngap.2\n\n\n        2\n       Of course, conduct need not be explicitly religious to\nconstitute harassment because of religion. Where there is evidence\nof overtly discriminatory conduct, a court may also consider acts\nthat, on their face, do not support a claim for discriminatory\nworkplace harassment. O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 729. In context, we\nhave held that subversion, exclusion, and denial of support can be\nfactors supporting a hostile work environment claim. Id. at 730.\nOur inquiry focuses on whether the offending conduct was\ndiscriminatory in form or function.\n     Rosario cites a patchwork of incidents spanning the latter\npart of her career at PRASA to buttress her Title VII claim. The\n\n                                   -15-\n\f              Finally, Rosario complains of a birthday card given to\n\nher by Rivera that depicted a pig wearing a rosary next to her birth\n\ndate.3       We certainly appreciate why Rosario was upset by the\n\nconnection made between her and the pig.      Rivera relished being\n\nprovocative and successfully egged Rosario on.     This is Rosario's\n\nstrongest evidence of religion-based discrimination, but it is also\n\nevidence equally susceptible of a non-discriminatory intent. As she\n\ntestified, people in her office took it as a joke, and she remained\n\ntranquil and viewed it as making fun of her.      While a jury could\n\nresolve the issue of intent in her favor, this single incident is\n\ninsufficient to support the edifice of her harassment claims and\n\ninsufficient by itself to be actionable. There is also no testimony\n\n\n\n\ncore of her argument is that her co-workers pointedly attempted to\noffend her by swearing and making sacrilegious comments in her\npresence. Feliciano, in particular, swore constantly and otherwise\nengaged in lewd and discourteous conduct notwithstanding Rosario's\ncomplaints. Rivera, for his part, targeted Rosario with offensive\ntaunts and aggressive conduct ostensibly meant to intimidate her.\nHe stated on more than one occasion that \"you had to smack women\";\nhe also accused her of \"running around with men,\" attending gay\nparades and clogging her toilet. The offending conduct, according\nto Rosario, was not limited to her co-workers. Her supervisor,\nColón, not only failed to quell these outbursts, but he also gave\nher no work, denied her vacation requests, and requested her\ntransfer to another office.      But Rosario must demonstrate a\ntrialworthy issue as to whether this conduct was because of her\nreligion, and she has not done so.\n         3\n       The defendants state that the rosary had nothing to do with\nreligion but rather was derivative of \"Rosario.\" For the purposes\nof summary judgment, we will assume arguendo that the rosary had\nreligious connotations.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fby Rosario that she brought this incident to the attention of\n\nmanagement.\n\n             The summary judgment record shows that the budget office\n\nat PRASA was an unprofessional environment.           The workers frequently\n\nswore, engaged in horseplay, and were derelict in their work duties.\n\nAnd, as Rosario points out, she was different.             Rosario attributes\n\nthat difference to her religious beliefs.4             There is no evidence\n\nabout whether there were other deeply religious people in the office\n\nand how they were treated.         Rosario's beliefs apparently motivated\n\nher to act in certain ways. Rosario was not averse to proselytizing\n\nand opining that her way was the right way.            She would often chide\n\nher co-workers for their obscene language and poor work habits, and\n\nfrequently      documented     their   infractions   of    PRASA   regulations.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this course of conduct provoked them and they\n\nresponded in ways apparently meant to offend her.                  Such antics,\n\nwhile deplorable, do not amount to a violation of Title VII.                 Cf.\n\nWilson v. U.S. West Communications, 58 F.3d 1337, 1342 (8th Cir.\n\n1995) (noting that \"Title VII does not require an employer to allow\n\nan   employee    to   impose    his    religious   views   on   others.\").    A\n\nconstellation of factors led to the friction between Rosario and her\n\n\n\n      4\n       We note that neither the Constitution nor Title VII\nprohibits honest disagreement about religion in the workplace.\nLindemann & Grossman, supra at 248 (noting that commentators and\nCongress criticized the EEOC's proposed harassment guidelines on\nreligion because they could be interpreted as proscribing employees\nfrom discussing religion in the workplace).\n\n                                        -17-\n\fco-workers, but no reasonable fact finder could conclude on the\n\nbasis of the incidents we have described or the general atmosphere\n\nin the office that one of these factors was an antipathy towards\n\nRosario's underlying religious convictions.5\n\nC.    Section 1983\n\n            Rosario next challenges the district court's dismissal of\n\nher § 1983 claim.    Relying on the two discriminatory transfer and\n\nthe hostile work environment claims she used in support of her Title\n\nVII    claim,   Rosario   posits   that   PSG   and   PRASA   are   liable\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that, in a § 1983 action, liability does\n\nnot attach pursuant to a respondeat superior theory.6         According to\n\nRosario, both entities are liable here because they engaged in a\n\npolicy and pattern of discrimination by failing to prevent the\n\nhostile work environment and by promoting it (e.g., by transferring\n\nher to another office with an interim position without any duties).\n\n\n       5\n       Because this ground is dispositive of Rosario's Title VII\nclaim, we need not address the remaining factors constituting a\nworkplace harassment claim. See supra at 13. Similarly, we do not\nhave to reach the district court's alternative holding that there\nis no individual liability under Title VII. See Serapion v.\nMartinez, 119 F.3d 982, 992 (1st Cir. 1997)(declining to \"enter\nth[e] thicket\" of determining whether individual liability exists\nunder Title VII).\n       6\n       The parties do not dispute that both PSG and PRASA fall\nwithin the definition of municipality under Monell v. Department of\nSocial Services of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 690-695 (1978)\n(negating respondeat superior liability of municipalities under §\n1983 for violations of federal civil rights).\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fRosario further contends, without any meaningful elaboration, that\n\nthe \"deliberate indifference\" of the various supervisors at PRASA\n\n(Colón, Nieves, Pomales and Ocasio) to her plight gives rise to an\n\nactionable equal protection violation.               These arguments fail.\n\n           We agree with the district court that any claims against\n\nPSG and PRASA must fail because there is no evidence of any policy\n\nor custom that could warrant municipal liability.                    This holding\n\napplies   with    equal     force     to    her   claims   for     injunctive    and\n\ndeclaratory      relief   as    \"the       Supreme   Court,   in    imposing     the\n\nprecondition of an unconstitutional official municipal policy, was\n\ndirectly addressing monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief.\"\n\nDirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't, 315 F.3d 65, 71 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(citing   Monell,     436      U.S.    at    690)(internal       quotation     marks\n\nomitted)(emphasis in original).\n\n           Rosario's claim against the individual officers also\n\nfails. When a plaintiff attempts to use § 1983 as a parallel remedy\n\nto a Title VII claim, the prima facie                   elements to establish\n\nliability are the same under both statutes.7               Lipsett v. Univ. of\n\nPuerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 898 (1st Cir. 1988); Morris v. Oldham\n\n\n     7\n        A   plaintiff   may   assert   a   concomitant   employment\ndiscrimination Title VII and § 1983 claim. Alexander v. Gardner-\nDenver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 48-49 (1974) (\"The clear inference is that\nTitle VII was designed to supplement rather than supplant, existing\nlaws and institutions relating to employment discrimination.\")\nHarassment of an employee because of her faith, whatever guise it\nassumes, may constitute religious discrimination under the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                       -19-\n\fCounty Fiscal Court, 201 F.3d 784, 794 (6th Cir. 2000); Jemmott v.\n\nCoughlin, 85 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir. 1996) (noting that courts commonly\n\napply Title VII law when analyzing § 1983 equal protection claims).\n\nIn either case, \"the plaintiff must prove that the defendant[s]\n\nacted with discriminatory intent.\"            Richardson v. Leeds Police\n\nDep't, 71 F.3d 801, 805 (11th Cir. 1995).              The inadequacy of\n\nRosario's Title VII claim establishes the inadequacy of her § 1983\n\nclaim.\n\nD.   Motion for Reconsideration\n\n           In her motion for reconsideration, Rosario attempted to\n\nintroduce new evidence and raise an additional claim of sex-based\n\ndiscrimination.      The district court rejected Rosario's requests,\n\nciting her failure to introduce certain audio recordings and raise\n\nthe sex-discrimination claim until after the entry of summary\n\njudgment. Rosario contends that district court erred in so holding.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n           We review a district court's denial of a motion under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) for abuse of discretion.          Once a motion for\n\nsummary   judgment    has   been   allowed,    \"the   district   court   has\n\nsubstantial discretion in deciding whether to reopen the proceedings\n\nin order to allow the unsuccessful party to introduce new material\n\nor argue a new theory.\" Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273,\n\n1279 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f             There was no error in the court's decision here to\n\ndisregard    the    audio     recordings     Rosario    first       introduced   in\n\nconnection with her motion for reconsideration.                   Rosario suggests\n\nthat she was not at fault for her evidentiary tardiness:                    she did\n\nnot present the audio recordings during the summary judgment stage\n\n(or   earlier)     because   she   needed    to   obtain    better     copies    and\n\ntranscripts and the court refused to grant her more time to do so.\n\nIn effect, Rosario admits that the evidence she offered for the\n\nfirst time in her motion for reconsideration was neither new nor\n\nunavailable at the summary judgment stage.                   As a result, the\n\ndistrict court was not obliged to consider it after the entry of\n\nsummary judgment.        E.g., Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (it is not an abuse of discretion for a district\n\ncourt to deny a motion for reconsideration where the supporting\n\nevidence was \"neither new nor unavailable at the time the district\n\ncourt entered judgment...\").\n\n             Rosario next argues that, as the district court itself\n\nacknowledged in its opinions, the record might have supported a\n\nclaim   of   sex-based      discrimination    even     if   not    raised   in   the\n\ncomplaint. The thrust of her argument, as we understand it, is that\n\npleadings should be construed \"to do substantial justice.\"                  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 8(f).      Rosario concedes that she failed to explicitly plead\n\na gender-based discrimination claim.          She posits, however, that her\n\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fallegation of a hostile work environment embraced the full spectrum\n\nof discriminatory conduct, including discrimination based on sex.\n\n            We   see   no   reason    to     disturb     the   district    court's\n\njudgment.   Plaintiffs should not resort to Rule 59(e) motions to\n\n\"raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before\n\njudgment issued.\"      FDIC v. World Univ., 978 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (quoting Harley-Davidson Motor Co., Inc. v. Bank of New\n\nEngland, 897 F.2d 611, 616 (1st Cir. 1990)).              Rosario endeavored to\n\nmake out a new legal argument in her motion for reconsideration\n\nwithout any explanation as to why she had not done so earlier.\n\nUnder   these    circumstances,      it    would   not   promote   \"substantial\n\njustice\" to allow Rosario to raise a new legal claim.                     Landrau-\n\nRomero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (explaining that a Rule 59(e) motion is inappropriate absent\n\na showing of a manifest error of law or newly discovered evidence).\n\n                             III.     Conclusion\n\n            Rosario has failed to produce sufficient evidence to\n\nwithstand a motion for summary judgment on her employment\n\ndiscrimination claims.      We therefore affirm the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\f",

Travelers Cos., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197586\"><a href=\"/opinion/197586/preferred-v-the-travelers/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n137 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              PRASA, a Puerto Rico water utility, hired Rosario in\n\n1979.   Her first few years at PRASA were auspicious:            she competed\n\nfor,    and   was   awarded,   several     promotions   within    the   budget\n\ndepartment, rising from Budget Technician I to Budget Analyst III.\n\nEarly into her tenure at PRASA, Rosario became an adherent of\n\ncharismatic Catholicism, a revival movement within the Catholic\n\nchurch whose members practice an \"intense\" form of Catholicism. As\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fa charismatic Catholic, Rosario's spirituality permeated her life,\n\nincluding her work.\n\n          During her first few years at PRASA, Rosario's workplace\n\nenvironment was \"calm,\" but her \"interior peace\" was disturbed when\n\nLydia Feliciano, and later José Antonio Rivera Bauzó, joined her\n\ndepartment.    Rosario   believed    that    her   tense   relations   with\n\nFeliciano and Rivera stemmed from her outwardly religious outlook\n\nand high expectation of others.        According to Rosario, her co-\n\nworkers discussed religion interminably, criticizing the Catholic\n\nchurch and, in turn, Rosario for her ardent religiosity.\n\n          In   this   environment,   Colón    became   Rosario's   direct\n\nsupervisor in 1992.      Rosario contended that Colón treated her\n\nunfairly: he failed to assign her work, criticized her performance,\n\ndenied her vacation time, did not offer her computer training, and\n\nchanged the lock of the door to the office without giving her a new\n\nkey.   Rosario complained to Colón that her co-workers' conduct\n\noffended her religious beliefs but he failed to pursue the matter.\n\n          According to Rosario, Feliciano was one of the main\n\nactors contributing to the hostile work environment in the budget\n\noffice.   Feliciano persistently offended Rosario's belief system.\n\nShe was tenaciously vulgar, using expletives (some of which were\n\ndirected at Rosario) regularly. When Rosario complained, Feliciano\n\nnicknamed her \"Mother Theresa.\"        Rosario also took fault with\n\nFeliciano's lax work ethic. She recorded in a notebook Feliciano's\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fviolations     of    PRASA's    regulations.      Rosario       believed    that\n\nFeliciano, uncomfortable with Rosario's discipline and religiosity,\n\nmistreated her.\n\n             Rivera also partook in the persistent provocation of\n\nRosario.     Rosario cites several unrelated incidents to make this\n\npoint:     Rivera pounded his fist on her desk yelling at her to get\n\nto work on several occasions, made absurd gestures at her, and\n\nconstantly    directed    inappropriate      comments    towards    her.      On\n\nRosario's birthday, for instance, Rivera gave her a card with a pig\n\nwearing a rosary with her birth date emblazoned at the top.                Rivera\n\nalso directed verbal taunts at Rosario including, \"You've got to\n\nabuse women and hit them hard\"; \"I am going to smack your face\n\nopen\"; and \"You pass your time buying pornographic movies, and\n\nlater you're climbing the walls.\"          Rivera would make such comments\n\nto Rosario in the presence of their co-workers.\n\n             Rosario believed that Colón and her co-workers wanted her\n\ntransferred     to    another    department    because     of    her   fervent\n\nCatholicism.     Indeed, Colón wrote a memorandum to the subdirector\n\nof finance in 1994 requesting Rosario's transfer to another office.\n\nRosario points to the fact that Colón had no good grounds for\n\nseeking that transfer.\n\n             In September 1995, PSG took over PRASA's administrative\n\nand maintenance responsibilities.           Several months later, in May\n\n1996, Colón met with the budget specialists and advised them that\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fone budget specialist would be placed within the jurisdiction of\n\nPSG   because   of   the   administrative    shuffle   caused   by   the   PSG\n\ncontract.    In July 1996, Rosario received a letter notifying her\n\nthat, although she would continue in her present position, she was\n\nthereafter under the supervision of PSG personnel.              Despite this\n\npersonnel change, Rosario remained in the same office with the same\n\nposition.\n\n            In August 1996, Rosario filed an administrative appeal of\n\nher transfer to PSG on the ground that she had seniority over\n\nemployees who were not transferred.         Rosario subsequently met with\n\nPRASA's executive director, Benjamin Pomales, and he assured her\n\nthat, for all practical purposes, PSG was the same as PRASA.\n\nPomales also stated that Colón had informed him that Rosario did\n\nnot have any work to do in her old position.\n\n            Rosario did not believe that her grievances were resolved\n\nfollowing her meeting with Pomales.         Eventually, on September 19,\n\n1997, she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission(\"EEOC\") and the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and\n\nHuman Resources.      Rosario did not make the EEOC complaint part of\n\nthe record, and so the scope of the complaint is not evidence.             The\n\nEEOC issued a right-to-sue letter on June 5, 1998.\n\n            Meanwhile, in March 1998, Rosario received a letter from\n\nJosé Nieves, PRASA's interim human resources manager, informing her\n\nthat she was going to be relocated to another floor.                   After\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fobjecting to this transfer to Nieves, Rosario was moved to a\n\nsmaller office in the finance area.           Along with this physical\n\ntransition, Rosario assumed the temporary position of \"interim\n\nsupervisor\" for the reimbursement area.        Her immediate supervisor\n\nwas   Elizabeth   Romero.   In    the    initial    period   following   her\n\ntransfer, Romero failed to assign Rosario work despite Rosario's\n\nrepeated requests for assignments.        Although she finally received\n\nwork in September 1998, she had neither work nor a computer one\n\nyear later. Rosario claims that she has suffered severe depression\n\nand anxiety because of the harassment at PRASA.\n\n           On September 2, 1998, Rosario commenced this action pro\n\nse pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e\n\net seq., and Commonwealth law, asserting claims for discrimination\n\nin the workplace against PRASA.     Rosario was still employed by PSG\n\nwhen she filed this action.         Prior to serving the complaint,\n\nRosario retained counsel and, on December 29, 1998, amended her\n\ncomplaint to add as defendants PSG, Colón, Pomales, Ocasio and\n\nNieves, and to add claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.            Rosario sought\n\ndamages, a declaratory judgment and an injunction reinstating her\n\nto her former position with PRASA.         Rosario subsequently amended\n\nthe complaint again, charging defendants with religious harassment\n\nand   discriminatory   transfer    under    Title    VII,    and   an   Equal\n\nProtection violation under § 1983.         The religious discrimination\n\ntheory advanced was that the defendants had engaged in a scheme of\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f\"spiritual harassment\" through mockery, vulgar language, and other\n\noffensive      conduct      contrary    to    \"normally     acknowledged        civil\n\nparameters.\"         Such    harassment,     Rosario    contended,         caused    her\n\nprofound mental and moral anguish. She sought damages collectively\n\nexceeding three million dollars to compensate her for her emotional\n\ndistress.\n\n              After the defendants unsuccessfully moved to dismiss,\n\nPSG, and subsequently PRASA and its officers, sought summary\n\njudgment on the grounds that Rosario had not made out a prima facie\n\nclaim under Title VII, and that some of the conduct in question was\n\ntime-barred.     PRASA also challenged Rosario's § 1983 claim on the\n\nground that Rosario had failed to establish that the discrimination\n\nwas pursuant to its custom or policy.

The crux of the court's rulings was that there was no\n\ncredible allegation that the charged conduct was motivated by\n\nreligious discrimination. The court stated that the outcome of the\n\ncase   might    be   different     if   Rosario    had     brought     a    sex-based\n\ndiscrimination claim as \"Rivera's comments would be strong evidence\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fto support such a claim.\" The court concluded that Rosario's claim\n\nbased on the July 1996 transfer was time-barred because Rosario,\n\naware of this adverse employment action, had a duty to contest it\n\nwithin the statutorily prescribed period.\n\n            Rosario subsequently moved for reconsideration of the\n\ncourt's order.    She also sought to introduce a claim for sex-based\n\ndiscrimination.    The district court denied the motion and, upon\n\nreceipt of Rosario's response to the show cause order, awarded\n\nsummary judgment to PSG on Rosario's § 1983 claim.                The court\n\nfurther dismissed without prejudice Rosario's Commonwealth law\n\nclaims.   This appeal followed.\n\n                            II.

Finally,\n\nRosario challenges the district court's refusal to entertain new\n\nevidence and her sexual harassment claim after the entry of partial\n\nsummary judgment.      We first address whether Rosario's claims based\n\non her two transfers are procedurally barred under Title VII, and\n\nthen turn to the substance of her remaining arguments.\n\nA.     The Discriminatory Transfer Claims Under Title VII\n\n              Under Title VII, a plaintiff in a deferral jurisdiction\n\nsuch as Puerto Rico must file a charge with the EEOC within 300\n\ndays after \"the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)(2000).        Rosario filed her charge with the\n\nEEOC on September 19, 1997, more than 300 days after the July 1996\n\ntransfer.      Rosario argues that her Title VII claim based on this\n\ntransfer is nonetheless timely under the \"continuing violation\n\ndoctrine,\" which would allow her to recover for the July 1996\n\ntransfer notwithstanding the limitations period if the transfer is\n\nsufficiently related to acts alleged in a timely charge.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          The \"continuing violation doctrine\" does not preserve\n\nRosario's claim.     The Supreme Court has recently elaborated on the\n\nmeaning of the term \"continuing violation,\" holding that a discrete\n\ndiscriminatory act transpires only at the time it takes place, even\n\nif it was related to acts that were timely filed.

Id.\n\n            We do not need to decide that question here.             The\n\ndefendants articulated a non-discriminatory reason for the transfer\n\n-- the facilitation of the transition to PSG supervision -- and\n\nRosario has not presented any evidence from which a reasonable fact\n\nfinder could conclude that this explanation is a pretext masking\n\nreligious discrimination.      See, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\n\nGreen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802-05 (1973).        Thus, even if we assume\n\narguendo that Rosario was not required to first present the agency\n\nwith her allegation that the 1998 transfer was discriminatory,\n\nRosario's discrimination claim under Title VII fails insofar as it\n\nis based on the 1998 transfer.\n\nB.   Title VII and Hostile Work Environment Claims\n\n            Rosario next challenges the district court's award of\n\nsummary judgment on her hostile work environment claim.       The court\n\nconcluded   that   religious   discrimination   was   not   behind   the\n\noffending conduct because the vast majority of incidents did not\n\ncontain any religious overtones and that animus could not be\n\ninferred from the record.      Rosario responds that the question of\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fwhether her overt religious practice was the source of the hostile\n\nenvironment she experienced is a jury issue.               This argument fails.\n\n               To make out a viable workplace harassment claim based on\n\nreligion, the plaintiff must establish that:                  (1) she is a member\n\nof     a    protected    class;      (2)    she   was   subject       to   uninvited\n\nharassment;(3) the offending conduct was because of her religion;\n\n(4) the harassment was severe and pervasive; (5) the offending\n\nconduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive and (where\n\nemployer liability is sought); (6) there was a basis for such\n\nliability.1      O'Rourke,     235   F.3d    at   728   (emphasis     added);   I.B.\n\nLindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 755-56 (3d\n\ned. 1996).      Here, there is no dispute that Rosario was a member of\n\na protected class.         The defendants also admit that Rosario was\n\nsubject to uninvited \"rude and unprofessional\" conduct which we\n\nassume was severe and pervasive.              We thus turn to whether there is\n\na genuine issue of material fact as to whether the alleged hostile\n\nwork       environment   was   because       of   religion.      On    that   score,\n\nregardless of the evidentiary course the plaintiff charts, she must\n\nshow that alleged discriminatory conduct was not \"merely tinged\"\n\n\n\n       1\n        In support of her claim, Rosario recounted a miscellany of\nincidents of discrimination during the preceding decade.       Such\nalleged discriminatory acts may be considered as background\nevidence even if they fall outside the filing period so long as one\nact supporting the claim occurs within the filing period. Morgan,\n122 S.Ct. at 2072. Given the litany of harassing acts alleged, we\nassume arguendo that Rosario satisfies this test.\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fwith remarks abhorrent to her religion but actually was, in either\n\ncharacter or substance, discrimination because of religion. Oncale\n\nv. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (1998).\n\n           In arguing that she presented sufficient proof of such\n\ncausation, Rosario points to her co-workers' repeated allusions to\n\nreligion and their persistent taunting and portrayal of her as\n\nself-righteous.   She further contends that the supervisors and, by\n\nextension, the employers involved (i.e., Colón, Pomales, Nieves,\n\nOcasio, PSG and PRASA) are liable because they were well aware of\n\nher predicament but failed to prevent the discrimination and\n\nharassment when it was within their power to do so.         Although the\n\nrecord is not clear as to whether and to what extent each employer\n\nknew about the several incidents of which Rosario complains, we\n\nshall assume that Rosario's employers were aware that her co-\n\nworkers had engaged in inappropriate conduct and mistreated her.\n\nWe turn now to the specifics.\n\n           Rosario   first   points   out   that   her   co-workers   were\n\ncritical of her faith and spirituality.        She states that she was\n\ngiven the nickname \"Mother Theresa\" by Feliciano, who was a co-\n\nworker with less seniority (and not her supervisor).          The record\n\nmakes clear, however, that the nickname was a response to Rosario's\n\nscolding of Feliciano for her constant vulgarity.         Rosario did not\n\nappreciate Feliciano's profanity and she regularly let Feliciano\n\nknow it.   But the evidence simply does not permit an inference that\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fthe tense    relations   between   the    two   was   caused   by   religious\n\ndiscrimination on the part of Feliciano.\n\n            Rosario next complains about a bawdy Christmas carol\n\nmentioning her name and sung to her by Rivera (again a co-worker\n\nwith less seniority).    Rosario asserts that the lyrics of the song\n\nare offensive to her, given her deep religious convictions.             We do\n\nnot doubt this is so.    But the question is not whether a religious\n\nperson could find the song offensive; it is whether religious\n\nanimus prompted Rivera to sing it to her.         And as with the \"Mother\n\nTheresa\" remark, the record does not permit an affirmative response\n\nto this question.     The song was characteristic of the office's\n\nvulgar and unprofessional environment -- an environment to which\n\nall were subjected.      But there is a conceptual gap between an\n\nenvironment that is offensive to a person of strong religious\n\nsensibilities and an environment that is offensive because of\n\nhostility to the religion guiding those sensibilities. Rosario has\n\nnot provided us with evidence or argument sufficient to bridge that\n\ngap.2\n\n\n        2\n       Of course, conduct need not be explicitly religious to\nconstitute harassment because of religion. Where there is evidence\nof overtly discriminatory conduct, a court may also consider acts\nthat, on their face, do not support a claim for discriminatory\nworkplace harassment. O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 729. In context, we\nhave held that subversion, exclusion, and denial of support can be\nfactors supporting a hostile work environment claim. Id. at 730.\nOur inquiry focuses on whether the offending conduct was\ndiscriminatory in form or function.\n     Rosario cites a patchwork of incidents spanning the latter\npart of her career at PRASA to buttress her Title VII claim. The\n\n                                   -15-\n\f              Finally, Rosario complains of a birthday card given to\n\nher by Rivera that depicted a pig wearing a rosary next to her birth\n\ndate.3       We certainly appreciate why Rosario was upset by the\n\nconnection made between her and the pig.      Rivera relished being\n\nprovocative and successfully egged Rosario on.     This is Rosario's\n\nstrongest evidence of religion-based discrimination, but it is also\n\nevidence equally susceptible of a non-discriminatory intent. As she\n\ntestified, people in her office took it as a joke, and she remained\n\ntranquil and viewed it as making fun of her.      While a jury could\n\nresolve the issue of intent in her favor, this single incident is\n\ninsufficient to support the edifice of her harassment claims and\n\ninsufficient by itself to be actionable. There is also no testimony\n\n\n\n\ncore of her argument is that her co-workers pointedly attempted to\noffend her by swearing and making sacrilegious comments in her\npresence. Feliciano, in particular, swore constantly and otherwise\nengaged in lewd and discourteous conduct notwithstanding Rosario's\ncomplaints. Rivera, for his part, targeted Rosario with offensive\ntaunts and aggressive conduct ostensibly meant to intimidate her.\nHe stated on more than one occasion that \"you had to smack women\";\nhe also accused her of \"running around with men,\" attending gay\nparades and clogging her toilet. The offending conduct, according\nto Rosario, was not limited to her co-workers. Her supervisor,\nColón, not only failed to quell these outbursts, but he also gave\nher no work, denied her vacation requests, and requested her\ntransfer to another office.      But Rosario must demonstrate a\ntrialworthy issue as to whether this conduct was because of her\nreligion, and she has not done so.\n         3\n       The defendants state that the rosary had nothing to do with\nreligion but rather was derivative of \"Rosario.\" For the purposes\nof summary judgment, we will assume arguendo that the rosary had\nreligious connotations.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fby Rosario that she brought this incident to the attention of\n\nmanagement.\n\n             The summary judgment record shows that the budget office\n\nat PRASA was an unprofessional environment.           The workers frequently\n\nswore, engaged in horseplay, and were derelict in their work duties.\n\nAnd, as Rosario points out, she was different.             Rosario attributes\n\nthat difference to her religious beliefs.4             There is no evidence\n\nabout whether there were other deeply religious people in the office\n\nand how they were treated.         Rosario's beliefs apparently motivated\n\nher to act in certain ways. Rosario was not averse to proselytizing\n\nand opining that her way was the right way.            She would often chide\n\nher co-workers for their obscene language and poor work habits, and\n\nfrequently      documented     their   infractions   of    PRASA   regulations.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this course of conduct provoked them and they\n\nresponded in ways apparently meant to offend her.                  Such antics,\n\nwhile deplorable, do not amount to a violation of Title VII.                 Cf.\n\nWilson v.

Section 1983\n\n            Rosario next challenges the district court's dismissal of\n\nher § 1983 claim.

The inadequacy of\n\nRosario's Title VII claim establishes the inadequacy of her § 1983\n\nclaim.\n\nD.   Motion for Reconsideration\n\n           In her motion for reconsideration, Rosario attempted to\n\nintroduce new evidence and raise an additional claim of sex-based\n\ndiscrimination.      The district court rejected Rosario's requests,\n\nciting her failure to introduce certain audio recordings and raise\n\nthe sex-discrimination claim until after the entry of summary\n\njudgment. Rosario contends that district court erred in so holding.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n           We review a district court's denial of a motion under\n\nFed. R. Civ.

Rosario suggests\n\nthat she was not at fault for her evidentiary tardiness:                    she did\n\nnot present the audio recordings during the summary judgment stage\n\n(or   earlier)     because   she   needed    to   obtain    better     copies    and\n\ntranscripts and the court refused to grant her more time to do so.\n\nIn effect, Rosario admits that the evidence she offered for the\n\nfirst time in her motion for reconsideration was neither new nor\n\nunavailable at the summary judgment stage.                   As a result, the\n\ndistrict court was not obliged to consider it after the entry of\n\nsummary judgment.        E.g., Aybar v.
