REY-HERNÁNDEZ, in his individual capacity; DR.

Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Raúl Barrera-Morales, with whom Hernandez Sanchez Law Firm was\non brief, for appellants.\n     Courtney R. Carroll, with whom Roberto Sanchez Ramos,\nSecretary of Justice, Salvador Antonetti Stutts, Solicitor General,\nEduadro A. Vera Ramirez, Eileen Landrón Guardiola and Landrón Vera,\nLLP were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         October 18, 2007\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       Appellants are four employees of\n\nthe Puerto Rico Department of Education who claim that they were\n\nunconstitutionally   demoted    in    2001   based   on   their   political\n\naffiliation.   They brought this suit against the Department of\n\nEducation and its Secretary, César Rey Hernández (\"Rey\"), a member\n\nof the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\").1       Appellants, all members\n\nof the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), were removed from trust\n\npositions and reassigned to their preexisting career employee\n\nstatus within days after Rey assumed his position following the\n\nPDP's 2000 electoral victory.2       The district court granted summary\n\njudgment for defendants, concluding that appellants failed to offer\n\nsufficient admissible evidence to establish a prima facie case of\n\npolitical discrimination.      Although the record is meager and the\n\ncase is therefore close, we conclude that appellants met their\n\nburden to generate a genuine issue of material fact on the elements\n\nof their claim. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n\n\n     1\n        Appellants filed their action in March 2001 seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and damages under various\nprovisions of federal law, including 42 U.S.C. § 1983, based on\nalleged violations of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe United States Constitution, as well as under the Commonwealth's\nPublic Service Personnel Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 1301-1431\n(2000); id. tit. 31, § 5141 (1990). The Personnel Act was repealed\nin 2004 and replaced by the Public Service Human Resources\nAdministration Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 1461-1468p. We apply\nthe law that was in effect at the time the complaint was filed.\n     2\n       Rey remains a defendant in his individual capacity, but was\nreplaced in his official capacity by the current Secretary, Rafael\nAragunde.\n\f                                I.\n\n          Defendant Rey took over as Secretary of Education at the\n\nbeginning of January 2001.3   Shortly thereafter, he sent letters\n\nnotifying the plaintiffs that, effective January 15, their current\n\ntrust appointments would cease and they would be reinstated to\n\ntheir previous career positions;4 the letters gave no reason for\n\nthe changes.   Before the transfers, plaintiff Ivonne Montfort-\n\nRodríguez (\"Montfort\") was Director of the Center of Investigations\n\nand Ethnographic Innovations, plaintiff Juanita Flores-de-Siaca\n\n(\"Flores\") was Facilitator of the Education Reform Institute for\n\nthe San Juan region, plaintiff Carmen Rivera-Rivera (\"Rivera\") was\n\nDirector of the Puerto Rico Statewide Systemic Initiative for\n\nScience and Mathematics, and plaintiff María Coss-Martínez (\"Coss\")\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       The complaint alleges that Rey was named Secretary of the\nDepartment on or around January 2, 2001.      In her deposition,\nplaintiff Ivonne Montfort-Rodríguez stated that she believed –\nbased on news reports – that his first day at the Department was\nJanuary 8.    Plaintiff María Coss-Martínez also stated in a\ndeposition that Rey \"arrived at the Department on January 8th.\"\n     4\n       Puerto Rico law distinguishes between \"career\" employees and\n\"trust\" or \"confidential\" employees. Career employees \"may only be\nremoved from their positions for just cause and after due filing of\ncharges,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, § 4554(b) (2001). Confidential\nemployees \"shall be of free selection and removal,\" P.R. Laws Ann.\ntit. 3, § 1350 (2000). Under the Personnel Act, \"a career employee\nwho accepts a trust position has an absolute right to be reinstated\nto a career position equal to the last position she held as a\ncareer employee.\" González-de-Blasini v. Family Dep't, 377 F.3d\n81, 84 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §\n1350(a)).\n\n                               -3-\n\fwas Director of the Physical Education Program.   The reassignments\n\nresulted in lower salaries for all four plaintiffs.\n\n          Rey testified in his deposition that when he took over as\n\nSecretary he asked Lizzette Pillich Otero, the newly appointed\n\nAssistant Secretary for Human Resources, to prepare a list of the\n\nDepartment's trust employees so that he would \"have an idea of how\n\nmany trust positions there were.\" Neither Rey nor Pillich examined\n\npersonnel files in compiling the list,5 and Rey testified that he\n\nhad no knowledge of the particular job responsibilities for any\n\nplaintiff.   In his deposition, Rey gave the following explanation\n\nfor generating the list and eliminating positions:\n\n          Positions in the organigram [sic] were\n          evaluated based on the need and based in the\n          necessity.   In fact, we evaluated all the\n          organigram of the whole organization, not just\n          the trust positions, we re-arranged the whole\n          administration.6\n\n          Rey also stated in his deposition that he was unaware of\n\nplaintiffs' political affiliations.   Plaintiffs maintain that he\n\n\n     5\n        Pillich stated in her deposition that she did not see the\nplaintiffs' personnel files until 2002. Another Human Resources\ndeponent, Hilda Cortés Figueroa (\"Cortés\"), testified that she\nconducted a study of trust positions that consisted of identifying\n\"which are the positions, who holds them or held them, and the\nstatus of the position,\" as well as what positions those trust\nemployees held in the career service.\n     6\n       At oral argument, counsel asserted that the Department,\nwhich she said had more than 72,000 employees, was encountering\n\"budgetary problems\" and \"rumors of scandal\" and was an agency \"in\ntrouble.\"   Appellees' brief invokes neither budget issues nor\npossible scandal as a basis for a reorganization, and we likewise\nfound no reference in the record to such concerns.\n\n                                -4-\n\fmust have known their NPP status because their involvement in the\n\nparty was common knowledge throughout the Department and their\n\ntrust       positions      during     the     prior      NPP        administration\n\ncircumstantially        revealed    their    affiliation   with       that   party.\n\nPlaintiffs further assert that they were replaced by members of the\n\nPDP, although that allegation is based partially on hearsay.7\n\n             The defendants' motion for summary judgment was referred\n\nto a magistrate judge, whose Report and Recommendation concluded\n\nthat the plaintiffs' evidence was inadequate to survive defendants'\n\nmotion for summary judgment because some of the facts essential to\n\na finding of political discrimination – that Rey knew plaintiffs'\n\npolitical affiliations and replaced them with members of his own\n\nparty – were supported only by speculation or hearsay.                           The\n\ndistrict court agreed that plaintiffs had not met their burden to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of political discrimination, having\n\nfailed      to   provide    \"admissible      evidence,     either      direct     or\n\ncircumstantial,      of    political    discrimination         on   the   part   of\n\ndefendants.\" Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motion for\n\n\n\n\n        7\n       Each appellant identified her successor, but two of them\noffered only hearsay knowledge of the successor's affiliation with\nthe PDP. Appellant Flores named her replacement as Caribel Rivera\nCasanova and identified Rivera as a member of the PDP. Appellant\nCoss stated in her deposition that she knew that her replacement,\nJorge Colón, is a PDP member.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fsummary judgment and dismissed the case with prejudice.8                      The court\n\nsubsequently denied plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend judgment.9\n\n                                           II.\n\nA. Standard of Review and Burden of Proof\n\n                We review the district court's summary judgment ruling de\n\nnovo, taking the record facts and all inferences to be drawn from\n\nthem in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.                        Aguiar-\n\nCarrasquillo v. Agosto-Alicea, 445 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate when the record reveals no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact, and the undisputed facts establish\n\nthe moving party's entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nFed.       R.   Civ.    P.   56(c).    A   genuine    issue      is   one    that   \"'may\n\nreasonably be resolved in favor of either party' at trial,\" Cordi-\n\nAllen v. Conlon, 494 F.3d 245, 249 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Garside\n\nv.   Osco       Drug,    Inc.,   895   F.2d   46,    48   (1st    Cir.      1990)),   and\n\n\"[s]ummary judgment 'should be granted only where . . . [further]\n\ninquiry into the facts is not desirable to clarify the application\n\n\n       8\n       Defendants asserted a number of other grounds on which they\nclaimed they were entitled to summary judgment, including that\nappellants held positions for which political affiliation was an\nappropriate criterion.    That particular argument has not been\npursued on appeal because the job descriptions necessary to\nevaluate the positions are not in the record. See, e.g., Valdizán\nv. Rivera-Hernandez, 445 F.3d 63, 65-66 (1st Cir. 2006) (examining\njob description to determine whether political compatibility was an\nappropriate qualification). Defendants may, of course, pursue this\naspect of the case on remand if they so desire.\n       9\n      Given our disposition on the summary judgment issue, we need\nnot further consider this ruling.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fof the law,'\" Mandel v. Boston Phoenix, Inc., 456 F.3d 198, 205\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Stevens v. Howard D. Johnson Co., 181 F.2d\n\n390, 394 (4th Cir. 1950)).\n\n            It is well established that \"[g]overnmental employees who\n\nare not in policy-making positions of confidence are shielded from\n\nadverse     employment      decisions     based     on     their   political\n\naffiliations.\"       Borges Colón v. Román-Abreu, 438 F.3d 1, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2006); see also Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S.\n\n62, 64-65 (1990).      Given that defendants do not argue on appeal\n\nthat    plaintiffs   were   policymakers    whose    job   responsibilities\n\nrequire political compatibility with the PDP administration, we\n\nfocus on whether a jury could infer from the evidence that Rey knew\n\nof the plaintiffs' political affiliation and replaced them because\n\nof it.10 See Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina, 491 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (\"To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show that\n\nparty affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind a\n\nchallenged employment action.\"); Vazquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz,\n\n385 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting requirement of \"'sufficient\n\ndirect or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may\n\ninfer that plaintiff['s] constitutionally protected conduct – in\n\n\n       10\n       Although plaintiffs were denominated trust employees, that\nlabel alone does not subject them to patronage dismissal.     See\nMorales-Santiago v. Hernández-Pérez, 488 F.3d 465, 468 n.4 (1st\nCir. 2007) (\"[M]any, though not all, trust positions are\npolicymaking positions into which a newly elected administration\nmay place members of its party without violating the First\nAmendment.\") (citing cases).\n\n                                    -7-\n\fthis case, political affiliation with the NPP – was a \"substantial\"\n\nor \"motivating\" factor behind [her] dismissal'\" (quoting Acevedo-\n\nDiaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 1993))), vacated and\n\nremanded on other grounds, 126 S. Ct. 1329 (2006); González-de-\n\nBlasini   v.    Family   Dep't,    377   F.3d   81,   85   (1st        Cir.   2004).\n\nPlaintiffs have the burden of proving the link between their\n\nadverse treatment and their politics. Peguero-Moronta v. Santiago,\n\n464 F.3d 29, 45 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            With these parameters in mind, we consider the evidence\n\nthus far developed by the parties.\n\nB. Assessing the Prima Facie Showing of Political Discrimination\n\n            Defendants urge us to accept the magistrate judge's\n\nconclusion that the evidence presented by plaintiffs is inadequate\n\nto show either Rey's knowledge of their politics or a deliberate\n\ndecision to remove them based on their NPP status.                      Defendants\n\nfurther assert that even the plaintiffs' evidence reveals that the\n\njobs they previously held were modified after their departures –\n\ndemonstrating that the motivation behind the transfers was not\n\nimpermissible        political    discrimination,      but        a    permissible\n\nstreamlining of the department's operations.               They specifically\n\ninvoke the \"changeover defense,\" which relies on the prerogative of\n\nnewly elected officials to make politically neutral changes to\n\nimprove departmental operations after a careful study of existing\n\npersonnel      and   business    practices.     Members      of       the   outgoing\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fadministration's political party inevitably will be affected by\n\nsuch changes.     See, e.g., Borges Colón, 438 F.3d at 6 (noting that\n\nthe effect of a new administration's policy choices may fall most\n\nheavily on the party that has lost power); Agosto-de-Feliciano v.\n\nAponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1220-21 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc).\n\n              Although the changeover defense ultimately may prevail,\n\nour close review of the record reveals an adequate circumstantial\n\nbasis   for    concluding   both   that    Rey   was   aware    of   plaintiffs'\n\npolitical allegiance to the NPP and that plaintiffs were replaced\n\nwith PDP loyalists.     Most significantly, the record lacks evidence\n\nof a considered appraisal of jobs and responsibilities that could\n\nsubstantiate a changeover defense. On this record – given both its\n\ncontents and its gaps – we believe a jury reasonably could find\n\npolitical discrimination.\n\n              1. The Evidence of Political Affiliation\n\n              Although plaintiffs have produced no direct evidence that\n\nRey was aware of their affiliation with the NPP, the record\n\ncontains      circumstantial   evidence     that   could       support   such   a\n\nfinding.      Pillich testified that she believed all of the trust\n\npositions on the list that she compiled for Rey, including those\n\nheld by plaintiffs, were occupied by individuals appointed by the\n\nprior administration \"because the last administration was there for\n\neight years.\"      This statement supports the inference that Pillich\n\nassumed the individuals in those positions probably were affiliated\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fwith the former NPP administration.   This is particularly so given\n\nthat Pillich further indicated that political affiliation with the\n\nnewly elected PDP administration \"may be one\" of the factors\n\nnecessary for those trust positions to ensure that the individuals\n\nin the jobs could \"collaborate . . . in th[e] educational project\"\n\nof the new administration.11    Although Pillich emphasized that\n\npolitical affiliation was not a \"determining\" factor, her testimony\n\nat least suggests that plaintiffs were identified as NPP members\n\nand were subject to removal for that reason.12      It is a small\n\n\n     11\n        As noted earlier, we do not in this appeal consider the\ndefense that political affiliation was an appropriate criterion for\nappellants' positions. However, testimony in the record suggesting\nthat appellants' supervisors were aware of, and considered, their\naffiliation is also relevant to assessing the prima facie case of\npolitical discrimination.\n     12\n       The appendix on appeal, which was provided by the appellees,\ncontained only partial deposition transcripts.        We requested\nseveral original exhibits from the district court, but these, too,\nconsisted of excerpts from the depositions.       The portions of\nPillich's deposition on which we rely are reproduced below:\n\n     Q. [I]n the case of the plaintiffs, was their political\n     affiliation necessary to occupy their positions?\n     A. Their political affiliation?\n     Q. Yes.\n     A. If they believe in the educational project and the\n     Secretary had the faculty to . . . hire people that he\n     knew that may collaborate with him in that educational\n     project of that new administration . . . which he\n     proposed in his government program.\n     . . .\n     Q. . . . That is, when it was talked about political need\n     it was . . . that it was not needed, that is, that it was\n     not a requirement, that is what you mean?\n     A. No, no, no. No, that is not what I want to say. That\n     it was not determining.\n     . . .\n\n                               -10-\n\finferential step from Pillich's testimony to Rey's own knowledge.\n\nThat is, we think it fair to infer that Rey, a PDP political\n\nappointee who asked Pillich to generate the list of trust employees\n\nas   soon   as   he   took   over   the    Department,   shared   Pillich's\n\nassumptions regarding the affiliations of all trust-classified\n\nincumbents.13\n\n\n     A. But if they held positions in the service of trust, it\n     is assumed that . . . to hold positions in services of\n     trust you have to work . . . you have to substantially\n     collaborate in the implementation of the public policy,\n     because otherwise . . .\n     Q. Then it was . . . That is why the political\n     affiliation was one of the factors.\n     A. That is not my answer.\n     Q. No, but I ask you, I ask you . . .\n     A. I am telling you . . .\n     . . .\n     A. I repeat that it was not a determining factor . . .\n     Q. But it was one of the factors.\n     . . .\n     A. Well, if it [was] not determining you should\n     understand that no.\n     Q.   That   it   is   one  of   the   factors   or   that\n     (unintelligible).\n     A. That it may be one.\n     Q.    Okay.    Do you know if they had confidential\n     information, in their positions, as part of their\n     performance in their positions, they had . . . obtained\n     confidential information?\n     A. No, I don't know.\n     Q. Well, that being the case, I am not going to present\n     any more questions.\n\nIn her deposition, Cortés, the other Human Resources representative\nwho surveyed the trust positions, stated that she was not aware of\nthe plaintiffs' duties, but noted in response to questioning: \"I\ndon't believe the political affiliation is a requisite for any\nposition.\"\n     13\n       In his deposition, Rey stated: \"I asked for an inventory of\nthe trust positions to have an idea of how many trust positions\n\n                                    -11-\n\f            Taken   in    the    light     most     favorable      to   plaintiffs,\n\nPillich's     deposition       testimony      also     inferentially       supports\n\nplaintiffs'    allegation       that   all    of     the    NPP   trust   employees\n\nidentified on the list that she compiled were replaced by PDP\n\nmembers who could be counted on to \"collaborate\" in the new\n\nadministration's \"educational project.\"                    Pillich insisted that\n\nloyal party members were needed to support plaintiffs' positions.\n\nInterestingly, defendants offered no evidence to rebut such an\n\nimplication, despite the fact that such evidence would probably be\n\nobtainable from the replacements identified by the plaintiffs.\n\nUnlike cases in which we have noted the plaintiffs' failure to\n\nprovide the names of their replacements, see, e,g., Vázquez-\n\nValentín, 385 F.3d at 38; Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221\n\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2000), the plaintiffs here have done so.\n\n            2. Circumstantial Evidence of Motivation\n\n            In seeking to justify plaintiffs' removals as part of a\n\nnatural transition from one administration to the next – the\n\nchangeover     defense     –    defendants         attempt    to    downplay    the\n\nsignificance of the plaintiffs' political affiliation and that of\n\ntheir successors.

Both Rey and Pillich acknowledged that,\n\nat   the    time    the   changes   were    made,    they    knew   neither   what\n\nplaintiffs' duties were nor how well they had performed their\n\njobs.14       See   Agosto-de-Feliciano,       889    F.2d     at   1221-22   (\"In\n\nevaluating the changeover defense, the factfinder should take into\n\naccount, inter alia, whether the actions occurred precipitately or\n\nafter some opportunity for appraisal, whether they seem connected\n\nwith previously announced goals, and whether they flowed from an\n\norganizational or procedural study.\" (footnote omitted)).\n\n              The quick terminations, with no attention to either job\n\nfunctions      or   performances,     are    strongly       suggestive   of   pure\n\npolitical motivation.

There    was   some   evidence    of   task     realignment:\n\nMontfort's former secretary testified in her deposition that the\n\noffice functioned differently \"[b]ecause now it's the director who\n\nmakes the decisions . . . not like it was done before.\"                      In\n\naddition, Flores stated that the Institute that she led \"doesn't\n\noperate as before.\"        However, Flores also observed that her old\n\nwork team is carrying out the same functions that she performed.\n\nHer secretary agreed, testifying that Flores's successor does not\n\ndo things the same way as Flores, but that \"[s]he has the same\n\nfunctions.\"15\n\n            The absence of evidence of a comprehensive or carefully\n\nstudied effort at reform distinguishes this case from a number of\n\nothers in which we have rejected claims of political discrimination\n\nfollowing a change in administration.

They brought this suit against the Department of Education and its Secretary, César Rey Hernandez (\"Rey\"), a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\").<sup>[1]</sup> Appellants, all members of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), were removed from trust positions and reassigned to their preexisting career employee status within days after Rey assumed his position following the PDP's 2000 electoral victory.<sup>[2]</sup> The district court granted summary judgment for defendants, concluding that appellants failed to offer sufficient admissible evidence to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination. Although the record is meager and the case is therefore close, we conclude that appellants met their burden to generate a genuine issue of material fact on the elements of their claim. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> I.</h2>\n<p>Defendant Rey took over as Secretary of Education at the beginning of January 2001.<sup>[3]</sup> Shortly thereafter, he sent letters notifying the plaintiffs that, effective January 15, their current trust appointments would cease and they would be reinstated to their previous career positions;<sup>[4]</sup> the letters gave no reason for the changes. Before the transfers, plaintiff Ivonne Montfort-Rodríguez (\"Montfort\") was Director of the Center of Investigations and Ethnographic Innovations, plaintiff Juanita Flores-de-Siaca (\"Flores\") was Facilitator of the Education Reform Institute for the San Juan region, plaintiff Carmen Rivera-Rivera (\"Rivera\") was Director of the Puerto Rico Statewide Systemic Initiative for Science and Mathematics, and plaintiff Maria Coss-Martinez (\"Coss\") was Director of the Physical Education Program. The reassignments resulted in lower salaries for all four plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Rey testified in his deposition that when he took over as Secretary he asked Lizzette Pillich Otero, the newly appointed Assistant Secretary for Human Resources, to prepare a list of the Department's trust employees so that he would \"have an idea of how many trust positions there were.\" Neither Rey nor Pillich examined personnel files in compiling the list,<sup>[5]</sup> and Rey testified that he had no knowledge of the particular job responsibilities for any plaintiff. In his deposition, Rey gave the following explanation for generating the list and eliminating positions:</p>\n<blockquote>Positions in the organigram [sic] were evaluated based on the need and based in the necessity. In fact, we evaluated all the organigram of the whole organization, not just the trust positions, we re-arranged the whole administration.<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Rey also stated in his deposition that he was unaware of plaintiffs' political affiliations. Plaintiffs maintain that he must have known their NPP status because their involvement in the party was common knowledge throughout the Department and their trust positions during the prior NPP administration circumstantially revealed their affiliation with that party. Plaintiffs further assert that they were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> replaced by members of the PDP, although that allegation is based partially on hearsay.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants' motion for summary judgment was referred to a magistrate judge, whose Report and Recommendation concluded that the plaintiffs' evidence was inadequate to survive defendants' motion for summary judgment because some of the facts essential to a finding of political discrimination  that Rey knew plaintiffs' political affiliations and replaced them with members of his own party  were supported only by speculation or hearsay. The district court agreed that plaintiffs had not met their burden to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination, having failed to provide \"admissible evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of political discrimination on the part of defendants.\" Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case with prejudice.<sup>[8]</sup> The court subsequently denied plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend judgment.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. Standard of Review and Burden of Proof</p>\n<p>We review the district court's summary judgment ruling de novo, taking the record facts and all inferences to be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>Aguiar-Carrasquillo v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> 445 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is appropriate when the record reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the undisputed facts establish the moving party's entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A genuine issue is one that \"`may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party' at trial,\" <i>Cordi-Allen v. Conlon,</i> 494 F.3d 245, 249 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990)), and \"[s]ummary judgment `should be granted only where . . . [further] inquiry into the facts is not desirable to clarify the application of the law,'\" <i>Mandel v. Boston Phoenix, Inc.,</i> 456 F.3d 198, 205 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Stevens v. Howard D. Johnson Co.,</i> 181 F.2d 390, 394 (4th Cir.1950)).</p>\n<p>It is well established that \"[g]overnmental employees who are not in policy-making positions of confidence are shielded from adverse employment decisions based on their political affiliations.\" <i>Borges Colón v. Román-Abreu,</i> 438 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 64-65, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990). Given that defendants do not argue on appeal that plaintiffs were policymakers whose job responsibilities require political compatibility with the PDP administration, we focus on whether a jury could infer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*225</span> from the evidence that Rey knew of the plaintiffs' political affiliation and replaced them because of it.<sup>[10]</sup><i>See </i><i>Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina,</i> 491 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2007) (\"To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show that party affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind a challenged employment action.\"); <i>Vazquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz,</i> 385 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir.2004) (noting requirement of \"`sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that plaintiff['s] constitutionally protected conduct  in this case, political affiliation with the NPP  was a \"substantial\" or \"motivating\" factor behind [her] dismissal'\" (quoting <i>Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte,</i> 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.1993))), <i>vacated and remanded on other grounds,</i> 546 U.S. 1163, 126 S.Ct. 1329, 164 L.Ed.2d 43 (2006); <i>González-de-Blasini v. Family Dep't,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 85 (1st Cir.2004). Plaintiffs have the burden of proving the link between their adverse treatment and their politics. <i>Peguero-Moronta v. Santiago,</i> 464 F.3d 29, 45 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>With these parameters in mind, we consider the evidence thus far developed by the parties.</p>\n<p>B. Assessing the Prima Facie Showing of Political Discrimination</p>\n<p>Defendants urge us to accept the magistrate judge's conclusion that the evidence presented by plaintiffs is inadequate to show either Rey's knowledge of their politics or a deliberate decision to remove them based on their NPP status. Defendants further assert that even the plaintiffs' evidence reveals that the jobs they previously held were modified after their departures  demonstrating that the motivation behind the transfers was not impermissible political discrimination, but a permissible streamlining of the department's operations. They specifically invoke the \"changeover defense,\" which relies on the prerogative of newly elected officials to make politically neutral changes to improve departmental operations after a careful study of existing personnel and business practices. Members of the outgoing administration's political party inevitably will be affected by such changes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Borges Colón,</i> 438 F.3d at 6 (noting that the effect of a new administration's policy choices may fall most heavily on the party that has lost power); <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 889 F.2d 1209, 1220-21 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Although the changeover defense ultimately may prevail, our close review of the record reveals an adequate circumstantial basis for concluding both that Rey was aware of plaintiffs' political allegiance to the NPP and that plaintiffs were replaced with PDP loyalists. Most significantly, the record lacks evidence of a considered appraisal of jobs and responsibilities that could substantiate a changeover defense. On this record  given both its contents and its gaps  we believe a jury reasonably could find political discrimination.</p>\n<p>1. The Evidence of Political Affiliation</p>\n<p>Although plaintiffs have produced no direct evidence that Rey was aware of their affiliation with the NPP, the record contains circumstantial evidence that could support such a finding. Pillich testified that she believed all of the trust positions on the list that she compiled for Rey, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*226</span> including those held by plaintiffs, were occupied by individuals appointed by the prior administration \"because the last administration was there for eight years.\" This statement supports the inference that Pillich assumed the individuals in those positions probably were affiliated with the former NPP administration. This is particularly so given that Pillich further indicated that political affiliation with the newly elected PDP administration \"may be one\" of the factors necessary for those trust positions to ensure that the individuals in the jobs could \"collaborate . . . in th[e] educational project\" of the new administration.<sup>[11]</sup> Although Pillich emphasized that political affiliation was not a \"determining\" factor, her testimony at least suggests that plaintiffs were identified as NPP members and were subject to removal for that reason.<sup>[12]</sup> It is a small inferential step from Pillich's testimony to Rey's own knowledge. That is, we think it fair to infer that Rey, a PDP political appointee who asked Pillich to generate the list of trust employees as soon as he took over the Department, shared Pillich's assumptions regarding the affiliations of all trust-classified incumbents.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> Taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, Pillich's deposition testimony also inferentially supports plaintiffs' allegation that all of the NPP trust employees identified on the list that she compiled were replaced by PDP members who could be counted on to \"collaborate\" in the new administration's \"educational project.\" Pillich insisted that loyal party members were needed to support plaintiffs' positions. Interestingly, defendants offered no evidence to rebut such an implication, despite the fact that such evidence would probably be obtainable from the replacements identified by the plaintiffs. Unlike cases in which we have noted the plaintiffs' failure to provide the names of their replacements, <i>see, e.g., Vázquez-Valentín,</i> 385 F.3d at 38; <i>Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio,</i> 221 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2000), the plaintiffs here have done so.</p>\n<p>2. Circumstantial Evidence of Motivation</p>\n<p>In seeking to justify plaintiffs' removals as part of a natural transition from one administration to the next  the changeover defense  defendants attempt to downplay the significance of the plaintiffs' political affiliation and that of their successors. This effort falters on the record before us. Plaintiffs were reassigned to their lower level career positions, without explanation, about a week after Rey assumed the Secretary's role. Although Rey stated in his deposition that the positions in the organization were evaluated based on need, the record contains no evidence  other than Rey's bald assertion that \"we re-arranged the whole administration\"  of a considered plan to restructure the Department of Education. Both Rey and Pillich acknowledged that, at the time the changes were made, they knew neither what plaintiffs' duties were nor how well they had performed their jobs.<sup>[14]</sup><i>See </i><i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1221-22 (\"In evaluating the changeover defense, the factfinder should take into account, <i>inter alia,</i> whether the actions occurred precipitately or after some opportunity for appraisal, whether they seem connected with previously announced goals, and whether they flowed from an organizational or procedural study.\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>The quick terminations, with no attention to either job functions or performances, are strongly suggestive of pure political motivation. <i>See id.</i> at 1222 n. 12 (\"[C]hanges made within days of a new administration's ascent to power ordinarily would be more likely to reflect an improper political housecleaning than would changes made months later, after the new officials have had a chance to evaluate how to reorganize their departments to best meet their policy goals.\"). Indeed, the record permits an inference that the defendants mistakenly believed they could demote all NPP trust employees without regard to their policymaking functions. Moreover, the evidence was equivocal as to whether the nature of plaintiffs' positions changed after they were removed, permitting a jury to conclude on this record that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*228</span> the personnel actions were made for political reasons rather than to improve efficiency. There was some evidence of task realignment: Montfort's former secretary testified in her deposition that the office functioned differently \"[b]ecause now it's the director who makes the decisions . . . not like it was done before.\" In addition, Flores stated that the Institute that she led \"doesn't operate as before.\" However, Flores also observed that her old work team is carrying out the same functions that she performed. Her secretary agreed, testifying that Flores's successor does not do things the same way as Flores, but that \"[s]he has the same functions.\"<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>The absence of evidence of a comprehensive or carefully studied effort at reform distinguishes this case from a number of others in which we have rejected claims of political discrimination following a change in administration. For example, in <i>Aguiar-Carrasquillo,</i> the defendant had directed an investigator to conduct an audit of all recent employment actions to evaluate their compliance with department regulations. We concluded there that it did not matter that NPP members were heavily affected:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]f uniformly applied personnel practices, predicated on legitimate reasons, result in terminations, those terminations are not unconstitutional because those affiliated with one political party are disproportionately impacted. It is in the nature of a change in administration that job actions by the new party will have a disparate impact on members of the outgoing party.</blockquote>\n<p>445 F.3d at 26 (quoting <i>Sánchez-López v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 140 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Similarly, in <i>Vázquez-Valentín,</i> the challenged reassignments occurred following defendants' review of the personnel files of all 1,300 or so municipal employees. 385 F.3d at 26; <i>see also </i><i>Vélez-Rivera v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> 437 F.3d 145, 149 (1st Cir.2006) (affirming summary judgment for defendants where an independent contractor conducted an audit to assess the legality of all personnel transactions during a particular period); <i>González-de-Blasini,</i> 377 F.3d at 84 (affirming summary judgment for defendants where their office conducted an audit of its Human Resources Department following the change in administration).</p>\n<p>3. Summary of Evidence</p>\n<p>In sum, the admissible evidence and the plausible inferences that a jury could draw from it suffice to meet appellants' burden to show a genuine factual dispute as to whether Rey knew of their NPP affiliation and replaced them with his political allies based solely on that association. The deposition testimony of Rey and Pillich, when viewed in context, renders this case more circumstantial than speculative. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Peguero-Moronta,</i> 464 F.3d at 46 (\"[W]here `the plaintiffs were all members of the adverse party . . . their superiors knew this, and . . . their duties were given to active supporters of the party in power,' we found there was ample evidence for the plaintiffs' case to avoid summary judgment.\" (quoting <i>Acosta-Orozco v. Rodriguez-de-Rivera,</i> 132 F.3d 97, 101 (1st Cir.1997))); <i>González-de-Blasini,</i> 377 F.3d at 86 (recognizing that a \"`prima facie case for political discrimination may be built on circumstantial evidence'\" so long as plaintiffs have \"generated `the specific facts necessary to take the asserted claim out of the realm of speculative, general allegations'\" (quoting <i>Kauffman v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> <i>P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 (1st Cir.1988))). The evidence here, \"though thin, point[s] in different directions; that is, it tend[s] to support conflicting inferences.

In her deposition, plaintiff Ivonne Montfort-Rodríguez stated that she believed  based on news reports  that his first day at the Department was January 8. Plaintiff Maria Coss-Martínez also stated in a deposition that Rey \"arrived at the Department on January 8th.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Puerto Rico law distinguishes between \"career\" employees and \"trust\" or \"confidential\" employees. Career employees \"may only be removed from their positions for just cause and after due filing of charges,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, § 4554(b) (2001). Confidential employees \"shall be of free selection and removal,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1350 (2000). Under the Personnel Act, \"a career employee who accepts a trust position has an absolute right to be reinstated to a career position equal to the last position she held as a career employee.\" <i>González-de-Blasini v. Family Dep't,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 84 n. 1 (1st Cir.2004) (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1350(a)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Pillich stated in her deposition that she did not see the plaintiffs' personnel files until 2002. Another Human Resources deponent, Hilda Cortés Figueroa (\"Cortés\"), testified that she conducted a study of trust positions that consisted of identifying \"which are the positions, who holds them or held them, and the status of the position,\" as well as what positions those trust employees held in the career service.</p>\n<p>[6]  At oral argument, counsel asserted that the Department, which she said had more than 72,000 employees, was encountering \"budgetary problems\" and \"rumors of scandal\" and was an agency \"in trouble.\" Appellees' brief invokes neither budget issues nor possible scandal as a basis for a reorganization, and we likewise found no reference in the record to such concerns.</p>\n<p>[7]  Each appellant identified her successor, but two of them offered only hearsay knowledge of the successor's affiliation with the PDP. Appellant Flores named her replacement as Caribel Rivera Casanova and identified Rivera as a member of the PDP. Appellant Coss stated in her deposition that she knew that her replacement, Jorge Colon, is a PDP member.</p>\n<p>[8]  Defendants asserted a number of other grounds on which they claimed they were entitled to summary judgment, including that appellants held positions for which political affiliation was an appropriate criterion. That particular argument has not been pursued on appeal because the job descriptions necessary to evaluate the positions are not in the record. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Valdizán v. Rivera-Hernandez,</i> 445 F.3d 63, 65-66 (1st Cir.2006) (examining job description to determine whether political compatibility was an appropriate qualification). Defendants may, of course, pursue this aspect of the case on remand if they so desire.</p>\n<p>[9]  Given our disposition on the summary judgment issue, we need not further consider this ruling.</p>\n<p>[10]  Although plaintiffs were denominated trust employees, that label alone does not subject them to patronage dismissal. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Santiago v. Hernández-Pérez,</i> 488 F.3d 465, 468 n. 4 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[M]any, though not all, trust positions are policymaking positions into which a newly elected administration may place members of its party without violating the First Amendment.\") (citing cases).</p>\n<p>[11]  As noted earlier, we do not in this appeal consider the defense that political affiliation was an appropriate criterion for appellants' positions. However, testimony in the record suggesting that appellants' supervisors were aware of, and considered, their affiliation is also relevant to assessing the prima facie case of political discrimination.</p>\n<p>[12]  The appendix on appeal, which was provided by the appellees, contained only partial deposition transcripts. We requested several original exhibits from the district court, but these, too, consisted of excerpts from the depositions. The portions of Pillich's deposition on which we rely are reproduced below:\n</p>\n<p>Q. [I]n the case of the plaintiffs, was their political affiliation necessary to occupy their positions?</p>\n<p>A. Their political affiliation?</p>\n<p>Q. Yes.</p>\n<p>A. If they believe in the educational project and the Secretary had the faculty to . . . hire people that he knew that may collaborate with him in that educational project of that new administration . . . which he proposed in his government program.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>Q. . . . That is, when it was talked about political need it was . . . that it was not needed, that is, that it was not a requirement, that is what you mean?</p>\n<p>A. No, no, no. No, that is not what I want to say. That it was not determining.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>A. But if they held positions in the service of trust, it is assumed that . . . to hold positions in services of trust you have to work . . . you have to substantially collaborate in the implementation of the public policy, because otherwise . . .</p>\n<p>Q. Then it was . . . That is why the political affiliation was one of the factors.</p>\n<p>A. That is not my answer.</p>\n<p>Q. No, but I ask you, I ask you . . .</p>\n<p>A. I am telling you . . .</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>A. I repeat that it was not a determining factor . . .</p>\n<p>Q. But it was one of the factors.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>A. Well, if it [was] not determining you should understand that no.</p>\n<p>Q. That it is one of the factors or that (unintelligible).</p>\n<p>A. That it may be one.</p>\n<p>Q. Okay. Do you know if they had confidential information, in their positions, as part of their performance in their positions, they had . . . obtained confidential information?</p>\n<p>A. No, I don't know.</p>\n<p>Q. Well, that being the case, I am not going to present any more questions.</p>\n<p>In her deposition, Cortés, the other Human Resources representative who surveyed the trust positions, stated that she was not aware of the plaintiffs' duties, but noted in response to questioning: \"I don't believe the political affiliation is a requisite for any position.\"</p>\n<p>[13]  In his deposition, Rey stated: \"I asked for an inventory of the trust positions to have an idea of how many trust positions there were.\" He explained that the purpose of the list was \"[t]o get to know the trust positions, their importance and to be able to have them available.\"</p>\n<p>[14]  Rey said that he had not examined the plaintiffs' personnel files because \"the duties of the director of the Department of Education are more complex than that.\" Although he signed the letters in which plaintiffs were informed of their removals, he said he had no knowledge of who recommended that the plaintiffs be transferred. Pillich testified that she began her position as Assistant Secretary for Human Resources on January 9; three of the plaintiffs' reassignment letters are dated January 12. The fourth is undated but contains the same termination date of January 15.</p>\n<p>[15]  We found nothing in the record concerning possible changes in the work performed by the successors to Coss and Rivera.</p>\n\n</div>",

They brought this suit against the Department of Education and its Secretary, César Rey Hernandez (\"Rey\"), a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\").<sup>[1]</sup> Appellants, all members of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), were removed from trust positions and reassigned to their preexisting career employee status within days after Rey assumed his position following the PDP's 2000 electoral victory.<sup>[2]</sup> The district court granted summary judgment for defendants, concluding that appellants failed to offer sufficient admissible evidence to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination. Although the record is meager and the case is therefore close, we conclude that appellants met their burden to generate a genuine issue of material fact on the elements of their claim. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> I.</h2>\n<p>Defendant Rey took over as Secretary of Education at the beginning of January 2001.<sup>[3]</sup> Shortly thereafter, he sent letters notifying the plaintiffs that, effective January 15, their current trust appointments would cease and they would be reinstated to their previous career positions;<sup>[4]</sup> the letters gave no reason for the changes. Before the transfers, plaintiff Ivonne Montfort-Rodríguez (\"Montfort\") was Director of the Center of Investigations and Ethnographic Innovations, plaintiff Juanita Flores-de-Siaca (\"Flores\") was Facilitator of the Education Reform Institute for the San Juan region, plaintiff Carmen Rivera-Rivera (\"Rivera\") was Director of the Puerto Rico Statewide Systemic Initiative for Science and Mathematics, and plaintiff Maria Coss-Martinez (\"Coss\") was Director of the Physical Education Program. The reassignments resulted in lower salaries for all four plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>Rey testified in his deposition that when he took over as Secretary he asked Lizzette Pillich Otero, the newly appointed Assistant Secretary for Human Resources, to prepare a list of the Department's trust employees so that he would \"have an idea of how many trust positions there were.\" Neither Rey nor Pillich examined personnel files in compiling the list,<sup>[5]</sup> and Rey testified that he had no knowledge of the particular job responsibilities for any plaintiff. In his deposition, Rey gave the following explanation for generating the list and eliminating positions:</p>\n<blockquote>Positions in the organigram [sic] were evaluated based on the need and based in the necessity. In fact, we evaluated all the organigram of the whole organization, not just the trust positions, we re-arranged the whole administration.<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Rey also stated in his deposition that he was unaware of plaintiffs' political affiliations. Plaintiffs maintain that he must have known their NPP status because their involvement in the party was common knowledge throughout the Department and their trust positions during the prior NPP administration circumstantially revealed their affiliation with that party. Plaintiffs further assert that they were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> replaced by members of the PDP, although that allegation is based partially on hearsay.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants' motion for summary judgment was referred to a magistrate judge, whose Report and Recommendation concluded that the plaintiffs' evidence was inadequate to survive defendants' motion for summary judgment because some of the facts essential to a finding of political discrimination  that Rey knew plaintiffs' political affiliations and replaced them with members of his own party  were supported only by speculation or hearsay. The district court agreed that plaintiffs had not met their burden to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination, having failed to provide \"admissible evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of political discrimination on the part of defendants.\" Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case with prejudice.<sup>[8]</sup> The court subsequently denied plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend judgment.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A.

Assessing the Prima Facie Showing of Political Discrimination</p>\n<p>Defendants urge us to accept the magistrate judge's conclusion that the evidence presented by plaintiffs is inadequate to show either Rey's knowledge of their politics or a deliberate decision to remove them based on their NPP status. Defendants further assert that even the plaintiffs' evidence reveals that the jobs they previously held were modified after their departures  demonstrating that the motivation behind the transfers was not impermissible political discrimination, but a permissible streamlining of the department's operations. They specifically invoke the \"changeover defense,\" which relies on the prerogative of newly elected officials to make politically neutral changes to improve departmental operations after a careful study of existing personnel and business practices. Members of the outgoing administration's political party inevitably will be affected by such changes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Borges Colón,</i> 438 F.3d at 6 (noting that the effect of a new administration's policy choices may fall most heavily on the party that has lost power); <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1220-21 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Although the changeover defense ultimately may prevail, our close review of the record reveals an adequate circumstantial basis for concluding both that Rey was aware of plaintiffs' political allegiance to the NPP and that plaintiffs were replaced with PDP loyalists. Most significantly, the record lacks evidence of a considered appraisal of jobs and responsibilities that could substantiate a changeover defense. On this record  given both its contents and its gaps  we believe a jury reasonably could find political discrimination.</p>\n<p>1. The Evidence of Political Affiliation</p>\n<p>Although plaintiffs have produced no direct evidence that Rey was aware of their affiliation with the NPP, the record contains circumstantial evidence that could support such a finding. Pillich testified that she believed all of the trust positions on the list that she compiled for Rey, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*226</span> including those held by plaintiffs, were occupied by individuals appointed by the prior administration \"because the last administration was there for eight years.\" This statement supports the inference that Pillich assumed the individuals in those positions probably were affiliated with the former NPP administration. This is particularly so given that Pillich further indicated that political affiliation with the newly elected PDP administration \"may be one\" of the factors necessary for those trust positions to ensure that the individuals in the jobs could \"collaborate . . . in th[e] educational project\" of the new administration.<sup>[11]</sup> Although Pillich emphasized that political affiliation was not a \"determining\" factor, her testimony at least suggests that plaintiffs were identified as NPP members and were subject to removal for that reason.<sup>[12]</sup> It is a small inferential step from Pillich's testimony to Rey's own knowledge. That is, we think it fair to infer that Rey, a PDP political appointee who asked Pillich to generate the list of trust employees as soon as he took over the Department, shared Pillich's assumptions regarding the affiliations of all trust-classified incumbents.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> Taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, Pillich's deposition testimony also inferentially supports plaintiffs' allegation that all of the NPP trust employees identified on the list that she compiled were replaced by PDP members who could be counted on to \"collaborate\" in the new administration's \"educational project.\" Pillich insisted that loyal party members were needed to support plaintiffs' positions. Interestingly, defendants offered no evidence to rebut such an implication, despite the fact that such evidence would probably be obtainable from the replacements identified by the plaintiffs. Unlike cases in which we have noted the plaintiffs' failure to provide the names of their replacements, <i>see, e.g., Vázquez-Valentín,</i> 385 F.3d at 38; <i>Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199013\"><a href=\"/opinion/199013/figueroa-serrano-v-ramos-alverio/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2000), the plaintiffs here have done so.</p>\n<p>2. Circumstantial Evidence of Motivation</p>\n<p>In seeking to justify plaintiffs' removals as part of a natural transition from one administration to the next  the changeover defense  defendants attempt to downplay the significance of the plaintiffs' political affiliation and that of their successors. This effort falters on the record before us. Plaintiffs were reassigned to their lower level career positions, without explanation, about a week after Rey assumed the Secretary's role. Although Rey stated in his deposition that the positions in the organization were evaluated based on need, the record contains no evidence  other than Rey's bald assertion that \"we re-arranged the whole administration\"  of a considered plan to restructure the Department of Education. Both Rey and Pillich acknowledged that, at the time the changes were made, they knew neither what plaintiffs' duties were nor how well they had performed their jobs.<sup>[14]</sup><i>See </i><i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1221-22 (\"In evaluating the changeover defense, the factfinder should take into account, <i>inter alia,</i> whether the actions occurred precipitately or after some opportunity for appraisal, whether they seem connected with previously announced goals, and whether they flowed from an organizational or procedural study.\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>The quick terminations, with no attention to either job functions or performances, are strongly suggestive of pure political motivation. <i>See id.</i> at 1222 n. 12 (\"[C]hanges made within days of a new administration's ascent to power ordinarily would be more likely to reflect an improper political housecleaning than would changes made months later, after the new officials have had a chance to evaluate how to reorganize their departments to best meet their policy goals.\"). Indeed, the record permits an inference that the defendants mistakenly believed they could demote all NPP trust employees without regard to their policymaking functions. Moreover, the evidence was equivocal as to whether the nature of plaintiffs' positions changed after they were removed, permitting a jury to conclude on this record that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*228</span> the personnel actions were made for political reasons rather than to improve efficiency. There was some evidence of task realignment: Montfort's former secretary testified in her deposition that the office functioned differently \"[b]ecause now it's the director who makes the decisions . . . not like it was done before.\" In addition, Flores stated that the Institute that she led \"doesn't operate as before.\" However, Flores also observed that her old work team is carrying out the same functions that she performed. Her secretary agreed, testifying that Flores's successor does not do things the same way as Flores, but that \"[s]he has the same functions.\"<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>The absence of evidence of a comprehensive or carefully studied effort at reform distinguishes this case from a number of others in which we have rejected claims of political discrimination following a change in administration. For example, in <i>Aguiar-Carrasquillo,</i> the defendant had directed an investigator to conduct an audit of all recent employment actions to evaluate their compliance with department regulations. We concluded there that it did not matter that NPP members were heavily affected:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]f uniformly applied personnel practices, predicated on legitimate reasons, result in terminations, those terminations are not unconstitutional because those affiliated with one political party are disproportionately impacted. It is in the nature of a change in administration that job actions by the new party will have a disparate impact on members of the outgoing party.</blockquote>\n<p>445 F.3d at 26 (quoting <i>Sánchez-López v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201133\"><a href=\"/opinion/201133/sanchez-lopez-v-fuentes-pujos/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 140 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Similarly, in <i>Vázquez-Valentín,</i> the challenged reassignments occurred following defendants' review of the personnel files of all 1,300 or so municipal employees. 385 F.3d at 26; <i>see also </i><i>Vélez-Rivera v.

Summary of Evidence</p>\n<p>In sum, the admissible evidence and the plausible inferences that a jury could draw from it suffice to meet appellants' burden to show a genuine factual dispute as to whether Rey knew of their NPP affiliation and replaced them with his political allies based solely on that association. The deposition testimony of Rey and Pillich, when viewed in context, renders this case more circumstantial than speculative. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Peguero-Moronta,</i> 464 F.3d at 46 (\"[W]here `the plaintiffs were all members of the adverse party . . . their superiors knew this, and . . . their duties were given to active supporters of the party in power,' we found there was ample evidence for the plaintiffs' case to avoid summary judgment.\" (quoting <i>Acosta-Orozco v.

We take no view of the propriety of summary judgment on a more fully developed record. Costs are taxed in favor of the appellants.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Appellants filed their action in March 2001 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages under various provisions of federal law, including 42 U.S.C. § 1983, based on alleged violations of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as under the Commonwealth's Public Service Personnel Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 1301-1431 (2000); <i>id.</i> tit. 31, § 5141 (1990). The Personnel Act was repealed in 2004 and replaced by the Public Service Human Resources Administration Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 1461-1468p. We apply the law that was in effect at the time the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p>[2]  Rey remains a defendant in his individual capacity, but was replaced in his official capacity by the current Secretary, Rafael Aragunde.</p>\n<p>[3]  The complaint alleges that Rey was named Secretary of the Department on or around January 2, 2001. In her deposition, plaintiff Ivonne Montfort-Rodríguez stated that she believed  based on news reports  that his first day at the Department was January 8. Plaintiff Maria Coss-Martínez also stated in a deposition that Rey \"arrived at the Department on January 8th.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Puerto Rico law distinguishes between \"career\" employees and \"trust\" or \"confidential\" employees. Career employees \"may only be removed from their positions for just cause and after due filing of charges,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 21, § 4554(b) (2001). Confidential employees \"shall be of free selection and removal,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1350 (2000). Under the Personnel Act, \"a career employee who accepts a trust position has an absolute right to be reinstated to a career position equal to the last position she held as a career employee.\" <i>González-de-Blasini v. Family Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201167\"><a href=\"/opinion/201167/gonzalez-de-blasini-v-family-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 84 n. 1 (1st Cir.2004) (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1350(a)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Pillich stated in her deposition that she did not see the plaintiffs' personnel files until 2002. Another Human Resources deponent, Hilda Cortés Figueroa (\"Cortés\"), testified that she conducted a study of trust positions that consisted of identifying \"which are the positions, who holds them or held them, and the status of the position,\" as well as what positions those trust employees held in the career service.</p>\n<p>[6]  At oral argument, counsel asserted that the Department, which she said had more than 72,000 employees, was encountering \"budgetary problems\" and \"rumors of scandal\" and was an agency \"in trouble.\" Appellees' brief invokes neither budget issues nor possible scandal as a basis for a reorganization, and we likewise found no reference in the record to such concerns.</p>\n<p>[7]  Each appellant identified her successor, but two of them offered only hearsay knowledge of the successor's affiliation with the PDP. Appellant Flores named her replacement as Caribel Rivera Casanova and identified Rivera as a member of the PDP. Appellant Coss stated in her deposition that she knew that her replacement, Jorge Colon, is a PDP member.</p>\n<p>[8]  Defendants asserted a number of other grounds on which they claimed they were entitled to summary judgment, including that appellants held positions for which political affiliation was an appropriate criterion. That particular argument has not been pursued on appeal because the job descriptions necessary to evaluate the positions are not in the record. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Valdizán v. Rivera-Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202168\"><a href=\"/opinion/202168/valdizan-v-rivera-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 65-66 (1st Cir.2006) (examining job description to determine whether political compatibility was an appropriate qualification). Defendants may, of course, pursue this aspect of the case on remand if they so desire.</p>\n<p>[9]  Given our disposition on the summary judgment issue, we need not further consider this ruling.</p>\n<p>[10]  Although plaintiffs were denominated trust employees, that label alone does not subject them to patronage dismissal. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Santiago v. Hernández-Pérez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202752\"><a href=\"/opinion/202752/morales-santiago-v-hernandez-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 468 n. 4 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[M]any, though not all, trust positions are policymaking positions into which a newly elected administration may place members of its party without violating the First Amendment.\") (citing cases).</p>\n<p>[11]  As noted earlier, we do not in this appeal consider the defense that political affiliation was an appropriate criterion for appellants' positions. However, testimony in the record suggesting that appellants' supervisors were aware of, and considered, their affiliation is also relevant to assessing the prima facie case of political discrimination.</p>\n<p>[12]  The appendix on appeal, which was provided by the appellees, contained only partial deposition transcripts. We requested several original exhibits from the district court, but these, too, consisted of excerpts from the depositions. The portions of Pillich's deposition on which we rely are reproduced below:\n</p>\n<p>Q. [I]n the case of the plaintiffs, was their political affiliation necessary to occupy their positions?</p>\n<p>A. Their political affiliation?</p>\n<p>Q. Yes.</p>\n<p>A. If they believe in the educational project and the Secretary had the faculty to . . . hire people that he knew that may collaborate with him in that educational project of that new administration . . . which he proposed in his government program.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>Q. . . . That is, when it was talked about political need it was . . . that it was not needed, that is, that it was not a requirement, that is what you mean?</p>\n<p>A. No, no, no. No, that is not what I want to say. That it was not determining.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>A. But if they held positions in the service of trust, it is assumed that . . . to hold positions in services of trust you have to work . . . you have to substantially collaborate in the implementation of the public policy, because otherwise . . .</p>\n<p>Q. Then it was . . . That is why the political affiliation was one of the factors.</p>\n<p>A. That is not my answer.</p>\n<p>Q. No, but I ask you, I ask you . . .</p>\n<p>A. I am telling you . . .</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>A. I repeat that it was not a determining factor . . .</p>\n<p>Q. But it was one of the factors.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>A. Well, if it [was] not determining you should understand that no.</p>\n<p>Q. That it is one of the factors or that (unintelligible).</p>\n<p>A. That it may be one.</p>\n<p>Q. Okay. Do you know if they had confidential information, in their positions, as part of their performance in their positions, they had . . . obtained confidential information?</p>\n<p>A. No, I don't know.</p>\n<p>Q. Well, that being the case, I am not going to present any more questions.</p>\n<p>In her deposition, Cortés, the other Human Resources representative who surveyed the trust positions, stated that she was not aware of the plaintiffs' duties, but noted in response to questioning: \"I don't believe the political affiliation is a requisite for any position.\"</p>\n<p>[13]  In his deposition, Rey stated: \"I asked for an inventory of the trust positions to have an idea of how many trust positions there were.\" He explained that the purpose of the list was \"[t]o get to know the trust positions, their importance and to be able to have them available.\"</p>\n<p>[14]  Rey said that he had not examined the plaintiffs' personnel files because \"the duties of the director of the Department of Education are more complex than that.\" Although he signed the letters in which plaintiffs were informed of their removals, he said he had no knowledge of who recommended that the plaintiffs be transferred. Pillich testified that she began her position as Assistant Secretary for Human Resources on January 9; three of the plaintiffs' reassignment letters are dated January 12. The fourth is undated but contains the same termination date of January 15.</p>\n<p>[15]  We found nothing in the record concerning possible changes in the work performed by the successors to Coss and Rivera.</p>\n\n</div>",
