Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                  Boudin, John R. Gibson,* and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Christopher P. Litterio with whom Michael J. Duffy and\nRuberto, Israel & Weiner, P.C. were on brief for appellant.\n     Daniel J. Murphy with whom Stanley W. Wheatley and The Murphy\nLaw Group, LLC were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 7, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.      The facts underlying this appeal\n\ndate back to 1975, when the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\")\n\nloaned $4 million, evidenced by a promissory note, to Statler\n\nIndustries,   Ltd.     (\"Statler\"),    an   Augusta,      Maine,    based   paper\n\nmanufacturer.      To secure the loan, the SBA received a first\n\npriority mortgage on the Statler plant site, a first priority\n\nsecurity    interest    in   almost   all   the    company's     equipment   and\n\nmachinery    and   a   personal   guaranty    of    the   loan     from   Leonard\n\nSugarman, then Statler's president and a major shareholder.\n\n            Sugarman's attorney, Harris Baseman, was able to modify\n\nslightly the standard guaranty required by the SBA; with SBA's\n\nconsent the word \"LIMITED\" was added to the title of the preprinted\n\nSBA form and an additional sentence--\"This guaranty is limited to\n\n60.1% of the outstanding loan balance\"--was added to the bottom of\n\nthe preprinted form.         The guaranty did not require the SBA to\n\nexhaust its collateral before turning to him; Sugarman sought\n\nunsuccessfully to secure such a limitation but the SBA refused to\n\nmodify its boilerplate.\n\n            In 1980, the firm's finances were in good shape, and\n\nSugarman not only renewed his prior request that the SBA agree to\n\nliquidate collateral before he was held personally liable, but also\n\nasked to have the guaranty limited to $500,000.                  With the SBA's\n\nagreement Baseman had the following two sentences typed at the\n\nbottom of the guaranty form before it was re-executed:\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f           This guaranty is limited to the deficiency\n           existing after sale of corporate assets\n           securing the subject loan.   The guaranty is\n           further limited to an amount not to exceed\n           Five Hundred Thousand Dollars.\n\nAt the SBA's insistence, the preprinted language was not altered.\n\nThus,   inconsistent   with   the   new   first   sentence   of   the   added\n\nlanguage, boilerplate language in the form continued to allow the\n\nSBA to demand payment from Sugarman without first exhausting the\n\ncollateral.\n\n           Also left undisturbed was boilerplate language granting\n\nthe SBA \"full power, in its uncontrolled discretion and without\n\nnotice to [Sugarman]\" to take any action it deemed fit with respect\n\nto the collateral.     The form provided the SBA could \"deal in any\n\nmatter\" with the collateral, including:\n\n           [T]he substitution, exchange, or release of\n           all or any parts of the collateral, whether or\n           not the collateral, if any, received by Lender\n           upon any such substitution, exchange or\n           release shall be of the same or a different\n           character or value than the collateral\n           surrendered by Lender.\n\nThe new 1980 guaranty, executed by both sides, is agreed to have\n\nsupplanted the original guaranty.\n\n           In 1994, Statler defaulted in its payments on the SBA\n\nloan.   The SBA then demanded payment of the outstanding balance\n\n($1.277 million plus interest) and, unable to pay, Statler filed\n\nfor chapter 11 bankruptcy.      In 1996, with the bankruptcy court's\n\nassent, Statler sold its assets to Tree-Free Fiber Co., LLC., which\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fassumed      Statler's   obligations       under    the    SBA   loan.      Sugarman\n\nconsented to the assumption, reaffirmed his guaranty, and agreed\n\nthat    \"Tree-Free    [could]      sell   machinery       or   equipment    with   an\n\naggregate value up to $25,000 per year\" without SBA consent.\n\n              To carry out its purchase of Statler's assets, Tree-Free\n\nreceived a $6 million loan from a supplier, Thermo Fibertek, Inc.\n\nThe loan was given pursuant to a subordination agreement, which\n\ngranted Thermo Fibertek the first security interest in certain\n\nmachinery and equipment that had previously been subject to the\n\nfirst priority claims of the SBA.               Both the SBA and Sugarman gave\n\ntheir consent to this subordination.\n\n              The following year, Tree Free needed additional financing\n\nto upgrade its facilities and sought a loan from KeyBank, N.A.                     To\n\nhelp Tree Free to secure the loan, the SBA agreed with KeyBank that\n\nthe SBA would give up its first priority on                       certain of the\n\nmortagaged real estate and its first priority security interest in\n\ncertain of the machinery and equipment that backed the promissory\n\nnote.    Sugarman was apparently not told of the transaction and he\n\ndid    not   give   consent   to    the    SBA's    release      of   its   priority\n\npositions.\n\n              At the time, Philip Proulx, then the SBA's chief of\n\nportfolio management, expressed concern in a letter to Tree Free\n\nexecutives about the proposal that the SBA enter into the release.\n\nProulx said that if it subordinated its position and the business\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwere to fail, Sugarman would remain liable under the guaranty but\n\nwithout the protection provided by the SBA's first claim on the\n\nreleased real estate and equipment.1          Nevertheless, the SBA took\n\nthe view that it was entitled to release the collateral without\n\nSugarman's consent and ultimately did so.\n\n             In December 1997, Tree Free defaulted on the loan from\n\nKeyBank     and   the   Maine   Superior   Court   placed   Tree   Free   into\n\nreceivership.       Tree-Free's assets were sold; with its reduced\n\nsecurity position, the SBA received only $350,000 of the $3.5\n\nmillion the sale generated.        As a result, the SBA was left with a\n\ndeficiency on its original loan to Statler in the amount of\n\n$284,688.71, plus additional interest that had accrued.\n\n             The SBA demanded under the 1980 guaranty that Sugarman\n\npay the deficiency. Sugarman denied liability, contending that the\n\nSBA had violated its obligations to him by releasing its first\n\npriority security interests without his consent.              The loan was\n\n\n\n     1\n         The letter stated, in relevant part:\n\n     I would like to point out that considerations other than\n     credit enter our deliberations. We currently have the\n     personal guaranty of the former principal of Statler,\n     which is not now at risk of being called upon, but, which\n     will be if we enter the proposed pari passu arrangement\n     and the business fails.      Although our documentation\n     allows us to take actions we consider prudent and in the\n     best interest of SBA without consent of the guarantor, we\n     have a moral obligation to consider the effects of our\n     action on that individual. Additionally, should we agree\n     to enter agreements which place him at risk of personal\n     loss, we would anticipate litigation....\n\n                                     -5-\n\feventually purchased from the SBA by LPP Mortgage Ltd. (\"LPP\");\n\nstanding now in the SBA's shoes, LPP commenced this law suit in\n\nfederal district court in Massachusetts to recover the deficiency\n\nremaining on the loan to Sugarman.\n\n             In the district court, both parties moved for summary\n\njudgment and the district court denied both motions.              In doing so,\n\nthe court found that the SBA was required under the guaranty to\n\nexhaust whatever collateral it had before turning to Sugarman as a\n\nguarantor. Although (as noted above) boilerplate language provided\n\notherwise, the district court found the typewritten sentences added\n\nin 1980 overrode the boilerplate language in this respect.\n\n             However, the modified guaranty by its terms only required\n\nthe SBA to exhaust its collateral (\"This guaranty is limited to the\n\ndeficiency existing after sale of corporate assets securing the\n\nsubject loan.\").        The district court found it less clear whether\n\nthe   SBA   was   entitled   to     release     collateral   in   1997   without\n\nSugarman's consent.       It therefore conducted a two day bench trial,\n\nhearing     extrinsic    evidence    of   the    parties'    intent.     Proulx,\n\nSugarman and Baseman all testified.\n\n             Proulx testified that, consistent with his letter, he\n\nbelieved the typewritten text had no impact on the SBA's rights to\n\nsubordinate its collateral.          Sugarman and Baseman both testified\n\nthat they understood the language inserted in 1980 to protect\n\nSugarman's interest in having the collateral available and that its\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\frelease   without   his   consent       was   inconsistent   with    this\n\nunderstanding.      Ultimately,   the     district   court   found   that\n\nSugarman's consent was required and it dismissed LPP Mortgage's\n\nclaim.\n\n          The gist of the district court's decisions--one denying\n\nsummary judgment to LPP and the other deciding against it on the\n\nmerits after trial--was as follows: that the guaranty as amended by\n\nthe additional sentences was ambiguous as to whether the SBA could\n\nwithout Sugarman's consent subordinate its first priority in the\n\ncollateral so that extrinsic evidence was proper; and, based on the\n\ntestimony and the parties' dealings, Sugarman's answer--that the\n\nSBA could not do so--was persuasive.\n\n          LPP has appealed, urging various errors; the standard of\n\nreview in this court varies with the claim of error.            Broadly,\n\nissues of law are reviewed de novo, Carr v. PMS Fishing Corp., 191\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999), and fact findings at a bench trial for\n\nclear error, Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc.,\n\n233 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000); but several judgment calls arguably\n\nfall somewhere in between these poles.         The case is not hard to\n\nanalyze but several of the issues are very close calls.\n\n          We start with choice of law which, happily, turns out not\n\nto matter.   In the district court, LPP claimed that Massachusetts\n\nlaw governed, while Sugarman thought Maine law controlled.           They\n\nagreed, however, that there were no substantive differences between\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe two states as to the relevant contract rules and the district\n\ncourt applied a hybrid of the two.            Neither side complains about\n\nthis approach on appeal, and we mention it only because both sides\n\nwere probably wrong.\n\n                Because the guaranty is a contract between a private\n\nparty and an agency of the United States, it appears likely that\n\nfederal common law governs as to contractual issues, 13 C.F.R. §\n\n101.106(b)(2) (2009), borrowing from state law where appropriate\n\nand consistent with federal interests. In some situations, federal\n\ncommon law might give the government an edge; but often ordinary\n\ncontract principles apply and no one argues otherwise here.\n\n              LPP argues first that the district court erred in finding\n\nthe   guaranty    ambiguous    and    conducting   a     trial   on    extrinsic\n\nevidence; specifically, evidence of course of dealing, the context\n\nin which the typed amendment was agreed to, and the parties'\n\nintentions as to the overriding of boilerplate. Whether a contract\n\nis ambiguous is a question of law and our review of the district\n\ncourt's ruling on that issue is plenary.           ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp.,\n\n926 F.2d 1258, 1261 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n              LPP's position is not frivolous, and 50 years ago many\n\ncourts would readily have endorsed it, at least so far as concerns\n\nthe   SBA's    right   to   dispose   of    collateral   without      Sugarman's\n\nconsent.      E.g., Burlee Dry Dock Co. v. Besse, 130 F. 444, 445-46\n\n(1st Cir. 1904).       But the tendency of the courts has been to soften\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe rigor of the classic doctrine that extrinsic evidence cannot be\n\nadmitted to override plain language.                      2 Farnsworth on Contracts §\n\n7.12,       at   314    (3d   ed.    2004);    see        also    Donoghue     v.   IBC    USA\n\n(Publications), Inc., 70 F.3d 206, 215 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                 The thin edge of the wedge was the view, now quite\n\ncommon,      that      extrinsic     evidence       can    be     offered    to   show    that\n\nseemingly        plain     language,    in     the    circumstances,           conceals     an\n\nambiguity.2         From there, it is not a long leap to a \"peek\" at\n\nextrinsic        evidence     even    where    it    does        not   focus   directly    on\n\n\"ambiguity.\"           Bank v. Int'l Bus. Mach. Corp., 145 F.3d 420, 424 n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).           How far to go is not clearly settled and perhaps\n\ncannot be reduced to formula.             See Nat'l Tax Inst., Inc., 388 F.3d\n\nat 20 (stating that it may be permissible to look to extrinsic\n\nevidence where \"language may point only slightly in one direction\n\nand extrinsic evidence strongly in another\").\n\n                 As it happens, the ambiguity here is in part very much on\n\nthe surface.           Compare Hunt Ltd. v. Lifschultz Fast Freight, Inc.,\n\n889 F.2d 1274 (2d Cir. 1989).             LPP is right that the provisions on\n\nwhich it relies do not in the strictest sense conflict with the\n\nadded sentences.              The former give the SBA broad authority to\n\n\n\n        2\n      Courts may look at extrinsic evidence for the \"very purpose\nof deciding whether the documentary expression of a contract is\nambiguous,\"   Donoghue 70 F.3d at 215, for there is the real\npossibility that \"extrinsic evidence may in fact reveal an\nambiguity not otherwise patent.\" Nat'l Tax Inst., Inc. v. Topnotch\nat Stowe Resort & Spa, 388 F.3d 15, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                              -9-\n\fdispose of collateral without notice to Sugarman or his consent;\n\nthe added language literally read merely requires resort first to\n\nwhatever collateral the SBA has if and when it seeks to recover\n\nfrom Sugarman.\n\n          But the added wording squarely conflicts with boilerplate\n\nlanguage saying that the SBA need not exhaust collateral before\n\nturning to Sugarman, and this language was not deleted when the\n\naddendum was added.      So something is amiss.      And, while one can\n\nargue that the conflict is only between this latter boilerplate\n\nprovision and the added language, the provisions relating to\n\ncollateral are functionally interrelated and Sugarman now has a\n\nplausible argument for looking behind plain wording to see just how\n\nfar the parties intended to repeal the relevant boilerplate.\n\n          Sugarman also has two pieces of extrinsic evidence, short\n\nof testimony about the parties' intent, that might be can openers\n\nfor direct testimony on that subject.        The first is that the SBA\n\ndid seek Sugarman's consent in 1996 when it was agreed that Tree-\n\nFree would receive Statler's assets.      Course of conduct testimony,\n\nfor obvious reasons, troubles courts less than other testimony, and\n\nis widely considered.       See 2 Farnsworth on Contracts § 7.13\n\n(detailing importance of course of dealing and performance in\n\ncontract interpretation).\n\n          The    other   piece   of   concrete   extrinsic   evidence   is\n\nProulx's letter expressing concerns when the SBA agreed with\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fKeyBank to surrender SBA's first priority rights.           It is true that\n\nProulx was not part of the 1980 negotiations and spoke only of a\n\nmoral and not a legal commitment; but it reinforces the connection\n\nbetween the exhaustion obligation and the importance of maintaining\n\nthe collateral intact.       Both the letter and the 1996 consent,\n\nalthough less weighty than might appear, reinforce the court's\n\nfinding of ambiguity.\n\n          This brings us to the merits on the premise that all of\n\nthe evidence may be considered which, as LPP framed its appeal,\n\npresent a series of issues: whether the district court misstated\n\nthe burden of proof, whether it matters, whether the evidence\n\nsupports the court's findings, whether the facts found support the\n\ncourt's   ultimate   determination       that   the   SBA    breached   its\n\nobligations, and whether Sugarman proved injury from such a breach.\n\nThe issues are curiously entangled.\n\n          The district court arguably did, as LPP argues, misstate\n\nthe allocation of burdens of proof, due partly to a confusing\n\ncolloquy with counsel.      LPP, as the party suing on a contractual\n\nguaranty, had to prove the guaranty, the failure to recover on the\n\nnote and the sum remaining unpaid.          Transmedia Rest. Corp. v.\n\nElegant Appetites, Inc., No. 243682, 2000 WL 1616462, at *3 (Mass.\n\nApp. Div. Oct. 20, 2000).    But most of this was straightforward and\n\nSugarman's liability turned, primarily, on whether the SBA was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fobliged to get his consent before releasing the collateral--which\n\nadmittedly it did not do.\n\n           The district court said that \"the parties agreed during\n\nthe trial that plaintiff bears the burden of proving the parties'\n\nintent in 1980\" and it found that while Sugarman had introduced\n\nintent   evidence   from   him   and   Baseman;   LPP--according   to   the\n\ndistrict judge--\"failed to meet its burden for the simple reason\n\nthat it failed to proffer any evidence of the SBA's intentions in\n\n1980\"--Proulx having not been involved in the revision and offering\n\nonly his own later view of SBA obligations.\n\n           LPP argues persuasively that it made no such general\n\nconcession.   The pertinent exchanges confirm that LPP twice told\n\nthe district judge that it bore the burden of showing a contract\n\nand its breach but that, to the extent that Sugarman claimed that\n\nhe was excused from performance because of a breach by SBA of an\n\nobligation under the guaranty to get his consent, this was an\n\naffirmative defense on which he bore the burden.3       This may well be\n\nthe better view of the law.      Cf. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Elder\n\nCare Servs., 82 F.3d 524, 526 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           After all, Sugarman claims that the guaranty required his\n\nconsent to the SBA's disposal of collateral: he does not say that\n\n\n\n     3\n      The two exchanges, occurring at different times during the\ntrial, are reprinted in an addendum and, in the second one, the\ndistrict judge acknowledges that this is LPP's position.\nSugarman's brief does not effectively respond.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthe language explicitly required it but that it was implicit in the\n\namendment.      It follows that Sugarman would have to show that such\n\na provision implicitly existed and that the explicit boilerplate to\n\nthe contrary had been implicitly disregarded.                     Whether or not one\n\ncalls this an affirmative defense, it feels like something that\n\nSugarman would normally have to show--absent an LPP concession\n\nwhich we think is absent.\n\n            But,       despite    the   district       court's      \"simple       reason\"\n\nstatement    quoted      above,    it   is     clear   to    us    that     the   burden\n\nallocation      made    no   difference      to     critical      factual     findings.\n\nSugarman and his lawyer both testified as to their understanding of\n\nthe contract and the district court credited their testimony; the\n\nSBA   offered    no     direct    evidence     of    the    understanding         of   SBA\n\nofficials    involved        in   the   1980    adjustment;        and    the     limited\n\ncircumstantial evidence supporting Sugarman is undisputed.                             See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 202 cmt. g (1981) (\"The parties\n\nto an agreement know best what they mean\").\n\n            Burden might matter if no witnesses had testified or the\n\ninferences were in perfect equipoise, but given that the district\n\ncourt heard and believed Sugarman, the raw facts are simply not in\n\ndispute.     And here the issue is readily framed but not easily\n\nanswered: is it permissible to move from a solid finding that\n\nSugarman and his lawyer understood the contract to embody a consent\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\frequirement to the more debatable conclusion that the contract\n\nshould be so interpreted?\n\n            After    all,    Sugarman   did   not   claim      that   any   SBA\n\nrepresentative      shared   his   understanding    and   so    conceded;    he\n\ntestified that because the amended language was designed to give\n\nhim the protection of the collateral, it followed that the SBA\n\ncould not release the collateral without his consent.             This is not\n\nnecessarily an unreasonable inference on his part; but the SBA, if\n\nit thought at all, could have thought that at most it had to behave\n\nreasonably as to the collateral--not that it needed Sugarman's\n\nconsent.4\n\n            But even if the SBA had one understanding and Sugarman\n\nanother on this single detail as to the necessity of consent,\n\nmodern contract law would not let either the guaranty or the\n\namendment fail for \"lack of mutual understanding.\" Instead the\n\ncourts would fill the gap with a \"reasonable\" solution, either\n\nattributing it to both sides' intent (conforming to what was taught\n\nwhen judges were in law school) or confessing that this is what\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Courts have read such a reasonableness obligation into SBA\nguaranty contracts absent an agreement to the contrary, Small Bus.\nAdmin. v. Sotomayor-Santos, 96 F.3d 584, 585 (1st Cir. 1996) (per\ncuriam); United States v. Mallett, 782 F.2d 302, 304 (1st Cir.\n1986), and it would certainly be the minimum that a guarantor would\nclaim if the issue were not addressed.     And there is reason to\nbelieve that the insertion of the language in question here would\nhave created just such a requirement. See United States v. Baus,\n834 F.2d 1114, 1126-27 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                                    -14-\n\fjudges do.      Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Nippon Sanso K.K., 331 F.3d\n\n153, 159 (1st Cir. 2003); 2 Farnsworth On Contracts § 7.9, at 285.\n\n              The district judge took a third course by attributing the\n\noutcome to the burden of proof, but the result would hardly be\n\ndifferent if the judge were asked (in a pointless remand) to choose\n\nthe reasonable solution.              Sugarman's aim had been to get the\n\ncollateral positioned ahead of his own liability; the amendment\n\naccepted   by    the    SBA   clearly    did   this    and,   just    as   clearly,\n\nimplicitly negated the boilerplate to the contrary. Sugarman might\n\nreasonably think it equally implicit that the collateral could not\n\nbe disposed of without his consent.\n\n              Although Sugarman's lawyer drafted the added sentences,\n\nit was the SBA that insisted on retaining all of the boilerplate\n\nincluding language flatly contrary to the addendum.                   Each can be\n\nregarded as the drafter of part of the contract, so the maxim of\n\ncontra proferentem uselessly runs against both, 2 Farnsworth on\n\nContracts § 7.11 at 300-04; but the SBA is the main cause of the\n\nmuddle   by    accepting      the   modification      and   then   (according   to\n\nBaseman) refusing to accept any adjustment in the boilerplate.\n\n              Finally, we have Proulx's letter acknowledging a \"moral\"\n\nobligation      not    to   release   the   collateral      and    admitting   that\n\nSugarman was safe if the release did not occur; the fact that the\n\nSBA did secure Sugarman's consent in the earlier limited release of\n\ncollateral; and the failure of LPP to secure any SBA witness\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\foffering a different understanding of events.   However limited the\n\nweight of such considerations, they are certainly not helpful to\n\nLPP's position.\n\n          In the end, the district court's decision as to the need\n\nfor consent is reasonable and a remand to recast slightly the\n\nrationale would serve no purpose.     This brings us to LPP's very\n\nbrief final argument, which is that Sugarman failed to show damages\n\nfrom the release of the collateral without his consent.   It might\n\nbe a nice question, not briefed by either side, whether an implicit\n\nrequirement of consent was a condition of Sugarman's liability or\n\nmerely an independent breach for which he had to show damages.\n\n          The failure to brief the issue could be fatal to LPP but\n\nthere is a good reason why it has not devoted much attention to the\n\ndamages issue.    Proulx's letter said that Sugarman was safe just\n\nbefore the collateral was released; it is fair enough to treat this\n\nas proof that, but for the release, he would owe nothing.    This,\n\nseemingly, is what the district court did, and to this view LPP\n\noffers no rebuttal.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f                              ADDENDUM\n\nInitial exchange regarding burden of proof:\n\nTHE COURT: . . . .

The facts underlying this appeal\n\ndate back to 1975, when the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\")\n\nloaned $4 million, evidenced by a promissory note, to Statler\n\nIndustries,   Ltd.     (\"Statler\"),    an   Augusta,      Maine,    based   paper\n\nmanufacturer.      To secure the loan, the SBA received a first\n\npriority mortgage on the Statler plant site, a first priority\n\nsecurity    interest    in   almost   all   the    company's     equipment   and\n\nmachinery    and   a   personal   guaranty    of    the   loan     from   Leonard\n\nSugarman, then Statler's president and a major shareholder.\n\n            Sugarman's attorney, Harris Baseman, was able to modify\n\nslightly the standard guaranty required by the SBA; with SBA's\n\nconsent the word \"LIMITED\" was added to the title of the preprinted\n\nSBA form and an additional sentence--\"This guaranty is limited to\n\n60.1% of the outstanding loan balance\"--was added to the bottom of\n\nthe preprinted form.         The guaranty did not require the SBA to\n\nexhaust its collateral before turning to him; Sugarman sought\n\nunsuccessfully to secure such a limitation but the SBA refused to\n\nmodify its boilerplate.\n\n            In 1980, the firm's finances were in good shape, and\n\nSugarman not only renewed his prior request that the SBA agree to\n\nliquidate collateral before he was held personally liable, but also\n\nasked to have the guaranty limited to $500,000.                  With the SBA's\n\nagreement Baseman had the following two sentences typed at the\n\nbottom of the guaranty form before it was re-executed:\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f           This guaranty is limited to the deficiency\n           existing after sale of corporate assets\n           securing the subject loan.   The guaranty is\n           further limited to an amount not to exceed\n           Five Hundred Thousand Dollars.\n\nAt the SBA's insistence, the preprinted language was not altered.\n\nThus,   inconsistent   with   the   new   first   sentence   of   the   added\n\nlanguage, boilerplate language in the form continued to allow the\n\nSBA to demand payment from Sugarman without first exhausting the\n\ncollateral.\n\n           Also left undisturbed was boilerplate language granting\n\nthe SBA \"full power, in its uncontrolled discretion and without\n\nnotice to [Sugarman]\" to take any action it deemed fit with respect\n\nto the collateral.     The form provided the SBA could \"deal in any\n\nmatter\" with the collateral, including:\n\n           [T]he substitution, exchange, or release of\n           all or any parts of the collateral, whether or\n           not the collateral, if any, received by Lender\n           upon any such substitution, exchange or\n           release shall be of the same or a different\n           character or value than the collateral\n           surrendered by Lender.\n\nThe new 1980 guaranty, executed by both sides, is agreed to have\n\nsupplanted the original guaranty.\n\n           In 1994, Statler defaulted in its payments on the SBA\n\nloan.   The SBA then demanded payment of the outstanding balance\n\n($1.277 million plus interest) and, unable to pay, Statler filed\n\nfor chapter 11 bankruptcy.      In 1996, with the bankruptcy court's\n\nassent, Statler sold its assets to Tree-Free Fiber Co., LLC., which\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fassumed      Statler's   obligations       under    the    SBA   loan.      Sugarman\n\nconsented to the assumption, reaffirmed his guaranty, and agreed\n\nthat    \"Tree-Free    [could]      sell   machinery       or   equipment    with   an\n\naggregate value up to $25,000 per year\" without SBA consent.\n\n              To carry out its purchase of Statler's assets, Tree-Free\n\nreceived a $6 million loan from a supplier, Thermo Fibertek, Inc.\n\nThe loan was given pursuant to a subordination agreement, which\n\ngranted Thermo Fibertek the first security interest in certain\n\nmachinery and equipment that had previously been subject to the\n\nfirst priority claims of the SBA.               Both the SBA and Sugarman gave\n\ntheir consent to this subordination.\n\n              The following year, Tree Free needed additional financing\n\nto upgrade its facilities and sought a loan from KeyBank, N.A.                     To\n\nhelp Tree Free to secure the loan, the SBA agreed with KeyBank that\n\nthe SBA would give up its first priority on                       certain of the\n\nmortagaged real estate and its first priority security interest in\n\ncertain of the machinery and equipment that backed the promissory\n\nnote.    Sugarman was apparently not told of the transaction and he\n\ndid    not   give   consent   to    the    SBA's    release      of   its   priority\n\npositions.\n\n              At the time, Philip Proulx, then the SBA's chief of\n\nportfolio management, expressed concern in a letter to Tree Free\n\nexecutives about the proposal that the SBA enter into the release.\n\nProulx said that if it subordinated its position and the business\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwere to fail, Sugarman would remain liable under the guaranty but\n\nwithout the protection provided by the SBA's first claim on the\n\nreleased real estate and equipment.1          Nevertheless, the SBA took\n\nthe view that it was entitled to release the collateral without\n\nSugarman's consent and ultimately did so.\n\n             In December 1997, Tree Free defaulted on the loan from\n\nKeyBank     and   the   Maine   Superior   Court   placed   Tree   Free   into\n\nreceivership.       Tree-Free's assets were sold; with its reduced\n\nsecurity position, the SBA received only $350,000 of the $3.5\n\nmillion the sale generated.        As a result, the SBA was left with a\n\ndeficiency on its original loan to Statler in the amount of\n\n$284,688.71, plus additional interest that had accrued.\n\n             The SBA demanded under the 1980 guaranty that Sugarman\n\npay the deficiency. Sugarman denied liability, contending that the\n\nSBA had violated its obligations to him by releasing its first\n\npriority security interests without his consent.              The loan was\n\n\n\n     1\n         The letter stated, in relevant part:\n\n     I would like to point out that considerations other than\n     credit enter our deliberations. We currently have the\n     personal guaranty of the former principal of Statler,\n     which is not now at risk of being called upon, but, which\n     will be if we enter the proposed pari passu arrangement\n     and the business fails.      Although our documentation\n     allows us to take actions we consider prudent and in the\n     best interest of SBA without consent of the guarantor, we\n     have a moral obligation to consider the effects of our\n     action on that individual. Additionally, should we agree\n     to enter agreements which place him at risk of personal\n     loss, we would anticipate litigation....\n\n                                     -5-\n\feventually purchased from the SBA by LPP Mortgage Ltd. (\"LPP\");\n\nstanding now in the SBA's shoes, LPP commenced this law suit in\n\nfederal district court in Massachusetts to recover the deficiency\n\nremaining on the loan to Sugarman.\n\n             In the district court, both parties moved for summary\n\njudgment and the district court denied both motions.              In doing so,\n\nthe court found that the SBA was required under the guaranty to\n\nexhaust whatever collateral it had before turning to Sugarman as a\n\nguarantor. Although (as noted above) boilerplate language provided\n\notherwise, the district court found the typewritten sentences added\n\nin 1980 overrode the boilerplate language in this respect.\n\n             However, the modified guaranty by its terms only required\n\nthe SBA to exhaust its collateral (\"This guaranty is limited to the\n\ndeficiency existing after sale of corporate assets securing the\n\nsubject loan.\").        The district court found it less clear whether\n\nthe   SBA   was   entitled   to     release     collateral   in   1997   without\n\nSugarman's consent.       It therefore conducted a two day bench trial,\n\nhearing     extrinsic    evidence    of   the    parties'    intent.     Proulx,\n\nSugarman and Baseman all testified.\n\n             Proulx testified that, consistent with his letter, he\n\nbelieved the typewritten text had no impact on the SBA's rights to\n\nsubordinate its collateral.          Sugarman and Baseman both testified\n\nthat they understood the language inserted in 1980 to protect\n\nSugarman's interest in having the collateral available and that its\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\frelease   without   his   consent       was   inconsistent   with    this\n\nunderstanding.      Ultimately,   the     district   court   found   that\n\nSugarman's consent was required and it dismissed LPP Mortgage's\n\nclaim.\n\n          The gist of the district court's decisions--one denying\n\nsummary judgment to LPP and the other deciding against it on the\n\nmerits after trial--was as follows: that the guaranty as amended by\n\nthe additional sentences was ambiguous as to whether the SBA could\n\nwithout Sugarman's consent subordinate its first priority in the\n\ncollateral so that extrinsic evidence was proper; and, based on the\n\ntestimony and the parties' dealings, Sugarman's answer--that the\n\nSBA could not do so--was persuasive.\n\n          LPP has appealed, urging various errors; the standard of\n\nreview in this court varies with the claim of error.

The case is not hard to\n\nanalyze but several of the issues are very close calls.\n\n          We start with choice of law which, happily, turns out not\n\nto matter.   In the district court, LPP claimed that Massachusetts\n\nlaw governed, while Sugarman thought Maine law controlled.           They\n\nagreed, however, that there were no substantive differences between\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe two states as to the relevant contract rules and the district\n\ncourt applied a hybrid of the two.            Neither side complains about\n\nthis approach on appeal, and we mention it only because both sides\n\nwere probably wrong.\n\n                Because the guaranty is a contract between a private\n\nparty and an agency of the United States, it appears likely that\n\nfederal common law governs as to contractual issues, 13 C.F.R. §\n\n101.106(b)(2) (2009), borrowing from state law where appropriate\n\nand consistent with federal interests. In some situations, federal\n\ncommon law might give the government an edge; but often ordinary\n\ncontract principles apply and no one argues otherwise here.\n\n              LPP argues first that the district court erred in finding\n\nthe   guaranty    ambiguous    and    conducting   a     trial   on    extrinsic\n\nevidence; specifically, evidence of course of dealing, the context\n\nin which the typed amendment was agreed to, and the parties'\n\nintentions as to the overriding of boilerplate. Whether a contract\n\nis ambiguous is a question of law and our review of the district\n\ncourt's ruling on that issue is plenary.           ITT Corp. v.

LPP is right that the provisions on\n\nwhich it relies do not in the strictest sense conflict with the\n\nadded sentences.              The former give the SBA broad authority to\n\n\n\n        2\n      Courts may look at extrinsic evidence for the \"very purpose\nof deciding whether the documentary expression of a contract is\nambiguous,\"   Donoghue 70 F.3d at 215, for there is the real\npossibility that \"extrinsic evidence may in fact reveal an\nambiguity not otherwise patent.\" Nat'l Tax Inst., Inc. v.

So something is amiss.      And, while one can\n\nargue that the conflict is only between this latter boilerplate\n\nprovision and the added language, the provisions relating to\n\ncollateral are functionally interrelated and Sugarman now has a\n\nplausible argument for looking behind plain wording to see just how\n\nfar the parties intended to repeal the relevant boilerplate.\n\n          Sugarman also has two pieces of extrinsic evidence, short\n\nof testimony about the parties' intent, that might be can openers\n\nfor direct testimony on that subject.        The first is that the SBA\n\ndid seek Sugarman's consent in 1996 when it was agreed that Tree-\n\nFree would receive Statler's assets.      Course of conduct testimony,\n\nfor obvious reasons, troubles courts less than other testimony, and\n\nis widely considered.       See 2 Farnsworth on Contracts § 7.13\n\n(detailing importance of course of dealing and performance in\n\ncontract interpretation).\n\n          The    other   piece   of   concrete   extrinsic   evidence   is\n\nProulx's letter expressing concerns when the SBA agreed with\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fKeyBank to surrender SBA's first priority rights.           It is true that\n\nProulx was not part of the 1980 negotiations and spoke only of a\n\nmoral and not a legal commitment; but it reinforces the connection\n\nbetween the exhaustion obligation and the importance of maintaining\n\nthe collateral intact.       Both the letter and the 1996 consent,\n\nalthough less weighty than might appear, reinforce the court's\n\nfinding of ambiguity.\n\n          This brings us to the merits on the premise that all of\n\nthe evidence may be considered which, as LPP framed its appeal,\n\npresent a series of issues: whether the district court misstated\n\nthe burden of proof, whether it matters, whether the evidence\n\nsupports the court's findings, whether the facts found support the\n\ncourt's   ultimate   determination       that   the   SBA    breached   its\n\nobligations, and whether Sugarman proved injury from such a breach.\n\nThe issues are curiously entangled.\n\n          The district court arguably did, as LPP argues, misstate\n\nthe allocation of burdens of proof, due partly to a confusing\n\ncolloquy with counsel.      LPP, as the party suing on a contractual\n\nguaranty, had to prove the guaranty, the failure to recover on the\n\nnote and the sum remaining unpaid.          Transmedia Rest. Corp. v.\n\nElegant Appetites, Inc., No. 243682, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1616462</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Mass.\n\nApp. Div. Oct. 20, 2000).    But most of this was straightforward and\n\nSugarman's liability turned, primarily, on whether the SBA was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fobliged to get his consent before releasing the collateral--which\n\nadmittedly it did not do.\n\n           The district court said that \"the parties agreed during\n\nthe trial that plaintiff bears the burden of proving the parties'\n\nintent in 1980\" and it found that while Sugarman had introduced\n\nintent   evidence   from   him   and   Baseman;   LPP--according   to   the\n\ndistrict judge--\"failed to meet its burden for the simple reason\n\nthat it failed to proffer any evidence of the SBA's intentions in\n\n1980\"--Proulx having not been involved in the revision and offering\n\nonly his own later view of SBA obligations.\n\n           LPP argues persuasively that it made no such general\n\nconcession.   The pertinent exchanges confirm that LPP twice told\n\nthe district judge that it bore the burden of showing a contract\n\nand its breach but that, to the extent that Sugarman claimed that\n\nhe was excused from performance because of a breach by SBA of an\n\nobligation under the guaranty to get his consent, this was an\n\naffirmative defense on which he bore the burden.3       This may well be\n\nthe better view of the law.      Cf. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Elder\n\nCare Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196723\"><a href=\"/opinion/196723/fdic-v-elder-care-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           After all, Sugarman claims that the guaranty required his\n\nconsent to the SBA's disposal of collateral: he does not say that\n\n\n\n     3\n      The two exchanges, occurring at different times during the\ntrial, are reprinted in an addendum and, in the second one, the\ndistrict judge acknowledges that this is LPP's position.\nSugarman's brief does not effectively respond.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthe language explicitly required it but that it was implicit in the\n\namendment.      It follows that Sugarman would have to show that such\n\na provision implicitly existed and that the explicit boilerplate to\n\nthe contrary had been implicitly disregarded.                     Whether or not one\n\ncalls this an affirmative defense, it feels like something that\n\nSugarman would normally have to show--absent an LPP concession\n\nwhich we think is absent.\n\n            But,       despite    the   district       court's      \"simple       reason\"\n\nstatement    quoted      above,    it   is     clear   to    us    that     the   burden\n\nallocation      made    no   difference      to     critical      factual     findings.\n\nSugarman and his lawyer both testified as to their understanding of\n\nthe contract and the district court credited their testimony; the\n\nSBA   offered    no     direct    evidence     of    the    understanding         of   SBA\n\nofficials    involved        in   the   1980    adjustment;        and    the     limited\n\ncircumstantial evidence supporting Sugarman is undisputed.                             See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 202 cmt. g (1981) (\"The parties\n\nto an agreement know best what they mean\").\n\n            Burden might matter if no witnesses had testified or the\n\ninferences were in perfect equipoise, but given that the district\n\ncourt heard and believed Sugarman, the raw facts are simply not in\n\ndispute.     And here the issue is readily framed but not easily\n\nanswered: is it permissible to move from a solid finding that\n\nSugarman and his lawyer understood the contract to embody a consent\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\frequirement to the more debatable conclusion that the contract\n\nshould be so interpreted?\n\n            After    all,    Sugarman   did   not   claim      that   any   SBA\n\nrepresentative      shared   his   understanding    and   so    conceded;    he\n\ntestified that because the amended language was designed to give\n\nhim the protection of the collateral, it followed that the SBA\n\ncould not release the collateral without his consent.             This is not\n\nnecessarily an unreasonable inference on his part; but the SBA, if\n\nit thought at all, could have thought that at most it had to behave\n\nreasonably as to the collateral--not that it needed Sugarman's\n\nconsent.4\n\n            But even if the SBA had one understanding and Sugarman\n\nanother on this single detail as to the necessity of consent,\n\nmodern contract law would not let either the guaranty or the\n\namendment fail for \"lack of mutual understanding.\" Instead the\n\ncourts would fill the gap with a \"reasonable\" solution, either\n\nattributing it to both sides' intent (conforming to what was taught\n\nwhen judges were in law school) or confessing that this is what\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Courts have read such a reasonableness obligation into SBA\nguaranty contracts absent an agreement to the contrary, Small Bus.\nAdmin. v.

Sugarman's aim had been to get the\n\ncollateral positioned ahead of his own liability; the amendment\n\naccepted   by    the    SBA   clearly    did   this    and,   just    as   clearly,\n\nimplicitly negated the boilerplate to the contrary. Sugarman might\n\nreasonably think it equally implicit that the collateral could not\n\nbe disposed of without his consent.\n\n              Although Sugarman's lawyer drafted the added sentences,\n\nit was the SBA that insisted on retaining all of the boilerplate\n\nincluding language flatly contrary to the addendum.                   Each can be\n\nregarded as the drafter of part of the contract, so the maxim of\n\ncontra proferentem uselessly runs against both, 2 Farnsworth on\n\nContracts § 7.11 at 300-04; but the SBA is the main cause of the\n\nmuddle   by    accepting      the   modification      and   then   (according   to\n\nBaseman) refusing to accept any adjustment in the boilerplate.\n\n              Finally, we have Proulx's letter acknowledging a \"moral\"\n\nobligation      not    to   release   the   collateral      and    admitting   that\n\nSugarman was safe if the release did not occur; the fact that the\n\nSBA did secure Sugarman's consent in the earlier limited release of\n\ncollateral; and the failure of LPP to secure any SBA witness\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\foffering a different understanding of events.   However limited the\n\nweight of such considerations, they are certainly not helpful to\n\nLPP's position.\n\n          In the end, the district court's decision as to the need\n\nfor consent is reasonable and a remand to recast slightly the\n\nrationale would serve no purpose.     This brings us to LPP's very\n\nbrief final argument, which is that Sugarman failed to show damages\n\nfrom the release of the collateral without his consent.   It might\n\nbe a nice question, not briefed by either side, whether an implicit\n\nrequirement of consent was a condition of Sugarman's liability or\n\nmerely an independent breach for which he had to show damages.\n\n          The failure to brief the issue could be fatal to LPP but\n\nthere is a good reason why it has not devoted much attention to the\n\ndamages issue.    Proulx's letter said that Sugarman was safe just\n\nbefore the collateral was released; it is fair enough to treat this\n\nas proof that, but for the release, he would owe nothing.    This,\n\nseemingly, is what the district court did, and to this view LPP\n\noffers no rebuttal.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f                              ADDENDUM\n\nInitial exchange regarding burden of proof:\n\nTHE COURT: . . . .
