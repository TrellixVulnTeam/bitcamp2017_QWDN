Minick, Office of Immigration Litigation, Peter D.\nKeisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division and Christopher\nC. Fuller, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           December 21, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam.    Veston Volcy petitions for judicial review\n\nof a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that\n\naffirmed without opinion the decision of an Immigration Judge (IJ)\n\ndenying Volcy's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT).   When the BIA affirms the IJ's decision without\n\nrendering its own opinion, we review the IJ's decision as the\n\ndecision of the BIA.    Ymeri v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   Upon consideration of the parties' briefs and the record,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n          The IJ concluded that Volcy was not credible in his\n\nclaims of past persecution or fear of future persecution.        We\n\nreview the finding of credibility under a deferential substantial\n\nevidence standard, Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nand uphold a denial of asylum unless an applicant puts forth\n\nevidence \"so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to\n\nfind the requisite fear of persecution.\"     INS v. Elias-Zacarias,\n\n502 U.S. 478, 483-84 (1992).    \"[T]he IJ must, if he or she chooses\n\nto reject [the petitioner's] testimony as lacking credibility,\n\noffer a specific, cogent reason for [the IJ's] disbelief.\" Gailius\n\nv. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted).    The IJ's decision adequately details the\n\nreasons for his disbelief, e.g., the discrepancies among Volcy's\n\nvarious statements, the questionable validity of the KONAKOM ID\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fcard, and his skepticism whether it was likely that, as Volcy\n\nclaims, Volcy would be viewed as a threat to the government and\n\nhunted and harmed for making statements about land reform.                       The\n\nIJ's finding was sufficiently detailed and supported by substantial\n\nevidence. Volcy's appellate brief does not effectively counter the\n\nIJ's decision and neither his evidence below nor his arguments here\n\ncompel a conclusion contrary to that decision.\n\n             Because   Volcy   does     not    satisfy   the    less      stringent\n\nstandard for asylum, a fortiori, he is unable to satisfy the test\n\nfor withholding of removal.         See Afful v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 1, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 2004), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Nov. 3, 2004) (No.\n\n04-7117).     Similarly, to obtain relief under CAT, Volcy must show\n\nthat it is more likely than not he would be tortured upon return to\n\nhis country, a higher burden of proof than an asylum claim, which\n\nrequires that he show a well founded fear of persecution. Settenda\n\nv. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 94 (1st Cir. 2004).                 Volcy's appellate\n\nbrief makes no particular argument addressed to his CAT claim.                    In\n\nany event, although we have rejected a per se rule that an adverse\n\ncredibility     determination      on   asylum    automatically        defeats    an\n\napplication under CAT, we have acknowledged that it would doom\n\nsome.    Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d at 95.           This is such a case.\n\nThe IJ's adverse credibility finding effectively undermines any\n\npart    of   Volcy's   testimony    that      could   serve    as   the   relevant\n\nfoundation for a successful claim under CAT.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f          Therefore, we affirm the decision denying the application\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. In light\n\nof that affirmance, Volcy's renewed motion to stay removal pending\n\nour consideration of this petition for review is denied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
