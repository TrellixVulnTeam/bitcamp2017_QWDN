Drinan for petitioner.\n\n     Daniel Meron, Civil Division, with whom Peter D. Keisler,\nAssistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and David V. Bernal and\nM. Jocelyn Lopez Wright, Assistant Directors, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, were on brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           June 3, 2004\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           On July 24, 2003, this court\n\naffirmed a September 2002 decision by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) denying asylum and withholding of deportation to Said\n\nGuirguis Khalil.       Khalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 54, 56 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). The BIA had granted Khalil a thirty-day period of voluntary\n\ndeparture, which expired while his petition for review was pending\n\nbefore this court.         We, as a matter of grace, reinstated that\n\nthirty-day departure period so that Khalil could leave the country\n\nvoluntarily without incurring the penalties for forcible removal.\n\nId. at 56.    In doing so, we applied the rule of Umanzor-Alvarado v.\n\nINS, 896 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1990) (Breyer, J.), which held that\n\ncourts have the inherent equitable authority to decide on a case-\n\nby-case basis to reinstate the period of voluntary departure\n\nearlier granted by the BIA as part of their review of petitions\n\nchallenging BIA actions.       Id. at 16.      The penalties for failing to\n\ndepart   within    the    designated    voluntary      departure   period   are\n\nsignificant.      Violators may be fined $1,000 to $5,000 and are\n\nineligible for ten years for further grants of voluntary departure,\n\ncancellation      of    removal,   adjustment     of     status,   change    of\n\nnonimmigrant classification, or creation of a record of lawful\n\nadmission for permanent residence.              8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d).         In\n\naddition, if a default removal order has been entered, violators\n\nmay be deported and, accordingly, be prevented from returning to\n\nthe United States without the prior consent of the Attorney General\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffor either five or ten years, depending on the circumstances.\n\nSee id. § 1182(a)(9)(A).\n\n          Khalil did not leave within the thirty days he had been\n\ngiven by this court.   Instead, Khalil waited (without seeking an\n\nextension of that thirty-day period) to see how this court would\n\ndecide the instant case: a second petition for review, filed\n\nearlier on July 2, 2003, from the BIA's denial of his separate\n\nmotion to reopen for adjustment of status.       The BIA had denied\n\nKhalil's petition on the ground that he was not eligible for\n\nadjustment of status because he had overstayed the voluntary\n\ndeparture period originally granted by the BIA in September 2002.\n\nKhalil did not seek any interim relief from this court pending\n\nreview of his second petition.    In this petition, he argues that\n\nour earlier reinstatement of the privilege of voluntary departure\n\nfor a limited period operates retroactively and means that the\n\nBIA's basis for denying his motion to reopen is now wrong.\n\n          We affirm the BIA's decision and hold that this court's\n\nreinstatement of the privilege of voluntary departure did not have\n\nretroactive effect and thus does not provide a basis to overturn\n\nthe BIA's denial of Khalil's motion to reopen.\n\n          We also outline, for the purpose of alerting aliens and\n\nthe bar to the issue, a broader argument that the respondent chose\n\nto make in this case: that federal courts lack the power to\n\nreinstate the privilege of voluntary departure as part of their\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\freview     of     petitions    challenging        BIA    actions     and,       in   the\n\nalternative, that if the courts have such power, it is restricted\n\nto situations in which a petitioner moved for a stay from the court\n\nbefore    the     voluntary    departure        period   granted     by   the    agency\n\nexpired.            The     respondent,          recognizing       that     Umanzor-\n\nAlvarado conflicts with its position, identifies changes in the\n\nstatutory scheme and asks us to overrule that case.                  We reserve the\n\nissue of the bounds of this court's authority for another case\n\nwhere resolution of that issue is required.\n\n                                          I.\n\n             On September 23, 2002, the BIA affirmed an immigration\n\njudge's order denying Khalil asylum and withholding of deportation,\n\nand   gave      Khalil    thirty   days   from     the   date   of   the    order    to\n\nvoluntarily depart.         Khalil had claimed religious persecution as a\n\nCoptic Christian in Egypt.            The BIA's order included a written\n\nnotice outlining the statutory penalties for failing to depart\n\nwithin the allotted time.          The BIA also entered a default order of\n\nremoval to Egypt if Khalil failed to depart on time.\n\n             Khalil did not depart, but appealed the BIA's order to\n\nthis court on October 22, 2002.                  He asked the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS)1 to extend his period of voluntary\n\n\n      1\n          In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(BICE). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fdeparture pending our review.          The INS denied his request and set\n\na new January 9, 2003 departure date.\n\n              On November 26, 2002, he filed a separate motion with the\n\nBIA to reopen proceedings in order to adjust his status based on an\n\nimmigrant visa petition filed by his employer and approved by the\n\nINS on November 18. See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(1) (allowing adjustment\n\nof   status    based   on   such   a   visa   petition,   provided    certain\n\nconditions are fulfilled). Khalil did not raise in that motion the\n\npossible effect of an order from this court reinstating the period\n\nof voluntary departure.\n\n              The January 9 deadline passed, but Khalil did not leave.\n\nNor did he file with this court a motion to stay removal or toll\n\nthe running of the period for voluntary departure.2                  We note,\n\nthough, that the INS had neither detained Khalil nor scheduled him\n\nfor removal, so there was no event (apart from the passing of the\n\nJanuary 9 deadline) that would have prompted Khalil to seek a stay\n\nfrom the court.\n\n              The BIA denied the motion to reopen on June 2, 2003 on\n\nthe ground that Khalil was statutorily ineligible to apply for\n\nadjustment of status because he had overstayed the January 9\n\n\n\n      2\n          To qualify for a stay of removal, a petitioner must\ndemonstrate (1) likelihood of success on the merits of the\nunderlying appeal; (2) potential for irreparable harm absent the\nstay; (3) that the balance of interests weighs in favor of granting\nthe stay; and (4) that the stay would not disserve the public\ninterest. See Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdeadline for voluntary departure.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d).           On\n\nJuly 2, 2003, Khalil filed the instant petition for review of that\n\ndenial.\n\n            Meanwhile, Khalil's appeal on his first petition was\n\nstill pending in this court.     On July 24, 2003, this court affirmed\n\nthe BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of deportation and\n\nreinstated the thirty-day period of voluntary departure originally\n\ngranted by the BIA, citing Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    Khalil, 337 F.3d at 56.        The panel was not made aware of\n\nKhalil's expired January 9, 2003 departure deadline.3\n\n            Mandate issued on October 23, 2003 without the respondent\n\nhaving    petitioned   for   rehearing    by   the   panel   or   en   banc   to\n\nchallenge the reinstatement order.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            On appeal from the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen,\n\nKhalil does not contest that if he had overstayed his period of\n\nvoluntary departure, he would in fact be statutorily ineligible for\n\nadjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), and his motion to\n\nreopen would have been properly denied. Instead, he argues that he\n\ndid not overstay his departure period because this court's July 24,\n\n2003 reinstatement of the voluntary departure period retroactively\n\n\n\n     3\n          Khalil did not request reinstatement of voluntary\ndeparture in that appeal, and therefore the respondent had no\noccasion to argue that the court lacked the power to grant such\nreinstatement.\n\n                                   -6-\n\foperated to extend his period of departure beyond January 9, 2003.\n\nAccordingly, he urges that the BIA's decision be vacated and\n\nremanded with instructions to treat him as statutorily eligible for\n\nadjustment of status or, in the alternative, to consider the effect\n\nof this court's reinstatement of voluntary departure.\n\n            As the respondent correctly points out, Khalil did not\n\nraise the possible effect of any reinstatement order from this\n\ncourt with the BIA in his motion to reopen.         Nor did he return to\n\nthe BIA once our reinstatement order was issued.          As a result, he\n\nhas likely waived the issue.        Nonetheless, we reach the issue in\n\norder to settle the question he raises.\n\n            We reject Khalil's argument.          Ordinarily, grants of\n\nequitable relief apply prospectively rather than retroactively.\n\nThat   is   why,   for   example,   plaintiffs   must   show   a   need   for\n\nprospective relief in order to obtain an injunction.           See Lopez v.\n\nGarriga, 917 F.2d 63, 67-68 (1st Cir. 1990).        Khalil has not cited\n\nany authority, or even any reason, for viewing the reinstatement by\n\na court of appeals of a limited period for voluntary departure any\n\ndifferently. This court's reinstatement of voluntary departure was\n\nnot intended to apply retroactively.        Nor should it be understood\n\nthat way: Black's Law Dictionary defines \"reinstate\" as \"to place\n\nagain in a former state or position; to restore.\"              Black's Law\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fDictionary at 1290 (7th ed. 1999).          We were restarting the clock on\n\na period that had already run.4\n\n            The    reinstatement      of    the       privilege      of    voluntary\n\ndeparture, which operates prospectively, gives a petitioner an\n\nopportunity, after taking his appeal, to depart at his own expense\n\nto a country of his own choosing without facing the adverse\n\nconsequences      of   deportation.        See    8   U.S.C.    §    1182(a)(9)(A)\n\n(explaining those consequences). It does not retroactively nullify\n\nthe fact that a petitioner overstayed his original period of\n\nvoluntary   departure.       Khalil    was       statutorily        ineligible      for\n\nadjustment of status at the time of the BIA's decision and remains\n\nso today.\n\n            The    respondent   raises       questions         about      whether     a\n\nreinstated period of voluntary departure begins running from the\n\ndate of this court's decision or from the issuance of mandate and\n\nwhether the period is stayed if the alien seeks review in the\n\nSupreme Court.5        We need not -- and do not -- address those\n\nquestions today because, under any interpretation, it is clear that\n\nKhalil has overstayed and abused the time he was given by this\n\ncourt, and so has again lost the privilege of voluntary departure.\n\n\n     4\n          We further note that adoption of Khalil's position would\nobviously undercut the finality of decisions by the BIA and this\ncourt.\n     5\n          We held in Umanzor-Alvarado that the period runs from the\ndate that this court's mandate issues. 896 F.2d at 16. We have\nnot since revisited that question.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f                                 III.\n\n          Although this opinion could end there, we think it better\n\nto note but not decide two challenges raised by the respondent to\n\nthis court's authority to reinstate voluntary departure in its\n\ndecision on a petition for review. This discussion is meant simply\n\nto outline some of the relevant arguments; it should not be\n\nconstrued as a prediction as to how the questions raised by the\n\nrespondent should be answered.\n\n          The respondent first asserts, in the broader of its two\n\nchallenges, that this court lacks the authority ever to stay or\n\nreinstate voluntary departure because the respondent reads the\n\ncurrent version of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as\n\nvesting such authority solely in the INS.     Fourteen years ago,\n\nunder a different version of the INA, this court rejected that\n\nargument, holding that we may reinstate voluntary departure as part\n\nof our inherent equitable authority to order the appropriate remedy\n\nin a case before us.   Id.\n\n          Six years later, in 1996, Congress passed the Illegal\n\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). Pub.\n\nL. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996).   The IIRIRA included a\n\nseries of amendments to the INA, some of which limited the courts'\n\nreview of various discretionary decisions by the Attorney General,\n\nsee Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471,\n\n485 (1999), but none of which expressly addressed the power of the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fcourts of appeals, as part of their review of petitions properly\n\nbefore them, to reinstate periods of voluntary departure previously\n\ngranted by the BIA.\n\n           The respondent argues that the IIRIRA undermined the\n\nreasoning behind Umanzor-Alvarado and requires us to overturn that\n\ncase.     First,    the    respondent   contends,      Umanzor-Alvarado      was\n\nmotivated primarily by the concern that absent an order reinstating\n\nvoluntary departure after review, aliens would be forced to choose\n\nbetween   seeking   judicial    review      and    leaving   within    the   time\n\nallotted for voluntary departure.           That was because the pre-IIRIRA\n\nversion of the INA barred courts from reviewing removal orders if\n\nthe alien in question had departed the country.                      8 U.S.C. §\n\n1105a(c) (1994) (repealed).          The respondent points out, however,\n\nthat the IIRIRA has eliminated that provision, thus permitting an\n\nalien who has voluntarily departed or who has been deported to\n\ncontinue his appeal.\n\n           Second, the respondent points to 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2),\n\nwhich provides that \"[p]ermission to depart voluntarily under this\n\nsubsection shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days,\" and\n\nargues that judicial reinstatement of voluntary departure will\n\noften impermissibly extend the period beyond this statutory limit.\n\nThe respondent also relies on 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f), which states\n\nthat \"[a]uthority     to    extend    the   time    within   which    to   depart\n\nvoluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fBoard is only within the jurisdiction of the district director.\"\n\nThat statute and that regulation, however, both describe the\n\nauthority of the Attorney General, not that of the courts.                See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229c(b) (describing the circumstances in which \"[t]he\n\nAttorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the\n\nUnited    States\");   8   C.F.R.   §    1240.26   (regulation    labeled     as\n\n\"Voluntary departure -- authority of the Executive Office for\n\nImmigration Review\").      The provisions that describe the authority\n\nof the courts provide instead that \"[j]udicial review of a final\n\norder of removal . . . is governed only by chapter 158 of Title\n\n28.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1).         In turn, chapter 158 of Title 28\n\nprovides that \"[t]he filing of the petition to review does not of\n\nitself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the agency,\n\nbut the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend,\n\nin whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final\n\nhearing and determination of the petition.\"              28 U.S.C. § 2349(b)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            The respondent's broader challenge has been rejected by\n\ntwo circuits, see Nwakanma v. Ashcroft, 352 F.3d 325, 327 (6th Cir.\n\n2003); El Himri v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1261, 1262 (9th Cir. 2003)\n\n(adopting Zazueta-Carrillo v. Ashcroft, 322 F.3d 1166, 1175-78 (9th\n\nCir.   2003)   (Berzon,   J.,   concurring)),      and    accepted   by   one,\n\nsee Reynoso-Lopez v. Ashcroft, No. 02-3278 (3d Cir. May 25, 2004).\n\nBoth circuits that have rejected the respondent's argument have\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fexpressed the concern that, particularly in asylum cases, aliens\n\nwho voluntarily depart may be returning to home countries where\n\nthey are unsafe or, even if safe, will not be allowed to return to\n\nthe United States should they be successful on judicial review.\n\nSee Nwakanma, 352 F.3d at 327; Zazueta-Carrillo, 322 F.3d at 1176-\n\n77.   While aliens in these situations may formally retain their\n\nright to appeal under the post-IIRIRA statute after leaving this\n\ncountry, their purpose in seeking an appeal is arguably thwarted.\n\nSee Zazueta-Carrillo, 322 F.3d at 1177. Those two courts concluded\n\nthat although court-ordered stays of voluntary departure delay\n\ndeparture and may impose costs on the government, such stays are\n\nnecessary in some cases to ensure the right to meaningful judicial\n\nreview.\n\n            Additionally, those two courts rejected the respondent's\n\nargument under 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2) and 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f) on\n\nthe ground that a stay or reinstatement of voluntary departure did\n\nnot \"extend\" the period for departure, but instead merely restarted\n\nthe clock for the running of the departure period designated by the\n\nagency.    See Nwakanma, 352 F.3d at 327; Zazueta-Carrillo, 322 F.3d\n\nat 1176.\n\n            Perhaps   recognizing    these   concerns,   the   respondent\n\noffered a second, more limited challenge to the courts' authority\n\nto reinstate voluntary departure at oral argument.        The respondent\n\ncontends that even assuming (without conceding) that courts have\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fthe power, either by statute or inherently, to reinstate voluntary\n\ndeparture when they decide a petition for review, they may do so\n\nonly when the petitioner filed a motion with the court before the\n\ndeparture period expired to stay removal or to toll the running of\n\nthe period of voluntary departure.         The Ninth Circuit recently\n\nadopted this position in Garcia v. Ashcroft, No. 02-71630 (9th Cir.\n\nMay 27, 2004).   The respondent further argues that the fact that a\n\npetitioner has not been detained or scheduled for deportation does\n\nnot excuse the alien's failure to file such a motion.        This policy,\n\nthe respondent argues, is necessary to ensure that the court has\n\nthe opportunity to determine whether the traditional four-part test\n\nfor a stay, which requires, inter alia, a showing of a substantial\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits of the underlying petition, has\n\nbeen met.   See Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nIf voluntary departure can be stayed or reinstated without such a\n\nshowing, the respondent warns, petitioners will be encouraged to\n\nfile frivolous    appeals   merely   to   extend   their   stays   in   this\n\ncountry.    The IIRIRA, the respondent urges, eliminated provisions\n\nof the INA that automatically stayed removal upon the filing of a\n\npetition for judicial review to address precisely such concerns.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(3)(B) (a petition for review does not stay\n\nremoval unless a court orders otherwise).      Khalil's brief does not\n\naddress any of the respondent's arguments on this issue, so we\n\noutline no arguments for a contrary conclusion.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            The respondent's arguments, whatever their merits, raise\n\nconcerns about notice to the bar and aliens of the respondent's\n\npresent position.     Since Umanzor-Alvarado, this court's practice\n\nwhen the agency has granted a period for voluntary departure has\n\nbeen to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to reinstate that\n\ndeparture period upon rendering our decision on the underlying\n\npetition.    See, e.g., Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 55, 59 (1st\n\nCir. 2003);    Disu v. Ashcroft, 338 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nQuevedo v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 39, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2003); Yatskin,\n\n255 F.3d at 11.      The practice of the bar in this circuit, we\n\nobserve, has been not to file motions with this court to toll or to\n\nstay the running of the period of voluntary departure pending\n\njudicial review.    We are unaware of any rules promulgated by the\n\nINS giving notice to the bar and aliens of the position that the\n\nrespondent has taken in this litigation.   No doubt this court will\n\nin a later case be required to resolve these questions.

Ashcroft,</i> 337 F.3d 50, 54, 56 (1st Cir.2003). The BIA had granted Khalil a thirty-day period of voluntary departure, which expired while his petition for review was pending before this court. We, as a matter of grace, reinstated that thirty-day departure period so that Khalil could leave the country voluntarily without incurring the penalties for forcible removal. <i>Id.</i> at 56. In doing so, we applied the rule of <i>Umanzor-Alvarado v. INS,</i> 896 F.2d 14 (1st Cir.1990) (Breyer, J.), which held that courts have the inherent equitable authority to decide on a case-by-case basis to reinstate the period of voluntary departure earlier granted by the BIA as part of their review of petitions challenging BIA actions. <i>Id.</i> at 16. The penalties for failing to depart within the designated voluntary departure period are significant. Violators may be fined $1,000 to $5,000 and are ineligible for ten years for further grants of voluntary departure, cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, change of nonimmigrant classification, or creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d). In addition, if a default removal order has been entered, violators may be deported and, accordingly, be prevented from returning to the United States without the prior consent of the Attorney General for either five or ten years, depending on the circumstances. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1182(a)(9)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Khalil did not leave within the thirty days he had been given by this court. Instead, Khalil waited (without seeking an extension of that thirty-day period) to see how this court would decide the instant case: a second petition for review, filed earlier on July 2, 2003, from the BIA's denial of his separate motion to reopen for adjustment of status. The BIA had denied Khalil's petition on the ground that he was not eligible for adjustment of status because he had overstayed the voluntary departure period originally granted by the BIA in September 2002. Khalil did not seek any interim relief from this court pending review of his second petition. In this petition, he argues that our earlier reinstatement of the privilege of voluntary departure for a limited period operates retroactively and means that the BIA's basis for denying his motion to reopen is now wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the BIA's decision and hold that this court's reinstatement of the privilege of voluntary departure did not have retroactive effect and thus does not provide a basis to overturn the BIA's denial of Khalil's motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also outline, for the purpose of alerting aliens and the bar to the issue, a broader argument that the respondent chose to make in this case: that federal courts lack the power to reinstate the privilege of voluntary departure as part of their review of petitions challenging BIA actions and, in the alternative, that if the courts have such power, it is restricted to situations in which a petitioner moved for a stay from the court before the voluntary departure period granted by the agency expired. The respondent, recognizing that <i>Umanzor-Alvarado</i> conflicts with its position, identifies changes in the statutory scheme and asks us to overrule that case. We reserve the issue of the bounds of this court's authority for another case where resolution of that issue is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 23, 2002, the BIA affirmed an immigration judge's order denying Khalil asylum and withholding of deportation, and gave Khalil thirty days from the date of the order to voluntarily depart. Khalil had claimed religious persecution as a Coptic Christian in Egypt. The BIA's order included a written notice outlining the statutory penalties for failing to depart within the allotted time. The BIA also entered a default order of removal to Egypt if Khalil failed to depart on time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Khalil did not depart, but appealed the BIA's order to this court on October 22, 2002. He asked the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to extend his period of voluntary departure pending our review. The INS denied his request and set a new January 9, 2003 departure date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 26, 2002, he filed a separate motion with the BIA to reopen proceedings in order to adjust his status based on an immigrant visa petition filed by his employer and approved by the INS on November 18. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i)(1) (allowing adjustment of status based on such a visa petition, provided certain conditions are fulfilled). Khalil did not raise in that motion the possible effect of an order from this court reinstating the period of voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 9 deadline passed, but Khalil did not leave. Nor did he file with this court a motion to stay removal or toll the running of the period for voluntary departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We note, though, that the INS had neither detained Khalil nor scheduled him for removal, so there was no event (apart from the passing of the January 9 deadline) that would have prompted Khalil to seek a stay from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA denied the motion to reopen on June 2, 2003 on the ground that Khalil was statutorily ineligible to apply for adjustment of status because he had overstayed the January 9 deadline for voluntary departure. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d). On July 2, 2003, Khalil filed the instant petition for review of that denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Khalil's appeal on his first petition was still pending in this court. On July 24, 2003, this court affirmed the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of deportation and reinstated the thirty-day period of voluntary departure originally granted by the BIA, citing <i>Yatskin v. INS,</i> 255 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir.2001). <i>Khalil,</i> 337 F.3d at 56. The panel was not made aware of Khalil's expired January 9, 2003 departure deadline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mandate issued on October 23, 2003 without the respondent having petitioned for rehearing by the panel or en banc to challenge the reinstatement order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal from the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen, Khalil does not contest that if he had overstayed his period of voluntary departure, he would in fact be statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d), and his motion to reopen would have been properly denied. Instead, he argues that he did not overstay his departure period because this court's July 24, 2003 reinstatement of the voluntary departure period <i>retroactively</i> operated to extend his period of departure beyond January 9, 2003. Accordingly, he urges that the BIA's decision be vacated and remanded with instructions to treat him as statutorily eligible for adjustment of status or, in the alternative, to consider the effect of this court's reinstatement of voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the respondent correctly points out, Khalil did not raise the possible effect of any reinstatement order from this court with the BIA in his motion to reopen. Nor did he return to the BIA once our reinstatement order was issued. As a result, he has likely waived the issue. Nonetheless, we reach the issue in order to settle the question he raises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Khalil's argument. Ordinarily, grants of equitable relief apply prospectively rather than retroactively. That is why, for example, plaintiffs must show a need for prospective relief in order to obtain an injunction. <i>See Lopez v. Garriga,</i> 917 F.2d 63, 67-68 (1st Cir.1990). Khalil has not cited any authority, or even any reason, for viewing the reinstatement by a court of appeals of a limited period for voluntary departure any differently. This court's reinstatement of voluntary departure was not intended to apply retroactively. Nor should it be understood that way: <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> defines \"reinstate\" as \"to place again in a former state or position; to restore.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> at 1290 (7th ed.1999). We were restarting the clock on a period that had already run.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reinstatement of the privilege of voluntary departure, which operates prospectively, gives a petitioner an opportunity, after taking his appeal, to depart at his own expense to a country of his own choosing without facing the adverse consequences of deportation. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(A) (explaining those consequences). It does not retroactively nullify the fact that a petitioner overstayed his original period of voluntary departure. Khalil was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status at the time of the BIA's decision and remains so today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent raises questions about whether a reinstated period of voluntary departure begins running from the date of this court's decision or from the issuance of mandate and whether the period is stayed if the alien seeks review in the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We need not &#8212; and do not &#8212; address those questions today because, under any interpretation, it is clear that Khalil has overstayed and abused the time he was given by this court, and so has again lost the privilege of voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this opinion could end there, we think it better to note but not decide two challenges raised by the respondent to this court's authority to reinstate voluntary departure in its decision on a petition for review. This discussion is meant simply to outline some of the relevant arguments; it should not be construed as a prediction as to how the questions raised by the respondent should be answered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent first asserts, in the broader of its two challenges, that this court lacks the authority ever to stay or reinstate voluntary departure because the respondent reads the current version of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as vesting such authority solely in the INS. Fourteen years ago, under a different version of the INA, this court rejected that argument, holding that we may reinstate voluntary departure as part of our inherent equitable authority to order the appropriate remedy in a case before us. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six years later, in 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996). The IIRIRA included a series of amendments to the INA, some of which limited the courts' review of various discretionary decisions by the Attorney General, <i>see Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,</i> 525 U.S. 471, 485, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999), but none of which expressly addressed the power of the courts of appeals, as part of their review of petitions properly before them, to reinstate periods of voluntary departure previously granted by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent argues that the IIRIRA undermined the reasoning behind <i>Umanzor-Alvarado</i> and requires us to overturn that case. First, the respondent contends, <i>Umanzor-Alvarado</i> was motivated primarily by the concern that absent an order reinstating voluntary departure after review, aliens would be forced to choose between seeking judicial review and leaving within the time allotted for voluntary departure. That was because the pre-IIRIRA version of the INA barred courts from reviewing removal orders if the alien in question had departed the country. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(c) (1994) (repealed). The respondent points out, however, that the IIRIRA has eliminated that provision, thus permitting an alien who has voluntarily departed or who has been deported to continue his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the respondent points to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(b)(2), which provides that \"[p]ermission to depart voluntarily under this subsection shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days,\" and argues that judicial reinstatement of voluntary departure will often impermissibly extend the period beyond this statutory limit. The respondent also relies on 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1240.26(f), which states that \"[a]uthority to extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the Board is only within the jurisdiction of the district director.\" That statute and that regulation, however, both describe the authority of the <i>Attorney General,</i> not that of the courts. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(b) (describing the circumstances in which \"[t]he Attorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States\"); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1240.26 (regulation labeled as \"Voluntary departure &#8212; authority of the Executive Office for Immigration Review\"). The provisions that describe the authority of the <i>courts</i> provide instead that \"[j]udicial review of a final order of removal ... is governed only by chapter 158 of Title 28.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(1). In turn, chapter 158 of Title 28 provides that \"[t]he filing of the petition to review does not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the agency, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or <i>suspend,</i> in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2349(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent's broader challenge has been rejected by two circuits, <i>see Nwakanma v. Ashcroft,</i> 352 F.3d 325, 327 (6th Cir.2003); <i>El Himri v. Ashcroft,</i> 344 F.3d 1261, 1262 (9th Cir.2003) (adopting <i>Zazueta-Carrillo v. Ashcroft,</i> 322 F.3d 1166, 1175-78 (9th Cir.2003) (Berzon, J., concurring)), and accepted by one, <i>see Reynoso-Lopez v. Ashcroft,</i> 369 F.3d 275 (3d Cir.2004). Both circuits that have rejected the respondent's argument have expressed the concern that, particularly in asylum cases, aliens who voluntarily depart may be returning to home countries where they are unsafe or, even if safe, will not be allowed to return to the United States should they be successful on judicial review. <i>See Nwakanma,</i> 352 F.3d at 327; <i>Zazueta-Carrillo,</i> 322 F.3d at 1176-77. While aliens in these situations may formally retain their right to appeal under the post-IIRIRA statute after leaving this country, their purpose in seeking an appeal is arguably thwarted. <i>See Zazueta-Carrillo,</i> 322 F.3d at 1177. Those two courts concluded that although court-ordered stays of voluntary departure delay departure and may impose costs on the government, such stays are necessary in some cases to ensure the right to meaningful judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, those two courts rejected the respondent's argument under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(b)(2) and 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1240.26(f) on the ground that a stay or reinstatement of voluntary departure did not \"extend\" the period for departure, but instead merely restarted the clock for the running of the departure period designated by the agency. <i>See Nwakanma,</i> 352 F.3d at 327; <i>Zazueta-Carrillo,</i> 322 F.3d at 1176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps recognizing these concerns, the respondent offered a second, more limited challenge to the courts' authority to reinstate voluntary departure at oral argument. The respondent contends that even assuming (without conceding) that courts have the power, either by statute or inherently, to reinstate voluntary departure when they decide a petition for review, they may do so only when the petitioner filed a motion with the court before the departure period expired to stay removal or to toll the running of the period of voluntary departure. The Ninth Circuit recently adopted this position in <i>Garcia v. Ashcroft,</i> 368 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2004). The respondent further argues that the fact that a petitioner has not been detained or scheduled for deportation does not excuse the alien's failure to file such a motion. This policy, the respondent argues, is necessary to ensure that the court has the opportunity to determine whether the traditional four-part test for a stay, which requires, inter alia, a showing of a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying petition, has been met. <i>See Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> 344 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2003). If voluntary departure can be stayed or reinstated without such a showing, the respondent warns, petitioners will be encouraged to file frivolous appeals merely to extend their stays in this country. The IIRIRA, the respondent urges, eliminated provisions of the INA that automatically stayed removal upon the filing of a petition for judicial review to address precisely such concerns. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(3)(B) (a petition for review does not stay removal unless a court orders otherwise). Khalil's brief does not address any of the respondent's arguments on this issue, so we outline no arguments for a contrary conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent's arguments, whatever their merits, raise concerns about notice to the bar and aliens of the respondent's present position. Since <i>Umanzor-Alvarado,</i> this court's practice when the agency has granted a period for voluntary departure has been to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to reinstate that departure period upon rendering our decision on the underlying petition. <i>See, e.g., Velasquez v. Ashcroft,</i> 342 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Disu v. Ashcroft,</i> 338 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Quevedo v. Ashcroft,</i> 336 F.3d 39, 45-46 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Yatskin,</i> 255 F.3d at 11. The practice of the bar in this circuit, we observe, has been not to file motions with this court to toll or to stay the running of the period of voluntary departure pending judicial review. We are unaware of any rules promulgated by the INS giving notice to the bar and aliens of the position that the respondent has taken in this litigation. No doubt this court will in a later case be required to resolve these questions. We would encourage the attention of the bar and potential amici on both sides to the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of the motion to reopen is <i>affirmed.</i> Khalil, having failed to depart earlier within the time permitted by this court, has lost the privilege of voluntary departure as well as the right to petition further for adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were transferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and reorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE).

Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200567\"><a href=\"/opinion/200567/khalil-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54, 56 (1st Cir.2003). The BIA had granted Khalil a thirty-day period of voluntary departure, which expired while his petition for review was pending before this court. We, as a matter of grace, reinstated that thirty-day departure period so that Khalil could leave the country voluntarily without incurring the penalties for forcible removal. <i>Id.</i> at 56. In doing so, we applied the rule of <i>Umanzor-Alvarado v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536518\"><a href=\"/opinion/536518/florentin-umanzor-alvarado-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990) (Breyer, J.), which held that courts have the inherent equitable authority to decide on a case-by-case basis to reinstate the period of voluntary departure earlier granted by the BIA as part of their review of petitions challenging BIA actions. <i>Id.</i> at 16. The penalties for failing to depart within the designated voluntary departure period are significant. Violators may be fined $1,000 to $5,000 and are ineligible for ten years for further grants of voluntary departure, cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, change of nonimmigrant classification, or creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d). In addition, if a default removal order has been entered, violators may be deported and, accordingly, be prevented from returning to the United States without the prior consent of the Attorney General for either five or ten years, depending on the circumstances. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1182(a)(9)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Khalil did not leave within the thirty days he had been given by this court. Instead, Khalil waited (without seeking an extension of that thirty-day period) to see how this court would decide the instant case: a second petition for review, filed earlier on July 2, 2003, from the BIA's denial of his separate motion to reopen for adjustment of status. The BIA had denied Khalil's petition on the ground that he was not eligible for adjustment of status because he had overstayed the voluntary departure period originally granted by the BIA in September 2002. Khalil did not seek any interim relief from this court pending review of his second petition. In this petition, he argues that our earlier reinstatement of the privilege of voluntary departure for a limited period operates retroactively and means that the BIA's basis for denying his motion to reopen is now wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the BIA's decision and hold that this court's reinstatement of the privilege of voluntary departure did not have retroactive effect and thus does not provide a basis to overturn the BIA's denial of Khalil's motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also outline, for the purpose of alerting aliens and the bar to the issue, a broader argument that the respondent chose to make in this case: that federal courts lack the power to reinstate the privilege of voluntary departure as part of their review of petitions challenging BIA actions and, in the alternative, that if the courts have such power, it is restricted to situations in which a petitioner moved for a stay from the court before the voluntary departure period granted by the agency expired. The respondent, recognizing that <i>Umanzor-Alvarado</i> conflicts with its position, identifies changes in the statutory scheme and asks us to overrule that case. We reserve the issue of the bounds of this court's authority for another case where resolution of that issue is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 23, 2002, the BIA affirmed an immigration judge's order denying Khalil asylum and withholding of deportation, and gave Khalil thirty days from the date of the order to voluntarily depart. Khalil had claimed religious persecution as a Coptic Christian in Egypt. The BIA's order included a written notice outlining the statutory penalties for failing to depart within the allotted time. The BIA also entered a default order of removal to Egypt if Khalil failed to depart on time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Khalil did not depart, but appealed the BIA's order to this court on October 22, 2002. He asked the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to extend his period of voluntary departure pending our review. The INS denied his request and set a new January 9, 2003 departure date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 26, 2002, he filed a separate motion with the BIA to reopen proceedings in order to adjust his status based on an immigrant visa petition filed by his employer and approved by the INS on November 18. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i)(1) (allowing adjustment of status based on such a visa petition, provided certain conditions are fulfilled). Khalil did not raise in that motion the possible effect of an order from this court reinstating the period of voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 9 deadline passed, but Khalil did not leave. Nor did he file with this court a motion to stay removal or toll the running of the period for voluntary departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We note, though, that the INS had neither detained Khalil nor scheduled him for removal, so there was no event (apart from the passing of the January 9 deadline) that would have prompted Khalil to seek a stay from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA denied the motion to reopen on June 2, 2003 on the ground that Khalil was statutorily ineligible to apply for adjustment of status because he had overstayed the January 9 deadline for voluntary departure. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d). On July 2, 2003, Khalil filed the instant petition for review of that denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Khalil's appeal on his first petition was still pending in this court. On July 24, 2003, this court affirmed the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of deportation and reinstated the thirty-day period of voluntary departure originally granted by the BIA, citing <i>Yatskin v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199481\"><a href=\"/opinion/199481/yatskin-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2001). <i>Khalil,</i> 337 F.3d at 56. The panel was not made aware of Khalil's expired January 9, 2003 departure deadline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mandate issued on October 23, 2003 without the respondent having petitioned for rehearing by the panel or en banc to challenge the reinstatement order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal from the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen, Khalil does not contest that if he had overstayed his period of voluntary departure, he would in fact be statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d), and his motion to reopen would have been properly denied. Instead, he argues that he did not overstay his departure period because this court's July 24, 2003 reinstatement of the voluntary departure period <i>retroactively</i> operated to extend his period of departure beyond January 9, 2003. Accordingly, he urges that the BIA's decision be vacated and remanded with instructions to treat him as statutorily eligible for adjustment of status or, in the alternative, to consider the effect of this court's reinstatement of voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the respondent correctly points out, Khalil did not raise the possible effect of any reinstatement order from this court with the BIA in his motion to reopen. Nor did he return to the BIA once our reinstatement order was issued. As a result, he has likely waived the issue. Nonetheless, we reach the issue in order to settle the question he raises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Khalil's argument. Ordinarily, grants of equitable relief apply prospectively rather than retroactively. That is why, for example, plaintiffs must show a need for prospective relief in order to obtain an injunction. <i>See Lopez v. Garriga,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550303\"><a href=\"/opinion/550303/celso-lopez-aka-celso-lopez-lopez-v-rd-garriga/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 67-68 (1st Cir.1990). Khalil has not cited any authority, or even any reason, for viewing the reinstatement by a court of appeals of a limited period for voluntary departure any differently. This court's reinstatement of voluntary departure was not intended to apply retroactively. Nor should it be understood that way: <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> defines \"reinstate\" as \"to place again in a former state or position; to restore.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> at 1290 (7th ed.1999). We were restarting the clock on a period that had already run.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reinstatement of the privilege of voluntary departure, which operates prospectively, gives a petitioner an opportunity, after taking his appeal, to depart at his own expense to a country of his own choosing without facing the adverse consequences of deportation. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(A) (explaining those consequences). It does not retroactively nullify the fact that a petitioner overstayed his original period of voluntary departure. Khalil was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status at the time of the BIA's decision and remains so today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent raises questions about whether a reinstated period of voluntary departure begins running from the date of this court's decision or from the issuance of mandate and whether the period is stayed if the alien seeks review in the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We need not &#8212; and do not &#8212; address those questions today because, under any interpretation, it is clear that Khalil has overstayed and abused the time he was given by this court, and so has again lost the privilege of voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this opinion could end there, we think it better to note but not decide two challenges raised by the respondent to this court's authority to reinstate voluntary departure in its decision on a petition for review. This discussion is meant simply to outline some of the relevant arguments; it should not be construed as a prediction as to how the questions raised by the respondent should be answered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent first asserts, in the broader of its two challenges, that this court lacks the authority ever to stay or reinstate voluntary departure because the respondent reads the current version of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as vesting such authority solely in the INS. Fourteen years ago, under a different version of the INA, this court rejected that argument, holding that we may reinstate voluntary departure as part of our inherent equitable authority to order the appropriate remedy in a case before us. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six years later, in 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996). The IIRIRA included a series of amendments to the INA, some of which limited the courts' review of various discretionary decisions by the Attorney General, <i>see Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118264\"><a href=\"/opinion/118264/reno-v-american-arab-anti-discrimination-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 485, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118264\"><a href=\"/opinion/118264/reno-v-american-arab-anti-discrimination-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span> (1999), but none of which expressly addressed the power of the courts of appeals, as part of their review of petitions properly before them, to reinstate periods of voluntary departure previously granted by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent argues that the IIRIRA undermined the reasoning behind <i>Umanzor-Alvarado</i> and requires us to overturn that case. First, the respondent contends, <i>Umanzor-Alvarado</i> was motivated primarily by the concern that absent an order reinstating voluntary departure after review, aliens would be forced to choose between seeking judicial review and leaving within the time allotted for voluntary departure. That was because the pre-IIRIRA version of the INA barred courts from reviewing removal orders if the alien in question had departed the country. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(c) (1994) (repealed). The respondent points out, however, that the IIRIRA has eliminated that provision, thus permitting an alien who has voluntarily departed or who has been deported to continue his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the respondent points to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(b)(2), which provides that \"[p]ermission to depart voluntarily under this subsection shall not be valid for a period exceeding 60 days,\" and argues that judicial reinstatement of voluntary departure will often impermissibly extend the period beyond this statutory limit. The respondent also relies on 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1240.26(f), which states that \"[a]uthority to extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the Board is only within the jurisdiction of the district director.\" That statute and that regulation, however, both describe the authority of the <i>Attorney General,</i> not that of the courts. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(b) (describing the circumstances in which \"[t]he Attorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States\"); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1240.26 (regulation labeled as \"Voluntary departure &#8212; authority of the Executive Office for Immigration Review\"). The provisions that describe the authority of the <i>courts</i> provide instead that \"[j]udicial review of a final order of removal ... is governed only by chapter 158 of Title 28.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(1). In turn, chapter 158 of Title 28 provides that \"[t]he filing of the petition to review does not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the agency, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or <i>suspend,</i> in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2349(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent's broader challenge has been rejected by two circuits, <i>see Nwakanma v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784459\"><a href=\"/opinion/784459/godfrey-n-nwakanma-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 327 (6th Cir.2003); <i>El Himri v.

Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span>, 1175-78 (9th Cir.2003) (Berzon, J., concurring)), and accepted by one, <i>see Reynoso-Lopez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786330\"><a href=\"/opinion/786330/demetrio-reynoso-lopez-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span> (3d Cir.2004). Both circuits that have rejected the respondent's argument have expressed the concern that, particularly in asylum cases, aliens who voluntarily depart may be returning to home countries where they are unsafe or, even if safe, will not be allowed to return to the United States should they be successful on judicial review. <i>See Nwakanma,</i> 352 F.3d at 327; <i>Zazueta-Carrillo,</i> 322 F.3d at 1176-77. While aliens in these situations may formally retain their right to appeal under the post-IIRIRA statute after leaving this country, their purpose in seeking an appeal is arguably thwarted. <i>See Zazueta-Carrillo,</i> 322 F.3d at 1177. Those two courts concluded that although court-ordered stays of voluntary departure delay departure and may impose costs on the government, such stays are necessary in some cases to ensure the right to meaningful judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, those two courts rejected the respondent's argument under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(b)(2) and 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1240.26(f) on the ground that a stay or reinstatement of voluntary departure did not \"extend\" the period for departure, but instead merely restarted the clock for the running of the departure period designated by the agency. <i>See Nwakanma,</i> 352 F.3d at 327; <i>Zazueta-Carrillo,</i> 322 F.3d at 1176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps recognizing these concerns, the respondent offered a second, more limited challenge to the courts' authority to reinstate voluntary departure at oral argument. The respondent contends that even assuming (without conceding) that courts have the power, either by statute or inherently, to reinstate voluntary departure when they decide a petition for review, they may do so only when the petitioner filed a motion with the court before the departure period expired to stay removal or to toll the running of the period of voluntary departure. The Ninth Circuit recently adopted this position in <i>Garcia v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786299\"><a href=\"/opinion/786299/violeta-i-garcia-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-felipe-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2004). The respondent further argues that the fact that a petitioner has not been detained or scheduled for deportation does not excuse the alien's failure to file such a motion. This policy, the respondent argues, is necessary to ensure that the court has the opportunity to determine whether the traditional four-part test for a stay, which requires, inter alia, a showing of a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying petition, has been met. <i>See Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200622\"><a href=\"/opinion/200622/arevalo-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2003). If voluntary departure can be stayed or reinstated without such a showing, the respondent warns, petitioners will be encouraged to file frivolous appeals merely to extend their stays in this country. The IIRIRA, the respondent urges, eliminated provisions of the INA that automatically stayed removal upon the filing of a petition for judicial review to address precisely such concerns. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(3)(B) (a petition for review does not stay removal unless a court orders otherwise). Khalil's brief does not address any of the respondent's arguments on this issue, so we outline no arguments for a contrary conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent's arguments, whatever their merits, raise concerns about notice to the bar and aliens of the respondent's present position. Since <i>Umanzor-Alvarado,</i> this court's practice when the agency has granted a period for voluntary departure has been to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to reinstate that departure period upon rendering our decision on the underlying petition. <i>See, e.g., Velasquez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783402\"><a href=\"/opinion/783402/ricardo-f-velasquez-susana-d-granados-urizar-eluvia-r-granados-urizar/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Disu v.

The practice of the bar in this circuit, we observe, has been not to file motions with this court to toll or to stay the running of the period of voluntary departure pending judicial review. We are unaware of any rules promulgated by the INS giving notice to the bar and aliens of the position that the respondent has taken in this litigation. No doubt this court will in a later case be required to resolve these questions.
