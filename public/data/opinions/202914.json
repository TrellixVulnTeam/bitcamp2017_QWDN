Defendant David Turner and three\n\ncodefendants were convicted of several Hobbs Act and firearms\n\noffenses based upon their attempt to rob an armored car facility.\n\nTurner appeals his conviction and sentence.\n\n                                   I.\n\n          We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, see United States v. Isler, 429 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), reserving a discussion of additional facts for our analysis.\n\n          Turner   and   his   fellow    conspirators   Carmello   Merlino\n\n(Merlino), Stephen Rosetti, and William Merlino were arrested on\n\nFebruary 7, 1999, as they converged upon their designated rallying\n\npoint -- TRC Auto Electric (TRC). From there, the conspirators had\n\nintended to go to the Loomis Fargo armored car facility in Easton,\n\nMassachusetts and rob it of over $50 million.           To carry out this\n\nplan, the conspirators had acquired an arsenal of several handguns,\n\nan assault rifle, and a hand grenade, as well as masks, bullet\n\nproof vests, police scanners, a radio frequency detector, large\n\nduffle bags for the money, and vehicles that they intended to use\n\nduring the robbery and subsequent escape. The planned heist was an\n\nFBI sting, however, and a purported fifth coconspirator, Anthony\n\nRomano, was an FBI informant who had worn a wire during the\n\nplanning of the robbery.\n\n          At trial, Turner claimed entrapment based upon the FBI's\n\ntactics in conducting the sting.         His claim focused upon two FBI\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fagents, David Nadolski and William Cronin, and Romano.               Turner\n\nasserted that the FBI agents induced him to participate in the\n\ncrime so that they could pressure him to provide information\n\nregarding the 1990 robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum\n\nin Boston, about which they thought he had knowledge.1\n\n          In   1996,    Romano,   then     incarcerated,   had    contacted\n\nNadolski and provided information regarding the robbery of the John\n\nQuincy Adams Library that led to the conviction of the perpetrator\n\nand the recovery of stolen rare books. Romano remained in periodic\n\ncontact with Nadolski thereafter.          In October 1997, Romano was\n\nreleased from prison and obtained employment at TRC from his\n\nfriend, Merlino. Romano then contacted Nadolski with two pieces of\n\ninformation:   (1)   that   Romano    believed   that   Merlino    and   his\n\nassociate, Turner, had been involved in the Gardener robbery; and\n\n(2) that Merlino was planning to rob the Loomis Fargo facility.\n\nNadolski informed Cronin, who already believed that Merlino and\n\nTurner (who was believed to be a member of Merlino's crew) were\n\nsomehow involved in the Gardener robbery. Romano was told to \"keep\n\nhis ears open.\"      Cronin ultimately met with Merlino three times\n\nbetween January and late April 1998, to negotiate for the return of\n\nthe paintings.    The negotiations ended after the third meeting,\n\n\n\n1\n The Gardener robbery was one of the largest art thefts in history\nand resulted in the loss of several priceless paintings. Despite\nthe offer of a $5 million reward, the thieves have not been\napprehended nor have the paintings been recovered.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fwith Cronin expressing frustration that Merlino could not return\n\nthe paintings and would not voluntarily provide information about\n\nthem.\n\n           Between April and November 1998, Romano continued to\n\nprovide information about the Gardener robbery and the Loomis Fargo\n\nplans -- notably, that Merlino wished Romano to arrange for an\n\ninsider at Loomis Fargo to provide them with information about the\n\ninterior of the facility.      Nadolski, the case agent on the Loomis\n\nFargo matter, decided to proceed with a sting operation, with an\n\nFBI agent acting as the insider.            In November, Romano agreed to\n\nbecome a \"cooperating witness\" for the FBI and to record various\n\nconversations.     At this time, Romano told Merlino that he had\n\nfinally procured an \"insider.\"             With the assistance of Loomis\n\nFargo's    security    personnel,    the     FBI   provided    Romano   with\n\ninformation about the facility and a purported diagram of the\n\ninterior that he could forward to Merlino.               When Romano was\n\ndirected by Merlino to steal a vehicle and license plates, the FBI\n\nprovided Romano with them.\n\n           Merlino and Romano discussed possible accomplices for the\n\nheist, and Merlino suggested Turner, making various comments about\n\nTurner's   criminal    experience.     Merlino's     initial   attempts   to\n\ncontact Turner were unsuccessful, and Romano periodically inquired\n\nabout Turner's status, even suggesting that William Merlino be sent\n\nto look for him.      Turner ultimately responded.\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           Turner and Rosetti joined the conspiracy on January 13,\n\n1999, after Merlino presented his plan to them at a restaurant.\n\nThereafter, matters sped ahead, with the conspirators discussing\n\nweapons, tactics, vehicles, the advisability of taking hostages,\n\nand the need to evade the police if stopped, as well as engaging in\n\n\"dry runs\" with the insider.2         They selected February 7, 1999 as\n\nthe robbery date, agreeing to rendezvous at TRC in the early\n\nmorning.\n\n           Carmello Merlino was arrested upon his arrival; William\n\nMerlino was arrested at a nearby gas station after he attempted to\n\nenter TRC.      Turner and Rosetti arrived at TRC in Rosetti's Honda,\n\nand they proceeded to \"square the block\" -- check for following\n\nvehicles and surveil the area for law enforcement personnel.\n\nApparently sensing something was amiss, they left the area and\n\ndrove to Turner's Chevrolet Tahoe that had been parked in a nearby\n\ncondominium complex parking lot.        There they removed several large\n\nduffle   bags    from   the   Honda   and   placed   them   in   the   Tahoe.\n\nThereafter, they returned in the Honda to TRC and again began\n\nsquaring the block.     Law enforcement personnel arrested them after\n\na brief chase. A search of the Tahoe revealed weapons, ammunition,\n\n\n2\n  The \"insider\" would be called via a special cell phone, then\nleave the facility for the parking lot, ostensibly to get something\nfrom his car. The conspirators intended to pretend to take the\ninsider hostage with a gun to his head and enter the facility. On\nthese dry runs an undercover FBI agent, acting as the inside man,\nresponded to the calls and went to his car in the parking lot as\narranged (while the conspirators observed him from a distance).\n\n                                      -5-\n\fmasks, bullet proof vests, scanners, a radio frequency detector,\n\nthe box for the cell phone provided to the insider, and other\n\nequipment.     A search of TRC revealed the van that was to be used in\n\nthe heist, which contained other robbery equipment.\n\n           Turner was indicted for six offenses:                        conspiracy to\n\naffect commerce by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Hobbs\n\nAct) (Count 1), attempt to affect commerce by robbery in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count 2), carrying a firearm (grenade) in\n\nrelation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\n\n(Count 3), carrying a firearm (handguns and an assault rifle) in\n\nrelation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\n\n(Count 4), being a felon in possession of a firearm (grenade) in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count 5), and being a felon in\n\npossession     of    a   firearm        (handguns    and     an   assault    rifle)    in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count 6).\n\n           All defendants were tried together.3                    In addition to the\n\ntapes and physical evidence, the government presented the testimony\n\nof   Romano,    Nadolski,         and    a   host    of    other    agents     who    had\n\nparticipated    in       the    sting.       The    government     also    presented    a\n\nstipulation that Turner was a convicted felon.\n\n           Turner's        defense       presented     a     theory   of     \"vicarious\n\nentrapment\"     --       that    the     FBI,      through    Romano,       coerced    an\n\nunsuspecting third party (Merlino) into inducing Turner to join the\n\n3\n  Their motion to continue the trial in light of the September 11,\n2001 terrorist attacks upon the United States was denied.\n\n                                             -6-\n\fconspiracy so that the FBI could use the prosecution as leverage on\n\nTurner to cooperate in the Gardener robbery investigation.                Turner\n\ncalled FBI special agent Cronin as his only witness.                      Cronin\n\nacknowledged that he was provided information by Romano about the\n\nGardener robbery throughout the conspiracy, and that he believed\n\nTurner would be more likely to cooperate if he were facing serious\n\ncriminal charges. He also acknowledged that he visited both Turner\n\nand Merlino immediately after their arrest in hopes that they would\n\nprovide information about the Gardner robbery in exchange for\n\npossible assistance in this case.4                But he   claimed that his\n\ninterest had been primarily in Merlino, not Turner, and that his\n\ninterest in both diminished after April 1998 because he concluded\n\nthat   they    could   not     facilitate   the   return   of    the    Gardener\n\npaintings.      To rebut Turner's entrapment theory, the government\n\npresented evidence that Turner had been convicted in 1989 and 1990\n\nof two firearm offenses and one larceny/breaking and entering\n\noffense, which the government used to argue that he was predisposed\n\nto   commit    the   instant    offense.    Although   the      court   gave   an\n\nentrapment instruction, the jury found Turner guilty on all counts.\n\n              Between conviction and sentencing, Turner filed a motion\n\nfor a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.                 Turner argued\n\nthat a new trial was warranted due to the government's improper\n\nfailure to produce significant exculpatory evidence, in violation\n\n4\n  Nadolski provided similar testimony on cross-examination during\nthe government's case-in-chief.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fof Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).   The evidence consisted\n\nof several FBI investigative reports (302s) regarding a second FBI\n\ninformant who had provided information about Merlino's and Turner's\n\npossible involvement in the Gardener robbery.5   Turner argued that\n\nthe 302s would have constituted powerful evidence supporting his\n\nentrapment defense and would have eviscerated Cronin's testimony\n\nthat he had a reduced interest in Merlino and Turner after April\n\n1998. The district court denied the motion and sentenced Turner to\n\n460 months' imprisonment.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Turner raises several challenges to his conviction and\n\nsentence, including:   (A.) a Hobbs Act conspiracy is not a \"crime\n\nof violence\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924; (B.) the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support a conviction for attempted robbery under\n\nthe Hobbs Act; (C.) the district court improperly instructed the\n\njury on the elements of vicarious entrapment and the necessary\n\nimpact on interstate commerce for a Hobbs Act violation; (D.) the\n\ncourt erred in admitting Merlino's taped statements regarding\n\nTurner's criminal past; (E.) the court erred in admitting evidence\n\nof Turner's prior convictions and the radio frequency detector;\n\n(F.) the court erred in denying Turner's motion to sever his trial\n\nfrom Merlino's and to sever the felon-in-possession counts from the\n\n\n5\n Turner's motion was also based upon certain other law enforcement\nreports, but his presentation here focuses on the 302s related to\nthe second informant.\n\n                                -8-\n\frest of the charges; (G.) the court erred in denying his motion for\n\na new trial; (H.) Turner was entitled to a sentence reduction for\n\nacceptance of responsibility; and (I.) Turner is entitled to remand\n\nfor resentencing pursuant to United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005).6   Concluding that none of these challenges succeed, we\n\naffirm Turner's conviction and sentence.\n\n           A.   Hobbs Act Conspiracy as Crime of Violence\n\n           Turner argues that he is entitled to a judgment of\n\nacquittal on the Section 924(c) counts because conspiracy under the\n\nHobbs Act is not a predicate \"crime of violence.\"7   Turner reasons\n\nthat, because an overt act is not required for a conspiracy\n\nconviction under the Hobbs Act, the crime is complete with the\n\nmaking of the agreement (which is not a violent act).       Turner\n\n\n6\n  Turner raises certain other challenges that do not warrant\nsignificant discussion. First, he argues that the trial should\nhave been postponed based upon the terrorist attacks upon the\nUnited States on September 11, 2001. This contention fails as this\ncase did not concern terrorism and Turner presents no basis for\nbelieving that the denial of a continuance in any way prejudiced\nhim.   Second, he argues that he should have been permitted to\nquestion Nadolski about his knowledge of the penalty for possession\nof a grenade. This contention also fails, as Turner presents no\ncoherent claim of sentencing entrapment and the evidence made it\nclear that Merlino (rather than Nadolski through Romano) brought up\nthe matter of grenades.\n7\n  Section 924(c) provides an enhanced penalty for anyone who uses\nor carries a firearm in relation to a \"crime of violence.\" \"Crime\nof violence\" is defined as \"an offense that is a felony and -- (A)\nhas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against the person or property of another, or (B)\nthat by its very nature involves a substantial risk that physical\nforce against the person or property of another may be used in the\ncourse of committing the offense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3).\n\n                                 -9-\n\frelies upon Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1 (2004) and United States\n\nv. King, 979 F.2d 801 (10th Cir. 1992), in pressing this claim.\n\n           We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.\n\nSee United States v. Frechette, 456 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2006).   The\n\noverwhelming weight of authority holds that a Hobbs Act conspiracy\n\nis a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of Section 924(c).         See\n\nUnited States v. Taylor, 176 F.3d 331, 337-38 (6th Cir. 1999);\n\nUnited States v. Phan, 121 F.3d 149, 152-53 (4th Cir. 1997);\n\nUnited States v. Elder, 88 F.3d 127, 129 (2d Cir. 1996); United\n\nStates v. Mendez, 992 F.2d 1488, 1491 (9th Cir. 1992).       These\n\ncourts reason:\n\n           A conspiracy, by its very nature, is a\n           collective criminal effort where a common goal\n           unites two or more criminals. Such a meeting\n           of the minds enhances the likelihood that the\n           planned crime will be carried out. Thus, when\n           a conspiracy exists to commit a crime of\n           violence,. . . the conspiracy itself poses a\n           substantial risk of violence, which qualifies\n           it under Section 924(c)(1) and Section 924\n           (c)(3)(B) as a crime of violence.\n\nElder, 88 F.3d at 129 (internal citation and quotation omitted).\n\nThis authority is consistent with our rationale for concluding that\n\na conspiracy to commit a crime of violence is a crime of violence\n\nunder the Bail Reform Act (which is worded identically to Section\n\n924(c)).   See United States v. Mitchell, 23 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)(collecting cases reaching same result under the criminal\n\ncode).   The absence of an overt act requirement does not alter our\n\nview.    See United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d   1, 4 n.4 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f1992)(state conspiracy offense was \"crime of violence\" for purposes\n\nof career offender guideline, even though no act was required); cf.\n\nUnited States v. McKenney, 450 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 127 S. Ct. 537 (2006)(drug conspiracy as predicate offense\n\nunder Armed Career Criminal Act). Indeed, in Fiore, we stated that\n\nthe key inquiry in assessing the nature of a conspiracy is to ask\n\n\"conspiracy to do what?\" -- as the object of the conspiracy is the\n\ncritical determinant of its nature.        Id. at 3.\n\n            Turner counters that this authority has been undermined\n\nby the Supreme Court's decision in Leocal.          In that case the Court\n\nconcluded that the offense of driving while intoxicated which\n\ncauses serious bodily injury (under Florida law) was not a \"crime\n\nof violence\" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16).          543 U.S. at 10-13.\n\nLeocal is inapposite for at least two reasons.          First, the Court's\n\nrationale was that the Florida statute criminalized conduct that\n\nwas   merely    accidental   or   negligent   and   thus   not   inherently\n\n\"violent.\"     Id. at 8-10 (noting that 18 U.S.C. § 16 has higher mens\n\nrea requirement).     This is not the case with a Hobbs Act violation.\n\nSecond, the Court was not dealing with inchoate offenses.           Id. at\n\n8-9 (\"We do not here deal with an attempted or threatened use of\n\nforce.\").      Leocal thus has not undermined the conclusion that a\n\nconspiracy may qualify as a crime of violence.\n\n            Turner also contends that the Tenth Circuit's decision in\n\nKing properly acknowledges the significance of the absence of an\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fovert act requirement in a parallel context.     In King, 979 F.2d at\n\n803.   The Tenth Circuit concluded that conspiracy under New Mexico\n\nlaw, which did not require proof of an overt act, was not a crime\n\nof violence.    The court held that because the crime of conspiracy\n\nwas complete upon \"formation of the intent to commit a felony, and\n\ndoes not require that any action be taken on that intent, the\n\nelements of conspiracy to commit a violent felony do not include\n\nthe threatened use of physical force.\"     Id.\n\n           We are unpersuaded by King, which, aside from being at\n\nodds with our authority and the great weight of authority from\n\nother circuits, does not consider the importance of the object of\n\nthe conspiracy, which under our case law is a critical inquiry.\n\nSee Fiore, 983 F.2d at 3.8   We conclude that conspiracy under the\n\nHobbs Act constitutes a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c).\n\n           B.   Sufficiency of the Evidence of Attempted Robbery\n\n           Turner next argues that the evidence does not support a\n\nconviction for attempted robbery.      He maintains that, at the time\n\nof the arrest, his actions could at best be characterized as \"mere\n\npreparation\" because he was far from the designated target, Loomis\n\n\n8\n We note that the Tenth Circuit has more recently moved toward the\nmajority position. In United States v. Brown, the court observed\nthat, despite the fact that conspiracy punishes the agreement\nrather than the substantive offense, \"at minimum, an agreement to\naccomplish the statutory elements of [a violent felony] necessarily\ninvolves a substantial risk of physical force against the person or\nproperty of the victim.\" 200 F.3d 700, 706 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                -12-\n\fFargo,   and   was   driving   away   from   the   rallying   point   when\n\napprehended.   To his view, the arrest should have been made after\n\nthe group arrived at Loomis Fargo or, at the earliest, when they\n\nhad assembled, prepared, and left TRC in their vehicles.\n\n           We assess a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nby determining whether the evidence, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government, supports the guilty verdict.         United\n\nStates v. Burgos, 254 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2001).              \"To prove\n\nattempt, the government must establish both an intent to commit the\n\nsubstantive offense and a substantial step towards its commission.\"\n\nId. at 12 (internal citation omitted).        While \"mere preparation\"\n\ndoes not constitute a substantial step, a defendant \"does not have\n\nto get very far along the line toward ultimate commission of the\n\nobject crime in order to commit the attempt offense.\"             United\n\nStates v. Doyon, 194 F.3d 207, 211 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           Under this standard, the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsupport the verdict.       Turner and his compatriots planned the\n\noffense in great detail, assembled weapons and other robbery\n\nequipment, prepared vehicles, surveiled the target, practiced dry-\n\nruns, and gathered at the designated assembly point on the day\n\nscheduled for the robbery.      No more is required.      See generally\n\nUnited States v. LiCausi, 167     F.3d 36, 48 (1st Cir. 1999); United\n\nStates v. Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d 28, 30-33 (1st Cir. 1993). Indeed,\n\nthe facts in both LiCausi and Chapdelaine are strikingly similar to\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fthe conduct of Turner and his cohorts in this case.      The LiCausi\n\nand Chapdelaine defendants surveiled the target, assembled weapons,\n\nutilized disguises/robbery clothes, stole and positioned vehicles\n\nfor use in the robbery and subsequent escape, and used a radio\n\nscanner to monitor police activity.     See id.   As in each of those\n\ncases, the evidence here suffices to support a conviction for\n\nattempted armed robbery.   Moreover, there is no requirement that\n\nthe actions constituting the attempt have a particular geographic\n\nproximity to the object of the substantive offense.     See generally\n\nDoyon, 194 F.3d at 212 (drug dealer's payment of past drug debt to\n\nsupplier constituted a substantial step in his attempt to make a\n\nfuture narcotics purchase).      And the fact that Turner may have\n\ndetected the FBI's surveillance and tried to abandon the attempt at\n\nthe last moment is irrelevant.    See LiCausi, 167 F.3d at 48 (that\n\ndefendants abandoned the attempt after seeing a large number of\n\npeople in front of the target and intercepting a police call on a\n\nradio scanner was inconsequential as they had already taken a\n\nsubstantial step toward the robbery); United States v. Del Carmen\n\nRamirez, 823 F.2d 1, 1-2 (1st Cir. 1987)(that defendants hid guns\n\nin grass and attempted to leave area when they spotted police is\n\nirrelevant because defendants had already completed a substantial\n\nstep).9\n\n9\n  We note a final flaw with Turner's position. In light of the\ndefendants' formidable arsenal and stated intent to \"have it out\"\nwith the police, waiting to make the arrest until the defendants\nleft TRC (with bullet proof vests on and weapons at ready) or\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          C.   Jury Instructions\n\n          Turner raises two challenges to the jury instructions.\n\nHe first argues that the instructions were inadequate in their\n\ndescription of the required impact on interstate commerce necessary\n\nfor a Hobbs Act conviction.    Turner posits that the Supreme Court,\n\nin United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), raised the impact\n\non interstate commerce required under the Hobbs Act from \"any\n\nimpact\" to a \"substantial impact.\"      Further, Turner asserts that\n\nthe factual impossibility of the robbery forecloses as a matter of\n\nlaw the possibility that his crime had a substantial impact on\n\ninterstate commerce.      He also argues that the court erred in\n\ninstructing the jury regarding the vicarious entrapment defense.\n\nTurner says that the court should not have told the jury that the\n\ngovernment agent must \"specifically target\" the defendant and\n\n\"specifically instruct\" the intermediary to pressure the defendant.\n\n          In assessing a challenge to jury instructions, our task\n\nis to determine if the instructions, taken as a whole, fairly and\n\nadequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.          See\n\nUnited States v. Glaum, 356 F.3d 169, 178 (1st Cir. 2004), vacated\n\non other grounds, 543 U.S. 1099 (2005) (Booker).\n\n          Turner's     first   challenge   fails.    We   have   held\n\nspecifically that Lopez did not change the interstate commerce\n\n\n\n\narrived at Loomis Fargo would have exposed          law   enforcement\npersonnel and the public to unnecessary risk.\n\n                                 -15-\n\frequirement   for      a   Hobbs   Act   conviction,       stating     that   \"the\n\ngovernment must show only that the ... conduct created a realistic\n\nprobability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.\" United\n\nStates v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 334-36 (1st Cir. 2003)(internal\n\ncitation and quotation omitted).            The planned theft of over $50\n\nmillion from a national armored car company more than qualifies.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Jimenez-Torres, 435 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   Turner's impossibility contention also fails.                 \"While the\n\nsubstantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy may be\n\nimpossible to achieve, the conspiracy nonetheless qualifies as an\n\noffense for which a person may be prosecuted\" under federal law.\n\nUnited   States   v.    Sanchez-Berrios,     424    F.3d    65,   78   (1st   Cir.\n\n2005)(government       sting   operation);    see   also    United     States   v.\n\nNguyen, 246 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir. 2001)(\"All that matters is that\n\n[defendant] entered a conspiracy whose objective was to steal the\n\nassets of an entity in interstate commerce.                That the conspiracy\n\nfailed to accomplish such objective is irrelevant.\").\n\n           We also reject Turner's challenge to the \"vicarious\n\nentrapment instruction.\"        The district court's instruction stated:\n\n                  Inducement by a codefendant constitutes\n           some vicarious entrapment by the government if\n           the following three elements are met:\n                  First,   that    a   government   agent\n           specifically identified the defendant as the\n           desired target of the inducement or pressure;\n                  second, that the government agent\n           encouraged the codefendant to induce or\n           pressure the defendant to commit the crime, or\n           his government agent's handlers condoned the\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f          use of coercive inducements or pressure by the\n          codefendant; and\n                 third,   the  codefendant,   in   fact,\n          applied pressure or an improper inducement to\n          overcome the defendant's reluctance to become\n          involved.\n\n\nTurner's claim that the second part of the instruction included a\n\nrequisite that the government agent must \"specifically instruct\"\n\nthe codefendant to induce the defendant to participate in the crime\n\nis baseless.     The instruction explicitly allows for situations\n\nwhere the codefendant, on his own, coerces the defendant into\n\njoining the criminal enterprise, and the government merely condones\n\nthe action.    This instruction is consistent with our case law on\n\nthe third-party entrapment defense.            See United States v. Luisi,\n\n482 F3d. 43, 54-56 (1st Cir. 2007) United States v. Rogers, 102\n\nF.3d 641, 645 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Bradley, 820 F.2d\n\n3, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n          Turner's       alternative      claim,     that   the   instruction\n\nimproperly    informed    the   jury    that   the   government   agent   must\n\ninitially \"target\" the defendant may have more traction, as such a\n\nrequirement does not explicitly appear in Luisi, Rogers or Bradley,\n\nand it makes the defense somewhat harder for a defendant to\n\nestablish.    But even if there was error, and we are not saying that\n\nthere was, the error was harmless.             To prevail on an entrapment\n\nclaim, the defendant must show that he was improperly induced by\n\nthe government to engage in criminal conduct and that he was not\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fpredisposed to engage in the conduct. Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d at\n\n76.      Improper    inducement      consists    of    more   than   providing   an\n\nopportunity to a commit a crime; the inducement must create \"a risk\n\nof causing an otherwise unwilling person to commit the crime.\"\n\nUnited States v. Walter, 434 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2006)(internal\n\ncitation and quotation omitted).              The something \"more\" generally\n\nconsists of excessive pressure by the government agent on the\n\ndefendant or the exploitation of a defendant's noncriminal motive,\n\nfor example, sympathy.         Id.    Failure to establish either improper\n\ninducement or lack of predisposition defeats the defense.                  Id. at\n\n35-36.\n\n            The     evidence   is    strong     that   there   was   no   improper\n\ninducement and that Turner was predisposed to commit the crime.\n\nDespite making several phone calls and pages to Turner, Merlino\n\nmade it clear that he was making an offer to participate which\n\nTurner could readily decline.          There was no hint of threats or any\n\nother undue pressure -- simply the opportunity for a big score.\n\nSee Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d at 76-77 (neither mere solicitation\n\nnor the prospect of illicit gain constitutes improper inducement).\n\nMoreover, Turner's own statements, either on tape or attributed to\n\nhim by Romano, and conduct clearly paint him as an experienced\n\ncriminal and an eager participant.              Turner engaged in additional\n\nsurveillance of the target, ran an additional dry run with the\n\n\"insider,\" stated that the group should shoot it out with police if\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fstopped, expressed concern that his Tahoe was bugged, commiserated\n\nwith Rosetti about the intense impatience one feels while waiting\n\nto begin a planned robbery, and expressed concern that he and\n\nMerlino should not be seen together because people know that when\n\nthey are together something illegal is going to happen.                   See\n\ngenerally Walter, 434 F.3d at 37 (predisposition may be inferred\n\nfrom the defendant's statements showing experience with criminal\n\nactivity).   On this record, Turner's entrapment defense could not\n\nprevail.\n\n           D.   Merlino's Statements\n\n           Turner   raises   three    challenges   to   the   admission   of\n\nCarmello Merlino's taped statements about Turner's criminal past:\n\nthat his entrapment defense was fatally prejudiced by the admission\n\nof the statements, that the admission of Merlino's statements\n\nconstituted error under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123\n\n(1968), and that admission of the statements violated his right of\n\nconfrontation under Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).\n\n           We begin with common ground.      Both sides agree that the\n\nstatements are admissible against Merlino.          Further, both sides\n\nagree that statements in furtherance of the conspiracy, made by\n\nMerlino after Turner joined the conspiracy, are admissible against\n\nTurner.    See generally LiCausi, 167 F.3d at 46.             At issue are\n\nstatements made by Merlino before the January 13, 1999 meeting,\n\nwhich the jury could understand to mean that Turner was proficient\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fwith firearms (e.g., \"good with these\"), could obtain them (e.g.,\n\n\"they got one or two\"), and had participated in other robberies\n\n(e.g., \"knows how to do these\").\n\n            Again here, any error with respect to the entrapment\n\ndefense was harmless.      \"The admission of improper testimony is\n\nharmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence\n\nthe verdict.\"     Isler, 429 F.3d at 26 (internal citation omitted).\n\nFactors to consider in this calculus include the importance of the\n\nevidence,   its   uniqueness,   how   it    was   used,    and   the    relative\n\nstrength of the opposing case.        Id.\n\n            In our view, the statements in question were merely\n\ncumulative, as Merlino made nearly identical comments about Turner\n\nafter January 13th.       Moreover, as we have noted, Turner's own\n\ncomments were to the same effect.       Finally, as we have also noted,\n\nthe evidence that Turner was not entrapped was strong, and the pre-\n\nJanuary 13th comments were not emphasized by the government in its\n\nargument.\n\n            The   Sixth   Amendment     challenges        are    also    flawed.\n\nMerlino's statements implying past criminal behavior on Turner's\n\npart did not directly implicate Turner in the charged conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, the admission of the statements could not constitute\n\nBruton error.     See United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223, 1227-28\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (no Bruton error where the codefendant's statement\n\ndoes not expressly implicate the defendant).          Similarly, there is\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fno Crawford error, as Merlino's secretly recorded statements were\n\nnot \"testimonial,\" within the meaning of Crawford.                       See generally\n\nUnited States v. Brito, 427 F.3d 53, 58-59 (1st Cir. 2005); see\n\nalso   Horton    v.    Allen,     370     F.3d    75,   83-85       (1st     Cir.    2004)\n\n(conspirator's statement to witness during private conversation was\n\nnot testimonial).\n\n            E.     Other Evidentiary Claims\n\n            Turner     raises     two     other   challenges        to     the    district\n\ncourt's evidentiary rulings. First, he argues that the court erred\n\nin admitting evidence of two prior convictions that were remote in\n\ntime and of dubious relevance.             Second, he contends that the court\n\nerred in admitting evidence of the radio frequency detector10 found\n\nin his vehicle, which Turner maintains served no function other\n\nthan   to   prejudice       the   jury.      We    review      a    district      court's\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.                        United States v.\n\nMercado Irizarry, 404 F.3d 497, 500               (1st Cir. 2005).          There was no\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n            The prior convictions were highly probative to rebut\n\nTurner's entrapment defense and not too remote in time. See United\n\nStates v. Van Horn, 277 F.3d            48, 57-58 (1st Cir. 2002).               Moreover,\n\ngiven the nature of the conspiracy and Turner's role in providing\n\nthe    firearms,      the   prior   convictions         were       clearly       relevant.\n\n\n\n10\n   A radio frequency detector is a device for detecting hidden\nlistening devices.\n\n                                          -21-\n\fSimilarly, the radio frequency detector was probative of the\n\nsophisticated nature of the conspiracy and, thus, the merits of the\n\nentrapment defense. Moreover, the admission of the radio frequency\n\ndetector is no more prejudicial than the admission of the police\n\nscanners, which Turner does not challenge.\n\n             F.    Severance\n\n             Turner next argues that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to sever his felon-in-possession counts and in failing to\n\nsever his trial from Merlino's.            As to the former, Turner asserts\n\nthat   the   felon-in-possession         counts   prejudiced     his   entrapment\n\ndefense.     As to the latter, Turner argues that a severance was\n\nnecessary to obtain Merlino's testimony that (1) Romano raised\n\nTurner's name and pressured Merlino to recruit him, (2) Turner\n\ninitially rejected Merlino's overtures and Merlino continued to\n\napply pressure on him, and (3) Turner had received Merlino's\n\nrepeated pages and telephone messages.\n\n             We begin with the refusal to sever felon-in-possession\n\ncounts, assessing the district court's ruling for manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       See Burgos, 254 F.3d at 13.        To prevail on this claim,\n\nTurner must show that the \"improper joinder likely deprived him of\n\na   fair   trial.\"      Id.    at   14   (internal    citation   and    quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n             There was no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\nrefusal to sever these counts. The felon-in-possession counts were\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fproperly tried with the other counts because they arose out of the\n\nsame conduct.         See United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1416 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).           In addition, any possible prejudice was limited by\n\nTurner's stipulation to his status as a convicted felon.                           See id.\n\nMoreover,      and     in    any    event,    as     discussed      above,       his   prior\n\nconvictions were properly a part of the government's rebuttal of\n\nhis entrapment defense.             See Van Horn, 277 F.3d at 57-58.\n\n               As to the severance of Merlino and Turner's trials, we\n\nstart    by    noting       that    individuals       who    are    indicted      together\n\ngenerally should be tried together.                   United States v. Pena-Lora,\n\n225     F.3d    17,    33    (1st     Cir.     2000).       Moreover,        severance   is\n\nparticularly disfavored in conspiracy cases.                       Id.       To be entitled\n\nto severance, the defendant must show \"prejudice so pervasive that\n\na miscarriage of justice looms.\"                    LiCausi, 167 F.3d at 49.             To\n\nobtain    a    severance      based    upon     the     need   for       a    codefendant's\n\ntestimony, the defendant must show \"(1) a bona fide need for the\n\ntestimony; (2) the substance of the testimony; (3) its exculpatory\n\nnature and effect; and (4) that the codefendant will in fact\n\ntestify if the cases are severed.\"                  Smith, 46 F.3d at 1231.\n\n               Under this standard, there was no manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion.                   The proffered testimony was of\n\nlimited, if any significance to Turner's entrapment defense because\n\n\n\n\n                                             -23-\n\fit   did    not    tend   to    refute   the   overwhelming   evidence   of\n\npredisposition nor indicate improper inducement.11\n\n            G.     Motion for a New Trial\n\n            Turner argues that he is entitled to a new trial because\n\nthe government violated its obligations under Brady in improperly\n\nsuppressing the FBI 302 reports regarding a second informant - the\n\nso-called     \"Chicofsky       materials.\"     Turner   asserts   that   the\n\nsuppressed materials would have provided invaluable support for his\n\nentrapment defense, and that the evidence would have enabled him to\n\nimpeach Cronin's testimony that his interest in Merlino and Turner\n\nwaned after April.\n\n            Under Brady, the government is required to turn over\n\nexculpatory or impeachment evidence in its possession to the\n\ndefendant.    United States v. Rivera-Rangel, 396 F.3d 476, 485 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).       A new trial is warranted based upon a Brady violation\n\nif the defendant establishes that (1) the evidence is material and\n\nfavorable to the defense, (2) the prosecution suppressed the\n\nevidence, and (3) the defendant was prejudiced because there is a\n\nreasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. Id.\n\nSuppressed evidence that is merely cumulative of evidence already\n\nin the defendant's possession does not justify a new trial. Conley\n\n\n\n11\n   Furthermore, any suggestion of improper inducement would be\nrefuted by Merlino's taped statements to the contrary.\n\n                                      -24-\n\fv. United States, 415 F.3d 183, 189 (1st Cir. 2005).                  We review the\n\ndistrict      court's    decision     for   manifest    abuse    of    discretion.\n\nRivera-Rangel, 396 F.3d at 485-86.\n\n                Turner's     Brady    claim   fails    because     the      Chicofsky\n\nmaterials, and related documents, are not nearly as beneficial as\n\nTurner claims.          All but two of the thirty-eight Chicofsky 302s\n\nprecede May 1, 1998, and the other two reports did not mention\n\nTurner; this is consistent with Cronin's testimony that his belief\n\nthat Merlino would or could return the paintings waned after April\n\n1998.      Further, Turner was mentioned in only five of the 302s, and\n\nMerlino's attempts to return the paintings, as recounted in the\n\n302s, focused entirely on other individuals.                Moreover, all this\n\nevidence was merely cumulative of stronger evidence presented at\n\ntrial suggestive of the FBI's potential motivation to entrap\n\nTurner.      Indeed, Cronin's own testimony made it clear that he was\n\nin active negotiations with Merlino in April 1998, that he was well\n\naware of Turner's connection to Merlino, that he had received\n\nreports from Romano regarding the Gardener robbery throughout the\n\nconspiracy, and that he visited Turner on the day of his arrest in\n\na   last    attempt     to   secure   information      regarding      the   Gardener\n\nrobbery.      Most significantly, Turner's presentation continues to\n\nfocus on the FBI's potential motive to entrap him, while ignoring\n\nthe more significant issues of inducement and predisposition.                     On\n\n\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fthose issues, the Chicofsky materials contribute nothing.12                    There\n\nis   nothing      about   the    suppressed    materials     that     suggests     a\n\nreasonable probability of a different result.\n\n            H.    Sentencing\n\n            Finally, Turner raises two issues regarding his sentence.\n\nHe first claims that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance\n\nof responsibility, claiming that he did not deny the \"essential\n\nfactual elements of guilt\" but simply challenged the government's\n\nconduct    with    his    entrapment   defense.      While     it   is    remotely\n\nconceivable, in some rare circumstance, that a defendant who goes\n\nto trial with an entrapment defense might still be entitled to such\n\na reduction, Turner's decision to defend himself at trial through\n\na weak claim of entrapment in no way places him in this narrow\n\ntheoretical category.           See Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d at 79; see\n\nalso Glaum, 356 F.3d at 180.\n\n            Turner next claims that he is entitled to a remand for\n\nresentencing under Booker, as he has met the four-part plain error\n\ntest discussed in United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 78-\n\n79 (1st Cir. 2005)(there was error, the error was plain, the error\n\naffected   substantial       rights    of   the   defendant,    and      the   error\n\n\n\n12\n  Turner's other arguments regarding Chicofsky -- that Chicofsky\nshould not have been permitted to invoke the Fifth Amendment at the\nhearing and that Turner should have been permitted to examine him\nquestion by question -- are too perfunctorily presented to merit\nreview. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990).\n\n                                       -26-\n\fundermined the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings).\n\nTurner meets the first two parts, because the district court\n\ntreated the guidelines as mandatory.    See Isler, 429 F.3d at 29.\n\nHowever, to satisfy parts three and four, Turner \"must show a\n\nreasonable probability that the district court would impose a\n\ndifferent sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new\n\nadvisory guidelines.\"    See United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492,\n\n505 (1st Cir. 2005)(internal citation and quotation omitted).\n\nTurner cannot carry this burden.   The district court rejected his\n\nrequest to be sentenced at the bottom of the guideline range, and\n\nsuch a refusal \"speaks volumes\" about the defendant's chances on\n\nremand.   Id.   Moreover, a review of the sentencing materials\n\nreveals no indication that the district judge would be inclined to\n\nimpose a lower sentence.   See id.13\n\n\n\n                                III.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, Turner's conviction and\n\nsentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n13\n  Turner also argues that the district court erred in applying\nU.S.S.G. § 2X1.1 instead of § 2B3.1, and, alternatively, that the\ndistrict court erred in failing to grant a reduction under U.S.S.G.\n§ 2X1.1(b)(2).    Both of these arguments are presented without\nauthority   and in such a perfunctory manner that we deem them\nwaived. See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n                                -27-\n\f",

Turner appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Isler,</i> 429 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.2005), reserving a discussion of additional facts for our analysis.</p>\n<p>Turner and his fellow conspirators Carmello Merlino (Merlino), Stephen Rosetti, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> and William Merlino were arrested on February 7, 1999, as they converged upon their designated rallying point  TRC Auto Electric (TRC). From there, the conspirators had intended to go to the Loomis Fargo armored car facility in Easton, Massachusetts and rob it of over $50 million. To carry out this plan, the conspirators had acquired an arsenal of several handguns, an assault rifle, and a hand grenade, as well as masks, bullet proof vests, police scanners, a radio frequency detector, large duffle bags for the money, and vehicles that they intended to use during the robbery and subsequent escape. The planned heist was an FBI sting, however, and a purported fifth coconspirator, Anthony Romano, was an FBI informant who had worn a wire during the planning of the robbery.</p>\n<p>At trial, Turner claimed entrapment based upon the FBI's tactics in conducting the sting. His claim focused upon two FBI agents, David Nadolski and William Cronin, and Romano. Turner asserted that the FBI agents induced him to participate in the crime so that they could pressure him to provide information regarding the 1990 robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston, about which they thought he had knowledge.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In 1996, Romano, then incarcerated, had contacted Nadolski and provided information regarding the robbery of the John Quincy Adams Library that led to the conviction of the perpetrator and the recovery of stolen rare books. Romano remained in periodic contact with Nadolski thereafter. In October 1997, Romano was released from prison and obtained employment at TRC from his friend, Merlino. Romano then contacted Nadolski with two pieces of information: (1) that Romano believed that Merlino and his associate, Turner, had been involved in the Gardener robbery; and (2) that Merlino was planning to rob the Loomis Fargo facility. Nadolski informed Cronin, who already believed that Merlino and Turner (who was believed to be a member of Merlino's crew) were somehow involved in the Gardener robbery. Romano was told to \"keep his ears open.\" Cronin ultimately met with Merlino three times between January and late April 1998, to negotiate for the return of the paintings. The negotiations ended after the third meeting, with Cronin expressing frustration that Merlino could not return the paintings and would not voluntarily provide information about them.</p>\n<p>Between April and November 1998, Romano continued to provide information about the Gardener robbery and the Loomis Fargo plans  notably, that Merlino wished Romano to arrange for an insider at Loomis Fargo to provide them with information about the interior of the facility. Nadolski, the case agent on the Loomis Fargo matter, decided to proceed with a sting operation, with an FBI agent acting as the insider. In November, Romano agreed to become a \"cooperating witness\" for the FBI and to record various conversations. At this time, Romano told Merlino that he had finally procured an \"insider.\" With the assistance of Loomis Fargo's security personnel, the FBI provided Romano with information about the facility and a purported diagram of the interior that he could forward to Merlino. When Romano was directed by Merlino to steal a vehicle and license plates, the FBI provided Romano with them.</p>\n<p>Merlino and Romano discussed possible accomplices for the heist, and Merlino suggested <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> Turner, making various comments about Turner's criminal experience. Merlino's initial attempts to contact Turner were unsuccessful, and Romano periodically inquired about Turner's status, even suggesting that William Merlino be sent to look for him. Turner ultimately responded.</p>\n<p>Turner and Rosetti joined the conspiracy on January 13, 1999, after Merlino presented his plan to them at a restaurant. Thereafter, matters sped ahead, with the conspirators discussing weapons, tactics, vehicles, the advisability of taking hostages, and the need to evade the police if stopped, as well as engaging in \"dry runs\" with the insider.<sup>[2]</sup> They selected February 7, 1999 as the robbery date, agreeing to rendezvous at TRC in the early morning.</p>\n<p>Carmello Merlino was arrested upon his arrival; William Merlino was arrested at a nearby gas station after he attempted to enter TRC. Turner and Rosetti arrived at TRC in Rosetti's Honda, and they proceeded to \"square the block\"  check for following vehicles and surveil the area for law enforcement personnel. Apparently sensing something was amiss, they left the area and drove to Turner's Chevrolet Tahoe that had been parked in a nearby condominium complex parking lot. There they removed several large duffle bags from the Honda and placed them in the Tahoe. Thereafter, they returned in the Honda to TRC and again began squaring the block. Law enforcement personnel arrested them after a brief chase. A search of the Tahoe revealed weapons, ammunition, masks, bullet proof vests, scanners, a radio frequency detector, the box for the cell phone provided to the insider, and other equipment. A search of TRC revealed the van that was to be used in the heist, which contained other robbery equipment.</p>\n<p>Turner was indicted for six offenses: conspiracy to affect commerce by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Hobbs Act) (Count 1), attempt to affect commerce by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count 2), carrying a firearm (grenade) in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 3), carrying a firearm (handguns and an assault rifle) in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 4), being a felon in possession of a firearm (grenade) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count 5), and being a felon in possession of a firearm (handguns and an assault rifle) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count 6).</p>\n<p>All defendants were tried together.<sup>[3]</sup> In addition to the tapes and physical evidence, the government presented the testimony of Romano, Nadolski, and a host of other agents who had participated in the sting. The government also presented a stipulation that Turner was a convicted felon.</p>\n<p>Turner's defense presented a theory of \"vicarious entrapment\"  that the FBI, through Romano, coerced an unsuspecting third party (Merlino) into inducing Turner to join the conspiracy so that the FBI could use the prosecution as leverage on Turner to cooperate in the Gardener robbery investigation. Turner called FBI special agent Cronin as his only witness. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Cronin acknowledged that he was provided information by Romano about the Gardener robbery throughout the conspiracy, and that he believed Turner would be more likely to cooperate if he were facing serious criminal charges. He also acknowledged that he visited both Turner and Merlino immediately after their arrest in hopes that they would provide information about the Gardner robbery in exchange for possible assistance in this case.<sup>[4]</sup> But he claimed that his interest had been primarily in Merlino, not Turner, and that his interest in both diminished after April 1998 because he concluded that they could not facilitate the return of the Gardener paintings. To rebut Turner's entrapment theory, the government presented evidence that Turner had been convicted in 1989 and 1990 of two firearm offenses and one larceny/breaking and entering offense, which the government used to argue that he was predisposed to commit the instant offense. Although the court gave an entrapment instruction, the jury found Turner guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p>Between conviction and sentencing, Turner filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. Turner argued that a new trial was warranted due to the government's improper failure to produce significant exculpatory evidence, in violation of <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The evidence consisted of several FBI investigative reports (302s) regarding a second FBI informant who had provided information about Merlino's and Turner's possible involvement in the Gardener robbery.<sup>[5]</sup> Turner argued that the 302s would have constituted powerful evidence supporting his entrapment defense and would have eviscerated Cronin's testimony that he had a reduced interest in Merlino and Turner after April 1998. The district court denied the motion and sentenced Turner to 460 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Turner raises several challenges to his conviction and sentence, including: (A.) a Hobbs Act conspiracy is not a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924; (B.) the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for attempted robbery under the Hobbs Act; (C.) the district court improperly instructed the jury on the elements of vicarious entrapment and the necessary impact on interstate commerce for a Hobbs Act violation; (D.) the court erred in admitting Merlino's taped statements regarding Turner's criminal past; (E.) the court erred in admitting evidence of Turner's prior convictions and the radio frequency detector; (F.) the court erred in denying Turner's motion to sever his trial from Merlino's and to sever the felon-in-possession counts from the rest of the charges; (G.) the court erred in denying his motion for a new trial; (H.) Turner was entitled to a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility; and (I.) Turner is entitled to remand for resentencing pursuant to <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<sup>[6]</sup> Concluding that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> none of these challenges succeed, we affirm Turner's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p>A. Hobbs Act Conspiracy as Crime of Violence</p>\n<p>Turner argues that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the Section 924(c) counts because conspiracy under the Hobbs Act is not a predicate \"crime of violence.\"<sup>[7]</sup> Turner reasons that, because an overt act is not required for a conspiracy conviction under the Hobbs Act, the crime is complete with the making of the agreement (which is not a violent act). Turner relies upon <i>Leocal v. Ashcroft,</i> 543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) and <i>United States v. King,</i> 979 F.2d 801 (10th Cir.1992), in pressing this claim.</p>\n<p>We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Frechette,</i> 456 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2006). The overwhelming weight of authority holds that a Hobbs Act conspiracy is a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of Section 924(c). <i>See </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 176 F.3d 331, 337-38 (6th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Phan,</i> 121 F.3d 149, 152-53 (4th Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Elder,</i> 88 F.3d 127, 129 (2d Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Mendez,</i> 992 F.2d 1488, 1491 (9th Cir. 1992). These courts reason:</p>\n<blockquote>A conspiracy, by its very nature, is a collective criminal effort where a common goal unites two or more criminals. Such a meeting of the minds enhances the likelihood that the planned crime will be carried out. Thus, when a conspiracy exists to commit a crime of violence, . . . the conspiracy itself poses a substantial risk of violence, which qualifies it under Section 924(c)(1) and Section 924(c)(3)(B) as a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Elder,</i> 88 F.3d at 129 (internal citation and quotation omitted). This authority is consistent with our rationale for concluding that a conspiracy to commit a crime of violence is a crime of violence under the Bail Reform Act (which is worded identically to Section 924(c)). <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 23 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1994)(collecting cases reaching same result under the criminal code). The absence of an overt act requirement does not alter our view. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Fiore,</i> 983 F.2d 1, 4 n. 4 (1st Cir.1992)(state conspiracy offense was \"crime of violence\" for purposes of career offender guideline, even though no act was required); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. McKenney,</i> 450 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 537, 166 L.Ed.2d 398 (2006)(drug conspiracy as predicate offense under Armed Career Criminal Act). Indeed, in <i>Fiore,</i> we stated that the key inquiry in assessing the nature of a conspiracy is to ask \"conspiracy to do what?\"  as the object of the conspiracy is the critical determinant of its nature. <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>Turner counters that this authority has been undermined by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Leocal.</i> In that case the Court concluded that the offense of driving while intoxicated which causes serious bodily injury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> (under Florida law) was not a \"crime of violence\" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16). 543 U.S. at 10-13, 125 S.Ct. 377. <i>Leocal</i> is inapposite for at least two reasons. First, the Court's rationale was that the Florida statute criminalized conduct that was merely accidental or negligent and thus not inherently \"violent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8-10, 125 S.Ct. 377 (noting that 18 U.S.C. § 16 has higher mens rea requirement). This is not the case with a Hobbs Act violation. Second, the Court was not dealing with inchoate offenses. <i>Id.</i> at 8-9, 125 S.Ct. 377 (\"We do not here deal with an <i>attempted</i> or <i>threatened</i> use of force.\"). <i>Leocal</i> thus has not undermined the conclusion that a conspiracy may qualify as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p>Turner also contends that the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>King</i> properly acknowledges the significance of the absence of an overt act requirement in a parallel context. In <i>King,</i> 979 F.2d at 803. The Tenth Circuit concluded that conspiracy under New Mexico law, which did not require proof of an overt act, was not a crime of violence. The court held that because the crime of conspiracy was complete upon \"formation of the intent to commit a felony, and does not require that any action be taken on that intent, the elements of conspiracy to commit a violent felony do not include the threatened use of physical force.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded by <i>King,</i> which, aside from being at odds with our authority and the great weight of authority from other circuits, does not consider the importance of the object of the conspiracy, which under our case law is a critical inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Fiore,</i> 983 F.2d at 3.<sup>[8]</sup> We conclude that conspiracy under the Hobbs Act constitutes a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).</p>\n<p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence of Attempted Robbery</p>\n<p>Turner next argues that the evidence does not support a conviction for attempted robbery. He maintains that, at the time of the arrest, his actions could at best be characterized as \"mere preparation\" because he was far from the designated target, Loomis Fargo, and was driving away from the rallying point when apprehended. To his view, the arrest should have been made after the group arrived at Loomis Fargo or, at the earliest, when they had assembled, prepared, and left TRC in their vehicles.</p>\n<p>We assess a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by determining whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government, supports the guilty verdict. <i>United States v. Burgos,</i> 254 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.2001). \"To prove attempt, the government must establish both an intent to commit the substantive offense and a substantial step towards its commission.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12 (internal citation omitted). While \"mere preparation\" does not constitute a substantial step, a defendant \"does not have to get very far along the line toward ultimate commission of the object crime in order to commit the attempt offense.\" <i>United States v. Doyon,</i> 194 F.3d 207, 211 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Under this standard, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Turner and his compatriots planned the offense in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> great detail, assembled weapons and other robbery equipment, prepared vehicles, surveiled the target, practiced dry-runs, and gathered at the designated assembly point on the day scheduled for the robbery. No more is required. <i>See generally </i><i>United States v. LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d 36, 48 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Chapdelaine,</i> 989 F.2d 28, 30-33 (1st Cir.1993). Indeed, the facts in both <i>LiCausi</i> and <i>Chapdelaine</i> are strikingly similar to the conduct of Turner and his cohorts in this case. The <i>LiCausi</i> and <i>Chapdelaine</i> defendants surveiled the target, assembled weapons, utilized disguises/robbery clothes, stole and positioned vehicles for use in the robbery and subsequent escape, and used a radio scanner to monitor police activity. <i>See id.</i> As in each of those cases, the evidence here suffices to support a conviction for attempted armed robbery. Moreover, there is no requirement that the actions constituting the attempt have a particular geographic proximity to the object of the substantive offense. <i>See generally </i><i>Doyon,</i> 194 F.3d at 212 (drug dealer's payment of past drug debt to supplier constituted a substantial step in his attempt to make a future narcotics purchase). And the fact that Turner may have detected the FBI's surveillance and tried to abandon the attempt at the last moment is irrelevant. <i>See </i><i>LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d at 48 (that defendants abandoned the attempt after seeing a large number of people in front of the target and intercepting a police call on a radio scanner was inconsequential as they had already taken a substantial step toward the robbery); <i>United States v. Del Carmen Ramirez,</i> 823 F.2d 1, 1-2 (1st Cir.1987)(that defendants hid guns in grass and attempted to leave area when they spotted police is irrelevant because defendants had already completed a substantial step).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>C. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p>Turner raises two challenges to the jury instructions. He first argues that the instructions were inadequate in their description of the required impact on interstate commerce necessary for a Hobbs Act conviction. Turner posits that the Supreme Court, in <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), raised the impact on interstate commerce required under the Hobbs Act from \"any impact\" to a \"substantial impact.\" Further, Turner asserts that the factual impossibility of the robbery forecloses as a matter of law the possibility that his crime had a substantial impact on interstate commerce. He also argues that the court erred in instructing the jury regarding the vicarious entrapment defense. Turner says that the court should not have told the jury that the government agent must \"specifically target\" the defendant and \"specifically instruct\" the intermediary to pressure the defendant. In assessing a challenge to jury instructions, our task is to determine if the instructions, taken as a whole, fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d 169, 178 (1st Cir.2004), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 543 U.S. 1099, 125 S.Ct. 1030, 160 L.Ed.2d 994 (2005) (<i>Booker</i>).</p>\n<p>Turner's first challenge fails. We have held specifically that <i>Lopez</i> did not change the interstate commerce requirement for a Hobbs Act conviction, stating that \"the government must show only that the . . . conduct created a realistic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> probability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d 327, 334-36 (1st Cir.2003)(internal citation and quotation omitted). The planned theft of over $50 million from a national armored car company more than qualifies. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Jimenez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2006). Turner's impossibility contention also fails. \"While the substantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy may be impossible to achieve, the conspiracy nonetheless qualifies as an offense for which a person may be prosecuted\" under federal law. <i>United States v. Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 78 (1st Cir.2005)(government sting operation); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> 246 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.2001)(\"All that matters is that [defendant] entered a conspiracy whose objective was to steal the assets of an entity in interstate commerce. That the conspiracy failed to accomplish such objective is irrelevant.\").</p>\n<p>We also reject Turner's challenge to the \"vicarious entrapment instruction.\" The district court's instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Inducement by a codefendant constitutes some vicarious entrapment by the government if the following three elements are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>First, that a government agent specifically identified the defendant as the desired target of the inducement or pressure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>second, that the government agent encouraged the codefendant to induce or pressure the defendant to commit the crime, or his government agent's handlers condoned the use of coercive inducements or pressure by the codefendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>third, the codefendant, in fact, applied pressure or an improper inducement to overcome the defendant's reluctance to become involved.</blockquote>\n<p>Turner's claim that the second part of the instruction included a requisite that the government agent must \"specifically instruct\" the codefendant to induce the defendant to participate in the crime is baseless. The instruction explicitly allows for situations where the codefendant, on his own, coerces the defendant into joining the criminal enterprise, and the government merely condones the action. This instruction is consistent with our case law on the third-party entrapment defense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d 43, 54-56 (1st Cir.2007) <i>United States v. Rogers,</i> 102 F.3d 641, 645 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d 3, 7-8 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>Turner's alternative claim, that the instruction improperly informed the jury that the government agent must initially \"target\" the defendant may have more traction, as such a requirement does not explicitly appear in <i>Luisi, Rogers</i> or <i>Bradley,</i> and it makes the defense somewhat harder for a defendant to establish. But even if there was error, and we are not saying that there was, the error was harmless. To prevail on an entrapment claim, the defendant must show that he was improperly induced by the government to engage in criminal conduct and that he was not predisposed to engage in the conduct. <i>Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d at 76. Improper inducement consists of more than providing an opportunity to a commit a crime; the inducement must create \"a risk of causing an otherwise unwilling person to commit the crime.\" <i>United States v. Walter,</i> 434 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir.2006)(internal citation and quotation omitted). The something \"more\" generally consists of excessive pressure by the government agent on the defendant or the exploitation of a defendant's noncriminal motive, for example, sympathy. <i>Id.</i> Failure to establish either improper inducement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> or lack of predisposition defeats the defense. <i>Id.</i> at 35-36.</p>\n<p>The evidence is strong that there was no improper inducement and that Turner was predisposed to commit the crime. Despite making several phone calls and pages to Turner, Merlino made it clear that he was making an offer to participate which Turner could readily decline. There was no hint of threats or any other undue pressure  simply the opportunity for a big score. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d at 76-77 (neither mere solicitation nor the prospect of illicit gain constitutes improper inducement). Moreover, Turner's own statements, either on tape or attributed to him by Romano, and conduct clearly paint him as an experienced criminal and an eager participant. Turner engaged in additional surveillance of the target, ran an additional dry run with the \"insider,\" stated that the group should shoot it out with police if stopped, expressed concern that his Tahoe was bugged, commiserated with Rosetti about the intense impatience one feels while waiting to begin a planned robbery, and expressed concern that he and Merlino should not be seen together because people know that when they are together something illegal is going to happen. <i>See generally </i><i>Walter,</i> 434 F.3d at 37 (predisposition may be inferred from the defendant's statements showing experience with criminal activity). On this record, Turner's entrapment defense could not prevail.</p>\n<p>D. Merlino's Statements</p>\n<p>Turner raises three challenges to the admission of Carmello Merlino's taped statements about Turner's criminal past: that his entrapment defense was fatally prejudiced by the admission of the statements, that the admission of Merlino's statements constituted error under <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and that admission of the statements violated his right of confrontation under <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p>We begin with common ground. Both sides agree that the statements are admissible against Merlino. Further, both sides agree that statements in furtherance of the conspiracy, made by Merlino after Turner joined the conspiracy, are admissible against Turner. <i>See generally </i><i>LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d at 46. At issue are statements made by Merlino before the January 13, 1999 meeting, which the jury could understand to mean that Turner was proficient with firearms (e.g., \"good with these\"), could obtain them (e.g., \"they got one or two\"), and had participated in other robberies (e.g., \"knows how to do these\").</p>\n<p>Again here, any error with respect to the entrapment defense was harmless. \"The admission of improper testimony is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>Isler,</i> 429 F.3d at 26 (internal citation omitted). Factors to consider in this calculus include the importance of the evidence, its uniqueness, how it was used, and the relative strength of the opposing case. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In our view, the statements in question were merely cumulative, as Merlino made nearly identical comments about Turner after January 13th. Moreover, as we have noted, Turner's own comments were to the same effect. Finally, as we have also noted, the evidence that Turner was not entrapped was strong, and the pre-January 13th comments were not emphasized by the government in its argument.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment challenges are also flawed. Merlino's statements implying past criminal behavior on Turner's part did not directly implicate Turner in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> charged conspiracy. Therefore, the admission of the statements could not constitute <i>Bruton</i> error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 46 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (1st Cir. 1995) (no <i>Bruton</i> error where the codefendant's statement does not expressly implicate the defendant). Similarly, there is no <i>Crawford</i> error, as Merlino's secretly recorded statements were not \"testimonial,\" within the meaning of <i>Crawford. See generally </i><i>United States v. Brito,</i> 427 F.3d 53, 58-59 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>Horton v. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d 75, 83-85 (1st Cir.2004) (conspirator's statement to witness during private conversation was not testimonial).</p>\n<p>E. Other Evidentiary Claims</p>\n<p>Turner raises two other challenges to the district court's evidentiary rulings. First, he argues that the court erred in admitting evidence of two prior convictions that were remote in time and of dubious relevance. Second, he contends that the court erred in admitting evidence of the radio frequency detector<sup>[10]</sup> found in his vehicle, which Turner maintains served no function other than to prejudice the jury. We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Mercado Irizarry,</i> 404 F.3d 497, 500 (1st Cir.2005). There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>The prior convictions were highly probative to rebut Turner's entrapment defense and not too remote in time. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d 48, 57-58 (1st Cir.2002). Moreover, given the nature of the conspiracy and Turner's role in providing the firearms, the prior convictions were clearly relevant. Similarly, the radio frequency detector was probative of the sophisticated nature of the conspiracy and, thus, the merits of the entrapment defense. Moreover, the admission of the radio frequency detector is no more prejudicial than the admission of the police scanners, which Turner does not challenge.</p>\n<p>F. Severance</p>\n<p>Turner next argues that the district court erred in refusing to sever his felon-in-possession counts and in failing to sever his trial from Merlino's. As to the former, Turner asserts that the felon-in-possession counts prejudiced his entrapment defense. As to the latter, Turner argues that a severance was necessary to obtain Merlino's testimony that (1) Romano raised Turner's name and pressured Merlino to recruit him, (2) Turner initially rejected Merlino's overtures and Merlino continued to apply pressure on him, and (3) Turner had received Merlino's repeated pages and telephone messages.</p>\n<p>We begin with the refusal to sever felon-in-possession counts, assessing the district court's ruling for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Burgos,</i> 254 F.3d at 13. To prevail on this claim, Turner must show that the \"improper joinder likely deprived him of a fair trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14 (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>There was no abuse of discretion in the district court's refusal to sever these counts. The felon-in-possession counts were properly tried with the other counts because they arose out of the same conduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rose,</i> 104 F.3d 1408, 1416 (1st Cir.1997). In addition, any possible prejudice was limited by Turner's stipulation to his status as a convicted felon. <i>See id.</i> Moreover, and in any event, as discussed above, his prior convictions were properly a part of the government's rebuttal of his entrapment defense. <i>See </i><i>Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d at 57-58.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> As to the severance of Merlino and Turner's trials, we start by noting that individuals who are indicted together generally should be tried together. <i>United States v. Pena-Lora,</i> 225 F.3d 17, 33 (1st Cir.2000). Moreover, severance is particularly disfavored in conspiracy cases. <i>Id.</i> To be entitled to severance, the defendant must show \"prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.\" <i>LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d at 49. To obtain a severance based upon the need for a codefendant's testimony, the defendant must show \"(1) a bona fide need for the testimony; (2) the substance of the testimony; (3) its exculpatory nature and effect; and (4) that the codefendant will in fact testify if the cases are severed.\" <i>Smith,</i> 46 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p>Under this standard, there was no manifest abuse of discretion in denying the motion. The proffered testimony was of limited, if any significance to Turner's entrapment defense because it did not tend to refute the overwhelming evidence of predisposition nor indicate improper inducement.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>G. Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p>Turner argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the government violated its obligations under <i>Brady</i> in improperly suppressing the FBI 302 reports regarding a second informant-the so-called \"Chicofsky materials.\" Turner asserts that the suppressed materials would have provided invaluable support for his entrapment defense, and that the evidence would have enabled him to impeach Cronin's testimony that his interest in Merlino and Turner waned after April.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Brady,</i> the government is required to turn over exculpatory or impeachment evidence in its possession to the defendant. <i>United States v. Rivera-Rangel,</i> 396 F.3d 476, 485 (1st Cir.2005). A new trial is warranted based upon a <i>Brady</i> violation if the defendant establishes that (1) the evidence is material and favorable to the defense, (2) the prosecution suppressed the evidence, and (3) the defendant was prejudiced because there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. <i>Id.</i> Suppressed evidence that is merely cumulative of evidence already in the defendant's possession does not justify a new trial. <i>Conley v. United States,</i> 415 F.3d 183, 189 (1st Cir.2005). We review the district court's decision for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>Rivera Rangel,</i> 396 F.3d at 485-86.</p>\n<p>Turner's <i>Brady</i> claim fails because the Chicofsky materials, and related documents, are not nearly as beneficial as Turner claims. All but two of the thirty-eight Chicofsky 302s precede May 1, 1998, and the other two reports did not mention Turner; this is consistent with Cronin's testimony that his belief that Merlino would or could return the paintings waned after April 1998. Further, Turner was mentioned in only five of the 302s, and Merlino's attempts to return the paintings, as recounted in the 302s, focused entirely on other individuals. Moreover, all this evidence was merely cumulative of stronger evidence presented at trial suggestive of the FBI's potential motivation to entrap Turner. Indeed, Cronin's own testimony made it clear that he was in active negotiations with Merlino in April 1998, that he was well aware of Turner's connection to Merlino, that he had received reports from Romano regarding the Gardener robbery <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> throughout the conspiracy, and that he visited Turner on the day of his arrest in a last attempt to secure information regarding the Gardener robbery. Most significantly, Turner's presentation continues to focus on the FBI's potential motive to entrap him, while ignoring the more significant issues of inducement and predisposition. On those issues, the Chicofsky materials contribute nothing.<sup>[12]</sup> There is nothing about the suppressed materials that suggests a reasonable probability of a different result.</p>\n<p>H. Sentencing</p>\n<p>Finally, Turner raises two issues regarding his sentence. He first claims that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, claiming that he did not deny the \"essential factual elements of guilt\" but simply challenged the government's conduct with his entrapment defense. While it is remotely conceivable, in some rare circumstance, that a defendant who goes to trial with an entrapment defense might still be entitled to such a reduction, Turner's decision to defend himself at trial through a weak claim of entrapment in no way places him in this narrow theoretical category. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d at 79; <i>see also </i><i>Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d at 180.</p>\n<p>Turner next claims that he is entitled to a remand for resentencing under <i>Booker,</i> as he has met the four-part plain error test discussed in <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 78-79 (1st Cir.2005)(there was error, the error was plain, the error affected substantial rights of the defendant, and the error undermined the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings). Turner meets the first two parts, because the district court treated the guidelines as mandatory. <i>See </i><i>Isler,</i> 429 F.3d at 29. However, to satisfy parts three and four, Turner \"must show a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new advisory guidelines.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir.2005)(internal citation and quotation omitted). Turner cannot carry this burden. The district court rejected his request to be sentenced at the bottom of the guideline range, and such a refusal \"speaks volumes\" about the defendant's chances on remand. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, a review of the sentencing materials reveals no indication that the district judge would be inclined to impose a lower sentence. <i>See id.</i><sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, Turner's conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Gardener robbery was one of the largest art thefts in history and resulted in the loss of several priceless paintings. Despite the offer of a $5 million reward, the thieves have not been apprehended nor have the paintings been recovered.</p>\n<p>[2]  The \"insider\" would be called via a special cell phone, then leave the facility for the parking lot, ostensibly to get something from his car. The conspirators intended to pretend to take the insider hostage with a gun to his head and enter the facility. On these dry runs an undercover FBI agent, acting as the inside man, responded to the calls and went to his car in the parking lot as arranged (while the conspirators observed him from a distance).</p>\n<p>[3]  Their motion to continue the trial in light of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks upon the United States was denied.</p>\n<p>[4]  Nadolski provided similar testimony on cross-examination during the government's case-in-chief.</p>\n<p>[5]  Turner's motion was also based upon certain other law enforcement reports, but his presentation here focuses on the 302s related to the second informant.</p>\n<p>[6]  Turner raises certain other challenges that do not warrant significant discussion. First, he argues that the trial should have been postponed based upon the terrorist attacks upon the United States on September 11, 2001. This contention fails as this case did not concern terrorism and Turner presents no basis for believing that the denial of a continuance in any way prejudiced him. Second, he argues that he should have been permitted to question Nadolski about his knowledge of the penalty for possession of a grenade. This contention also fails, as Turner presents no coherent claim of sentencing entrapment and the evidence made it clear that Merlino (rather than Nadolski through Romano) brought up the matter of grenades.</p>\n<p>[7]  Section 924(c) provides an enhanced penalty for anyone who uses or carries a firearm in relation to a \"crime of violence.\" \"Crime of violence\" is defined as \"an offense that is a felony and  (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (B) that by its very nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3).</p>\n<p>[8]  We note that the Tenth Circuit has more recently moved toward the majority position. In <i>United States v. Brown,</i> the court observed that, despite the fact that conspiracy punishes the agreement rather than the substantive offense, \"at minimum, an agreement to accomplish the statutory elements of [a violent felony] necessarily involves a substantial risk of physical force against the person or property of the victim.\" 200 F.3d 700, 706 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p>[9]  We note a final flaw with Turner's position. In light of the defendants' formidable arsenal and stated intent to \"have it out\" with the police, waiting to make the arrest until the defendants left TRC (with bullet proof vests on and weapons at ready) or arrived at Loomis Fargo would have exposed law enforcement personnel and the public to unnecessary risk.</p>\n<p>[10]  A radio frequency detector is a device for detecting hidden listening devices.</p>\n<p>[11]  Furthermore, any suggestion of improper inducement would be refuted by Merlino's taped statements to the contrary.</p>\n<p>[12]  Turner's other arguments regarding Chicofsky  that Chicofsky should not have been permitted to invoke the Fifth Amendment at the hearing and that Turner should have been permitted to examine him question by question  are too perfunctorily presented to merit review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[13]  Turner also argues that the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1 instead of § 2B3.1, and, alternatively, that the district court erred in failing to grant a reduction under U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(b)(2). Both of these arguments are presented without authority and in such a perfunctory manner that we deem them waived. <i>See </i><i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n\n</div>",

Turner appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Isler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201921\"><a href=\"/opinion/201921/united-states-v-isler/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2005), reserving a discussion of additional facts for our analysis.</p>\n<p>Turner and his fellow conspirators Carmello Merlino (Merlino), Stephen Rosetti, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> and William Merlino were arrested on February 7, 1999, as they converged upon their designated rallying point  TRC Auto Electric (TRC). From there, the conspirators had intended to go to the Loomis Fargo armored car facility in Easton, Massachusetts and rob it of over $50 million. To carry out this plan, the conspirators had acquired an arsenal of several handguns, an assault rifle, and a hand grenade, as well as masks, bullet proof vests, police scanners, a radio frequency detector, large duffle bags for the money, and vehicles that they intended to use during the robbery and subsequent escape. The planned heist was an FBI sting, however, and a purported fifth coconspirator, Anthony Romano, was an FBI informant who had worn a wire during the planning of the robbery.</p>\n<p>At trial, Turner claimed entrapment based upon the FBI's tactics in conducting the sting. His claim focused upon two FBI agents, David Nadolski and William Cronin, and Romano. Turner asserted that the FBI agents induced him to participate in the crime so that they could pressure him to provide information regarding the 1990 robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston, about which they thought he had knowledge.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In 1996, Romano, then incarcerated, had contacted Nadolski and provided information regarding the robbery of the John Quincy Adams Library that led to the conviction of the perpetrator and the recovery of stolen rare books. Romano remained in periodic contact with Nadolski thereafter. In October 1997, Romano was released from prison and obtained employment at TRC from his friend, Merlino. Romano then contacted Nadolski with two pieces of information: (1) that Romano believed that Merlino and his associate, Turner, had been involved in the Gardener robbery; and (2) that Merlino was planning to rob the Loomis Fargo facility. Nadolski informed Cronin, who already believed that Merlino and Turner (who was believed to be a member of Merlino's crew) were somehow involved in the Gardener robbery. Romano was told to \"keep his ears open.\" Cronin ultimately met with Merlino three times between January and late April 1998, to negotiate for the return of the paintings. The negotiations ended after the third meeting, with Cronin expressing frustration that Merlino could not return the paintings and would not voluntarily provide information about them.</p>\n<p>Between April and November 1998, Romano continued to provide information about the Gardener robbery and the Loomis Fargo plans  notably, that Merlino wished Romano to arrange for an insider at Loomis Fargo to provide them with information about the interior of the facility. Nadolski, the case agent on the Loomis Fargo matter, decided to proceed with a sting operation, with an FBI agent acting as the insider. In November, Romano agreed to become a \"cooperating witness\" for the FBI and to record various conversations. At this time, Romano told Merlino that he had finally procured an \"insider.\" With the assistance of Loomis Fargo's security personnel, the FBI provided Romano with information about the facility and a purported diagram of the interior that he could forward to Merlino. When Romano was directed by Merlino to steal a vehicle and license plates, the FBI provided Romano with them.</p>\n<p>Merlino and Romano discussed possible accomplices for the heist, and Merlino suggested <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> Turner, making various comments about Turner's criminal experience. Merlino's initial attempts to contact Turner were unsuccessful, and Romano periodically inquired about Turner's status, even suggesting that William Merlino be sent to look for him. Turner ultimately responded.</p>\n<p>Turner and Rosetti joined the conspiracy on January 13, 1999, after Merlino presented his plan to them at a restaurant. Thereafter, matters sped ahead, with the conspirators discussing weapons, tactics, vehicles, the advisability of taking hostages, and the need to evade the police if stopped, as well as engaging in \"dry runs\" with the insider.<sup>[2]</sup> They selected February 7, 1999 as the robbery date, agreeing to rendezvous at TRC in the early morning.</p>\n<p>Carmello Merlino was arrested upon his arrival; William Merlino was arrested at a nearby gas station after he attempted to enter TRC. Turner and Rosetti arrived at TRC in Rosetti's Honda, and they proceeded to \"square the block\"  check for following vehicles and surveil the area for law enforcement personnel. Apparently sensing something was amiss, they left the area and drove to Turner's Chevrolet Tahoe that had been parked in a nearby condominium complex parking lot. There they removed several large duffle bags from the Honda and placed them in the Tahoe. Thereafter, they returned in the Honda to TRC and again began squaring the block. Law enforcement personnel arrested them after a brief chase. A search of the Tahoe revealed weapons, ammunition, masks, bullet proof vests, scanners, a radio frequency detector, the box for the cell phone provided to the insider, and other equipment. A search of TRC revealed the van that was to be used in the heist, which contained other robbery equipment.</p>\n<p>Turner was indicted for six offenses: conspiracy to affect commerce by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Hobbs Act) (Count 1), attempt to affect commerce by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count 2), carrying a firearm (grenade) in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 3), carrying a firearm (handguns and an assault rifle) in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 4), being a felon in possession of a firearm (grenade) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count 5), and being a felon in possession of a firearm (handguns and an assault rifle) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count 6).</p>\n<p>All defendants were tried together.<sup>[3]</sup> In addition to the tapes and physical evidence, the government presented the testimony of Romano, Nadolski, and a host of other agents who had participated in the sting. The government also presented a stipulation that Turner was a convicted felon.</p>\n<p>Turner's defense presented a theory of \"vicarious entrapment\"  that the FBI, through Romano, coerced an unsuspecting third party (Merlino) into inducing Turner to join the conspiracy so that the FBI could use the prosecution as leverage on Turner to cooperate in the Gardener robbery investigation. Turner called FBI special agent Cronin as his only witness. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Cronin acknowledged that he was provided information by Romano about the Gardener robbery throughout the conspiracy, and that he believed Turner would be more likely to cooperate if he were facing serious criminal charges. He also acknowledged that he visited both Turner and Merlino immediately after their arrest in hopes that they would provide information about the Gardner robbery in exchange for possible assistance in this case.<sup>[4]</sup> But he claimed that his interest had been primarily in Merlino, not Turner, and that his interest in both diminished after April 1998 because he concluded that they could not facilitate the return of the Gardener paintings. To rebut Turner's entrapment theory, the government presented evidence that Turner had been convicted in 1989 and 1990 of two firearm offenses and one larceny/breaking and entering offense, which the government used to argue that he was predisposed to commit the instant offense. Although the court gave an entrapment instruction, the jury found Turner guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p>Between conviction and sentencing, Turner filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. Turner argued that a new trial was warranted due to the government's improper failure to produce significant exculpatory evidence, in violation of <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span> (1963). The evidence consisted of several FBI investigative reports (302s) regarding a second FBI informant who had provided information about Merlino's and Turner's possible involvement in the Gardener robbery.<sup>[5]</sup> Turner argued that the 302s would have constituted powerful evidence supporting his entrapment defense and would have eviscerated Cronin's testimony that he had a reduced interest in Merlino and Turner after April 1998. The district court denied the motion and sentenced Turner to 460 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Turner raises several challenges to his conviction and sentence, including: (A.) a Hobbs Act conspiracy is not a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924; (B.) the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for attempted robbery under the Hobbs Act; (C.) the district court improperly instructed the jury on the elements of vicarious entrapment and the necessary impact on interstate commerce for a Hobbs Act violation; (D.) the court erred in admitting Merlino's taped statements regarding Turner's criminal past; (E.) the court erred in admitting evidence of Turner's prior convictions and the radio frequency detector; (F.) the court erred in denying Turner's motion to sever his trial from Merlino's and to sever the felon-in-possession counts from the rest of the charges; (G.) the court erred in denying his motion for a new trial; (H.) Turner was entitled to a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility; and (I.) Turner is entitled to remand for resentencing pursuant to <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005).<sup>[6]</sup> Concluding that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> none of these challenges succeed, we affirm Turner's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p>A. Hobbs Act Conspiracy as Crime of Violence</p>\n<p>Turner argues that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the Section 924(c) counts because conspiracy under the Hobbs Act is not a predicate \"crime of violence.\"<sup>[7]</sup> Turner reasons that, because an overt act is not required for a conspiracy conviction under the Hobbs Act, the crime is complete with the making of the agreement (which is not a violent act). Turner relies upon <i>Leocal v.

The overwhelming weight of authority holds that a Hobbs Act conspiracy is a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of Section 924(c). <i>See </i><i>United States v.

These courts reason:</p>\n<blockquote>A conspiracy, by its very nature, is a collective criminal effort where a common goal unites two or more criminals. Such a meeting of the minds enhances the likelihood that the planned crime will be carried out. Thus, when a conspiracy exists to commit a crime of violence, . . . the conspiracy itself poses a substantial risk of violence, which qualifies it under Section 924(c)(1) and Section 924(c)(3)(B) as a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Elder,</i> 88 F.3d at 129 (internal citation and quotation omitted). This authority is consistent with our rationale for concluding that a conspiracy to commit a crime of violence is a crime of violence under the Bail Reform Act (which is worded identically to Section 924(c)). <i>See </i><i>United States v.

The absence of an overt act requirement does not alter our view. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></span> (2006)(drug conspiracy as predicate offense under Armed Career Criminal Act). Indeed, in <i>Fiore,</i> we stated that the key inquiry in assessing the nature of a conspiracy is to ask \"conspiracy to do what?\"  as the object of the conspiracy is the critical determinant of its nature. <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>Turner counters that this authority has been undermined by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Leocal.</i> In that case the Court concluded that the offense of driving while intoxicated which causes serious bodily injury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> (under Florida law) was not a \"crime of violence\" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16). 543 U.S. at 10-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137725\"><a href=\"/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>. <i>Leocal</i> is inapposite for at least two reasons. First, the Court's rationale was that the Florida statute criminalized conduct that was merely accidental or negligent and thus not inherently \"violent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137725\"><a href=\"/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span> (noting that 18 U.S.C. § 16 has higher mens rea requirement). This is not the case with a Hobbs Act violation. Second, the Court was not dealing with inchoate offenses. <i>Id.</i> at 8-9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137725\"><a href=\"/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span> (\"We do not here deal with an <i>attempted</i> or <i>threatened</i> use of force.\"). <i>Leocal</i> thus has not undermined the conclusion that a conspiracy may qualify as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p>Turner also contends that the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>King</i> properly acknowledges the significance of the absence of an overt act requirement in a parallel context. In <i>King,</i> 979 F.2d at 803. The Tenth Circuit concluded that conspiracy under New Mexico law, which did not require proof of an overt act, was not a crime of violence. The court held that because the crime of conspiracy was complete upon \"formation of the intent to commit a felony, and does not require that any action be taken on that intent, the elements of conspiracy to commit a violent felony do not include the threatened use of physical force.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded by <i>King,</i> which, aside from being at odds with our authority and the great weight of authority from other circuits, does not consider the importance of the object of the conspiracy, which under our case law is a critical inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Fiore,</i> 983 F.2d at 3.<sup>[8]</sup> We conclude that conspiracy under the Hobbs Act constitutes a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).</p>\n<p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence of Attempted Robbery</p>\n<p>Turner next argues that the evidence does not support a conviction for attempted robbery. He maintains that, at the time of the arrest, his actions could at best be characterized as \"mere preparation\" because he was far from the designated target, Loomis Fargo, and was driving away from the rallying point when apprehended. To his view, the arrest should have been made after the group arrived at Loomis Fargo or, at the earliest, when they had assembled, prepared, and left TRC in their vehicles.</p>\n<p>We assess a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by determining whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government, supports the guilty verdict. <i>United States v. Burgos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199459\"><a href=\"/opinion/199459/united-states-v-burgos/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2001). \"To prove attempt, the government must establish both an intent to commit the substantive offense and a substantial step towards its commission.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12 (internal citation omitted). While \"mere preparation\" does not constitute a substantial step, a defendant \"does not have to get very far along the line toward ultimate commission of the object crime in order to commit the attempt offense.\" <i>United States v. Doyon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198684\"><a href=\"/opinion/198684/united-states-v-doyon/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 211 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Under this standard, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Turner and his compatriots planned the offense in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> great detail, assembled weapons and other robbery equipment, prepared vehicles, surveiled the target, practiced dry-runs, and gathered at the designated assembly point on the day scheduled for the robbery. No more is required. <i>See generally </i><i>United States v. LiCausi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198296\"><a href=\"/opinion/198296/united-states-v-licausi/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Chapdelaine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602833\"><a href=\"/opinion/602833/united-states-v-george-chapdelaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 30-33 (1st Cir.1993). Indeed, the facts in both <i>LiCausi</i> and <i>Chapdelaine</i> are strikingly similar to the conduct of Turner and his cohorts in this case. The <i>LiCausi</i> and <i>Chapdelaine</i> defendants surveiled the target, assembled weapons, utilized disguises/robbery clothes, stole and positioned vehicles for use in the robbery and subsequent escape, and used a radio scanner to monitor police activity. <i>See id.</i> As in each of those cases, the evidence here suffices to support a conviction for attempted armed robbery. Moreover, there is no requirement that the actions constituting the attempt have a particular geographic proximity to the object of the substantive offense. <i>See generally </i><i>Doyon,</i> 194 F.3d at 212 (drug dealer's payment of past drug debt to supplier constituted a substantial step in his attempt to make a future narcotics purchase). And the fact that Turner may have detected the FBI's surveillance and tried to abandon the attempt at the last moment is irrelevant. <i>See </i><i>LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d at 48 (that defendants abandoned the attempt after seeing a large number of people in front of the target and intercepting a police call on a radio scanner was inconsequential as they had already taken a substantial step toward the robbery); <i>United States v. Del Carmen Ramirez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490949\"><a href=\"/opinion/490949/united-states-v-julio-del-carmen-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 1-2 (1st Cir.1987)(that defendants hid guns in grass and attempted to leave area when they spotted police is irrelevant because defendants had already completed a substantial step).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>C. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p>Turner raises two challenges to the jury instructions. He first argues that the instructions were inadequate in their description of the required impact on interstate commerce necessary for a Hobbs Act conviction. Turner posits that the Supreme Court, in <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1624</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span> (1995), raised the impact on interstate commerce required under the Hobbs Act from \"any impact\" to a \"substantial impact.\" Further, Turner asserts that the factual impossibility of the robbery forecloses as a matter of law the possibility that his crime had a substantial impact on interstate commerce. He also argues that the court erred in instructing the jury regarding the vicarious entrapment defense. Turner says that the court should not have told the jury that the government agent must \"specifically target\" the defendant and \"specifically instruct\" the intermediary to pressure the defendant. In assessing a challenge to jury instructions, our task is to determine if the instructions, taken as a whole, fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Glaum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200833\"><a href=\"/opinion/200833/united-states-v-glaum/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 178 (1st Cir.2004), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137725\"><a href=\"/opinion/137725/leocal-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>099, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></span> (2005) (<i>Booker</i>).</p>\n<p>Turner's first challenge fails. We have held specifically that <i>Lopez</i> did not change the interstate commerce requirement for a Hobbs Act conviction, stating that \"the government must show only that the . . . conduct created a realistic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> probability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200671\"><a href=\"/opinion/200671/united-states-v-capozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 334-36 (1st Cir.2003)(internal citation and quotation omitted). The planned theft of over $50 million from a national armored car company more than qualifies. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Jimenez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202004\"><a href=\"/opinion/202004/united-states-v-jimenez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2006). Turner's impossibility contention also fails. \"While the substantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy may be impossible to achieve, the conspiracy nonetheless qualifies as an offense for which a person may be prosecuted\" under federal law. <i>United States v. Sanchez-Berrios,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201833\"><a href=\"/opinion/201833/united-states-v-sanchez-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.2005)(government sting operation); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772789\"><a href=\"/opinion/772789/united-states-v-kieu-minh-nguyen/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2001)(\"All that matters is that [defendant] entered a conspiracy whose objective was to steal the assets of an entity in interstate commerce. That the conspiracy failed to accomplish such objective is irrelevant.\").</p>\n<p>We also reject Turner's challenge to the \"vicarious entrapment instruction.\" The district court's instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Inducement by a codefendant constitutes some vicarious entrapment by the government if the following three elements are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>First, that a government agent specifically identified the defendant as the desired target of the inducement or pressure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>second, that the government agent encouraged the codefendant to induce or pressure the defendant to commit the crime, or his government agent's handlers condoned the use of coercive inducements or pressure by the codefendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>third, the codefendant, in fact, applied pressure or an improper inducement to overcome the defendant's reluctance to become involved.</blockquote>\n<p>Turner's claim that the second part of the instruction included a requisite that the government agent must \"specifically instruct\" the codefendant to induce the defendant to participate in the crime is baseless. The instruction explicitly allows for situations where the codefendant, on his own, coerces the defendant into joining the criminal enterprise, and the government merely condones the action. This instruction is consistent with our case law on the third-party entrapment defense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Luisi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202719\"><a href=\"/opinion/202719/united-states-v-luisi/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 54-56 (1st Cir.2007) <i>United States v. Rogers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197136\"><a href=\"/opinion/197136/united-states-v-rogers/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 645 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489321\"><a href=\"/opinion/489321/united-states-v-john-c-bradley-united-states-of-america-v-howard-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7-8 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>Turner's alternative claim, that the instruction improperly informed the jury that the government agent must initially \"target\" the defendant may have more traction, as such a requirement does not explicitly appear in <i>Luisi, Rogers</i> or <i>Bradley,</i> and it makes the defense somewhat harder for a defendant to establish. But even if there was error, and we are not saying that there was, the error was harmless. To prevail on an entrapment claim, the defendant must show that he was improperly induced by the government to engage in criminal conduct and that he was not predisposed to engage in the conduct. <i>Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d at 76. Improper inducement consists of more than providing an opportunity to a commit a crime; the inducement must create \"a risk of causing an otherwise unwilling person to commit the crime.\" <i>United States v. Walter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202006\"><a href=\"/opinion/202006/united-states-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2006)(internal citation and quotation omitted). The something \"more\" generally consists of excessive pressure by the government agent on the defendant or the exploitation of a defendant's noncriminal motive, for example, sympathy. <i>Id.</i> Failure to establish either improper inducement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> or lack of predisposition defeats the defense. <i>Id.</i> at 35-36.</p>\n<p>The evidence is strong that there was no improper inducement and that Turner was predisposed to commit the crime. Despite making several phone calls and pages to Turner, Merlino made it clear that he was making an offer to participate which Turner could readily decline. There was no hint of threats or any other undue pressure  simply the opportunity for a big score. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d at 76-77 (neither mere solicitation nor the prospect of illicit gain constitutes improper inducement). Moreover, Turner's own statements, either on tape or attributed to him by Romano, and conduct clearly paint him as an experienced criminal and an eager participant. Turner engaged in additional surveillance of the target, ran an additional dry run with the \"insider,\" stated that the group should shoot it out with police if stopped, expressed concern that his Tahoe was bugged, commiserated with Rosetti about the intense impatience one feels while waiting to begin a planned robbery, and expressed concern that he and Merlino should not be seen together because people know that when they are together something illegal is going to happen. <i>See generally </i><i>Walter,</i> 434 F.3d at 37 (predisposition may be inferred from the defendant's statements showing experience with criminal activity). On this record, Turner's entrapment defense could not prevail.</p>\n<p>D. Merlino's Statements</p>\n<p>Turner raises three challenges to the admission of Carmello Merlino's taped statements about Turner's criminal past: that his entrapment defense was fatally prejudiced by the admission of the statements, that the admission of Merlino's statements constituted error under <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span> (1968), and that admission of the statements violated his right of confrontation under <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (2004).</p>\n<p>We begin with common ground. Both sides agree that the statements are admissible against Merlino. Further, both sides agree that statements in furtherance of the conspiracy, made by Merlino after Turner joined the conspiracy, are admissible against Turner. <i>See generally </i><i>LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d at 46. At issue are statements made by Merlino before the January 13, 1999 meeting, which the jury could understand to mean that Turner was proficient with firearms (e.g., \"good with these\"), could obtain them (e.g., \"they got one or two\"), and had participated in other robberies (e.g., \"knows how to do these\").</p>\n<p>Again here, any error with respect to the entrapment defense was harmless. \"The admission of improper testimony is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>Isler,</i> 429 F.3d at 26 (internal citation omitted). Factors to consider in this calculus include the importance of the evidence, its uniqueness, how it was used, and the relative strength of the opposing case. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In our view, the statements in question were merely cumulative, as Merlino made nearly identical comments about Turner after January 13th. Moreover, as we have noted, Turner's own comments were to the same effect. Finally, as we have also noted, the evidence that Turner was not entrapped was strong, and the pre-January 13th comments were not emphasized by the government in its argument.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment challenges are also flawed. Merlino's statements implying past criminal behavior on Turner's part did not directly implicate Turner in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> charged conspiracy. Therefore, the admission of the statements could not constitute <i>Bruton</i> error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195903\"><a href=\"/opinion/195903/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span>, 1227-28 (1st Cir. 1995) (no <i>Bruton</i> error where the codefendant's statement does not expressly implicate the defendant). Similarly, there is no <i>Crawford</i> error, as Merlino's secretly recorded statements were not \"testimonial,\" within the meaning of <i>Crawford. See generally </i><i>United States v. Brito,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201867\"><a href=\"/opinion/201867/united-states-v-brito/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 58-59 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>Horton v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201031\"><a href=\"/opinion/201031/horton-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 83-85 (1st Cir.2004) (conspirator's statement to witness during private conversation was not testimonial).</p>\n<p>E. Other Evidentiary Claims</p>\n<p>Turner raises two other challenges to the district court's evidentiary rulings. First, he argues that the court erred in admitting evidence of two prior convictions that were remote in time and of dubious relevance. Second, he contends that the court erred in admitting evidence of the radio frequency detector<sup>[10]</sup> found in his vehicle, which Turner maintains served no function other than to prejudice the jury. We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Mercado Irizarry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789904\"><a href=\"/opinion/789904/united-states-v-felix-mercado-irizarry-manuel-vazquez-mendez-eliezer/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 500 (1st Cir.2005). There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>The prior convictions were highly probative to rebut Turner's entrapment defense and not too remote in time. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Van Horn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199777\"><a href=\"/opinion/199777/united-states-v-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 57-58 (1st Cir.2002). Moreover, given the nature of the conspiracy and Turner's role in providing the firearms, the prior convictions were clearly relevant. Similarly, the radio frequency detector was probative of the sophisticated nature of the conspiracy and, thus, the merits of the entrapment defense. Moreover, the admission of the radio frequency detector is no more prejudicial than the admission of the police scanners, which Turner does not challenge.</p>\n<p>F. Severance</p>\n<p>Turner next argues that the district court erred in refusing to sever his felon-in-possession counts and in failing to sever his trial from Merlino's. As to the former, Turner asserts that the felon-in-possession counts prejudiced his entrapment defense. As to the latter, Turner argues that a severance was necessary to obtain Merlino's testimony that (1) Romano raised Turner's name and pressured Merlino to recruit him, (2) Turner initially rejected Merlino's overtures and Merlino continued to apply pressure on him, and (3) Turner had received Merlino's repeated pages and telephone messages.</p>\n<p>We begin with the refusal to sever felon-in-possession counts, assessing the district court's ruling for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Burgos,</i> 254 F.3d at 13. To prevail on this claim, Turner must show that the \"improper joinder likely deprived him of a fair trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14 (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>There was no abuse of discretion in the district court's refusal to sever these counts. The felon-in-possession counts were properly tried with the other counts because they arose out of the same conduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rose,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197184\"><a href=\"/opinion/197184/united-states-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1408</span></a></span>, 1416 (1st Cir.1997). In addition, any possible prejudice was limited by Turner's stipulation to his status as a convicted felon. <i>See id.</i> Moreover, and in any event, as discussed above, his prior convictions were properly a part of the government's rebuttal of his entrapment defense. <i>See </i><i>Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d at 57-58.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> As to the severance of Merlino and Turner's trials, we start by noting that individuals who are indicted together generally should be tried together. <i>United States v. Pena-Lora,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770240\"><a href=\"/opinion/770240/united-states-v-luis-manuel-pea-lora-united-states-of-america-v-jorge/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2000). Moreover, severance is particularly disfavored in conspiracy cases. <i>Id.</i> To be entitled to severance, the defendant must show \"prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.\" <i>LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d at 49. To obtain a severance based upon the need for a codefendant's testimony, the defendant must show \"(1) a bona fide need for the testimony; (2) the substance of the testimony; (3) its exculpatory nature and effect; and (4) that the codefendant will in fact testify if the cases are severed.\" <i>Smith,</i> 46 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p>Under this standard, there was no manifest abuse of discretion in denying the motion. The proffered testimony was of limited, if any significance to Turner's entrapment defense because it did not tend to refute the overwhelming evidence of predisposition nor indicate improper inducement.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>G. Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p>Turner argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the government violated its obligations under <i>Brady</i> in improperly suppressing the FBI 302 reports regarding a second informant-the so-called \"Chicofsky materials.\" Turner asserts that the suppressed materials would have provided invaluable support for his entrapment defense, and that the evidence would have enabled him to impeach Cronin's testimony that his interest in Merlino and Turner waned after April.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Brady,</i> the government is required to turn over exculpatory or impeachment evidence in its possession to the defendant. <i>United States v. Rivera-Rangel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201439\"><a href=\"/opinion/201439/united-states-v-rivera-rangel/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 485 (1st Cir.2005). A new trial is warranted based upon a <i>Brady</i> violation if the defendant establishes that (1) the evidence is material and favorable to the defense, (2) the prosecution suppressed the evidence, and (3) the defendant was prejudiced because there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. <i>Id.</i> Suppressed evidence that is merely cumulative of evidence already in the defendant's possession does not justify a new trial. <i>Conley v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201725\"><a href=\"/opinion/201725/conley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 189 (1st Cir.2005). We review the district court's decision for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>Rivera Rangel,</i> 396 F.3d at 485-86.</p>\n<p>Turner's <i>Brady</i> claim fails because the Chicofsky materials, and related documents, are not nearly as beneficial as Turner claims. All but two of the thirty-eight Chicofsky 302s precede May 1, 1998, and the other two reports did not mention Turner; this is consistent with Cronin's testimony that his belief that Merlino would or could return the paintings waned after April 1998. Further, Turner was mentioned in only five of the 302s, and Merlino's attempts to return the paintings, as recounted in the 302s, focused entirely on other individuals. Moreover, all this evidence was merely cumulative of stronger evidence presented at trial suggestive of the FBI's potential motivation to entrap Turner. Indeed, Cronin's own testimony made it clear that he was in active negotiations with Merlino in April 1998, that he was well aware of Turner's connection to Merlino, that he had received reports from Romano regarding the Gardener robbery <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> throughout the conspiracy, and that he visited Turner on the day of his arrest in a last attempt to secure information regarding the Gardener robbery. Most significantly, Turner's presentation continues to focus on the FBI's potential motive to entrap him, while ignoring the more significant issues of inducement and predisposition. On those issues, the Chicofsky materials contribute nothing.<sup>[12]</sup> There is nothing about the suppressed materials that suggests a reasonable probability of a different result.</p>\n<p>H. Sentencing</p>\n<p>Finally, Turner raises two issues regarding his sentence. He first claims that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, claiming that he did not deny the \"essential factual elements of guilt\" but simply challenged the government's conduct with his entrapment defense. While it is remotely conceivable, in some rare circumstance, that a defendant who goes to trial with an entrapment defense might still be entitled to such a reduction, Turner's decision to defend himself at trial through a weak claim of entrapment in no way places him in this narrow theoretical category. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d at 79; <i>see also </i><i>Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d at 180.</p>\n<p>Turner next claims that he is entitled to a remand for resentencing under <i>Booker,</i> as he has met the four-part plain error test discussed in <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 78-79 (1st Cir.2005)(there was error, the error was plain, the error affected substantial rights of the defendant, and the error undermined the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings). Turner meets the first two parts, because the district court treated the guidelines as mandatory. <i>See </i><i>Isler,</i> 429 F.3d at 29. However, to satisfy parts three and four, Turner \"must show a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new advisory guidelines.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. McLean,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790402\"><a href=\"/opinion/790402/united-states-v-dale-mclean-united-states-of-america-v-manolin-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 505 (1st Cir.2005)(internal citation and quotation omitted). Turner cannot carry this burden. The district court rejected his request to be sentenced at the bottom of the guideline range, and such a refusal \"speaks volumes\" about the defendant's chances on remand. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, a review of the sentencing materials reveals no indication that the district judge would be inclined to impose a lower sentence. <i>See id.</i><sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, Turner's conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Gardener robbery was one of the largest art thefts in history and resulted in the loss of several priceless paintings. Despite the offer of a $5 million reward, the thieves have not been apprehended nor have the paintings been recovered.</p>\n<p>[2]  The \"insider\" would be called via a special cell phone, then leave the facility for the parking lot, ostensibly to get something from his car. The conspirators intended to pretend to take the insider hostage with a gun to his head and enter the facility. On these dry runs an undercover FBI agent, acting as the inside man, responded to the calls and went to his car in the parking lot as arranged (while the conspirators observed him from a distance).</p>\n<p>[3]  Their motion to continue the trial in light of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks upon the United States was denied.</p>\n<p>[4]  Nadolski provided similar testimony on cross-examination during the government's case-in-chief.</p>\n<p>[5]  Turner's motion was also based upon certain other law enforcement reports, but his presentation here focuses on the 302s related to the second informant.</p>\n<p>[6]  Turner raises certain other challenges that do not warrant significant discussion. First, he argues that the trial should have been postponed based upon the terrorist attacks upon the United States on September 11, 2001. This contention fails as this case did not concern terrorism and Turner presents no basis for believing that the denial of a continuance in any way prejudiced him. Second, he argues that he should have been permitted to question Nadolski about his knowledge of the penalty for possession of a grenade. This contention also fails, as Turner presents no coherent claim of sentencing entrapment and the evidence made it clear that Merlino (rather than Nadolski through Romano) brought up the matter of grenades.</p>\n<p>[7]  Section 924(c) provides an enhanced penalty for anyone who uses or carries a firearm in relation to a \"crime of violence.\" \"Crime of violence\" is defined as \"an offense that is a felony and  (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (B) that by its very nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3).</p>\n<p>[8]  We note that the Tenth Circuit has more recently moved toward the majority position. In <i>United States v. Brown,</i> the court observed that, despite the fact that conspiracy punishes the agreement rather than the substantive offense, \"at minimum, an agreement to accomplish the statutory elements of [a violent felony] necessarily involves a substantial risk of physical force against the person or property of the victim.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159017\"><a href=\"/opinion/159017/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span>, 706 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p>[9]  We note a final flaw with Turner's position. In light of the defendants' formidable arsenal and stated intent to \"have it out\" with the police, waiting to make the arrest until the defendants left TRC (with bullet proof vests on and weapons at ready) or arrived at Loomis Fargo would have exposed law enforcement personnel and the public to unnecessary risk.</p>\n<p>[10]  A radio frequency detector is a device for detecting hidden listening devices.</p>\n<p>[11]  Furthermore, any suggestion of improper inducement would be refuted by Merlino's taped statements to the contrary.</p>\n<p>[12]  Turner's other arguments regarding Chicofsky  that Chicofsky should not have been permitted to invoke the Fifth Amendment at the hearing and that Turner should have been permitted to examine him question by question  are too perfunctorily presented to merit review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[13]  Turner also argues that the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1 instead of § 2B3.1, and, alternatively, that the district court erred in failing to grant a reduction under U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(b)(2). Both of these arguments are presented without authority and in such a perfunctory manner that we deem them waived. <i>See </i><i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n\n</div>",
