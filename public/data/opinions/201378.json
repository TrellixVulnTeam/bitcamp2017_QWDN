Plaintiff-Appellant J.G.M.C.J.\n\nCorporation (\"J.G.M.C.J.\") purchased commercial property that was\n\nsubject to a lease entered into by the original owner of the\n\nproperty and Defendant-Appellee Sears, Roebuck & Co. (\"Sears\").\n\nSears eventually assigned its interest in the lease to HomeLife\n\nCorporation (\"HomeLife\").      Before the lease term ended, HomeLife\n\nexercised two extension options contained in the lease.           HomeLife\n\nsubsequently filed for bankruptcy protection, and J.G.M.C.J. now\n\nseeks declaratory judgment that Sears is obligated to pay rent\n\npursuant to the extension of the lease.          J.G.M.C.J. also raises a\n\nvariety of common law and statutory claims in an attempt to recover\n\nlost rent from Sears.     The district court granted summary judgment\n\nto Sears on all counts, and we affirm.\n\n                             I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     On February 1, 1990, Sears entered into a lease (the \"Lease\"),\n\nas tenant, with Cohas Brook Associates (\"Cohas\"), as landlord, for\n\npart of a to-be-constructed shopping plaza located at 1875 South\n\nWillow   Street   in   Manchester,   New    Hampshire   (the   \"Premises\").\n\nApparently, J.G.M.C.J. then purchased the Premises from Cohas and\n\nconstructed the plaza, largely in reliance on Sears' anchor tenancy\n\nand its creditworthiness as a tenant.            Upon completion of the\n\nconstruction, Sears used the leased space to open a \"HOMELIFE\"\n\nstore, which at the time of the signing of the Lease was a division\n\nof Sears.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f     J.G.M.C.J. became the successor in interest to the Lease,\n\nwhich had been negotiated by Cohas.       The Lease had an original term\n\nof ten (10) years, with an option for Sears to extend the term for\n\ntwo (2) additional five (5) year terms upon 180 days notice to the\n\nlandlord.    The Lease contained an Assignment and Sublease Clause,\n\nwhich read:\n\n            19.     Assignment and Sublease\n\n            [Sears] shall have the right to assign this lease\n            . . . subject to [J.G.M.C.J.]'s approval . . . .\n            In the event of . . . assignment, [Sears] shall\n            remain responsible for the payment of rent and\n            the performance of its other obligations, but not\n            beyond the term to which [Sears] has agreed in\n            writing.\n\nParagraph 3 of the Lease defined \"term\" as \"commenc[ing] on the\n\nCommencement Date and terminat[ing] ten (10) years thereafter\n\n(\"Term\").\"\n\n     Sears subsequently decided to sell off its HOMELIFE division\n\nto HomeLife Corp., retaining a nineteen percent ownership interest\n\nin the new corporation.        By letter dated November 24, 1998 (the\n\n\"November     24,    1998   Letter\"),   Sears   sought   the   consent   of\n\nJ.G.M.C.J., pursuant to Paragraph 19 of the Lease, to assign the\n\nLease to HomeLife.       In this letter, Sears represented:\n\n                  Please be assured that HomeLife will\n             continue to operate the store as a HOMELIFE\n             store. The rights, duties and obligations of\n             landlord and tenant under the Lease will not\n             change. Sears will continue to be responsible\n             for the tenant's obligations under the Lease.\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fThe assignment to HomeLife was approved in writing by J.G.M.C.J. on\n\nDecember 15, 1998.     In conjunction with the assignment, J.G.M.C.J.\n\nprovided HomeLife with an estoppel certificate dated December 15,\n\n1998, which read in pertinent part:\n\n             1. The Lease is in full force and effect and\n             has not been modified or amended except by [an\n             amendment not relevant to this appeal]. There\n             are no other agreements between Landlord and\n             Tenant with respect to the Premises.\n\n           2. The term of the Lease commenced on August\n           1, 1990 and will continue until 11:59 p.m.\n           July 31, 2000, subject to two five-year\n           renewal options as provided for in the Lease.\n\nPursuant to J.G.M.C.J.'s consent, Sears, on February 1, 1999,\n\nassigned its \"right, title and interest\" in the Lease to HomeLife,\n\nwhich in turn assumed \"all rights, obligations and duties\" under\n\nthe Lease.\n\n     In a letter dated October 5, 1999, J.G.M.C.J. advised Sears,\n\npursuant to Paragraph 3A of the Lease, which obligated J.G.M.C.J.\n\nto provide Sears with \"written notice of the imminent expiration of\n\nthe Term,\" that the Lease would expire on July 31, 2000.                The\n\nletter requested that Sears provide J.G.M.C.J. \"notice of [its]\n\nintention to exercise [its] option to extend the term of the Lease\n\nfor an additional five (5) years.\"       Sears did not respond.\n\n     On   July   24,   2000,   J.G.M.C.J.   and   HomeLife   executed    an\n\nExtension and Amendment to the Lease (\"Extension Agreement\"), in\n\nwhich J.G.M.C.J. granted HomeLife's request to exercise both five-\n\nyear extension options contained in the Lease.         In addition, the\n\n                                   -4-\n\fExtension Agreement materially altered several provisions of the\n\nLease.     For example, the Extension Agreement:        (1) increased the\n\nrent for the extended terms to higher than what had been provided\n\nfor in the original Lease and (2) amended a provision of the Lease,\n\nwhich originally stated that Sears did not have to operate a\n\nbusiness    on   the   Premises,   to   grant   J.G.M.C.J.   the   right   to\n\nterminate the Lease in the event HomeLife failed to operate a\n\nbusiness on the premises for a period of ninety (90) consecutive\n\ndays or longer.\n\n     Furthermore, the Extension Agreement provided that to the\n\nextent J.G.M.C.J. and HomeLife had the authority to so acknowledge,\n\nthey acknowledged that \"the execution of this Extension shall in no\n\nway be considered a waiver of Landlord's rights against Sears\n\nRoebuck and Co. under the Lease.\"         Sears, however, was not a party\n\nto, and did not sign, the Extension Agreement.\n\n     On July 16, 2001, HomeLife filed for bankruptcy in the United\n\nStates Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.              HomeLife\n\ncontinued to pay rent under the terms of the Extension Agreement\n\nuntil November 23, 2001, when the trustee rejected the Lease.\n\n     On August 5, 2003, J.G.M.C.J. filed its Amended and Restated\n\nComplaint against Sears, seeking declaratory judgment that Sears is\n\nobligated to perform under the terms of the Extension Agreement,\n\nand also alleging that Sears: (1) breached the implied covenant of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing; (2) committed the tort of negligent\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\frepresentation; (3) would be unjustly enriched if excused from\n\nperformance under the Extension Agreement; and (4) engaged in\n\nunfair or deceptive acts in violation of the New Hampshire Consumer\n\nProtection Act.     On March 3, 2004, the district court1 granted\n\nSears' Motion for Summary Judgment on all counts. J.G.M.C.J. filed\n\nthis timely appeal.\n\n                           II. DISCUSSION\n\n     Summary judgment is proper when \"the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\n\nthe affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).    In ruling on the motion,\n\nthe district court must \"view the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that\n\nparty's favor.\" Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp., 63 F.3d 32, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n     We note at the outset that the Lease, pursuant to Paragraph\n\n23, is governed by New Hampshire law.        Under New Hampshire law,\n\n\"[a] lease is a form of contract that is construed in accordance\n\n\n\n     1\n      Pursuant to District of New Hampshire Local Rule 73.1(b)(2),\nthis case was randomly assigned to a United States Magistrate\nJudge, an assignment to which the parties did not object.        In\naccordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(c) and New Hampshire Local Rule\n73.1(a), the Magistrate Judge was designated to conduct any and all\nproceedings. An appeal from a judgment entered by a Magistrate\nJudge pursuant to this procedure is treated in the same manner as\nan appeal from any other judgment of a district court.\n\n                                -6-\n\fwith   the     standard   rules      of   contract   interpretation.\"      Echo\n\nConsulting Servs., Inc. v. N. Conway Bank, 669 A.2d 227, 230 (N.H.\n\n1995).    \"[T]he proper interpretation of a lease is ultimately a\n\nquestion of law for [the] court to determine.\"               N.A.P.P. Realty\n\nTrust v. CC Enters., 784 A.2d 1166, 1168 (N.H. 2001) (citation\n\nomitted).      Moreover, \"[i]n the absence of ambiguity, the intent of\n\nthe parties to a lease is to be determined from the plain meaning\n\nof the language used.\"         Echo Consulting Servs., 669 A.2d at 230.\n\nAnd, the \"determination whether a contract term is ambiguous\" is a\n\nquestion of law.      Id.\n\n       With these background contract principles in mind, we engage\n\nin   plenary    review    of   the    district   court's   grant   of   summary\n\njudgment.      Burns v. State Police Ass'n of Mass., 230 F.3d 8, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).      J.G.M.C.J. raises the variety of claims listed\n\nabove in an attempt to bind Sears to the Extension Agreement.               We,\n\nlike the district court below, find them all without merit.\n\nA.     Declaratory Judgment on Sears' Obligations Under the Extension\n       Agreement\n\n       First, J.G.M.C.J. claims that Sears remained liable under the\n\nExtension Agreement by virtue of the common law contract principle\n\nthat an original lessee, after assignment, remains liable for the\n\npayment of rent during the assignee's extension of the lease.                See\n\nMaybury Shoe Co. v. Rochester Factory Holding Co., 185 A. 654, 655\n\n(N.H. 1936) (noting that \"[t]he lessees' personal covenant to pay\n\nthe rent applied to the extended term [of the lease]\").                 Although\n\n                                          -7-\n\fthis is an accurate statement of the common law, just as parties to\n\na contract may negotiate terms that vary from the common law,\n\nparties to a lease may limit their respective obligations in the\n\nevent of an assignment.     Cf. S. S. Kresge Co. v. Sears, 87 F.2d\n\n135, 138 (1st Cir. 1936) (stating that under Massachusetts common\n\nlaw, parties can contract, \"in case of assignment . . .[,] that\n\nlessee shall not be further liable\").   Here, Sears did just that:\n\nit limited its obligation in the event of assignment through\n\nParagraph 19 of the Lease. In that Paragraph, Sears and J.G.M.C.J.\n\nexpressly agreed that, in the event of assignment of the Lease,\n\nSears would not be responsible for the payment of rent and the\n\nperformance of other obligations \"beyond the term to which [Sears]\n\nha[d] agreed in writing.\"    (Emphasis added.)\n\n     To get around this express limitation, J.G.M.C.J. argues that\n\nthe \"term\" referenced in Paragraph 19 is the original ten-year term\n\nplus the two five-year extension options.        This argument fails\n\nbecause the Lease \"term\" is defined in Paragraph 3 of the Lease as\n\nthat period of time \"commenc[ing] on the Commencement Date and\n\nterminat[ing] ten (10) years thereafter.\"2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      We note that J.G.M.C.J. itself called the original ten-year\nlease term the \"term\" in its letter of October 5, 1999, notifying\nSears of the expiration of the Lease. In that letter, J.G.M.C.J.,\nthrough its President John B. Sullivan, stated, \"please accept this\nnotice of the 'imminent expiration of the term of the Sears'\nLease.'\"\n\n                                 -8-\n\f     Alternatively, J.G.M.C.J. argues that Paragraph 19 was amended\n\nby the parties pursuant to Paragraph 22, which provided that the\n\nLease may be amended \"by an instrument in writing signed by the\n\nparties.\"     Under this theory, J.G.M.C.J. proposes that Sears'\n\nNovember 24, 1998 Letter, read together with J.G.M.C.J.'s letter\n\napproving    Sears'   assignment   of   the   Lease   to   HomeLife    and   an\n\nestoppel certificate provided to Sears by J.G.M.C.J., amended\n\nParagraph 19 to make Sears liable in the event HomeLife exercised\n\nthe extension options contained in the Lease, even without Sears'\n\nwritten consent.      Although it is true that a writing requirement\n\ncan be satisfied by a series of documents, see Ashuelot Paper Co.\n\nv. Ryll, 259 A.2d 657, 658 (N.H. 1969), these documents, read as a\n\nwhole, did not amend Paragraph 19.3\n\n     Furthermore, J.G.M.C.J.'s own actions at the time HomeLife\n\nexercised the extension options would have acted to terminate\n\nSears' obligations under the Lease by operation of law because the\n\nExtension Agreement materially altered the terms of the original\n\nLease.     Under common law principles, upon assignment of a lease,\n\nthe original \"lessee becomes a surety for the performance of the\n\ncovenants of the lease by the assignee.\"        Cf. S. S. Kresge, 87 F.2d\n\nat   138    (discussing   the   obligations     of    an    assignor    under\n\n\n     3\n      Interestingly, on December 15, 1998, J.G.M.C.J. provided\nHomeLife with an estoppel certificate which read, in pertinent\npart, that the Lease \"[had] not been modified or amended except by\n[an amendment not relevant to this appeal].\"     Thus, J.G.M.C.J.\nrepresented to HomeLife that Paragraph 19 had not been amended.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fMassachusetts common law). However, just as a surety is discharged\n\nby material changes in a contract, an original lessee can be\n\ndischarged by material changes in the lease negotiated between the\n\nassignee and the lessor.         See McCabe v. Arcidy, 635 A.2d 446, 453\n\n(N.H. 1993) (noting that material alteration in principal contract\n\nwithout consent of guarantor discharges guarantor if the material\n\nalteration injures the interest of the guarantor).\n\nB.   J.G.M.C.J.'s Remaining Common Law and Statutory Claims\n\n     J.G.M.C.J. next alleges a series of common law and statutory\n\nclaims in an attempt to hold Sears responsible for the rent\n\nincurred by HomeLife as a result of HomeLife's exercise of the\n\nextension options. It claims that Sears: (1) breached the implied\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing; (2) committed the tort of\n\nnegligent representation; (3) would be unjustly enriched if excused\n\nfrom performance under the Extension Agreement; and (4) engaged in\n\nunfair or deceptive acts in violation of the New Hampshire Consumer\n\nProtection Act. Each of these claims, however, fails because Sears\n\nacted in full compliance with a valid, express contract, did not\n\nmisrepresent its obligations under that contract, and did not act\n\nin an unfair or deceptive manner.        See Centronics Corp. v. Genicom\n\nCorp., 562 A.2d 187, 190, 193 (N.H. 1989) (A breach of the common\n\nlaw obligation of good faith, when not related to an employment\n\ncontract   or   contract    formation,      requires   a   showing    that    the\n\ndefendant's     \"exercise   of     discretion    exceeded    the     limits   of\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\freasonableness.\"); Snierson v. Scruton, 761 A.2d 1046, 1049-50\n\n(N.H. 2000) (The tort of negligent misrepresentation requires a\n\nshowing that the defendant made a negligent misrepresentation of a\n\nmaterial fact, and that the plaintiff justifiably relied on it.);\n\nTentindo v. Locke Lake Colony Ass'n, 419 A.2d 1097, 1100 (N.H.\n\n1980) (A claim of unjust enrichment will not lie \"[w]here there is\n\na valid express contract between the parties . . . [because] the\n\nlaw will not imply a quasi-contract.\"); Barrows v. Boles, 687 A.2d\n\n979, 986 (N.H. 1996) (To state a claim under the New Hampshire\n\nConsumer Protection Act, \"[t]he objectionable conduct must attain\n\na level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured\n\nto the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\" (citation\n\nomitted)).   Thus, Sears is not liable for any of the rent due under\n\nthe Extension Agreement.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

In addition, the Extension Agreement materially altered several provisions of the Lease. For example, the Extension Agreement: (1) increased the rent for the extended terms to higher than what had been provided for in the original Lease and (2) amended a provision of the Lease, which originally stated that Sears did not have to operate a business on the Premises, to grant J.G.M.C.J. the right to terminate the Lease in the event HomeLife failed to operate a business on the premises for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days or longer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Extension Agreement provided that to the extent J.G.M.C.J. and HomeLife had the authority to so acknowledge, they acknowledged that \"the execution of this Extension shall in no way be considered a waiver of Landlord's rights against Sears Roebuck and Co. under the Lease.\" Sears, however, was not a party to, and did not sign, the Extension Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 16, 2001, HomeLife filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is proper when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In ruling on the motion, the district court must \"view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp.,</i> 63 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note at the outset that the Lease, pursuant to Paragraph 23, is governed by New Hampshire law. Under New Hampshire law, \"[a] lease is a form of contract that is construed in accordance with the standard rules of contract interpretation.\" <i>Echo Consulting Servs., Inc. v. N. Conway Bank,</i> 140 N.H. 566, 669 A.2d 227, 230 (N.H.1995). \"[T]he proper interpretation of a lease is ultimately a question of law for [the] court to determine.\" <i>N.A.P.P. Realty Trust v. CC Enters.,</i> 147 N.H. 137, 784 A.2d 1166, 1168 (N.H.2001) (citation omitted). Moreover, \"[i]n the absence of ambiguity, the intent of the parties to a lease is to be determined from the plain meaning of the language used.\" <i>Echo Consulting Servs.,</i> 669 A.2d at 230. And, the \"determination whether a contract term is ambiguous\" is a question of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these background contract principles in mind, we engage in plenary review of the district court's grant of summary judgment. <i>Burns v. State Police Ass'n of Mass.,</i> 230 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir.2000). J.G.M.C.J. raises the variety of claims listed above in an attempt to bind Sears to the Extension Agreement. We, like the district court below, find them all without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Declaratory Judgment on Sears' Obligations Under the Extension Agreement</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, J.G.M.C.J. claims that Sears remained liable under the Extension Agreement by virtue of the common law contract principle that an original lessee, after assignment, remains liable for the payment of rent during the assignee's extension of the lease. <i>See Maybury Shoe Co. v. Rochester Factory Holding Co.,</i> 88 N.H. 172, 185 A. 654, 655 (1936) (noting that \"[t]he lessees' personal covenant to pay the rent applied to the extended term [of the lease]\"). Although this is an accurate statement of the common law, just as parties to a contract may negotiate terms that vary from the common law, parties to a lease may limit their respective obligations in the event of an assignment. <i>Cf. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Sears,</i> 87 F.2d 135, 138 (1st Cir.1936) (stating that under Massachusetts common law, parties can contract, \"in case of assignment ... [,] that lessee shall not be further liable\"). Here, Sears did just that: it limited its obligation in the event of assignment through Paragraph 19 of the Lease. In that Paragraph, Sears and J.G.M.C.J. expressly agreed that, in the event of assignment of the Lease, Sears would not be responsible for the payment of rent and the performance of other obligations \"beyond the <i>term</i> to which [Sears] ha[d] agreed <i>in writing.</i>\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To get around this express limitation, J.G.M.C.J. argues that the \"term\" referenced in Paragraph 19 is the original ten-year term plus the two five-year extension options. This argument fails because the Lease \"term\" is defined in Paragraph 3 of the Lease as that period of time \"commenc[ing] on the Commencement Date and terminat[ing] ten (10) years thereafter.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, J.G.M.C.J. argues that Paragraph 19 was amended by the parties pursuant to Paragraph 22, which provided that the Lease may be amended \"by an instrument in writing signed by the parties.\" Under this theory, J.G.M.C.J. proposes that Sears' November 24, 1998 Letter, read together with J.G.M.C.J.'s letter approving Sears' assignment of the Lease to HomeLife and an estoppel certificate provided to Sears by J.G.M.C.J., amended Paragraph 19 to make Sears liable in the event HomeLife exercised the extension options contained in the Lease, even without Sears' written consent. Although it is true that a writing requirement can be satisfied by a series of documents, <i>see Ashuelot Paper Co. v. Ryll,</i> 109 N.H. 573, 259 A.2d 657, 658 (1969), these documents, read as a whole, did not amend Paragraph 19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, J.G.M.C.J.'s own actions at the time HomeLife exercised the extension options would have acted to terminate Sears' obligations under the Lease by operation of law because the Extension Agreement materially altered the terms of the original Lease. Under common law principles, upon assignment of a lease, the original \"lessee becomes a surety for the performance of the covenants of the lease by the assignee.\" <i>Cf. S.S. Kresge,</i> 87 F.2d at 138 (discussing the obligations of an assignor under Massachusetts common law). However, just as a surety is discharged by material changes in a contract, an original lessee can be discharged by material changes in the lease negotiated between the assignee and the lessor. <i>See McCabe v. Arcidy,</i> 138 N.H. 20, 635 A.2d 446, 453 (1993) (noting that material alteration in principal contract without consent of guarantor discharges guarantor if the material alteration injures the interest of the guarantor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>J.G.M.C.J.'s Remaining Common Law and Statutory Claims</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">J.G.M.C.J. next alleges a series of common law and statutory claims in an attempt to hold Sears responsible for the rent incurred by HomeLife as a result of HomeLife's exercise of the extension options. It claims that Sears: (1) breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (2) committed the tort of negligent representation; (3) would be unjustly enriched if excused from performance under the Extension Agreement; and (4) engaged in unfair or deceptive acts in violation of the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act. Each of these claims, however, fails because Sears acted in full compliance with a valid, express contract, did not misrepresent its obligations under that contract, and did not act in an unfair or deceptive manner. <i>See Centronics Corp. v. Genicom Corp.,</i> 132 N.H. 133, 562 A.2d 187, 190, 193 (1989) (A breach of the common law obligation of good faith, when not related to an employment contract or contract formation, requires a showing that the defendant's \"exercise of discretion exceeded the limits of reasonableness.\"); <i>Snierson v. Scruton,</i> 145 N.H. 73, 761 A.2d 1046, 1049-50 (2000) (The tort of negligent misrepresentation requires a showing that the defendant made a negligent misrepresentation of a material fact, and that the plaintiff justifiably relied on it.); <i>Tentindo v. Locke Lake Colony Ass'n,</i> 120 N.H. 593, 419 A.2d 1097, 1100 (1980) (A claim of unjust enrichment will not lie \"[w]here there is a valid express contract between the parties ... [because] the law will not imply a quasi-contract.\"); <i>Barrows v. Boles,</i> 141 N.H. 382, 687 A.2d 979, 986 (1996) (To state a claim under the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act, \"[t]he objectionable conduct must attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\" (citation omitted)). Thus, Sears is not liable for any of the rent due under the Extension Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pursuant to District of New Hampshire Local Rule 73.1(b)(2), this case was randomly assigned to a United States Magistrate Judge, an assignment to which the parties did not object.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 1990, Sears entered into a lease (the \"Lease\"), as tenant, with Cohas Brook Associates (\"Cohas\"), as landlord, for part of a to-be-constructed shopping plaza located at 1875 South Willow Street in Manchester, New Hampshire (the \"Premises\"). Apparently, J.G.M.C.J. then purchased the Premises from Cohas and constructed the plaza, largely in reliance on Sears' anchor tenancy and its creditworthiness as a tenant. Upon completion of the construction, Sears used the leased space to open a \"HOMELIFE\" store, which at the time of the signing of the Lease was a division of Sears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">J.G.M.C.J. became the successor in interest to the Lease, which had been negotiated by Cohas. The Lease had an original term of ten (10) years, with an option for Sears to extend the term for two (2) additional five (5) year terms upon 180 days notice to the landlord. The Lease contained an Assignment and Sublease Clause, which read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">19. <i>Assignment and Sublease</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Sears] shall have the right to assign this lease ... subject to [J.G.M.C.J.]'s approval....

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is proper when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In ruling on the motion, the district court must \"view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>Barbour v.

Under New Hampshire law, \"[a] lease is a form of contract that is construed in accordance with the standard rules of contract interpretation.\" <i>Echo Consulting Servs., Inc. v. N. Conway Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span>, 230 (N.H.1995). \"[T]he proper interpretation of a lease is ultimately a question of law for [the] court to determine.\" <i>N.A.P.P.

Moreover, \"[i]n the absence of ambiguity, the intent of the parties to a lease is to be determined from the plain meaning of the language used.\" <i>Echo Consulting Servs.,</i> 669 A.2d at 230. And, the \"determination whether a contract term is ambiguous\" is a question of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these background contract principles in mind, we engage in plenary review of the district court's grant of summary judgment. <i>Burns v. State Police Ass'n of Mass.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770832\"><a href=\"/opinion/770832/john-a-burns-v-state-police-association-of-massachusetts-and-dean-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2000). J.G.M.C.J. raises the variety of claims listed above in an attempt to bind Sears to the Extension Agreement. We, like the district court below, find them all without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Declaratory Judgment on Sears' Obligations Under the Extension Agreement</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, J.G.M.C.J. claims that Sears remained liable under the Extension Agreement by virtue of the common law contract principle that an original lessee, after assignment, remains liable for the payment of rent during the assignee's extension of the lease. <i>See Maybury Shoe Co. v. Rochester Factory Holding Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></span>, 655 (1936) (noting that \"[t]he lessees' personal covenant to pay the rent applied to the extended term [of the lease]\"). Although this is an accurate statement of the common law, just as parties to a contract may negotiate terms that vary from the common law, parties to a lease may limit their respective obligations in the event of an assignment. <i>Cf. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Sears,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1545757\"><a href=\"/opinion/1545757/ss-kresge-co-v-sears/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span>, 138 (1st Cir.1936) (stating that under Massachusetts common law, parties can contract, \"in case of assignment ... [,] that lessee shall not be further liable\"). Here, Sears did just that: it limited its obligation in the event of assignment through Paragraph 19 of the Lease. In that Paragraph, Sears and J.G.M.C.J. expressly agreed that, in the event of assignment of the Lease, Sears would not be responsible for the payment of rent and the performance of other obligations \"beyond the <i>term</i> to which [Sears] ha[d] agreed <i>in writing.</i>\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To get around this express limitation, J.G.M.C.J. argues that the \"term\" referenced in Paragraph 19 is the original ten-year term plus the two five-year extension options. This argument fails because the Lease \"term\" is defined in Paragraph 3 of the Lease as that period of time \"commenc[ing] on the Commencement Date and terminat[ing] ten (10) years thereafter.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, J.G.M.C.J. argues that Paragraph 19 was amended by the parties pursuant to Paragraph 22, which provided that the Lease may be amended \"by an instrument in writing signed by the parties.\" Under this theory, J.G.M.C.J. proposes that Sears' November 24, 1998 Letter, read together with J.G.M.C.J.'s letter approving Sears' assignment of the Lease to HomeLife and an estoppel certificate provided to Sears by J.G.M.C.J., amended Paragraph 19 to make Sears liable in the event HomeLife exercised the extension options contained in the Lease, even without Sears' written consent. Although it is true that a writing requirement can be satisfied by a series of documents, <i>see Ashuelot Paper Co. v. Ryll,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1924020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1924020/ashuelot-paper-co-v-ryll/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></span>, 658 (1969), these documents, read as a whole, did not amend Paragraph 19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, J.G.M.C.J.'s own actions at the time HomeLife exercised the extension options would have acted to terminate Sears' obligations under the Lease by operation of law because the Extension Agreement materially altered the terms of the original Lease. Under common law principles, upon assignment of a lease, the original \"lessee becomes a surety for the performance of the covenants of the lease by the assignee.\" <i>Cf. S.S. Kresge,</i> 87 F.2d at 138 (discussing the obligations of an assignor under Massachusetts common law). However, just as a surety is discharged by material changes in a contract, an original lessee can be discharged by material changes in the lease negotiated between the assignee and the lessor. <i>See McCabe v. Arcidy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span>, 453 (1993) (noting that material alteration in principal contract without consent of guarantor discharges guarantor if the material alteration injures the interest of the guarantor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>J.G.M.C.J.'s Remaining Common Law and Statutory Claims</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">J.G.M.C.J. next alleges a series of common law and statutory claims in an attempt to hold Sears responsible for the rent incurred by HomeLife as a result of HomeLife's exercise of the extension options. It claims that Sears: (1) breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (2) committed the tort of negligent representation; (3) would be unjustly enriched if excused from performance under the Extension Agreement; and (4) engaged in unfair or deceptive acts in violation of the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act. Each of these claims, however, fails because Sears acted in full compliance with a valid, express contract, did not misrepresent its obligations under that contract, and did not act in an unfair or deceptive manner. <i>See Centronics Corp. v. Genicom Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span>, 190, 193 (1989) (A breach of the common law obligation of good faith, when not related to an employment contract or contract formation, requires a showing that the defendant's \"exercise of discretion exceeded the limits of reasonableness.\"); <i>Snierson v.
