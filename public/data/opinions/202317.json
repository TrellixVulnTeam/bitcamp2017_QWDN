Renato Stroni (\"Stroni\") seeks\n\nreview of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\naffirming        the    Immigration        Judge's    decision     to   deny    Stroni's\n\napplications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture.                  To the extent Stroni seeks\n\nreview of the denial of his application for asylum, we dismiss his\n\npetition for lack of jurisdiction.                   We otherwise affirm the BIA's\n\norder and deny the petition for review.\n\n                                             I.\n\n                                             A.\n\n                 Stroni is a native and citizen of Albania who claims that\n\nhe entered the United States illegally on March 17, 2001.                       On March\n\n12, 2002, almost one year after his purported entry date, Stroni\n\nfiled       an    application        for   asylum     with   the    Immigration      and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\").1                   In support of his request for\n\nasylum, Stroni described several incidents of past persecution by\n\nthe Socialist government of Albania, incidents allegedly based on\n\nStroni's political affiliation and opinion.                    Stroni also asserted\n\nthat he feared he would be killed, tortured, or arrested if he\n\nreturned to Albania.\n\n                 The asylum officer who heard Stroni's case found Stroni's\n\ntestimony        to    be   vague,    inconsistent,      and     lacking   in    detail.\n\n\n        1\n        The functions of the INS have since been transferred to the\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n                                             -2-\n\fAlthough     Stroni    was       given    the   opportunity        to    clarify     all\n\ndiscrepancies     in       his    testimony,      he   was    unable      to   do     so\n\nsuccessfully.         In   particular,      the     asylum    officer     found     that\n\nStroni's testimony regarding the date, manner, and place of his\n\nentry into the United States was not credible.                    The asylum officer\n\nthus rejected Stroni's application for asylum, having concluded\n\nthat Stroni failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat he filed his application for asylum within one year of his\n\nentry as required by law.\n\n           Upon referral from the asylum officer, the Immigration\n\nCourt placed Stroni in removal proceedings by filing a Notice to\n\nAppear dated April 15, 2002.               On June 28, 2002, at an initial\n\nhearing before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") in New York City, Stroni\n\nconceded removability as charged, renewed his application for\n\nasylum, and requested withholding of removal, protection under the\n\nConvention    Against      Torture       (\"CAT\"),    and,    in    the   alternative,\n\nvoluntary departure.         The IJ adjourned the hearing after granting\n\nStroni's request to transfer venue to Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n           Stroni ultimately presented documentary and testimonial\n\nevidence at two hearings before different IJs in Boston.                       At the\n\nfirst hearing, held on January 17, 2003, Stroni testified before IJ\n\nThomas Ragno.         IJ Ragno continued the hearing after Stroni's\n\ntestimony was concluded to allow the INS to verify information\n\nprovided by Stroni as to his entry date and use of passport\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\faliases.    A second hearing was held on February 13, 2004, more than\n\na year later, before IJ Kenneth Josephson.            While acknowledging\n\nthat IJ Ragno had taken testimony at the earlier hearing, IJ\n\nJosephson    announced   that   he   would   hear   the   testimony   again,\n\nexplaining that he had not had an opportunity to listen to the\n\ntapes of the previous hearing.            Before testimony was begun, IJ\n\nJosephson noted for the record that the computer printout from the\n\n\"central indices\" showed no supporting documentation for Stroni's\n\nclaim regarding the date and place he entered the United States.\n\n                                     B.\n\n            Briefly, Stroni testified as follows:\n\n            Stroni was an activist on behalf of the Democratic Party\n\n(\"DP\") in Albania, an organization that opposed the communist\n\nregime that had controlled Albania for many years. Although Stroni\n\nhimself was never a member of the DP, Stroni's father was a\n\nfounding member and vice chairman of a local branch of the DP.           The\n\nDP rose to power in 1992 but was defeated in 1997 by the Socialist\n\nParty, then dominated by a previous leader in the communist regime.\n\n            In October 1997, 19-year-old Stroni and his father were\n\narrested at a DP rally where they were protesting the Socialist\n\nParty's practice of firing DP supporters.           While they were being\n\nheld at the police station, Stroni and his father were beaten and\n\nthreatened with death if they continued to support the DP.            Stroni\n\nwas released after one night, his father after three nights.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           In March 1999, a bomb was detonated outside Stroni's\n\nhome, wounding Stroni's sister in the leg.               Although the incident\n\nwas reported to the police, the police failed to do anything about\n\nthe bombing.     Stroni believes that the family was targeted by\n\n\"unknown people\" for political reasons.\n\n           In   or   about    November    1999,    Stroni    joined    the    Azem\n\nHajdari, an anti-communist organization named after a DP activist\n\nwho was assassinated on September 12, 1998.               Stroni began paying\n\ndues to the Azem Hajdari in January 2000, and he thereafter\n\nattended meetings once or twice a month.\n\n           On August 28, 2000, Stroni and his father were once again\n\narrested and taken to the police station.                As before, they were\n\nbeaten and threatened with death if they continued to support the\n\ndemocratic movement.     They were released the next day.\n\n           On September 12, 2000, Stroni was arrested the morning\n\nafter a DP demonstration commemorating the second anniversary of\n\nAzem Hajdari's death. Stroni was released that same evening, after\n\nhe was punched, kicked, and warned that he could suffer the same\n\nfate as Azem Hajdari.\n\n           On   December      1,   2000,        Stroni    was   arrested       for\n\nparticipating in protests in his hometown of Ballish.                 During his\n\ntwo-day   detention,    the   police     beat    him,    threatened    him,   and\n\nurinated on his face while holding his head.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f              After this latest arrest, Stroni left Ballish and went to\n\nlive with his aunt in Tirana for several months.                      He lived there\n\nwithout incident, staying mostly inside. In January 2001, Stroni's\n\nfather obtained an Albanian passport for Stroni from the very\n\npolice   department      in    Ballish    where      he   and    Stroni       had   been\n\nmistreated.      Stroni claimed that he was too afraid to get the\n\npassport      himself.\n\n              Stroni   departed    Albania      on   March      11,    2001,   passing\n\nthrough Italy, Belgium, and Munich on his way to the United States.\n\nStroni arrived in Chicago on March 17, 2001, using not his Albanian\n\npassport   but    a    fake   Italian    passport     issued      in    the    name   of\n\n\"Carmello Pezzotta.\"          Stroni disposed of his Italian passport the\n\nday after he arrived in the United States.\n\n                                         C.\n\n              By oral decision dated February 13, 2004, IJ Josephson\n\nruled that Stroni was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he\n\nfailed   to    satisfy    his    burden    of    establishing          by   clear     and\n\nconvincing evidence that he filed his asylum application within one\n\nyear after his entry into the United States.                      Although Stroni\n\ntestified that he entered the United States on March 17, 2001, the\n\nIJ specifically stated that he did not find Stroni to be credible.\n\nThe IJ also noted that, in addition to Stroni's having failed to\n\nproduce any documentary evidence to support his claimed entry date,\n\nthe INS's \"nonimmigrant information system inquiry\" failed to\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fproduce any supporting check for Stroni's claimed entry under the\n\nname of \"Carmelo Pezzotta.\"\n\n           IJ    Josephson   also   denied   Stroni's    applications       for\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under CAT, finding that\n\nStroni   had    utterly   failed    to   demonstrate    that   he   would    be\n\npersecuted, more likely than not, if he were to return to Albania.\n\nAmong other things, the IJ cited the State Department's Profile\n\nReport, which described conditions in Albania as follows:\n\n           The democratic party currently participates in\n           most parliamentary activity.\n\n           Despite opposition claims of massive voter\n           disenfranchisement and other manipulations,\n           nationwide local elections held in October of\n           2000 made clear and unmistakable progress\n           towards meeting democratic standards. . . .\n\n           All political parties have been active in most\n           of   the  country   without   a   pattern   of\n           mistreatment even during the dark days of\n           1997. There is no post communist tradition of\n           retribution against political leaders and few\n           instances thereof.\n\nAlbania: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions, May 2001.\n\nThe IJ also noted that, as to his father and other family members\n\nwho continued not only to live in Albania but also to openly\n\nsupport the Democratic Party, Stroni made no claim that they had\n\nsuffered anything more than insults since Stroni's departure from\n\nAlbania.   Finally, describing some of the many inconsistencies in\n\nStroni's testimony, the IJ simply concluded that Stroni's story\n\nabout past and future persecution was not at all credible.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            The     BIA     adopted    and   affirmed   the   decision   of   IJ\n\nJosephson, stating additionally that it agreed with the IJ's\n\nfinding that (1) Stroni was statutorily ineligible for asylum\n\nbecause he both failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he\n\ntimely filed his asylum application and also failed to establish\n\nextraordinary circumstances for such delay; (2) Stroni failed to\n\nmeet the heightened burden of proof to establish his eligibility\n\nfor withholding removal; and (3) Stroni failed to establish his\n\neligibility       for     protection    under   CAT   because   he   failed   to\n\ndemonstrate both that he suffered torture in Albania in the past\n\nand also that he could not relocate to another area in Albania to\n\navoid torture in the future.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            This court normally reviews decisions of the BIA rather\n\nthan those of an IJ.         Where, as here, the BIA summarily adopts and\n\naffirms an IJ's decision, this court reviews the IJ's decision\n\ndirectly.   Sulaiman v. Gonzales, 429 F.3d 347, 350 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 338 (1st Cir. 2004)).               We\n\nreview the BIA's additions to the IJ's decision directly.\n\n            We review the BIA's and/or IJ's findings of fact under\n\nthe substantial evidence standard, reversing only if \"the record\n\nevidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary\n\ndetermination.\" Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003)).                 This\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdeferential standard applies not only to asylum claims but also to\n\nwithholding and CAT claims.            Settenda v. Ashcroft 377 F.3d 89, 93\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).          We review legal conclusions de novo, \"with\n\nappropriate    deference     to    the    agency's       interpretation   of    the\n\nunderlying     statute     in     accordance       with     administrative      law\n\nprinciples.\"    Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           When asked to review a credibility determination by the\n\nBIA   and/or   IJ,   we   look    to    see    whether    the   determination    is\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"              Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d\n\n257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481, 112 S. Ct. 812, 117 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1992)).                   This court\n\nwill not reverse a determination that a witness was not credible\n\nunless \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude\n\nto the contrary.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Chen v. Gonzales, 418\n\nF.3d 110, 113 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                        III.\n\n                                         A.\n\n           An individual applying for asylum must \"demonstrate[ ] by\n\nclear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed\n\nwithin 1 year after the date of the [individual's] arrival in the\n\nUnited States.\"      8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).            There is, however, an\n\nexception to the one-year filing requirement that applies if the\n\napplicant \"demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\feither the existence of changed circumstances which materially\n\naffect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\"                     8\n\nU.S.C.   §   1158(a)(2)(D).        Significantly,        no    court   shall     have\n\njurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\n\nconcerning whether an applicant for asylum filed an untimely\n\napplication      or    qualifies     for    the   exception      to    the   filing\n\nrequirement.     8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); see also Mehilli v. Gonzales,\n\n433 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 2005) (explaining that discretionary or\n\nfactual determinations with regard to the timeliness of an asylum\n\npetition fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals);\n\nNjenga, 386 F.3d at 339 (same).\n\n             Here, the IJ found that Stroni failed to demonstrate by\n\nclear and convincing evidence that his petition for asylum was\n\ntimely filed.         The BIA adopted and affirmed this finding of the\n\nIJ,   finding,    in     addition,    that      Stroni   had    also    failed    to\n\ndemonstrate that his delay in filing was excused by extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.        These findings were factual ones, based largely on\n\nStroni's lack of credibility. Because these findings by the BIA/IJ\n\nare not subject to review by this court, we must dismiss Stroni's\n\npetition for review of the denial of his application for asylum for\n\nlack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                           B.\n\n             To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\findividual has the burden of proving that, upon deportation, his\n\n\"life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the\n\n[individual's]    race,   religion,     nationality,         membership    in    a\n\nparticular   social   group,   or    political    opinion.\"        8   U.S.C.    §\n\n1231(b)(3); Salazar v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nAn individual may satisfy this burden by demonstrating either that\n\n(1) he has suffered past persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion (thus creating a rebuttable presumption that he will more\n\nlikely than not suffer future persecution), or (2) it is more\n\nlikely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a\n\nprotected ground upon his return to his native land.               Da Silva v.\n\nAshcroft, 394 F.3d 1,      4 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.16(b)); see also Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (explaining that an applicant for withholding of removal must\n\nshow a \"clear probability\" of persecution upon removal from the\n\nUnited States).\n\n             If   credible,    the    testimony        of   an   applicant     for\n\nwithholding of removal may be sufficient by itself to sustain his\n\nor her burden of proof as to past or future persecution.                  See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.16(a) (2002) (providing that \"[t]he testimony of the\n\napplicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of\n\nproof   without   corroboration\").          On   the    other    hand,    if    an\n\napplicant's testimony is not credible, \"it may be disregarded or\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fsharply discounted, depending on the circumstances.\"      Nikijuluw v.\n\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir. 2005). Importantly, minor or\n\ntrivial    inconsistencies   in    an    applicant's   testimony   are\n\ninsufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.            See\n\nSecaida-Rosales v. INS, 331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir. 2003) (stating\n\nthat \"[i]nconsistencies of less than substantial importance for\n\nwhich a plausible explanation is offered cannot form the sole basis\n\nfor an adverse credibility finding . . . especially [ ] when the\n\ninconsistencies do not concern the basis for the claim of asylum or\n\nwithholding, but rather matters collateral or ancillary to the\n\nclaim\" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). Instead,\n\nan adverse credibility finding must be based upon \"discrepancies\n\nthat   involve[]   the   heart     of    the   [withholding]   claim.\"\n\nBojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           Here, the IJ found that Stroni was not a credible witness\n\nand so denied Stroni's request for withholding of removal. The BIA\n\nsummarily adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision, including the\n\nIJ's finding as to Stroni's lack of credibility.       Like the asylum\n\nofficer who first denied Stroni's application for asylum, the IJ\n\nbased his credibility finding on the many inconsistencies in\n\nStroni's   testimony.\n\n           While some of the inconsistencies noted by the IJ are\n\ntrivial, others go to the heart of Stroni's withholding claim. For\n\nexample, the IJ noted that Stroni did not claim that he needed or\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fsought medical attention even though he claimed to have been\n\n\"significantly    physically        mistreated.\"      Without   stating    so\n\nexplicitly, the IJ implied that Stroni's failure to seek medical\n\nattention cast doubt on his claim that he suffered significant past\n\npersecution.      When   the   IJ    asked   Stroni   about   this   apparent\n\ninconsistency, Stroni responded that the \"communists were at all\n\nthe hospitals.\"     The IJ was unpersuaded by this \"sweeping and\n\nunsupported\" response.         The IJ was also dubious of Stroni's\n\nclaim that his family      members had been told by authorities that\n\nStroni would be killed if he returned to Albania.               When the IJ\n\nasked Stroni why the authorities would want to kill him, given that\n\nhis father–-a founding member and an elected official of the DP--\n\nhad suffered nothing more than insults since Stroni left Albania,\n\nStroni stated that the authorities were only concerned with young\n\npeople and not with people over 50.2          When reminded that neither\n\nhe, in his asylum application, nor his father, in a declaration\n\nsigned in July, 2002, had mentioned this death threat, Stroni\n\nexplained that the threat was made a mere four days before the\n\n\n     2\n       In Lumaj v. Gonzalez, 446 F.3d 194, 199 (1st Cir. 2006), the\ncourt upheld the IJ's lack-of-credibility finding in a case similar\nto this one. In Lumaj, the court stated:\n\n     [The] petitioner's parents and sister remain in Albania,\n     apparently without imminent risk of harm, despite the\n     family's longstanding history of political persecution\n     and his father's public status as an elected DP official.\n     Although petitioner points to his parents' advanced age\n     to explain their apparently peaceful existence, we have\n     no basis for treating age as a relevant distinction.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fFebruary 2004 hearing.              Stroni then went on to explain that,\n\nalthough similar threats were made to his family in October of 1997\n\nand September of 2003, he had no corroborating declarations about\n\nthe earlier threats because \"nobody asked me for it.\"\n\n            Our review of the record, which includes transcripts from\n\nthe hearings before both IJs, does not compel us to reject IJ\n\nJosephson's       lack-of-credibility            determination.         As    the    IJ\n\nconcluded, Stroni's testimony was rife with inconsistencies and\n\nimplausibilities. When asked why he would offer for the record his\n\nfather's     and     uncle's      declarations         when   those     declarations\n\ncontradicted certain details in his own testimony, Stroni claimed\n\nthat he had not read the supporting declarations, adding that his\n\nfather and uncle were simply confused.                    Stroni had improbable\n\nmemory     lapses,      changed     his    testimony      when    the    IJ    became\n\nincredulous, and blamed any discrepancies in his testimony on the\n\nmistakes of others.         When asked whether he had various specific\n\ndocuments to corroborate his testimony, Stroni explained that the\n\ndocuments had been thrown away or were otherwise unavailable.                       See\n\nDhima v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2005) (explaining\n\nthat, \"if the applicant is found not to be credible, corroborating\n\nevidence    may    be   used   to    bolster      an   applicant's      credibility\"\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Quite simply, we\n\nare persuaded that the record adequately supports the IJ's lack-of-\n\ncredibility finding and, in consequence, the IJ's finding that\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fStroni failed to establish his past persecution.              Certainly, the\n\nrecord is not such that \"any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary.\"         8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n           We also agree with the BIA's finding that Stroni has not\n\nestablished that it is more likely than not that he will be\n\npersecuted upon his return to Albania.              Stroni acknowledged that\n\nhis father and other family members have continued to live for\n\nseveral years in Albania without major incident despite their\n\naffiliation with the Democratic Party.         Stroni's father, a leading\n\nfigure in the DP, was not so afraid of the police that he refrained\n\nfrom obtaining an Albanian passport for Stroni from the very police\n\nwho participated in the alleged beatings.            Stroni admitted that he\n\nhimself lived without incident for four months with his aunt in\n\nTirana before he left the country.              The INS produced country\n\nreports revealing that, since 1997, all political parties had been\n\nactive in most of the country without a pattern of mistreatment.\n\nGiven   such    record   evidence,   we    cannot    say   that   the    BIA   was\n\ncompelled to find that Stroni demonstrated a clear probability that\n\nhe would be subjected to persecution upon his return to Albania.\n\n                                      C.\n\n           An    individual    seeking      protection      under       CAT    must\n\n\"establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be\n\ntortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\"                 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.16(c)(2); Saint Fort v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 191, 196 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f2003) (citing § 208.16(c)(2)).         \"For an act to constitute torture\n\nit must be: (1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or\n\nsuffering;    (2)    intentionally    inflicted;    (3)     for   a   proscribed\n\npurpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\n\nacquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical\n\ncontrol of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\"\n\nElien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2004); see also 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(2) (providing that \"torture\" is \"an extreme\n\nform of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser\n\nforms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that\n\ndo not amount to torture\"). Evidence relevant to the assessment of\n\neligibility for CAT relief includes, but is not limited to: (1)\n\nevidence of past torture; (2) the viability of relocation as a\n\nmeans to avoid torture; (3) gross, flagrant or mass human rights\n\nviolations in the country of removal; and (4) other relevant\n\ncountry conditions.       8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(3).\n\n           The IJ in this case rejected Stroni's CAT claim based on\n\nStroni's lack of credibility.         The BIA affirmed, concluding that\n\nStroni   failed     to   establish   that   he   suffered    past     torture   in\n\nAlbania.     The BIA also added that Stroni failed to show that he\n\ncould not relocate to another area of Albania to avoid torture in\n\nthe future.       As we have already explained, we find substantial\n\nrecord support for the IJ's lack-of-credibility finding and thus\n\nthe BIA's finding that Stroni failed to demonstrate past torture.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fBecause these findings are enough to doom Stroni's request for\n\nprotection under CAT, we do not reach the issue of whether Stroni\n\nfailed to show that he could not relocate to another part of\n\nAlbania to avoid future torture.           Because we find that the record\n\nfalls far short of compelling a conclusion contrary to that reached\n\nby   the   IJ   and   BIA,   we   affirm    the   decision   as   to   Stroni's\n\nineligibility for protection under CAT.3\n\n                                     IV.\n\n            Because we lack jurisdiction over Stroni's asylum claim,\n\nand because the record demonstrates that the findings of the IJ and\n\nBIA are amply \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole,\" Hernandez-Barrera v.\n\nAshcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2004), we DISMISS Stroni's\n\npetition to the extent he seeks review of his asylum claim, and we\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       The INS maintains that Stroni has waived any challenge to\nthe agency's denial of his CAT and withholding claims based on the\nperfunctory treatment of these claims in his appellate brief. To\nbe sure, without citation to the record, Stroni does little more in\nhis brief than assert in conclusory fashion that the BIA erred in\nfinding him ineligible for withholding of removal and protection\nunder CAT.     While such perfunctory treatment is generally\ninsufficient to preserve these issues on appeal, we nonetheless\nhave considered and rejected Stroni's appeal of these issues on the\nmerits. See Torres-Arroyo v. Rullan, 436 F.3d 1, 7(1st Cir. 2006)\n(noting that \"[g]auzy generalizations are manifestly insufficient\nto preserve an issue for appellate review\"); Ryan v.

On March 12, 2002, almost one year after his purported entry date, Stroni filed an application for asylum with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In support of his request for asylum, Stroni described several incidents of past persecution by the Socialist government of Albania, incidents allegedly based on Stroni's political affiliation and opinion. Stroni also asserted that he feared he would be killed, tortured, or arrested if he returned to Albania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The asylum officer who heard Stroni's case found Stroni's testimony to be vague, inconsistent, and lacking in detail. Although Stroni was given the opportunity to clarify all discrepancies in his testimony, he was unable to do so successfully. In particular, the asylum officer found that Stroni's testimony regarding the date, manner, and place of his entry into the United States was not credible. The asylum officer thus rejected Stroni's application for asylum, having concluded that Stroni failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application for asylum within one year of his entry as required by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon referral from the asylum officer, the Immigration Court placed Stroni in removal proceedings by filing a Notice to Appear dated April 15, 2002. On June 28, 2002, at an initial hearing before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") in New York City, Stroni conceded removability as charged, renewed his application for asylum, and requested withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), and, in the alternative, voluntary departure. The IJ adjourned the hearing after granting Stroni's request to transfer venue to Boston, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stroni ultimately presented documentary and testimonial evidence at two hearings before different IJs in Boston. At the first hearing, held on January 17, 2003, Stroni testified before IJ Thomas Ragno. IJ Ragno continued the hearing after Stroni's testimony was concluded to allow the INS to verify information provided by Stroni as to his entry date and use of passport aliases. A second hearing was held on February 13, 2004, more than a year later, before IJ Kenneth Josephson. While acknowledging that IJ Ragno had taken testimony at the earlier hearing, IJ Josephson announced that he would hear the testimony again, explaining that he had not had an opportunity to listen to the tapes of the previous hearing. Before testimony was begun, IJ Josephson noted for the record that the computer printout from the \"central indices\" showed no supporting documentation for Stroni's claim regarding the date and place he entered the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Briefly, Stroni testified as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stroni was an activist on behalf of the Democratic Party (\"DP\") in Albania, an organization that opposed the communist regime that had controlled Albania for many years. Although Stroni himself was never a member of the DP, Stroni's father was a founding member and vice chairman of a local branch of the DP. The DP rose to power in 1992 but was defeated in 1997 by the Socialist Party, then dominated by a previous leader in the communist regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1997, 19-year-old Stroni and his father were arrested at a DP rally where they were protesting the Socialist Party's practice of firing DP supporters. While they were being held at the police station, Stroni and his father were beaten and threatened with death if they continued to support the DP. Stroni was released after one night, his father after three nights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, a bomb was detonated outside Stroni's home, wounding Stroni's sister in the leg. Although the incident was reported to the police, the police failed to do anything about the bombing. Stroni believes that the family was targeted by \"unknown people\" for political reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or about November 1999, Stroni joined the Azem Hajdari, an anti-communist organization named after a DP activist who was assassinated on September 12, 1998. Stroni began paying dues to the Azem Hajdari in January 2000, and he thereafter attended meetings once or twice a month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 28, 2000, Stroni and his father were once again arrested and taken to the police station. As before, they were beaten and threatened with death if they continued to support the democratic movement. They were released the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2000, Stroni was arrested the morning after a DP demonstration commemorating the second anniversary of Azem Hajdari's death. Stroni was released that same evening, after he was punched, kicked, and warned that he could suffer the same fate as Azem Hajdari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 1, 2000, Stroni was arrested for participating in protests in his hometown of Ballish. During his two-day detention, the police beat him, threatened him, and urinated on his face while holding his head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this latest arrest, Stroni left Ballish and went to live with his aunt in Tirana for several months. He lived there without incident, staying mostly inside. In January 2001, Stroni's father obtained an Albanian passport for Stroni from the very police department in Ballish where he and Stroni had been mistreated. Stroni claimed that he was too afraid to get the passport himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stroni departed Albania on March 11, 2001, passing through Italy, Belgium, and Munich on his way to the United States. Stroni arrived in Chicago on March 17, 2001, using not his Albanian passport but a fake Italian passport issued in the name of \"Carmello Pezzotta.\" Stroni disposed of his Italian passport the day after he arrived in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By oral decision dated February 13, 2004, IJ Josephson ruled that Stroni was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he failed to satisfy his burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his asylum application within one year after his entry into the United States. Although Stroni testified that he entered the United States on March 17, 2001, the IJ specifically stated that he did not find Stroni to be credible. The IJ also noted that, in addition to Stroni's having failed to produce any documentary evidence to support his claimed entry date, the INS's \"nonimmigrant information system inquiry\" failed to produce any supporting check for Stroni's claimed entry under the name of \"Carmelo Pezzotta.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IJ Josephson also denied Stroni's applications for withholding of removal and protection under CAT, finding that Stroni had utterly failed to demonstrate that he would be persecuted, more likely than not, if he were to return to Albania. Among other things, the IJ cited the State Department's Profile Report, which described conditions in Albania as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The democratic party currently participates in most parliamentary activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite opposition claims of massive voter disenfranchisement and other manipulations, nationwide local elections held in October of 2000 made clear and unmistakable progress towards meeting democratic standards. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All political parties have been active in most of the country without a pattern of mistreatment even during the dark days of 1997.

The IJ also noted that, as to his father and other family members who continued not only to live in Albania but also to openly support the Democratic Party, Stroni made no claim that they had suffered anything more than insults since Stroni's departure from Albania. Finally, describing some of the many inconsistencies in Stroni's testimony, the IJ simply concluded that Stroni's story about past and future persecution was not at all credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the decision of IJ Josephson, stating additionally that it agreed with the IJ's finding that (1) Stroni was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he both failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he timely filed his asylum application and also failed to establish extraordinary circumstances for such delay; (2) Stroni failed to meet the heightened burden of proof to establish his eligibility for withholding removal; and (3) Stroni failed to establish his eligibility for protection under CAT because he failed to demonstrate both that he suffered torture in Albania in the past and also that he could not relocate to another area in Albania to avoid torture in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court normally reviews decisions of the BIA rather than those of an IJ.

Significantly, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General concerning whether an applicant for asylum filed an untimely application or qualifies for the exception to the filing requirement. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3); <i>see also Mehilli v.

The BIA adopted and affirmed this finding of the IJ, finding, in addition, that Stroni had also failed to demonstrate that his delay in filing was excused by extraordinary circumstances. These findings were factual ones, based largely on Stroni's lack of credibility. Because these findings by the BIA/IJ are not subject to review by this court, we must dismiss Stroni's petition for review of the denial of his application for asylum for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an individual has the burden of proving that, upon deportation, his \"life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the [individual's] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3); <i>Salazar v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2004). An individual may satisfy this burden by demonstrating either that (1) he has suffered past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion (thus creating a rebuttable presumption that he will more likely than not suffer future persecution), or (2) it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground upon his return to his native land. <i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005) (citing 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b)); <i>see also Ang v.

On the other hand, if an applicant's testimony is not credible, \"it may be disregarded or sharply discounted, depending on the circumstances.\" <i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.2005). Importantly, minor or trivial inconsistencies in an applicant's testimony are insufficient to support an adverse credibility finding. <i>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS,</i> 331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003) (stating that \"[i]nconsistencies of less than substantial importance for which a plausible explanation is offered cannot form the sole basis for an adverse credibility finding . . . especially [] when the inconsistencies do not concern the basis for the claim of asylum or withholding, but rather matters collateral or ancillary to the claim\" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). Instead, an adverse credibility finding must be based upon \"discrepancies that involve[] the heart of the [withholding] claim.\" <i>Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS,</i> 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ found that Stroni was not a credible witness and so denied Stroni's request for withholding of removal. The BIA summarily adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision, including the IJ's finding as to Stroni's lack of credibility. Like the asylum officer who first denied Stroni's application for asylum, the IJ based his credibility finding on the many inconsistencies in Stroni's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While some of the inconsistencies noted by the IJ are trivial, others go to the heart of Stroni's withholding claim. For example, the IJ noted that Stroni did not claim that he needed or sought medical attention even though he claimed to have been \"significantly physically mistreated.\" Without stating so explicitly, the IJ implied that Stroni's failure to seek medical attention cast doubt on his claim that he suffered significant past persecution. When the IJ asked Stroni about this apparent inconsistency, Stroni responded that the \"communists were at all the hospitals.\" The IJ was unpersuaded by this \"sweeping and unsupported\" response. The IJ was also dubious of Stroni's claim that his family members had been told by authorities that Stroni would be killed if he returned to Albania. When the IJ asked Stroni why the authorities would want to kill him, given that his father &#8212; a founding member and an elected official of the DP &#8212; had suffered nothing more than insults since Stroni left Albania, Stroni stated that the authorities were only concerned with young people and not with people over 50.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> When reminded that neither he, in his asylum application, nor his father, in a declaration signed in July, 2002, had mentioned this death threat, Stroni explained that the threat was made a mere four days before the February 2004 hearing. Stroni then went on to explain that, although similar threats were made to his family in October of 1997 and September of 2003, he had no corroborating declarations about the earlier threats because \"nobody asked me for it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record, which includes transcripts from the hearings before both IJs, does not compel us to reject IJ Josephson's lack-of-credibility determination. As the IJ concluded, Stroni's testimony was rife with inconsistencies and implausibilities. When asked why he would offer for the record his father's and uncle's declarations when those declarations contradicted certain details in his own testimony, Stroni claimed that he had not read the supporting declarations, adding that his father and uncle were simply confused. Stroni had improbable memory lapses, changed his testimony when the IJ became incredulous, and blamed any discrepancies in his testimony on the mistakes of others. When asked whether he had various specific documents to corroborate his testimony, Stroni explained that the documents had been thrown away or were otherwise unavailable. <i>See Dhima v. Gonzales,</i> 416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir.2005) (explaining that, \"if the applicant is found not to be credible, corroborating evidence may be used to bolster an applicant's credibility\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Quite simply, we are persuaded that the record adequately supports the IJ's lack-of-credibility finding and, in consequence, the IJ's finding that Stroni failed to establish his past persecution. Certainly, the record is not such that \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with the BIA's finding that Stroni has not established that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted upon his return to Albania. Stroni acknowledged that his father and other family members have continued to live for several years in Albania without major incident despite their affiliation with the Democratic Party. Stroni's father, a leading figure in the DP, was not so afraid of the police that he refrained from obtaining an Albanian passport for Stroni from the very police who participated in the alleged beatings. Stroni admitted that he himself lived without incident for four months with his aunt in Tirana before he left the country. The INS produced country reports revealing that, since 1997, all political parties had been active in most of the country without a pattern of mistreatment. Given such record evidence, we cannot say that the BIA was compelled to find that Stroni demonstrated a clear probability that he would be subjected to persecution upon his return to Albania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An individual seeking protection under CAT must \"establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(c)(2); <i>Saint Fort v. Ashcroft,</i> 329 F.3d 191, 196 (1st Cir.2003) (citing &#167; 208.16(c)(2)). \"For an act to constitute torture it must be: (1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\" <i>Elien v.

Evidence relevant to the assessment of eligibility for CAT relief includes, but is not limited to: (1) evidence of past torture; (2) the viability of relocation as a means to avoid torture; (3) gross, flagrant or mass human rights violations in the country of removal; and (4) other relevant country conditions. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.16(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ in this case rejected Stroni's CAT claim based on Stroni's lack of credibility. The BIA affirmed, concluding that Stroni failed to establish that he suffered past torture in Albania. The BIA also added that Stroni failed to show that he could not relocate to another area of Albania to avoid torture in the future. As we have already explained, we find substantial record support for the IJ's lack-of-credibility finding and thus the BIA's finding that Stroni failed to demonstrate past torture. Because these findings are enough to doom Stroni's request for protection under CAT, we do not reach the issue of whether Stroni failed to show that he could not relocate to another part of Albania to avoid future torture. Because we find that the record falls far short of compelling a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ and BIA, we affirm the decision as to Stroni's ineligibility for protection under CAT.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we lack jurisdiction over Stroni's asylum claim, and because the record demonstrates that the findings of the IJ and BIA are amply \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\" <i>Hernandez-Barrera v.

On March 12, 2002, almost one year after his purported entry date, Stroni filed an application for asylum with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In support of his request for asylum, Stroni described several incidents of past persecution by the Socialist government of Albania, incidents allegedly based on Stroni's political affiliation and opinion. Stroni also asserted that he feared he would be killed, tortured, or arrested if he returned to Albania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The asylum officer who heard Stroni's case found Stroni's testimony to be vague, inconsistent, and lacking in detail. Although Stroni was given the opportunity to clarify all discrepancies in his testimony, he was unable to do so successfully. In particular, the asylum officer found that Stroni's testimony regarding the date, manner, and place of his entry into the United States was not credible. The asylum officer thus rejected Stroni's application for asylum, having concluded that Stroni failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application for asylum within one year of his entry as required by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon referral from the asylum officer, the Immigration Court placed Stroni in removal proceedings by filing a Notice to Appear dated April 15, 2002. On June 28, 2002, at an initial hearing before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") in New York City, Stroni conceded removability as charged, renewed his application for asylum, and requested withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), and, in the alternative, voluntary departure. The IJ adjourned the hearing after granting Stroni's request to transfer venue to Boston, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stroni ultimately presented documentary and testimonial evidence at two hearings before different IJs in Boston. At the first hearing, held on January 17, 2003, Stroni testified before IJ Thomas Ragno. IJ Ragno continued the hearing after Stroni's testimony was concluded to allow the INS to verify information provided by Stroni as to his entry date and use of passport aliases. A second hearing was held on February 13, 2004, more than a year later, before IJ Kenneth Josephson. While acknowledging that IJ Ragno had taken testimony at the earlier hearing, IJ Josephson announced that he would hear the testimony again, explaining that he had not had an opportunity to listen to the tapes of the previous hearing. Before testimony was begun, IJ Josephson noted for the record that the computer printout from the \"central indices\" showed no supporting documentation for Stroni's claim regarding the date and place he entered the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Briefly, Stroni testified as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stroni was an activist on behalf of the Democratic Party (\"DP\") in Albania, an organization that opposed the communist regime that had controlled Albania for many years. Although Stroni himself was never a member of the DP, Stroni's father was a founding member and vice chairman of a local branch of the DP. The DP rose to power in 1992 but was defeated in 1997 by the Socialist Party, then dominated by a previous leader in the communist regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1997, 19-year-old Stroni and his father were arrested at a DP rally where they were protesting the Socialist Party's practice of firing DP supporters. While they were being held at the police station, Stroni and his father were beaten and threatened with death if they continued to support the DP. Stroni was released after one night, his father after three nights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, a bomb was detonated outside Stroni's home, wounding Stroni's sister in the leg. Although the incident was reported to the police, the police failed to do anything about the bombing. Stroni believes that the family was targeted by \"unknown people\" for political reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or about November 1999, Stroni joined the Azem Hajdari, an anti-communist organization named after a DP activist who was assassinated on September 12, 1998. Stroni began paying dues to the Azem Hajdari in January 2000, and he thereafter attended meetings once or twice a month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 28, 2000, Stroni and his father were once again arrested and taken to the police station. As before, they were beaten and threatened with death if they continued to support the democratic movement. They were released the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2000, Stroni was arrested the morning after a DP demonstration commemorating the second anniversary of Azem Hajdari's death. Stroni was released that same evening, after he was punched, kicked, and warned that he could suffer the same fate as Azem Hajdari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 1, 2000, Stroni was arrested for participating in protests in his hometown of Ballish. During his two-day detention, the police beat him, threatened him, and urinated on his face while holding his head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this latest arrest, Stroni left Ballish and went to live with his aunt in Tirana for several months. He lived there without incident, staying mostly inside. In January 2001, Stroni's father obtained an Albanian passport for Stroni from the very police department in Ballish where he and Stroni had been mistreated. Stroni claimed that he was too afraid to get the passport himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stroni departed Albania on March 11, 2001, passing through Italy, Belgium, and Munich on his way to the United States. Stroni arrived in Chicago on March 17, 2001, using not his Albanian passport but a fake Italian passport issued in the name of \"Carmello Pezzotta.\" Stroni disposed of his Italian passport the day after he arrived in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By oral decision dated February 13, 2004, IJ Josephson ruled that Stroni was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he failed to satisfy his burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his asylum application within one year after his entry into the United States. Although Stroni testified that he entered the United States on March 17, 2001, the IJ specifically stated that he did not find Stroni to be credible. The IJ also noted that, in addition to Stroni's having failed to produce any documentary evidence to support his claimed entry date, the INS's \"nonimmigrant information system inquiry\" failed to produce any supporting check for Stroni's claimed entry under the name of \"Carmelo Pezzotta.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IJ Josephson also denied Stroni's applications for withholding of removal and protection under CAT, finding that Stroni had utterly failed to demonstrate that he would be persecuted, more likely than not, if he were to return to Albania. Among other things, the IJ cited the State Department's Profile Report, which described conditions in Albania as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The democratic party currently participates in most parliamentary activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite opposition claims of massive voter disenfranchisement and other manipulations, nationwide local elections held in October of 2000 made clear and unmistakable progress towards meeting democratic standards. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All political parties have been active in most of the country without a pattern of mistreatment even during the dark days of 1997.

The BIA summarily adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision, including the IJ's finding as to Stroni's lack of credibility. Like the asylum officer who first denied Stroni's application for asylum, the IJ based his credibility finding on the many inconsistencies in Stroni's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While some of the inconsistencies noted by the IJ are trivial, others go to the heart of Stroni's withholding claim. For example, the IJ noted that Stroni did not claim that he needed or sought medical attention even though he claimed to have been \"significantly physically mistreated.\" Without stating so explicitly, the IJ implied that Stroni's failure to seek medical attention cast doubt on his claim that he suffered significant past persecution. When the IJ asked Stroni about this apparent inconsistency, Stroni responded that the \"communists were at all the hospitals.\" The IJ was unpersuaded by this \"sweeping and unsupported\" response. The IJ was also dubious of Stroni's claim that his family members had been told by authorities that Stroni would be killed if he returned to Albania. When the IJ asked Stroni why the authorities would want to kill him, given that his father &#8212; a founding member and an elected official of the DP &#8212; had suffered nothing more than insults since Stroni left Albania, Stroni stated that the authorities were only concerned with young people and not with people over 50.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> When reminded that neither he, in his asylum application, nor his father, in a declaration signed in July, 2002, had mentioned this death threat, Stroni explained that the threat was made a mere four days before the February 2004 hearing. Stroni then went on to explain that, although similar threats were made to his family in October of 1997 and September of 2003, he had no corroborating declarations about the earlier threats because \"nobody asked me for it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record, which includes transcripts from the hearings before both IJs, does not compel us to reject IJ Josephson's lack-of-credibility determination. As the IJ concluded, Stroni's testimony was rife with inconsistencies and implausibilities. When asked why he would offer for the record his father's and uncle's declarations when those declarations contradicted certain details in his own testimony, Stroni claimed that he had not read the supporting declarations, adding that his father and uncle were simply confused. Stroni had improbable memory lapses, changed his testimony when the IJ became incredulous, and blamed any discrepancies in his testimony on the mistakes of others. When asked whether he had various specific documents to corroborate his testimony, Stroni explained that the documents had been thrown away or were otherwise unavailable. <i>See Dhima v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201733\"><a href=\"/opinion/201733/dhima-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2005) (explaining that, \"if the applicant is found not to be credible, corroborating evidence may be used to bolster an applicant's credibility\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Quite simply, we are persuaded that the record adequately supports the IJ's lack-of-credibility finding and, in consequence, the IJ's finding that Stroni failed to establish his past persecution. Certainly, the record is not such that \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with the BIA's finding that Stroni has not established that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted upon his return to Albania. Stroni acknowledged that his father and other family members have continued to live for several years in Albania without major incident despite their affiliation with the Democratic Party. Stroni's father, a leading figure in the DP, was not so afraid of the police that he refrained from obtaining an Albanian passport for Stroni from the very police who participated in the alleged beatings. Stroni admitted that he himself lived without incident for four months with his aunt in Tirana before he left the country. The INS produced country reports revealing that, since 1997, all political parties had been active in most of the country without a pattern of mistreatment. Given such record evidence, we cannot say that the BIA was compelled to find that Stroni demonstrated a clear probability that he would be subjected to persecution upon his return to Albania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An individual seeking protection under CAT must \"establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(c)(2); <i>Saint Fort v.

As we have already explained, we find substantial record support for the IJ's lack-of-credibility finding and thus the BIA's finding that Stroni failed to demonstrate past torture. Because these findings are enough to doom Stroni's request for protection under CAT, we do not reach the issue of whether Stroni failed to show that he could not relocate to another part of Albania to avoid future torture.
