Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n                   Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Richard B. Klibaner, with whom Klibaner & Sabino, was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     John-Alex Romano, Attorney, Criminal Division, United States\nDepartment of Justice, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States\nAttorney and William F. Bloomer, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwere on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 5, 2008\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.          A jury convicted George Upton of\n\nconspiracy to commit money laundering.             In this appeal, he argues\n\nthat, by the time of his indictment, the statute of limitations\n\nperiod had run on all of his conduct except for the filing of a\n\nfalse tax return and the failure to file a tax return.                      Upton\n\nasserts that, under governing Supreme Court precedent cabining the\n\ngovernment's ability to charge continuing conspiracies based on\n\nsubsequent acts of cover-up, the two tax offenses were not part of\n\nthe conspiracy.       From this premise he contends both that he was\n\nentitled to a jury instruction on the statute of limitations and\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to convict him of conspiracy to\n\nlaunder money within the applicable limitations period.                   He also\n\nclaims   that   the   district    court    erred    in    admitting   a   hearsay\n\nstatement as an excited utterance.           We affirm.1\n\n                                      I.\n\n                          A.     Background Facts\n\n           For purposes of assessing the sufficiency claim, we\n\nrecite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Boulanger, 444 F.3d 76, 89 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Upton owned Look Motors, Inc., a used car lot in Hyannis,\n\nMassachusetts    that   sold     automobiles    and      offered   financing    to\n\n\n\n1\n  After oral argument in this case, the Supreme Court decided\nCuellar v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 1994 (2008).  The case is\npertinent to the limitations issue raised and required further\nconsideration.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fcustomers who could not afford to make large down payments.      In\n\nconnection with this enterprise, he had a business relationship\n\nwith Steven Queen, a lender.\n\n          On July 9, 1997, Queen traveled to Florida and removed a\n\nlarge amount of cash from his parents' safe deposit box.   Queen had\n\ntold several people of his plans prior to making this trip,\n\nclaiming that the money was his inheritance. Upton had heard about\n\nQueen's trip and its purpose.\n\n          Upon returning from Florida on the evening of July 12,\n\n1997, Queen left a suitcase containing $900,000 in cash in the\n\ntrunk of a car that was parked in the Look Motors parking lot and\n\nwent to dinner.   Upton's daughter saw Queen place the suitcase in\n\nthe trunk of the car.   She told Upton and his girlfriend of twenty\n\nyears, Lynn Alberico, about the suitcase.       While Queen was at\n\ndinner, Upton and Alberico removed the suitcase from the car. When\n\nQueen returned to Look Motors and discovered that the suitcase was\n\nmissing, he accused Upton of stealing the money.    Upton denied the\n\naccusation and told Queen to leave.    Distraught, Queen went to the\n\napartment of a friend and told her that the money he had taken from\n\nhis parents was gone.\n\n          Queen accused Upton of stealing the money on several\n\noccasions, in public confrontations.    Upton did not admit to Queen\n\nthat he had taken the money.    During the fall of 1997, however,\n\nUpton did admit to an acquaintance that he had stolen a suitcase\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fwith more than $900,000 in cash from Queen.        In 1999, Alberico made\n\nthe same admission to her best friend.\n\n           On August 19, 1997, a month after the theft, Upton signed\n\na purchase and sale agreement to buy the property located at 89\n\nIyanough Road in Hyannis, Massachusetts for $120,000.              He made a\n\n$12,000   down   payment   by   check;    that   check   was    returned   for\n\ninsufficient funds, and Upton replaced it with $12,000 in cash.\n\nUpton paid the $108,000 balance of the purchase price with thirteen\n\ncashier's checks.\n\n           The cashier's checks had been acquired in several stages,\n\nover the span of three days.       Upton's brother, two friends, and a\n\nLook Motors employee assisted Upton and Alberico.              Upton provided\n\ncash to these four people.        Then, each person deposited the cash\n\ninto his or her personal bank account to purchase one or more\n\ncashier's checks.    Most of the deposits and checks were for sums\n\nless than $10,000 and involved visits to multiple bank branches or\n\nmultiple visits to the same branch, in order to avoid federal\n\nreporting requirements.2        The checks variously were made out to\n\nUpton or to Alberico.\n\n           Alberico took title to the property in the name of \"AU\n\nTrust.\"   That trust, created on the day of the closing, August 29,\n\n1997, bears Alberico's and Upton's initials.             Also on the day of\n\n\n2\n  Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 5313(a) and 31 C.F.R. § 103.22, domestic\nfinancial institutions are required to report currency transactions\ninvolving more than $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthe closing, Alberico granted a sham mortgage on the property to\n\n\"Bostonians Trust of Florida,\" which did not then even exist.              The\n\nproperty was then rented out for $1,000 per month.\n\n           The 89 Iyanough Road property was sold on January 5,\n\n1999, for $202,000.    On January 6, the real estate attorney wrote\n\nseparate checks to Upton and Alberico for $39,850 each, and, less\n\nthan a week later, purchased bank checks made out to Upton and\n\nAlberico for $52,948.21 each.         Bank records indicate that these\n\nchecks   were   deposited   into    the    accounts   of   Look   Motors   and\n\nAlberico, respectively, in January 1999.\n\n           Upton eventually filed his 1997 federal income tax return\n\nin July 2000, reporting a total income of $14,165.                At the same\n\ntime, he also filed returns for 1994, 1995, and 1996.              All of his\n\nreturns were prepared by his accountant, based on information\n\nprovided by Upton.    The 1997 return was false in that it did not\n\ndisclose any portion of the $900,000 stolen from Queen, nor did it\n\ndisclose any portion of the rental income from 89 Iyanough Road for\n\nthe partial year 1997.      Alberico's tax return for 1997, filed in\n\nAugust 1998, also neglected to report any portion of the stolen\n\nmoney or the rental income.        Upton did not file a return for 1998.\n\nAlberico filed a false return for 1998 in October 1999, again\n\nfailing to report rental income.          Neither Upton nor Alberico filed\n\na tax return for 1999, the year in which each earned a substantial\n\ncapital gain from the sale of the property.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                             B.   Procedural History\n\n              In August 2002, a grand jury indicted Upton and Alberico\n\nfor money laundering and for structuring financial transactions to\n\nevade reporting requirements, as well as for conspiracy to engage\n\nin such structuring.          On May 12, 2004, a superseding indictment\n\nadded counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(B), (h) and 1957(a); filing a materially\n\nfalse income tax return for the year 1997, in violation of 26\n\nU.S.C. § 7206(1); and failing to file an income tax return for the\n\nyear 1999, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7203.\n\n              The general five-year statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3282,     applies   to   prosecutions    for     violations    of   the   money\n\nlaundering and structuring statutes.               For reasons not material to\n\nthis appeal, the filing of the superseding indictment established\n\nMay 12, 2004 as the relevant date for statute of limitations\n\npurposes.      Prosecution for alleged crimes committed prior to May\n\n12,    1999    was   thus    barred    by    the    statute   of    limitations.\n\nAccordingly, the district court dismissed the counts carried over\n\nfrom the original indictment alleging money laundering, structuring\n\nand conspiracy to engage in structuring.             Upton, 339 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n196.   Upton went to trial on the remaining charges of conspiracy to\n\ncommit money laundering and the two tax violations.3\n\n\n\n3\n  Upton was tried in October 2004. Alberico's motion to sever had\nbeen granted previously; she was tried separately in July 2005.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f              During the charge conference, Upton did not request a\n\njury    instruction      on   a    statute     of   limitations   defense    to     the\n\nconspiracy count.        The next day, however, at the completion of the\n\ngovernment's case in chief, he did request such an instruction.\n\nThe trial judge denied this request on the basis that Upton had\n\nwaived the request by failing to raise it at the charge conference.\n\nAt     the    completion      of    the   government's       case,   Upton        moved\n\nunsuccessfully for judgment of acquittal on the basis that the\n\nmoney laundering conspiracy charge was time-barred. After the jury\n\nhad been instructed at the close of the evidence, Upton objected to\n\nthe denial of his request for a statute of limitations instruction.\n\nThe court again ruled that Upton had waived his right to a jury\n\ninstruction on the statute of limitations because he did not raise\n\nit at the charge conference.\n\n              The jury found Upton guilty on each of the three counts:\n\nconspiracy to commit money laundering, filing a false tax return,\n\nand failure to file a tax return.                   Following the verdict, the\n\ndistrict court denied Upton's renewed motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal, United States v. Upton, 352 F. Supp. 2d 92, 100 (D.\n\nMass. 2005), and sentenced him to 162 months' imprisonment.\n\n                                          II.\n\n              Upton appeals only his conviction for conspiracy to\n\ncommit       money    laundering.         He    does   not   challenge      his     tax\n\nconvictions.         As to the conspiracy conviction, he claims that the\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdistrict court erred in not instructing the jury on the statute of\n\nlimitations; erred in denying his motion for acquittal on statute\n\nof limitations grounds; and abused its discretion in admitting a\n\nstatement as an excited utterance.\n\n          A.   Jury Instruction on Statute of Limitations\n\n          Upton contends that the district court erred by failing\n\nto instruct the jury on the statute of limitations applicable to\n\nthe money laundering conspiracy.   He argues that he has preserved\n\nhis objection to the court's failure to so instruct, and therefore\n\nthat harmless error is the appropriate standard of review.   While\n\nhe acknowledges that he failed to request a written instruction at\n\nthe charge conference, Upton presses the fact that he raised his\n\nobjection after the charge conference but before the jury was\n\ninstructed, and again after the instructions were delivered to the\n\njury.   Beyond this, he asserts that even if he has not preserved\n\nhis objection, the court's failure to give the instruction was\n\nplainly erroneous. See United States v. Thurston, 358 F.3d 51 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), vacated on other grounds.\n\n          The appellant is not entitled to relief on this ground.\n\nFirst, the claim of error is unpreserved.     The requirements for\n\nrequesting a jury instruction are clear.    Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(a)\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n          Any party may request in writing that the\n          court instruct the jury on the law as\n          specified in the request. The request must be\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f          made at the close of evidence or at any time\n          that the court reasonably sets.\n\n(emphasis added). Upton concedes that he did not submit in writing\n\na request for an instruction on the statute of limitations; indeed,\n\nhe acknowledges that he withheld the request for a jury instruction\n\nat the charge conference as part of his trial strategy.        As he did\n\nnot meet the requirements for requesting a jury instruction, his\n\nlater objections to the jury instructions were deemed waived by the\n\ntrial judge.\n\n          That brings us to the question of how to treat the\n\nunpreserved jury instruction issue.      In United States v. Muñoz-\n\nFranco, 487 F.3d 25, 54 (1st Cir. 2007), we held that the failure\n\nto request a jury instruction constitutes waiver.       The defendants\n\nin Muñoz-Franco claimed that the district court erred in not\n\ninstructing the jury on the applicable statute of limitations, but\n\nthey had not raised that issue at any time prior to or during\n\ntrial, including in their post-trial Rule 29(a) motion.         We held\n\nthat their claim was waived and thus not reviewable on appeal.\n\n          Pointing to Thurston, Upton argues that plain error\n\nreview is appropriate in this case.      358 F.3d at 63.      It is not\n\nnecessary, however, to resolve any potential conflict between\n\nMuñoz-Franco   and   Thurston   here.   Waiver   is   the   \"intentional\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\"      United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).       The\n\nright to a jury instruction can be waived by not requesting the\n\n                                  -9-\n\finstruction, or not objecting at the proper time.           Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n30(a), (d).     Upton deliberately chose not to request a statute of\n\nlimitations jury instruction at the charge conference as a matter\n\nof trial strategy.4         The informed decision to decline to exercise\n\nthe   right    to    request     a   specific   jury    instruction    is    a\n\nstraightforward example of an \"intentional relinquishment\" subject\n\nto waiver.\n\n             Even were we to consider this an instance of forfeiture\n\nand review the failure to instruct the jury on the statute of\n\nlimitations for plain error, we would conclude that there was no\n\nplain error.    Under the plain error standard, Upton must show that\n\n\"the trial court committed an error, that the error was 'plain,'\n\nand   that    the   error    affected   the   substantial   rights    of    the\n\nappellant.\"     United States v. Colon-Nales, 464 F.3d 21, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (citing Olano, 507 U.S. at 732).            Further, error is to\n\nbe corrected only if it \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Upton points out that a defendant may face a difficult decision\nwhen a charge conference is held before the close of the\ngovernment's case: raising a defense at that point might alert the\ngovernment to a weakness in its case and encourage the government\nto seek additional evidence. Nevertheless, the district court is\nvested with the authority to manage trials, United States v.\nSaccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 770 (1st Cir. 1995), including setting a\ntime for the charge conference that parties must adhere to or face\nthe consequences. Here, the charge conference was the day before\nthe government closed the evidence in its case. The timing of the\nconference was entirely reasonable, and we need not explore\napplication of the rule to situations presenting an extreme gap in\ntiming between the conference and the close of the evidence.\n\n                                     -10-\n\for public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Olano, 507 U.S. at\n\n736 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n          The trial court did not commit plain error in declining\n\nto instruct the jury on the statute of limitations.    Rule 30(a) is\n\nclear, and Upton failed to meet its strictures. The district judge\n\nacted within her discretion to deny Upton's requested instruction\n\nbecause the request was untimely.\n\n          B.   Motion for Acquittal on Statute of Limitations\n\n          Presented as a challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, Upton argues that the district court should have granted\n\nhis motion for acquittal on the conspiracy count because the\n\nstatute of limitations bars his conviction.    The essence of this\n\nsufficiency claim is that there was no evidence that the conspiracy\n\ncontinued to a time that was within five years of the May 12, 2004\n\nsuperseding indictment.   Upton argues that the money laundering\n\nobjective of the conspiracy was achieved no later than when the\n\nconspirators sold the Iyanough Road property in January 1999.   His\n\nfailure to file a return for 1999 and his July 2000 filing of a\n\nfalse tax return for 1997 were, he says, at most unilateral acts\n\nintended to cover up the conspiracy after its termination. Relying\n\non Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391 (1957), Upton argues\n\nthat the tax violations must be viewed as no more than attempts at\n\ncovering up a completed conspiracy.   As such, under Grunewald they\n\ncannot constitute acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f          The government counters that Grunewald does not bar this\n\nprosecution.   Rather, because the indictment charged a conspiracy\n\nthe main objective of which was concealment, Grunewald's limiting\n\nprinciple has no applicability to this case.\n\n                                1.\n\n          We review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal based on the insufficiency of the evidence.       United\n\nStates v. Hatch, 434 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).      A motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal is only granted if \"the evidence and all\n\nreasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence, both taken in\n\nthe light most favorable to the government, are insufficient for a\n\nrational factfinder to conclude that the prosecution has proven,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, each of the elements of the offense.\"\n\nUnited States v. Pimental, 380 F.3d 575, 583 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          To determine whether Upton's motion for acquittal based\n\non the statute of limitations should have been granted, we look\n\nbackward from the date of the superseding indictment and assess\n\nwhether the evidence, taken in the light most hospitable to the\n\nverdict, was such that the jury could reasonably have concluded\n\nthat the conspiracy did not end until May 12, 1999 or later.    See\n\nUnited States v. Walsh, 928 F.2d 7, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1991).      The\n\nquestion boils down to whether the jury could have supportably\n\nfound that either or both of the tax offenses that Upton committed\n\nin 2000 were part of the conspiracy, and the wrinkle is Upton's\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fassertion that Grunewald requires us to view the tax violations as\n\nacts of cover-up beyond the scope of the conspiracy.\n\n              A conspiracy endures as long as the co-conspirators\n\nendeavor      to   attain    the   \"central     criminal     purposes\"    of   the\n\nconspiracy.        Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 401.              In this case, the\n\nindictment charged that Upton and Alberico conspired to violate 18\n\nU.S.C.   §§    1956(a)(1)(B)       and   1957(a).        Section   1956(a)(1)(B)\n\nprohibits engaging in financial transactions involving the proceeds\n\nof unlawful activities:\n\n                     knowing   that   the  transaction   is\n              designed in whole or in part–-\n                     (i) to conceal or disguise the nature,\n              the location, the source, the ownership, or\n              the control of the proceeds of specified\n              unlawful activity ...\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B) (emphasis supplied).                 The focus of the\n\nprohibition is thus trained on the design to conceal or disguise.\n\nThe   concealment     feature      distinguishes     §    1956(a)(1)(B)   from   §\n\n1957(a).       Section      1957(a)   prohibits     monetary   transactions      in\n\ncriminally derived property, but does not contain an element of\n\nconcealment or disguise.\n\n              The Supreme Court has recently examined language in §\n\n1956(a)(2) that is identical to the language of the section at\n\nissue in this case, § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).                  In Cuellar, 128 S. Ct.\n\n1994, the Court considered whether certain conduct violated §\n\n1956(a)(2)'s proscription against \"transportation\" of proceeds with\n\nknowledge that the transportation was designed to conceal or\n\n                                         -13-\n\fdisguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the\n\nproceeds. The Court emphasized that in the phrase \"designed ... to\n\nconceal or disguise,\" \"'design' means purpose or plan\"; i.e., the\n\nintended aim of the transportation.          128 S. Ct. at 2003.       As the\n\npertinent language of § 1956(a)(1)(B) is identical to that of §\n\n1956(a)(2)(B), we conclude that Congress's use of \"designed ... to\n\nconceal or disguise\" in (a)(1)(B) likewise requires the government\n\nto prove that there was a purpose or plan to conceal or disguise.\n\nSee    Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., 513 U.S. 561, 562 (1995) (\"The\n\nnormal rule of statutory construction [is] that identical words\n\nused in different parts of the same Act are intended to have the\n\nsame meaning.\"); see also Finnegan v. Leu, 456 U.S. 431, 438 n.9\n\n(1982) (noting that \"if Congress had intended identical language to\n\nhave substantially different meanings in different sections of the\n\nsame enactment it would have manifested its intention in some\n\nconcrete fashion.\").\n\n            The   conspiracy   count   in    the    indictment    explicitly\n\ninvoked the concealment money laundering prohibition of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§    1956(a)(1)(B),   charging   Upton     with   the   intent   to   conceal\n\nmaterial characteristics of the stolen money.               The indictment\n\nalleged, as the \"manner and means\" of carrying out the conspiracy,\n\nthat the defendants used the stolen monies to make the multi-\n\nlayered purchase of 89 Iyanough Road in August of 1997; that Upton\n\ncommingled additional theft proceeds with business receipts of Look\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fMotors on more than twenty occasions during the remainder of 1997;\n\nthat Alberico filed a false tax return for 1997 in 1998 that did\n\nnot disclose the theft income or her rental income from the\n\nIyanough road property; and that:\n\n           \"It   was   part   of  the   conspiracy   that\n           [defendants] attempted to conceal or disguise\n           the nature, location, source, ownership, or\n           control of the illegal cash proceeds by\n           failing to file income tax returns, or declare\n           a capital gain from the sale of the commercial\n           property, for the tax year 1999 [and Upton\n           attempted to conceal or disguise] by filing a\n           materially false federal income tax return . .\n           . that failed to declare the receipt of the\n           illegal income or the rental income from the\n           property in 1997.\"\n\n           The indictment thus put Upton on notice, at a minimum,\n\nthat his concealment of the capital gain from the sale of 89\n\nIyanough Road was part and parcel of the alleged means of carrying\n\nout the charged conspiracy.5        To sustain its burden of proof, the\n\ngovernment had to establish that Upton conspired to engage in\n\ntransactions with the intended aim of concealing or disguising\n\ncertain attributes of the funds involved. And to avoid the statute\n\nof limitations bar, it also had to prove that one of the tax\n\noffenses   was   in   furtherance   of   the   central   objective   of   the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n\n5\n  The indictment did not expressly allege the sale of the Iyanough\nRoad property in January 1999 as a money laundering transaction,\nbut as we have noted, the indictment did allege that the\nconcealment of capital gain on the sale was part of the conspiracy.\nIn any event, Upton does not make any claim of variance and does\nnot contest that the sale was part of the conspiratorial object.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f          Determining the contours of the conspiracy ordinarily is\n\na factual matter entrusted largely to the jury.   United States v.\n\nMoran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir. 1993).    Consistent with the\n\nallegations in the indictment, the government introduced evidence\n\nthat Upton and Alberico purchased the 89 Iyanough Road property in\n\nAugust 1997 and sold it in January 1999.   The pair converted cash\n\ninto cashier's checks to finance the initial purchase of the\n\nproperty, set up the sham mortgage, and took title in the name of\n\n\"AU Trust.\"    Upton commingled additional theft proceeds with\n\nbusiness income.   Alberico filed a false 1997 tax return, omitting\n\nthe theft proceeds and rental income.   Neither Upton nor Alberico\n\nfiled tax returns for 1999 -- the year in which they were required\n\nto report a capital gain on the sale.\n\n          From this evidence the jury reasonably could have found\n\nthat Upton's failure to file the 1999 return was in furtherance of\n\nthe central objective of the conspiracy.    Specifically, the jury\n\nsupportably could have concluded that the failure to file his 1999\n\nreturn in the ordinary course facilitated the concealment aim of\n\nthe money laundering transactions.    That act of omission may have\n\nhad special significance to the jury, because in his 1999 return\n\nUpton was required to disclose not only any rental receipts but\n\nalso the capital gain he realized on the sale of the property.   The\n\njury may have also found it significant that Alberico, too, did not\n\nfile a return for 1999, contrary to her practice in previous years.\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fThe capital gains disclosures they were required to make easily\n\ncould have unraveled the entire money-laundering scheme, not only\n\nsubjecting   them   to   prosecution,   but   also   resulting   in   the\n\nforfeiture of the proceeds.    See 18 U.S.C. § 981(a).    Avoiding such\n\nan outcome, whereby their use of the proceeds would be thwarted,\n\nwas a primary goal of the concealment money laundering conspiracy,\n\nor so the jury could have found.6\n\n                                  2.\n\n          In the face of this evidence, Upton argues that the\n\nGrunewald imposes a limitation on the ability of subsequent acts of\n\n\n\n\n6\n  The government says that Upton's filing in 2000 of a false 1997\nreturn was also an act in furtherance of the conspiracy. It may\nhave been, although the act occurred more than two years after\nUpton would have been expected to file a return, and almost two\nyears after his coconspirator Alberico similarly filed a false\nreturn. We need not definitively resolve whether that Upton's false\nfiling was in furtherance of the conspiracy. The evidence of the\nconspirators' parallel failures to file 1999 tax returns was\nsufficient for the jury to conclude that the conspiracy lasted at\nleast until May 12, 1999. But that does not by any stretch render\nUpton's 2000 filing irrelevant.    At a minimum, the fact of the\nfalse filing was admissible to show, and was strong evidence of,\nUpton's knowledge that the 1997 purchase was designed to conceal\ncharacteristics of the unlawful proceeds. In addition, coming as\nit did in the same time frame as Upton's failure to file a tax\nreturn for 1999, his guilty knowledge associated with the June 2000\nfalse filing solidifies the inference that the reason for the\nfailure to file was in fact to prevent discovery of the money\nlaundering conspiracy. The 1997 returns filed by both conspirators\nwere false in that they did not disclose the receipt of the stolen\nfunds. Pointedly, they also failed to disclose the rental income\nfrom the Iyanough Road property, further cementing the inference\nthat ownership of that property was part of a design to disguise or\nconceal.\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fconcealment to extend the life of a conspiracy.7   At bottom, as we\n\nhave noted, the argument is that acts that constitute an attempt to\n\ncover up a completed crime do not extend the duration of the\n\nconspiracy.   See Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 401 (it is not enough that\n\nthe defendants \"took care to cover up their crime in order to\n\nescape detection and punishment\"). According to Upton, his failure\n\nto file a 1999 tax return and his July 2000 filing of a false 1997\n\ntax return were, at most, attempts to cover up completed financial\n\ntransactions, namely, the buying and selling of the Iyanough Road\n\nproperty in August 1997 and January 1999.      Thus, he maintains,\n\nunder Grunewald the acts of concealment represented by the two tax\n\noffenses could not extend the life of the conspiracy.   In support\n\nof this argument, Upton cites United States v. LaSpina, 299 F.3d\n\n165, 176 (2d Cir. 2002), for the proposition that a conspiracy with\n\nan economic transaction as its objective lasts only until the\n\n\"anticipated economic benefits\" of that transaction are received.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n7\n  In Grunewald, decided under the general conspiracy statute, 18\nU.S.C. § 371,the defendants had been charged with conspiracy in\nconnection with a scheme to obtain \"no prosecution\" rulings by\nbribing an IRS official in two discrete tax cases. Based primarily\non a concern that the statute of limitations otherwise would be\nopen-ended, the Court concluded that later acts of cover-up did not\nextend the duration of the conspiracy. Subsequently, in Forman v.\nUnited States, the Court held a conspiracy to have continued into\nthe relevant limitations period, where the indictment alleged that\nthe conspiracy included the acts of concealment, and where the\nconcealment was necessary for the successful completion of the\nscheme. 361 U.S. 416, 423-24 (1960).\n\n                               -18-\n\f             If covering up a completed conspiracy to violate 18\n\nU.S.C.   §    1957(a),    by   engaging     in    monetary     transactions     in\n\ncriminally derived property, were all that the two tax offenses\n\naccomplished, the argument might have merit.             Here, however, as we\n\nhave noted, Upton was also charged with conspiring to violate §\n\n1956(a)(1)(B) by engaging in financial transactions designed to\n\nconceal or disguise certain characteristics of the proceeds of\n\nunlawful activity.       The objective of the conspiracy was more than\n\nthe   specific   monetary      transactions      of   buying   and    selling   89\n\nIyanough Road.     The objective was to engage in concealment money\n\nlaundering in order to obscure the illicit source of the funds and\n\nthe conspirators' continued control of the proceeds.                 Accordingly,\n\nUpton's argument fails to gain traction.8\n\n             To be sure, in some cases the crime of concealment money\n\nlaundering may be completed at the time the transaction itself is\n\nconsummated.     In this case, for example, there was a wealth of\n\nevidence that the purchase of the Iyanough Road property in 1997\n\nconstituted concealment money laundering.              But that the evidence\n\nmight have shown that the 1997 purchase of property constituted\n\nconcealment money laundering does not mean that the conspiracy to\n\n\n\n8\n  Upton's citation to LaSpina is inapposite. The conspiracy in\nLaSpina differed materially from the conspiracy in this case.\nLaSpina involved a conspiracy whose purpose was to engage in\nmonetary transactions in criminally derived property, in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a). The reasoning in LaSpina thus applies to\nconspiracies without an element of concealment.\n\n                                     -19-\n\fcommit concealment money laundering ceased at that time or, for\n\nthat matter, with the sale of the property in 1999.9\n\n            Where, as we have established is the case here, the\n\nsubstantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy has the\n\nintent to conceal as an element, the success of the conspiracy\n\nitself may depend on further concealment. Consequently, additional\n\nacts   of   concealment   that   facilitate   the    central   aim    of    the\n\nconspiracy are in furtherance of the conspiracy. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Goldberg, 105 F.3d 770, 774 (1997) (acts of tax evasion\n\nwere \"integral and self-evident part of\" fraud conspiracy charged\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 371); United States v. Mann, 161 F.3d 840, 859\n\n(5th Cir. 1998) (acts designed to frustrate regulatory oversight\n\nwere \"central\" to conspiracy involving fraud within savings and\n\nloan institution); United States v. Esacove, 943 F.2d 3, 5 (5th\n\nCir. 1991) (acts designed to protect money laundering conspiracy\n\nagainst     government    investigation   held      \"necessary\"      part   of\n\nconspiracy).    And, as noted above, the jury was entitled to infer\n\nthat the conspirators' parallel failures to file tax returns for\n\n\n9\n  In Grunewald, the court observed that subsequent acts of\nconcealment may well facilitate the success of the substantive\ncrime and thus be in furtherance of the conspiracy, as when a car\nthief repaints the stolen vehicle. 353 U.S. at 405. The purpose\nof concealment money laundering is to make proceeds appear\nlegitimate, especially to the government.          Preventing the\nauthorities from discovering the illicit nature of the proceeds, by\nconcealing the existence or financial impact of the money\nlaundering transactions, is as much a part of the ongoing\nconspiracy to launder money as repainting the car is a part of a\ntheft conspiracy.\n\n                                   -20-\n\f1999 were part of an ongoing plan to engage in concealment money\n\nlaundering, rather than merely being later attempts to cover up a\n\ncompleted crime.       See United States v. Dazey, 403 F.3d 1147, 1159\n\n(10th   Cir.   2005)    (\"[T]he   jury   may   infer   conspiracy   from   the\n\ndefendants' conduct and other circumstantial evidence indicating\n\ncoordination and concert of action.\").\n\n                                     3.\n\n           Upton presents another argument.            Even assuming that he\n\nengaged in acts of concealment that could be considered to be in\n\nfurtherance of the main objectives of the conspiracy, no conspiracy\n\ncould have existed in this case because he and Alberico never\n\nexpressly agreed to engage in acts of concealment.              The Court's\n\ndecision in Grunewald, he posits, requires that the government\n\npresent proof of defendant's express agreement to conceal.                 See\n\nUnited States v. Twitty, 72 F.3d 228, 234 (1st Cir. 1999).                 The\n\ngovernment, Upton contends, failed to present such evidence.                In\n\nfact, Upton argues that the record evidence actually supports his\n\ncontention that no such express agreement existed and that, as a\n\nresult, any acts of concealment were undertaken unilaterally. This\n\nis because the record indicates that, by the summer of 1999, he and\n\nAlberico were estranged.\n\n           Upton's argument misses the point.             In Grunewald, the\n\nCourt drew a distinction between \"acts of concealment done in\n\nfurtherance of the main objectives of the conspiracy,\" and \"acts of\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fconcealment done after these central objectives have been attained\n\nfor the purposes of covering up after the crime.\"                353 U.S. at 405.\n\nWhere the latter is involved, the government must present some\n\nproof of an express original agreement to engage in the acts of\n\nconcealment.     See Twitty, 72 F.3d at 234.          However, nothing in the\n\ncase law imposes a requirement that conspirators expressly agree to\n\nengage   in    acts   of    concealment     where   those      acts    are   done     in\n\nfurtherance of the main objectives of the conspiracy.10 Rather, the\n\nacts of concealment committed by one co-conspirator need only have\n\nbeen \"foreseeable\" to the other co-conspirator.                 See United States\n\nv. Hansen, 434 F.3d 92, 103 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.\n\nPinillos-Prieto, 419 F.3d 61, 69 (1st Cir 2005).\n\n              Here, as established above, a reasonable jury could\n\nconclude that the acts of concealment in this case, specifically\n\nthe failure of Upton and Alberico to file 1999 tax returns, were\n\ndone in furtherance of the main objectives of the conspiracy.\n\nAnd, moreover, these acts would have plainly been foreseeable to\n\nboth   conspirators.         Not   filing   returns      was    an    \"integral      and\n\nself-evident     part      of\"   the   conspiracy   --    had    either      Upton   or\n\nAlberico not hidden the proceeds of the house sale, this would have\n\n\n\n\n10\n  In fact, cases like Mann, 161 F.3d at 859 and Davis, 623 F.2d at\n192 indicate that no such requirement exists.\n\n                                        -22-\n\fdefeated the primary purpose of the conspiracy. Goldberg, 105 F.3d\n\nat 774.11\n\n                                     4.\n\n            In his final attempt at excluding the tax offenses from\n\nconsideration, Upton suggests that his estrangement from Alberico\n\nin the summer of 1999, alluded to above, amounted to a withdrawal\n\nfrom the conspiracy.    This argument is waived.        See United States\n\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to\n\nin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\").          In any event, the standard\n\nfor recognizing a conspirator's withdrawal from a conspiracy is\n\nexacting.     Even   were   this   argument   not   waived,   Upton   cannot\n\ndemonstrate his withdrawal from the conspiracy.         See United States\n\nv. Dunn, 758 F.2d 30, 38 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"[A] conspirator must act\n\naffirmatively to either defeat or disavow the purpose of the\n\n\n\n\n11\n  Although it is unnecessary to our analysis, we note further that\na reasonable jury could have concluded that Upton and Alberico had\nexpressly agreed to engage in acts of concealment.      Upton and\nAlberico acted in tandem when they both failed to file returns in\n1999. This concerted activity is circumstantial evidence that an\nexpress agreement to conceal was in place.\n     Of course, Upton and Alberico did not act in complete concert\nat all times. For example, in 1998 Alberico filed a false return\nfor 1997 omitting the stolen Queen money, whereas Upton waited\nuntil 2000 to file a false return for 1997.        But that other\nevidence conceivably supports the absence of an express agreement\nto conceal is not dispositive in this sufficiency of the evidence\ncase. See United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 2006)\n(\"[C]ompeting inferences are not enough to disturb a jury's\nverdict\").\n\n                                    -23-\n\fconspiracy\"; mere disagreement with co-conspirators is insufficient\n\nto constitute withdrawal.).12\n\n                           C.   Hearsay Evidence\n\n           Upton argues that the district court erred in admitting\n\nas an excited utterance Queen's hearsay statement to his friend\n\nJanet Hoell that \"the money was gone\" on the night of the theft of\n\nthe suitcase.   Fed. R. Evid. 803(2) creates an exception to the\n\nrule against hearsay for \"[a] statement relating to a startling\n\nevent or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of\n\nexcitement caused by the event or condition.\"         Upton contends that\n\nbecause six hours elapsed between the startling event -- the\n\ndisappearance   of   the   suitcase   full   of    money   --   and   Queen's\n\nstatement to Hoell, the statement could not have been made while\n\nQueen was \"under the stress of excitement\" of the loss of the\n\nmoney.   Fed. R. Evid. 803(2).\n\n\n\n12\n   Upton does present an additional argument that merits only\nsummary treatment. He contends that, for statute of limitation\npurposes, the indictment in this case barred consideration of his\ntax crimes because it failed to: (1) allege that he and Alberico\nagreed to commit those tax crimes and (2) charge him with\nconspiring to commit money laundering with the intent to evade\ntaxes or file a false return in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n1956(a)(1)(A)(ii). \"[A]n indictment is sufficient if it, first,\ncontains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a\ndefendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second,\nenables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future\nprosecutions for the same offense.\" United States v. Cianci, 378\nF.3d 71, 81 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation and internal quotations\nomitted).    A review of the indictment in this case makes plain\nthat the indictment's language was sufficient to put Upton on\nnotice of the conspiracy charge against him.\n\n                                    -24-\n\f              We review the admission of evidence after an objection\n\nfor an abuse of discretion.         See United States v. Garcia, 452 F.3d\n\n36, 38 (1st Cir. 2006).       We will only vacate a jury verdict if an\n\nimproperly admitted statement was not harmless -- that is, if its\n\nadmission \"'likely affected the outcome of trial.'\"            United States\n\nv. Castellini, 392 F.3d 35, 52 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136, 141 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n              If the admission of the statement was error at all, which\n\nwe needn't decide, it was harmless for two reasons.                First, the\n\nstatement      itself   likely   did    little    to   influence   the   jury.\n\nConspiracy to commit concealment money laundering involves an\n\nagreement to conceal the nature of proceeds that were unlawfully\n\nobtained.      Here, in order to prove the element that the proceeds\n\nhad been illegally obtained, the government had to show that Upton\n\nstole the money that he subsequently laundered.            Queen's statement\n\ndoes not demonstrate that the money was even stolen, much less that\n\nUpton was the one who stole it.               While Queen's statement does\n\nprovide support for the idea that the money disappeared from the\n\ntrunk of the car during a specific time frame, it does not\n\nimplicate Upton.\n\n              Second, the government presented plenty of evidence that\n\nUpton did in fact steal the money.            Upton's friend Phidias Dantos\n\ntestified that Queen accused Upton of stealing the money shortly\n\nafter   the    theft    occurred.      More   significantly,   Colleen    Otto\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\ftestified that Alberico told her that Alberico and Upton had taken\n\nthe money, and Edwin Jones testified that Upton revealed to him\n\nthat he had stolen the money. Look Motors's bookkeeper, Lucy Webb,\n\ntestified that Upton declined to tell her where he got the money to\n\npurchase 89 Iyanough Road, saying that he wanted to \"maintain her\n\ninnocence.\"       And   the   additional    evidence     of    Upton's   money\n\nlaundering activities provided strong support for the inference\n\nthat he and Alberico had obtained a large sum of money around the\n\ntime the suitcase was stolen from Queen.             If it was anything,\n\nQueen's statement was merely icing on the cake.\n\n           Upton nevertheless contends that the admission of Queen's\n\nstatement cannot constitute harmless error. He argues that Queen's\n\nstatement bolstered the testimony of Otto and Jones, witnesses who\n\nhe says were in need of bolstering because of their dubious\n\ncredibility.13    There are two problems with this argument.             First,\n\nthe bolstering complaint applies only to Otto and Jones.                 As we\n\nhave explained, the testimony of Otto and Jones was not the only\n\nevidence indicating that Upton stole the money from Queen. Second,\n\nin   addition    to   credibility   being   a   matter   for    the   jury   to\n\ndetermine, it is doubtful that the credibility of Otto and Jones\n\n\n13\n  Upton challenges Jones's credibility in two aspects: Jones was\nserving time on drug charges and testified in return for a\nreduction in his sentence; and, Jones may have been seeking revenge\nagainst Upton because Upton tipped off the police to Jones's drug\ndealing activities several years ago.       Upton also challenges\nAlberico's comments to Otto as potentially motivated by a desire to\nincriminate Upton following their breakup.\n\n                                    -26-\n\fneeded bolstering from Queen's statement in any event.                       Their\n\ntestimony was supported by other evidence.                Otto's testimony that\n\nAlberico admitted that she and Upton took the suitcase of money to\n\na   hotel   was     supported    by   hotel     records   introduced    at   trial\n\nrevealing that Upton rented a hotel room for two people on the\n\nnight Queen returned from Florida.              Otto's further testimony that\n\nAlberico said she had spent part of her share of the money during\n\na trip to Italy was corroborated by airline and credit card records\n\nshowing that Alberico was in Italy during February 1999.                     Jones\n\ntestified that in 1997 Upton gave him cash from a \"shoebox full of\n\nmoney\" and that the money \"looked old\" and was dated from the\n\n1950s; this description is consistent with the proposition that the\n\nmoney   was    earned     by   Queen's    father    throughout    his   life   and\n\nsubsequently stored in a safe deposit box.\n\n              In short, Queen's statement to Hoell is cumulative of\n\nother evidence in the record.            Regardless of whether admitting the\n\nstatement as an excited utterance may have been error, any such\n\nerror was harmless.\n\n              For   the   reasons     expressed    above,   we   uphold   Upton's\n\nconviction.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                          -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\f           LIPEZ,     Circuit   Judge,     dissenting         in    part.         The\n\nrelationship between the concealment at issue in Upton's conspiracy\n\nto commit money laundering and the concealment associated with his\n\nsubsequent tax crimes is complex.              The majority misapplies the\n\nrelevant legal principles and, consequently, wrongly concludes that\n\nUpton's failure to file a 1999 tax return was conduct within the\n\nscope of the money laundering conspiracy.                  In so doing, the\n\nmajority embraces the government's misguided attempt to remedy a\n\nstatute of limitations problem by stretching the money laundering\n\nconspiracy   beyond    its   justifiable       limits    to    include      Upton's\n\nindependent tax crime.\n\n           As the majority notes, the district court had dismissed\n\nbefore trial, on statute of limitations grounds, counts alleging\n\nmoney   laundering,    structuring,      and    conspiracy         to    engage   in\n\nstructuring.   To salvage its money laundering conspiracy charge,\n\nthe   government    sidestepped   the     Supreme       Court's      teaching     in\n\nGrunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391 (1957), which – given the\n\nevidence presented – bars treating the tax fraud as conduct that\n\nfurthered the conspiracy.       If, as Grunewald requires, Upton's tax\n\nevasion were eliminated from the scope of the conspiracy, no act in\n\nfurtherance of the money laundering scheme would fall within the\n\nfive-year statute of limitations period – and the jury's guilty\n\nverdict on the conspiracy count could not stand.                        Because the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fmajority's decision to uphold the verdict conflicts with the\n\ngoverning precedent, I respectfully dissent.14\n\n                                    I.\n\n           In   Grunewald,   the   Supreme     Court   drew   a   distinction\n\nbetween acts of concealment that furthered a charged conspiracy and\n\nsubsequent acts of concealment done \"for the purpose only of\n\ncovering up after the crime.\"       Id. at 405.        If the acts at issue\n\nwere of the latter type – i.e., they did not further \"the main\n\ncriminal objectives of the conspiracy\" – the concealment would not\n\nextend the duration of the conspiracy for purposes of the statute\n\nof limitations.    Id.; see also United States v. Twitty, 72 F.3d\n\n228, 233 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           That distinction, the Court explained, was governed by\n\n\"important considerations of policy\" that hearkened back to prior\n\ncases   \"repeatedly   warn[ing]    that   we   will    view   with   disfavor\n\nattempts to broaden the already pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of\n\nconspiracy prosecutions.\" Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 404.                Routinely\n\nviewing concealment efforts as part of a conspiracy would \"wipe out\n\nthe statute of limitations in conspiracy cases\" and \"result in a\n\ngreat widening of the scope of conspiracy prosecutions\" because\n\n\"every conspiracy will inevitably be followed by actions taken to\n\n\n\n14\n   My objections to the majority's reasoning also apply to its\ndecision in the separate appeal of Upton's co-defendant, Alberico,\nwho also challenged her conviction for conspiracy to commit money\nlaundering on statute of limitations grounds.\n\n                                   -29-\n\fcover the conspirators' traces.\"             Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 402.\n\nHence, the Court rejected \"the proposition that the duration of a\n\nconspiracy   can    be   indefinitely    lengthened   merely    because   the\n\nconspiracy is kept a secret, and merely because the conspirators\n\ntake steps to bury their traces, in order to avoid detection and\n\npunishment   after       the   central     criminal   purpose     has     been\n\naccomplished.\"      Id. at 405.\n\n             Thus, if Upton's tax evasion were conduct designed to\n\ncover up the money laundering conspiracy after the crime had been\n\naccomplished,      rather   than   conduct    undertaken   to   further   the\n\nconspiracy's central criminal purpose – laundering the stolen money\n\n– the money laundering conspiracy charge would be time-barred. Two\n\npossible theories, however, could support a conclusion that the\n\nfailure to file a 1999 tax return furthered the charged conspiracy\n\nfor purposes of the statute of limitations. First, if the evidence\n\nshowed that the conspiracy embraced \"an express original agreement\n\namong the conspirators to continue to act in concert in order to\n\ncover up\" the crime, those acts of concealment could \"properly be\n\nregarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"             Id. at 404, 397.\n\nIn such instances, the cover-up would be not only foreseeable – as\n\nit would be with all crimes – but the explicit objective of \"a\n\nsubsidiary conspiracy to conceal.\"           Id. at 402.\n\n          Second, the tax fraud would be within the scope of the\n\nmoney laundering conspiracy if it could be viewed as an act of\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fconcealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objective of\n\nthe conspiracy.     In Grunewald, the defendants had fraudulently\n\nobtained \"no prosecution\" rulings from the Bureau of Internal\n\nRevenue on behalf of two companies seeking to avoid tax evasion\n\ncharges, and the defendants later took steps to conceal their\n\nfraudulent activity.    Id. at 395-96.     The Supreme Court observed\n\nthat the \"no prosecution\" rulings obtained in 1948 and 1949 had\n\nbeen the main objective of the conspiracy presented to the jury,\n\nand the subsequent efforts to conceal the irregularities – the\n\nconduct occurring within the statute of limitations period – could\n\nonly have been for the purpose of avoiding apprehension, rather\n\nthan to further the conspiracy's already completed objective.            Id.\n\nat 405-06.    The Court acknowledged, however, that some acts of\n\nconcealment are so closely linked in time and purpose to the\n\naccomplishment of the conspiracy that they are \"in furtherance of\n\nthe objectives of the conspiracy itself.\"        Id. at 405.   The Court\n\ncited the concealment of kidnappers who hide while awaiting ransom\n\nand the repainting of a stolen car as instances in which \"the\n\nsuccessful accomplishment of the crime necessitates concealment.\"\n\nId.\n\n           The majority premises its analysis primarily on the\n\nsecond   theory,   concluding   that   \"[n]ot   filing   returns   was    an\n\n'integral and self-evident part of' the conspiracy,\" but it asserts\n\nin a footnote that a reasonable jury could have concluded as well\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fthat Upton and Alberico had expressly agreed to engage in acts of\n\nconcealment.    I therefore consider both theories, looking first at\n\nthe possibility of an express agreement to conceal.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            In asserting that the conspiracy in this case embraced\n\nthe acts of concealment in the aftermath of the money laundering\n\ntransactions, the majority emphasizes that, pursuant to the money\n\nlaundering statute, the indictment charged Upton with conspiring\n\n\"to conceal or disguise,\" inter alia, the source and control of the\n\nstolen $900,000.      See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B).15       The majority\n\nconcludes    that,   because   of   this   concealment   language,   \"[t]he\n\nobjective of the conspiracy was more than the specific monetary\n\ntransactions of buying and selling 89 Iyanough Road,\" but included\n\nthe purpose \"to obscure the illicit source of the funds and the\n\nconspirators' continued control of the proceeds.\" It reasons that,\n\nbecause the money laundering crime that was the objective of the\n\n\n\n15\n     That provision states, in relevant part:\n\n       (a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a\n       financial transaction represents the proceeds of some\n       form of unlawful activity, conducts . . . such a\n       financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds\n       of specified unlawful activity––\n             (B) knowing that the transaction is designed in\n       whole or in part––\n             (i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location,\n       the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds\n       of specified unlawful activity . . . .\n       shall    be    sentenced   to   a   fine    .   .   .   or\n       imprisonment . . . .\n\n                                    -32-\n\fconspiracy included a concealment element, the tax fraud was within\n\nthe conspiracy's scope.\n\n             The concealment element in the money laundering statute\n\ndoes not, however, bring within the scope of the money laundering\n\nconspiracy all conduct undertaken by the defendants to conceal the\n\ntheft   of   the   $900,000.    The   concealment    element   of   section\n\n1956(a)(1)(B) goes to the defendant's state-of-mind when engaging\n\nin the prohibited transactions.        The statute makes unlawful the\n\nconduct of a financial transaction \"knowing that the transaction is\n\ndesigned in whole or in part . . . to conceal or disguise\" the\n\norigin or control of unlawfully obtained property. In other words,\n\nthe jury in this case had to find that Upton conspired to commit\n\nmoney laundering transactions that were undertaken for the purpose\n\nof concealing the crime from which the laundered proceeds were\n\nderived (here, the theft of the $900,000). The statutory state-of-\n\nmind requirement does not, however, transform subsequent acts of\n\nconcealment that do not involve financial transactions – whether\n\ndesigned to hide the money laundering activity or, like the money\n\nlaundering itself, to hide the original theft – into conduct that\n\nis within the money laundering conspiracy.\n\n             Under Grunewald, efforts to conceal the money laundering\n\nconspiracy    after   the   conspiracy's   primary   aim   (the   deceptive\n\nfinancial transactions) has been achieved may be included within\n\nthe scope of the conspiracy only if the evidence permits the jury\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fto   find   that    the   defendants'    \"original      agreement\"     explicitly\n\nincluded a subsidiary objective to cover up their crime.                       See\n\nGrunewald, 353 U.S. at 404 (emphasis added). In other words, there\n\nmust be some evidence of an agreement between the defendants,\n\nentered into before they commit the crime that is the object of the\n\nconspiracy, to continue to act jointly to cover up their unlawful\n\nactivity. Only where there is such a pre-crime agreement will acts\n\nof   covering      up   after   the   crime    reveal   \"more   than    that   the\n\nconspirators do not wish to be apprehended – a concomitant . . . of\n\nevery crime since Cain attempted to conceal the murder of Abel from\n\nthe Lord.\"      Id. at 406.\n\n            As in Grunewald, \"[t]here is not a shred of direct\n\nevidence in this record to show anything like an express original\n\nagreement among the conspirators to continue to act in concert in\n\norder to cover up, for their own self-protection, traces of the\n\ncrime after its commission.\"          Id. at 404.       Nor does the fact that\n\nboth Upton and Alberico failed to file 1999 tax returns reporting\n\nthe gain earned from the stolen funds constitute indirect evidence\n\nof such an agreement to conceal.              The Supreme Court in Grunewald\n\nunequivocally held that such post-crime evidence was insufficient\n\nto show the required pre-crime agreement:\n\n            [A] conspiracy to conceal is being implied [by\n            the government] from elements which will be\n            present in virtually every conspiracy case,\n            that   is,  secrecy   plus   overt   acts   of\n            concealment. . . .\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\f           Acts of covering up, even though done in the\n           context of a mutually understood need for\n           secrecy, cannot themselves constitute proof\n           that concealment of the crime after its\n           commission was part of the initial agreement\n           among the conspirators.\n\nId. at 404, 402; see also SEC v. Papa, No. 08-1172, Slip op. at 11-\n\n12 (1st Cir. Feb. 6, 2009) (noting that \"an agreement to conceal\n\nafter the fact could be viewed as inherent in a conspiracy or any\n\nwrongful fraudulent scheme[,] but then all covert joint wrongdoing\n\nwould be a permanently continuing offense . . . an approach that\n\nthe Supreme Court has rejected\"); United States v. Goldberg, 105\n\nF.3d 770, 773 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that \"mere collateral\n\neffects   of    jointly    agreed-to     activity,    even    if   generally\n\nforeseeable, are not mechanically to be treated as an object of the\n\nconspiracy\"); id. at 774 (noting that, in the case of a band of\n\nbank   robbers,   \"[a]ll   know   that    the   agreed-upon   robbery   will\n\ngenerate 'income' that none of the robbers will report[, y]et it\n\nwould be straining to describe interference with the IRS as a\n\npurpose or object of the conspiracy\").               The inference of an\n\noriginal agreement to conceal is particularly unwarranted here\n\ngiven that, as the majority acknowledges, Upton and Alberico did\n\nnot consistently act in tandem following the money laundering.\n\nAlberico filed a false return for 1997 that omitted the stolen\n\n$900,000, while Upton filed his false return for that year in 2000.\n\n               In sum, \"the essential missing element is a showing\n\nthat the act [of concealment] was done in furtherance of a prior\n\n                                   -35-\n\fcriminal agreement among the conspirators.\" Grunewald, 353 U.S. at\n\n404 n.16.   Because there is no evidence permitting the jury to find\n\nthat    Upton   and    Alberico   entered    into   an   \"express    original\n\nagreement\" to cover up their money laundering activity, the tax\n\nfraud may not be considered within the scope of the conspiracy on\n\nthat basis.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            Nor can the failure to file the 1999 tax return be viewed\n\nas an act of concealment done in furtherance of the main objective\n\nof the money laundering conspiracy.            Although tax evasion is a\n\nforeseeable     consequence     of   virtually   every    financial       crime,\n\nGoldberg, 105 F.3d at 773, it is not inevitably within the scope of\n\nevery conspiracy to commit such crimes.          The question is whether,\n\nconsistent with the second theory permitted by Grunewald, the jury\n\ncould   find    that   \"the   successful    accomplishment   of     the    crime\n\nnecessitate[d]\" that act of concealment.16          Id. at 405.\n\n\n16\n  Count Four of the indictment alleged the following tax-related\nconduct by Upton as part of the money laundering conspiracy:\n\n            5. It was a part of the conspiracy that defendants\n       George L. Upton and Lynn M. Alberico attempted to conceal\n       or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or\n       control of the illegal cash proceeds by failing to file\n       income tax returns, or declare a capital gain from the\n       sale of the commercial property, for the tax year 1999.\n            6. It was a part of the conspiracy that George L.\n       Upton attempted to conceal or disguise the nature,\n       location, source, ownership, or control of the illegal\n       cash proceeds by filing a materially false federal income\n       tax return in or about July 2000 that failed to declare\n       the receipt of the illegal income or the rental income\n\n                                     -36-\n\f             The majority states that, because the purpose of the\n\nmoney   laundering       conspiracy   was    to    conceal      the    Queen      theft,\n\n\"additional acts of concealment that facilitate the central aim of\n\nthe conspiracy are in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" The majority\n\nasserts that the tax evasion meets this description: \"[C]oncealing\n\nthe   existence     or    financial   impact       of     the   money    laundering\n\ntransactions[] is as much a part of the ongoing conspiracy to\n\nlaunder     money   as   repainting    the    car    is    a    part    of    a    theft\n\nconspiracy.\"\n\n             This   case    does   not,     however,       involve     an     \"ongoing\n\nconspiracy\" that allegedly was intended to last beyond the set of\n\ntransactions that laundered the stolen $900,000. Such a continuous\n\nconspiracy was described in United States v. Gardiner, 463 F.3d\n\n445, 463 (6th Cir. 2006), where the court discussed crimes with\n\n\"'no specific terminating event'\" – such as a conspiracy to fix\n\ncourt cases or generalized loan-sharking activity – in which mid-\n\nconspiracy concealment is necessary for the scheme to continue.\n\nSee   id.   (recognizing      that,   \"[i]n       conspiracies        where    a    main\n\nobjective has not been attained or abandoned and concealment is\n\n\n\n      from the property in 1997.\n\nThe government argues that Upton's filing of a false return for\n1997 also was an act in furtherance of the conspiracy, although the\nmajority does not rely on that conduct.      I would have the same\nobjections to any such reliance as I do for Upton's failure to file\nthe 1999 return.\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fessential to success of that objective, attempts to conceal the\n\nconspiracy are made in furtherance of the conspiracy\") (citation\n\nomitted); see also United States v. Esacove, 943 F.2d 3, 5 (5th\n\nCir. 1991) (noting that \"'concealment is sometimes a necessary part\n\nof a conspiracy'\" to \"'protect it from those investigative agencies\n\nwhich threatened its continuation'\" (quoting United States v. Del\n\nValle, 587 F.2d 699, 704 (5th Cir. 1979))).        The money laundering\n\nconspiracy charged here, focused as it is on transactions designed\n\nto conceal a single crime, ended at a fixed point in time – when\n\nthose specific transactions were completed.       See Papa, slip op. at\n\n12 (\"'[T]hough the result of a conspiracy may be continuing, the\n\nconspiracy does not thereby become a continuing one.'\" (quoting\n\nFiswick v. United States, 329 U.S. 211, 216 (1946)).\n\n          The flaw in the majority's reasoning is further revealed\n\nby   considering   the   Supreme    Court's    illustrative   crimes   in\n\nGrunewald. With its stolen car and kidnaping examples, the Supreme\n\nCourt was describing acts of concealment that occur – as with\n\n\"ongoing\" conspiracies – in tandem with the criminal conduct that\n\nis the object of the charged conspiracy.       In such cases, where the\n\nconcealment occurs before the object of the conspiracy is completed\n\n(as with the kidnapers awaiting ransom) or coincident with its\n\ncompletion (as with the new paint job on a stolen car), the\n\nconcealment is closely related in time to the commission of the\n\ncrime that is the conspiracy's goal.          Such concealment directly\n\n\n                                   -38-\n\ffacilitates the crime's completion and, as such, it is properly\n\nviewed as part of the original criminal undertaking rather than as\n\npost-conspiracy cover-up.\n\n            Indeed, the Court in Grunewald extended its kidnaping\n\nexample     by   noting     that   the     concealment      addressed       by   the\n\ngovernment's proof at trial in that case was \"[m]ore closely\n\nanalogous to . . . conspiring kidnapers who cover up their traces\n\nafter the main conspiracy is finally ended – i.e., after they have\n\nabandoned    the      kidnaped   person    and   then   take   care    to    escape\n\ndetection.\"      353 U.S. at 405.         By confining \"necessary\" acts of\n\nconcealment to those that occur contemporaneously with the overt\n\nacts that comprise the substantive crime, the Supreme Court's\n\nconcern in Grunewald – that acts of concealment not be used to\n\nindefinitely extend the duration of a conspiracy – does not arise.\n\n            Here, too, the concealment relied upon by the government\n\nto extend the duration of the conspiracy is more akin to the cover-\n\nup   conduct     of   kidnapers    who    have   pocketed   their     ransom     and\n\nabandoned their victim.          There is no dispute that the overt acts\n\nthat were the objective of the charged conspiracy – the financial\n\ntransactions prohibited by section 1956(a)(1)(B) – had ended, at\n\nthe latest, with the sale of the Iyanough Road property in January\n\n1999.17   The failure to file a tax return more than a year later –\n\n\n17\n   Although Upton appears to presume that the money laundering\ntransactions included the house sale, the list of transactions in\nthe indictment concludes with the purchase of the house.\n\n                                         -39-\n\fassuming the usual April 15th deadline – is materially different\n\nfrom    either   of   the    Supreme    Court's   examples      of   within-the-\n\nconspiracy concealment.        First, the tax evasion was remote in time\n\nfrom the targeted transactions.           Second, the tax conduct did not\n\nfacilitate those transactions.           Upton and Alberico successfully\n\nchanged the cash into cashiers' checks and purchased the house in\n\n1997,    completing    the    money    laundering     conduct    that      was   the\n\nobjective of the charged conspiracy. Their failure to file returns\n\nshowing the gain from the house protected the scheme after the fact\n\nby concealing it, but that function is not enough to bring the tax\n\nevasion within the scope of the money laundering conspiracy.\n\n            Indeed, that tax evasion is precisely the sort of post-\n\nconspiracy concealment that the Court in Grunewald – as a matter of\n\npolicy – deemed insufficient to extend the statute of limitations.\n\nBy contrast, a car thief's repainting of the car – and, even more\n\nso, the hiding of kidnapers waiting for ransom – is necessary for\n\nthe successful accomplishment of the crime that is the object of\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n            The problem with the majority's logic is demonstrable by\n\napplying it to a scenario in which Upton and Alberico had sold the\n\nIyanough Road house ten years later, in 2009, and similarly failed\n\nto file tax returns reporting their gain.             The majority's analysis\n\nleads to the conclusion – impermissible under Grunewald – that the\n\nmoney   laundering    conspiracy       would   have   continued      for   another\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\fdecade,   despite   the   lack   of   money    laundering   transactions\n\nthroughout that period.    The majority disclaims such a conclusion\n\nin its opinion in Alberico's appeal, noting that \"the failure to\n\nfile [returns for 1999] was within a short time and thus likely to\n\nbe part of the conspirators' agreement.\"\n\n          The majority offers no principled basis, however, for\n\ndrawing a distinction between a failure to file a return disclosing\n\ngain earned in 1999 and a failure to file a return reporting that\n\nsame gain earned at a later date.             The concealment function\n\nperformed by the tax evasion is the same in both instances, and I\n\ndo not see how such concealment can be deemed an essential part of\n\nthe money laundering conspiracy at the earlier time but not later.18\n\nMoreover, in both instances the objective of the money laundering\n\nconspiracy – the commission of the crime of money laundering – had\n\n\n\n18\n  Beyond highlighting the flaw in the majority's reasoning, the\nhypothetical shows the problem in viewing the sale of the Iyanough\nRoad house – as distinguished from its purchase – as part of the\nmoney laundering conspiracy. The laundering was accomplished by\nconverting the cash to cashier's checks that were then converted\ninto real estate, from which Upton and Alberico earned rent of\n$1,000 a month.    As Upton points out, if the failure to report\ndown-the-line profits from the laundered money (such as gain from\nthe house sale) is held to be within the scope of the original\nmoney laundering conspiracy, the result would be an open-ended\nstatute of limitations – the Supreme Court's concern in Grunewald.\nSee 353 U.S. at 402 (\"Sanctioning the Government's theory would for\nall practical purposes wipe out the statute of limitations in\nconspiracy cases . . . .\"); see also United States v. Magluta, 418\nF.3d 1166, 1180 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that purchases using\nlaundered proceeds years after the payment that constituted the\noriginal laundering could not be considered part of the money\nlaundering conspiracy).\n\n                                 -41-\n\falready been completed.             Hence, the timing of the tax evasion does\n\nnot support the majority's conclusion that it was within the scope\n\nof the original money laundering conspiracy.                        To the contrary, the\n\ntax   conduct's         remoteness       from    the    charged      objective     of   the\n\nconspiracy      –    to      launder    the     $900,000     by     means   of   financial\n\ntransactions        –     confirms      that     it    was    not    necessary     to   the\n\naccomplishment          of    the    conspiracy        in    the    sense   required     by\n\nGrunewald.\n\n                                               IV.\n\n         The majority's confusion undoubtedly stems in part from its\n\nfailure    to       appreciate         the    critical       difference     between     the\n\nconspiracy alleged here and the type of conspiracy charged in\n\nGrunewald and other cases on which the majority relies, including\n\nGoldberg and United States v. Mann, 161 F.3d 840, 859 (5th Cir.\n\n1998).    Those cases involved conspiracies brought under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371, which criminalizes any conspiracy \"to defraud the United\n\nStates, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 371.          Such a conspiracy \"can have multiple objects, and\n\nany agreed-upon object can be a purpose of the conspiracy and used\n\nto define its character.\" Goldberg, 105 F.3d at 774 (citing Ingram\n\nv. United States, 360 U.S. 672, 679-80 (1959)).\n\n            Thus, under section 371, a defendant may be charged and\n\nfound guilty of conspiring to defraud the government by means of\n\ntax conduct whose purpose was to conceal earlier illicit activity\n\n\n                                              -42-\n\fthat was charged as a separate object of the same conspiracy.              In\n\nMann, for example, the government alleged five separate objects of\n\nthe single conspiracy charged under section 371 in the indictment's\n\nfirst count, including misuse of bank funds and the filing of false\n\nincome tax returns.    Mann, 161 F.3d at 847-48.      The court rejected\n\nthe defendants' Grunewald argument because \"[t]he central aim of\n\nthe conspiracy\" – as alleged in the indictment – included a purpose\n\nto evade taxes.    Mann, 161 F.3d at 859.\n\n           Grunewald   also    illustrates   the   potential     breadth   of\n\nconspiracies under section 371. Although the case was tried on the\n\ntheory that the defendants' conspiratorial objective was to obtain\n\n\"no prosecution\" rulings for certain taxpayers, the indictment\n\nembraced the theory that the conspiracy's central object extended\n\nbeyond   those   provisional    rulings   \"to   immunize   the    taxpayers\n\ncompletely from prosecution for tax evasion.\"        Grunewald, 353 U.S.\n\nat 408. The Supreme Court concluded that, under the limited theory\n\npresented to the jury, the acts of concealment following the \"no\n\nprosecution\" rulings could only be viewed as post-conspiracy cover-\n\nup to protect the defendants.      Under the broader theory, however,\n\nthose acts could be viewed as conduct in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy to fully protect the taxpayers from tax liability.              Id.\n\nat 409-411.\n\n           The Court remanded the case for a new trial because the\n\njury charge did not distinguish between concealment in order to\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fachieve the central purpose of the more broadly stated conspiracy\n\n(immunization of the taxpayers from tax-evasion prosecution), and\n\nconcealment   intended   solely   to     cover   up    a   completed    crime\n\n(obtaining the \"no prosecution\" rulings).        Id.   at 413-14.      To find\n\nthat the acts of concealment that took place within the limitations\n\nperiod were in furtherance of the conspiracy, the jury needed to\n\nfind that \"the basic aim of the conspiracy was not yet attained\" at\n\nthat time – a determination the jury was not asked to make.             Id. at\n\n414.\n\n          As far as we know, therefore, the present\n          convictions were based on the impermissible\n          theory . . . that a subordinate agreement to\n          conceal the conspiracy continued after the\n          central aim of the conspiracy had been\n          accomplished. . . .\n\n          [T]he judge's charge left it open for the jury\n          to convict even though they found that the\n          acts of concealment were motivated purely by\n          the purpose of the conspirators to cover up\n          their already accomplished crime. And this,\n          we think, was fatal error.\n\nId.\n\n          The majority fails to recognize that the indictment here\n\nis not similarly elastic.   The indictment charged a conspiracy to\n\ncommit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B),\n\nnot a more general conspiracy under section 371 \"to defraud the\n\nUnited States, or any agency thereof\" by concealing, through\n\nvarious unlawful actions, the theft of Queen's money. Although the\n\nindictment's conspiracy allegations included, under the heading\n\n\n                                  -44-\n\f\"Manner and Means,\" that \"[i]t was part of the conspiracy that\n\n[defendants] attempted to conceal or disguise the . . . source\n\n. . . or control of the illegal cash proceeds by failing to file\n\nincome tax returns . . . for the tax year 1999,\" the government's\n\ndescription   of    a   subsequent   tax    fraud   that   shared   the   same\n\nconcealment objective of the money laundering transactions cannot\n\nturn the specific conspiracy alleged – to commit money laundering\n\n– into a general conspiracy to conceal funds.19\n\n          Unlike the section 371 conspiracy charged in Mann, which\n\nincluded a separate tax fraud objective, or the conspiracy charged\n\nin Grunewald, whose general purpose to defraud the United States\n\ncould   embrace     acts   of   concealment     subsequent     to   the   \"no\n\nprosecution\" ruling, a conspiracy to commit money laundering –\n\ni.e., a conspiracy to conduct financial transactions – cannot, by\n\nits terms, include a \"central criminal purpose\" to conceal income\n\nfrom the IRS.      Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 405.        Put most simply, the\n\ntax evasion did not further the \"central aim\" of the conspiracy,\n\nwhich was to conduct financial transactions in order to conceal the\n\nsource of the $900,000.      Hence, the tax evasion was not within the\n\n\n\n\n19\n   The indictment originally included a count under section 371\nalleging a conspiracy to structure transactions for the purpose of\nevading federal currency reporting requirements.    See 31 U.S.C.\n§§ 5324(a)(3), 5322.      As noted earlier, the district court\ndismissed that count on the basis of the statute of limitations.\nSee United States v. Upton, 339 F. Supp. 2d 190, 196 (D. Mass.\n2004).\n\n                                     -45-\n\fscope   of   the   charged   conspiracy.     The      conspiracy    charge   was\n\ntherefore barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n                                       V.\n\n             The majority is correct, of course, that Upton's failure\n\nto file the 1999 tax return bears some relationship to the money\n\nlaundering conspiracy.        As I have noted, both crimes share a\n\npurpose to cover up the theft from Queen, with the tax evasion\n\npresumably    having   the    added    purpose   to    cover   up   the   money\n\nlaundering.        Both the facts and the law, however, preclude a\n\nfinding by the jury that there was an express original subsidiary\n\nagreement among the conspirators to cover up their crime, or a\n\nfinding that the failure to file the 1999 return was an act of\n\nconcealment done in furtherance of the money laundering conspiracy\n\nwithin the meaning of Grunewald. Thus, while Upton was charged and\n\nproperly convicted of the separate crime of failing to file a tax\n\nreturn, the majority errs in treating that independent crime as a\n\npart of the money laundering conspiracy.\n\n             Because the conspiracy charge was time-barred, Upton's\n\nconviction on Count 4 of the indictment should be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -46-\n\f",

A jury convicted George Upton of\n\nconspiracy to commit money laundering.             In this appeal, he argues\n\nthat, by the time of his indictment, the statute of limitations\n\nperiod had run on all of his conduct except for the filing of a\n\nfalse tax return and the failure to file a tax return.                      Upton\n\nasserts that, under governing Supreme Court precedent cabining the\n\ngovernment's ability to charge continuing conspiracies based on\n\nsubsequent acts of cover-up, the two tax offenses were not part of\n\nthe conspiracy.       From this premise he contends both that he was\n\nentitled to a jury instruction on the statute of limitations and\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to convict him of conspiracy to\n\nlaunder money within the applicable limitations period.

In\n\nconnection with this enterprise, he had a business relationship\n\nwith Steven Queen, a lender.\n\n          On July 9, 1997, Queen traveled to Florida and removed a\n\nlarge amount of cash from his parents' safe deposit box.   Queen had\n\ntold several people of his plans prior to making this trip,\n\nclaiming that the money was his inheritance. Upton had heard about\n\nQueen's trip and its purpose.\n\n          Upon returning from Florida on the evening of July 12,\n\n1997, Queen left a suitcase containing $900,000 in cash in the\n\ntrunk of a car that was parked in the Look Motors parking lot and\n\nwent to dinner.   Upton's daughter saw Queen place the suitcase in\n\nthe trunk of the car.   She told Upton and his girlfriend of twenty\n\nyears, Lynn Alberico, about the suitcase.       While Queen was at\n\ndinner, Upton and Alberico removed the suitcase from the car. When\n\nQueen returned to Look Motors and discovered that the suitcase was\n\nmissing, he accused Upton of stealing the money.    Upton denied the\n\naccusation and told Queen to leave.    Distraught, Queen went to the\n\napartment of a friend and told her that the money he had taken from\n\nhis parents was gone.\n\n          Queen accused Upton of stealing the money on several\n\noccasions, in public confrontations.    Upton did not admit to Queen\n\nthat he had taken the money.    During the fall of 1997, however,\n\nUpton did admit to an acquaintance that he had stolen a suitcase\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fwith more than $900,000 in cash from Queen.        In 1999, Alberico made\n\nthe same admission to her best friend.\n\n           On August 19, 1997, a month after the theft, Upton signed\n\na purchase and sale agreement to buy the property located at 89\n\nIyanough Road in Hyannis, Massachusetts for $120,000.              He made a\n\n$12,000   down   payment   by   check;    that   check   was    returned   for\n\ninsufficient funds, and Upton replaced it with $12,000 in cash.\n\nUpton paid the $108,000 balance of the purchase price with thirteen\n\ncashier's checks.\n\n           The cashier's checks had been acquired in several stages,\n\nover the span of three days.       Upton's brother, two friends, and a\n\nLook Motors employee assisted Upton and Alberico.              Upton provided\n\ncash to these four people.        Then, each person deposited the cash\n\ninto his or her personal bank account to purchase one or more\n\ncashier's checks.    Most of the deposits and checks were for sums\n\nless than $10,000 and involved visits to multiple bank branches or\n\nmultiple visits to the same branch, in order to avoid federal\n\nreporting requirements.2        The checks variously were made out to\n\nUpton or to Alberico.\n\n           Alberico took title to the property in the name of \"AU\n\nTrust.\"   That trust, created on the day of the closing, August 29,\n\n1997, bears Alberico's and Upton's initials.             Also on the day of\n\n\n2\n  Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 5313(a) and 31 C.F.R. § 103.22, domestic\nfinancial institutions are required to report currency transactions\ninvolving more than $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthe closing, Alberico granted a sham mortgage on the property to\n\n\"Bostonians Trust of Florida,\" which did not then even exist.              The\n\nproperty was then rented out for $1,000 per month.\n\n           The 89 Iyanough Road property was sold on January 5,\n\n1999, for $202,000.    On January 6, the real estate attorney wrote\n\nseparate checks to Upton and Alberico for $39,850 each, and, less\n\nthan a week later, purchased bank checks made out to Upton and\n\nAlberico for $52,948.21 each.         Bank records indicate that these\n\nchecks   were   deposited   into    the    accounts   of   Look   Motors   and\n\nAlberico, respectively, in January 1999.\n\n           Upton eventually filed his 1997 federal income tax return\n\nin July 2000, reporting a total income of $14,165.                At the same\n\ntime, he also filed returns for 1994, 1995, and 1996.              All of his\n\nreturns were prepared by his accountant, based on information\n\nprovided by Upton.    The 1997 return was false in that it did not\n\ndisclose any portion of the $900,000 stolen from Queen, nor did it\n\ndisclose any portion of the rental income from 89 Iyanough Road for\n\nthe partial year 1997.      Alberico's tax return for 1997, filed in\n\nAugust 1998, also neglected to report any portion of the stolen\n\nmoney or the rental income.        Upton did not file a return for 1998.\n\nAlberico filed a false return for 1998 in October 1999, again\n\nfailing to report rental income.          Neither Upton nor Alberico filed\n\na tax return for 1999, the year in which each earned a substantial\n\ncapital gain from the sale of the property.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                             B.   Procedural History\n\n              In August 2002, a grand jury indicted Upton and Alberico\n\nfor money laundering and for structuring financial transactions to\n\nevade reporting requirements, as well as for conspiracy to engage\n\nin such structuring.          On May 12, 2004, a superseding indictment\n\nadded counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(B), (h) and 1957(a); filing a materially\n\nfalse income tax return for the year 1997, in violation of 26\n\nU.S.C. § 7206(1); and failing to file an income tax return for the\n\nyear 1999, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7203.\n\n              The general five-year statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3282,     applies   to   prosecutions    for     violations    of   the   money\n\nlaundering and structuring statutes.               For reasons not material to\n\nthis appeal, the filing of the superseding indictment established\n\nMay 12, 2004 as the relevant date for statute of limitations\n\npurposes.      Prosecution for alleged crimes committed prior to May\n\n12,    1999    was   thus    barred    by    the    statute   of    limitations.\n\nAccordingly, the district court dismissed the counts carried over\n\nfrom the original indictment alleging money laundering, structuring\n\nand conspiracy to engage in structuring.             Upton, 339 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n196.   Upton went to trial on the remaining charges of conspiracy to\n\ncommit money laundering and the two tax violations.3\n\n\n\n3\n  Upton was tried in October 2004. Alberico's motion to sever had\nbeen granted previously; she was tried separately in July 2005.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f              During the charge conference, Upton did not request a\n\njury    instruction      on   a    statute     of   limitations   defense    to     the\n\nconspiracy count.        The next day, however, at the completion of the\n\ngovernment's case in chief, he did request such an instruction.\n\nThe trial judge denied this request on the basis that Upton had\n\nwaived the request by failing to raise it at the charge conference.\n\nAt     the    completion      of    the   government's       case,   Upton        moved\n\nunsuccessfully for judgment of acquittal on the basis that the\n\nmoney laundering conspiracy charge was time-barred. After the jury\n\nhad been instructed at the close of the evidence, Upton objected to\n\nthe denial of his request for a statute of limitations instruction.\n\nThe court again ruled that Upton had waived his right to a jury\n\ninstruction on the statute of limitations because he did not raise\n\nit at the charge conference.\n\n              The jury found Upton guilty on each of the three counts:\n\nconspiracy to commit money laundering, filing a false tax return,\n\nand failure to file a tax return.                   Following the verdict, the\n\ndistrict court denied Upton's renewed motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal, United States v.

He    does   not   challenge      his     tax\n\nconvictions.         As to the conspiracy conviction, he claims that the\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdistrict court erred in not instructing the jury on the statute of\n\nlimitations; erred in denying his motion for acquittal on statute\n\nof limitations grounds; and abused its discretion in admitting a\n\nstatement as an excited utterance.\n\n          A.   Jury Instruction on Statute of Limitations\n\n          Upton contends that the district court erred by failing\n\nto instruct the jury on the statute of limitations applicable to\n\nthe money laundering conspiracy.   He argues that he has preserved\n\nhis objection to the court's failure to so instruct, and therefore\n\nthat harmless error is the appropriate standard of review.   While\n\nhe acknowledges that he failed to request a written instruction at\n\nthe charge conference, Upton presses the fact that he raised his\n\nobjection after the charge conference but before the jury was\n\ninstructed, and again after the instructions were delivered to the\n\njury.   Beyond this, he asserts that even if he has not preserved\n\nhis objection, the court's failure to give the instruction was\n\nplainly erroneous. See United States v. Thurston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200842\"><a href=\"/opinion/200842/united-states-v-thurston/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\n\nCir. 2004), vacated on other grounds.\n\n          The appellant is not entitled to relief on this ground.\n\nFirst, the claim of error is unpreserved.     The requirements for\n\nrequesting a jury instruction are clear.    Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(a)\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n          Any party may request in writing that the\n          court instruct the jury on the law as\n          specified in the request. The request must be\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f          made at the close of evidence or at any time\n          that the court reasonably sets.\n\n(emphasis added). Upton concedes that he did not submit in writing\n\na request for an instruction on the statute of limitations; indeed,\n\nhe acknowledges that he withheld the request for a jury instruction\n\nat the charge conference as part of his trial strategy.        As he did\n\nnot meet the requirements for requesting a jury instruction, his\n\nlater objections to the jury instructions were deemed waived by the\n\ntrial judge.\n\n          That brings us to the question of how to treat the\n\nunpreserved jury instruction issue.      In United States v. Muñoz-\n\nFranco, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1st Cir. 2007), we held that the failure\n\nto request a jury instruction constitutes waiver.       The defendants\n\nin Muñoz-Franco claimed that the district court erred in not\n\ninstructing the jury on the applicable statute of limitations, but\n\nthey had not raised that issue at any time prior to or during\n\ntrial, including in their post-trial Rule 29(a) motion.         We held\n\nthat their claim was waived and thus not reviewable on appeal.\n\n          Pointing to Thurston, Upton argues that plain error\n\nreview is appropriate in this case.      358 F.3d at 63.      It is not\n\nnecessary, however, to resolve any potential conflict between\n\nMuñoz-Franco   and   Thurston   here.

Upton deliberately chose not to request a statute of\n\nlimitations jury instruction at the charge conference as a matter\n\nof trial strategy.4         The informed decision to decline to exercise\n\nthe   right    to    request     a   specific   jury    instruction    is    a\n\nstraightforward example of an \"intentional relinquishment\" subject\n\nto waiver.\n\n             Even were we to consider this an instance of forfeiture\n\nand review the failure to instruct the jury on the statute of\n\nlimitations for plain error, we would conclude that there was no\n\nplain error.    Under the plain error standard, Upton must show that\n\n\"the trial court committed an error, that the error was 'plain,'\n\nand   that    the   error    affected   the   substantial   rights    of    the\n\nappellant.\"     United States v.

Rule 30(a) is\n\nclear, and Upton failed to meet its strictures. The district judge\n\nacted within her discretion to deny Upton's requested instruction\n\nbecause the request was untimely.\n\n          B.   Motion for Acquittal on Statute of Limitations\n\n          Presented as a challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, Upton argues that the district court should have granted\n\nhis motion for acquittal on the conspiracy count because the\n\nstatute of limitations bars his conviction.    The essence of this\n\nsufficiency claim is that there was no evidence that the conspiracy\n\ncontinued to a time that was within five years of the May 12, 2004\n\nsuperseding indictment.   Upton argues that the money laundering\n\nobjective of the conspiracy was achieved no later than when the\n\nconspirators sold the Iyanough Road property in January 1999.   His\n\nfailure to file a return for 1999 and his July 2000 filing of a\n\nfalse tax return for 1997 were, he says, at most unilateral acts\n\nintended to cover up the conspiracy after its termination.

A motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal is only granted if \"the evidence and all\n\nreasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence, both taken in\n\nthe light most favorable to the government, are insufficient for a\n\nrational factfinder to conclude that the prosecution has proven,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, each of the elements of the offense.\"\n\nUnited States v.

See\n\nUnited States v. Walsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557359\"><a href=\"/opinion/557359/united-states-v-bartley-walsh-aka-barney-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1991).      The\n\nquestion boils down to whether the jury could have supportably\n\nfound that either or both of the tax offenses that Upton committed\n\nin 2000 were part of the conspiracy, and the wrinkle is Upton's\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fassertion that Grunewald requires us to view the tax violations as\n\nacts of cover-up beyond the scope of the conspiracy.\n\n              A conspiracy endures as long as the co-conspirators\n\nendeavor      to   attain    the   \"central     criminal     purposes\"    of   the\n\nconspiracy.        Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 401.              In this case, the\n\nindictment charged that Upton and Alberico conspired to violate 18\n\nU.S.C.   §§    1956(a)(1)(B)       and   1957(a).        Section   1956(a)(1)(B)\n\nprohibits engaging in financial transactions involving the proceeds\n\nof unlawful activities:\n\n                     knowing   that   the  transaction   is\n              designed in whole or in part–-\n                     (i) to conceal or disguise the nature,\n              the location, the source, the ownership, or\n              the control of the proceeds of specified\n              unlawful activity ...\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B) (emphasis supplied).                 The focus of the\n\nprohibition is thus trained on the design to conceal or disguise.\n\nThe   concealment     feature      distinguishes     §    1956(a)(1)(B)   from   §\n\n1957(a).       Section      1957(a)   prohibits     monetary   transactions      in\n\ncriminally derived property, but does not contain an element of\n\nconcealment or disguise.\n\n              The Supreme Court has recently examined language in §\n\n1956(a)(2) that is identical to the language of the section at\n\nissue in this case, § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).

As the\n\npertinent language of § 1956(a)(1)(B) is identical to that of §\n\n1956(a)(2)(B), we conclude that Congress's use of \"designed ... to\n\nconceal or disguise\" in (a)(1)(B) likewise requires the government\n\nto prove that there was a purpose or plan to conceal or disguise.\n\nSee    Gustafson v.

The indictment\n\nalleged, as the \"manner and means\" of carrying out the conspiracy,\n\nthat the defendants used the stolen monies to make the multi-\n\nlayered purchase of 89 Iyanough Road in August of 1997; that Upton\n\ncommingled additional theft proceeds with business receipts of Look\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fMotors on more than twenty occasions during the remainder of 1997;\n\nthat Alberico filed a false tax return for 1997 in 1998 that did\n\nnot disclose the theft income or her rental income from the\n\nIyanough road property; and that:\n\n           \"It   was   part   of  the   conspiracy   that\n           [defendants] attempted to conceal or disguise\n           the nature, location, source, ownership, or\n           control of the illegal cash proceeds by\n           failing to file income tax returns, or declare\n           a capital gain from the sale of the commercial\n           property, for the tax year 1999 [and Upton\n           attempted to conceal or disguise] by filing a\n           materially false federal income tax return . .\n           . that failed to declare the receipt of the\n           illegal income or the rental income from the\n           property in 1997.\"\n\n           The indictment thus put Upton on notice, at a minimum,\n\nthat his concealment of the capital gain from the sale of 89\n\nIyanough Road was part and parcel of the alleged means of carrying\n\nout the charged conspiracy.5        To sustain its burden of proof, the\n\ngovernment had to establish that Upton conspired to engage in\n\ntransactions with the intended aim of concealing or disguising\n\ncertain attributes of the funds involved.

Consistent with the\n\nallegations in the indictment, the government introduced evidence\n\nthat Upton and Alberico purchased the 89 Iyanough Road property in\n\nAugust 1997 and sold it in January 1999.   The pair converted cash\n\ninto cashier's checks to finance the initial purchase of the\n\nproperty, set up the sham mortgage, and took title in the name of\n\n\"AU Trust.\"    Upton commingled additional theft proceeds with\n\nbusiness income.   Alberico filed a false 1997 tax return, omitting\n\nthe theft proceeds and rental income.   Neither Upton nor Alberico\n\nfiled tax returns for 1999 -- the year in which they were required\n\nto report a capital gain on the sale.\n\n          From this evidence the jury reasonably could have found\n\nthat Upton's failure to file the 1999 return was in furtherance of\n\nthe central objective of the conspiracy.    Specifically, the jury\n\nsupportably could have concluded that the failure to file his 1999\n\nreturn in the ordinary course facilitated the concealment aim of\n\nthe money laundering transactions.    That act of omission may have\n\nhad special significance to the jury, because in his 1999 return\n\nUpton was required to disclose not only any rental receipts but\n\nalso the capital gain he realized on the sale of the property.   The\n\njury may have also found it significant that Alberico, too, did not\n\nfile a return for 1999, contrary to her practice in previous years.\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fThe capital gains disclosures they were required to make easily\n\ncould have unraveled the entire money-laundering scheme, not only\n\nsubjecting   them   to   prosecution,   but   also   resulting   in   the\n\nforfeiture of the proceeds.    See 18 U.S.C. § 981(a).    Avoiding such\n\nan outcome, whereby their use of the proceeds would be thwarted,\n\nwas a primary goal of the concealment money laundering conspiracy,\n\nor so the jury could have found.6\n\n                                  2.\n\n          In the face of this evidence, Upton argues that the\n\nGrunewald imposes a limitation on the ability of subsequent acts of\n\n\n\n\n6\n  The government says that Upton's filing in 2000 of a false 1997\nreturn was also an act in furtherance of the conspiracy. It may\nhave been, although the act occurred more than two years after\nUpton would have been expected to file a return, and almost two\nyears after his coconspirator Alberico similarly filed a false\nreturn. We need not definitively resolve whether that Upton's false\nfiling was in furtherance of the conspiracy. The evidence of the\nconspirators' parallel failures to file 1999 tax returns was\nsufficient for the jury to conclude that the conspiracy lasted at\nleast until May 12, 1999. But that does not by any stretch render\nUpton's 2000 filing irrelevant.    At a minimum, the fact of the\nfalse filing was admissible to show, and was strong evidence of,\nUpton's knowledge that the 1997 purchase was designed to conceal\ncharacteristics of the unlawful proceeds. In addition, coming as\nit did in the same time frame as Upton's failure to file a tax\nreturn for 1999, his guilty knowledge associated with the June 2000\nfalse filing solidifies the inference that the reason for the\nfailure to file was in fact to prevent discovery of the money\nlaundering conspiracy. The 1997 returns filed by both conspirators\nwere false in that they did not disclose the receipt of the stolen\nfunds. Pointedly, they also failed to disclose the rental income\nfrom the Iyanough Road property, further cementing the inference\nthat ownership of that property was part of a design to disguise or\nconceal.\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fconcealment to extend the life of a conspiracy.7   At bottom, as we\n\nhave noted, the argument is that acts that constitute an attempt to\n\ncover up a completed crime do not extend the duration of the\n\nconspiracy.   See Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 401 (it is not enough that\n\nthe defendants \"took care to cover up their crime in order to\n\nescape detection and punishment\"). According to Upton, his failure\n\nto file a 1999 tax return and his July 2000 filing of a false 1997\n\ntax return were, at most, attempts to cover up completed financial\n\ntransactions, namely, the buying and selling of the Iyanough Road\n\nproperty in August 1997 and January 1999.      Thus, he maintains,\n\nunder Grunewald the acts of concealment represented by the two tax\n\noffenses could not extend the life of the conspiracy.   In support\n\nof this argument, Upton cites United States v. LaSpina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778643\"><a href=\"/opinion/778643/united-states-v-lawrence-laspina-robert-st-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (2d Cir. 2002), for the proposition that a conspiracy with\n\nan economic transaction as its objective lasts only until the\n\n\"anticipated economic benefits\" of that transaction are received.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n7\n  In Grunewald, decided under the general conspiracy statute, 18\nU.S.C. § 371,the defendants had been charged with conspiracy in\nconnection with a scheme to obtain \"no prosecution\" rulings by\nbribing an IRS official in two discrete tax cases.

Here, however, as we\n\nhave noted, Upton was also charged with conspiring to violate §\n\n1956(a)(1)(B) by engaging in financial transactions designed to\n\nconceal or disguise certain characteristics of the proceeds of\n\nunlawful activity.       The objective of the conspiracy was more than\n\nthe   specific   monetary      transactions      of   buying   and    selling   89\n\nIyanough Road.     The objective was to engage in concealment money\n\nlaundering in order to obscure the illicit source of the funds and\n\nthe conspirators' continued control of the proceeds.

But that the evidence\n\nmight have shown that the 1997 purchase of property constituted\n\nconcealment money laundering does not mean that the conspiracy to\n\n\n\n8\n  Upton's citation to LaSpina is inapposite. The conspiracy in\nLaSpina differed materially from the conspiracy in this case.\nLaSpina involved a conspiracy whose purpose was to engage in\nmonetary transactions in criminally derived property, in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a).

Even assuming that he\n\nengaged in acts of concealment that could be considered to be in\n\nfurtherance of the main objectives of the conspiracy, no conspiracy\n\ncould have existed in this case because he and Alberico never\n\nexpressly agreed to engage in acts of concealment.

In\n\nfact, Upton argues that the record evidence actually supports his\n\ncontention that no such express agreement existed and that, as a\n\nresult, any acts of concealment were undertaken unilaterally. This\n\nis because the record indicates that, by the summer of 1999, he and\n\nAlberico were estranged.\n\n           Upton's argument misses the point.             In Grunewald, the\n\nCourt drew a distinction between \"acts of concealment done in\n\nfurtherance of the main objectives of the conspiracy,\" and \"acts of\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fconcealment done after these central objectives have been attained\n\nfor the purposes of covering up after the crime.\"                353 U.S. at 405.\n\nWhere the latter is involved, the government must present some\n\nproof of an express original agreement to engage in the acts of\n\nconcealment.     See Twitty, 72 F.3d at 234.          However, nothing in the\n\ncase law imposes a requirement that conspirators expressly agree to\n\nengage   in    acts   of    concealment     where   those      acts    are   done     in\n\nfurtherance of the main objectives of the conspiracy.10 Rather, the\n\nacts of concealment committed by one co-conspirator need only have\n\nbeen \"foreseeable\" to the other co-conspirator.

First, the\n\nstatement      itself   likely   did    little    to   influence   the   jury.\n\nConspiracy to commit concealment money laundering involves an\n\nagreement to conceal the nature of proceeds that were unlawfully\n\nobtained.      Here, in order to prove the element that the proceeds\n\nhad been illegally obtained, the government had to show that Upton\n\nstole the money that he subsequently laundered.            Queen's statement\n\ndoes not demonstrate that the money was even stolen, much less that\n\nUpton was the one who stole it.               While Queen's statement does\n\nprovide support for the idea that the money disappeared from the\n\ntrunk of the car during a specific time frame, it does not\n\nimplicate Upton.\n\n              Second, the government presented plenty of evidence that\n\nUpton did in fact steal the money.            Upton's friend Phidias Dantos\n\ntestified that Queen accused Upton of stealing the money shortly\n\nafter   the    theft    occurred.      More   significantly,   Colleen    Otto\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\ftestified that Alberico told her that Alberico and Upton had taken\n\nthe money, and Edwin Jones testified that Upton revealed to him\n\nthat he had stolen the money. Look Motors's bookkeeper, Lucy Webb,\n\ntestified that Upton declined to tell her where he got the money to\n\npurchase 89 Iyanough Road, saying that he wanted to \"maintain her\n\ninnocence.\"       And   the   additional    evidence     of    Upton's   money\n\nlaundering activities provided strong support for the inference\n\nthat he and Alberico had obtained a large sum of money around the\n\ntime the suitcase was stolen from Queen.             If it was anything,\n\nQueen's statement was merely icing on the cake.\n\n           Upton nevertheless contends that the admission of Queen's\n\nstatement cannot constitute harmless error. He argues that Queen's\n\nstatement bolstered the testimony of Otto and Jones, witnesses who\n\nhe says were in need of bolstering because of their dubious\n\ncredibility.13    There are two problems with this argument.             First,\n\nthe bolstering complaint applies only to Otto and Jones.                 As we\n\nhave explained, the testimony of Otto and Jones was not the only\n\nevidence indicating that Upton stole the money from Queen. Second,\n\nin   addition    to   credibility   being   a   matter   for    the   jury   to\n\ndetermine, it is doubtful that the credibility of Otto and Jones\n\n\n13\n  Upton challenges Jones's credibility in two aspects: Jones was\nserving time on drug charges and testified in return for a\nreduction in his sentence; and, Jones may have been seeking revenge\nagainst Upton because Upton tipped off the police to Jones's drug\ndealing activities several years ago.       Upton also challenges\nAlberico's comments to Otto as potentially motivated by a desire to\nincriminate Upton following their breakup.\n\n                                    -26-\n\fneeded bolstering from Queen's statement in any event.                       Their\n\ntestimony was supported by other evidence.                Otto's testimony that\n\nAlberico admitted that she and Upton took the suitcase of money to\n\na   hotel   was     supported    by   hotel     records   introduced    at   trial\n\nrevealing that Upton rented a hotel room for two people on the\n\nnight Queen returned from Florida.              Otto's further testimony that\n\nAlberico said she had spent part of her share of the money during\n\na trip to Italy was corroborated by airline and credit card records\n\nshowing that Alberico was in Italy during February 1999.                     Jones\n\ntestified that in 1997 Upton gave him cash from a \"shoebox full of\n\nmoney\" and that the money \"looked old\" and was dated from the\n\n1950s; this description is consistent with the proposition that the\n\nmoney   was    earned     by   Queen's    father    throughout    his   life   and\n\nsubsequently stored in a safe deposit box.\n\n              In short, Queen's statement to Hoell is cumulative of\n\nother evidence in the record.            Regardless of whether admitting the\n\nstatement as an excited utterance may have been error, any such\n\nerror was harmless.\n\n              For   the   reasons     expressed    above,   we   uphold   Upton's\n\nconviction.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                          -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\f           LIPEZ,     Circuit   Judge,     dissenting         in    part.         The\n\nrelationship between the concealment at issue in Upton's conspiracy\n\nto commit money laundering and the concealment associated with his\n\nsubsequent tax crimes is complex.              The majority misapplies the\n\nrelevant legal principles and, consequently, wrongly concludes that\n\nUpton's failure to file a 1999 tax return was conduct within the\n\nscope of the money laundering conspiracy.                  In so doing, the\n\nmajority embraces the government's misguided attempt to remedy a\n\nstatute of limitations problem by stretching the money laundering\n\nconspiracy   beyond    its   justifiable       limits    to    include      Upton's\n\nindependent tax crime.\n\n           As the majority notes, the district court had dismissed\n\nbefore trial, on statute of limitations grounds, counts alleging\n\nmoney   laundering,    structuring,      and    conspiracy         to    engage   in\n\nstructuring.   To salvage its money laundering conspiracy charge,\n\nthe   government    sidestepped   the     Supreme       Court's      teaching     in\n\nGrunewald v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105508\"><a href=\"/opinion/105508/grunewald-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1957), which – given the\n\nevidence presented – bars treating the tax fraud as conduct that\n\nfurthered the conspiracy.       If, as Grunewald requires, Upton's tax\n\nevasion were eliminated from the scope of the conspiracy, no act in\n\nfurtherance of the money laundering scheme would fall within the\n\nfive-year statute of limitations period – and the jury's guilty\n\nverdict on the conspiracy count could not stand.                        Because the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fmajority's decision to uphold the verdict conflicts with the\n\ngoverning precedent, I respectfully dissent.14\n\n                                    I.\n\n           In   Grunewald,   the   Supreme     Court   drew   a   distinction\n\nbetween acts of concealment that furthered a charged conspiracy and\n\nsubsequent acts of concealment done \"for the purpose only of\n\ncovering up after the crime.\"       Id. at 405.        If the acts at issue\n\nwere of the latter type – i.e., they did not further \"the main\n\ncriminal objectives of the conspiracy\" – the concealment would not\n\nextend the duration of the conspiracy for purposes of the statute\n\nof limitations.    Id.; see also United States v. Twitty, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">228</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           That distinction, the Court explained, was governed by\n\n\"important considerations of policy\" that hearkened back to prior\n\ncases   \"repeatedly   warn[ing]    that   we   will    view   with   disfavor\n\nattempts to broaden the already pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of\n\nconspiracy prosecutions.\" Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 404.                Routinely\n\nviewing concealment efforts as part of a conspiracy would \"wipe out\n\nthe statute of limitations in conspiracy cases\" and \"result in a\n\ngreat widening of the scope of conspiracy prosecutions\" because\n\n\"every conspiracy will inevitably be followed by actions taken to\n\n\n\n14\n   My objections to the majority's reasoning also apply to its\ndecision in the separate appeal of Upton's co-defendant, Alberico,\nwho also challenged her conviction for conspiracy to commit money\nlaundering on statute of limitations grounds.\n\n                                   -29-\n\fcover the conspirators' traces.\"             Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 402.\n\nHence, the Court rejected \"the proposition that the duration of a\n\nconspiracy   can    be   indefinitely    lengthened   merely    because   the\n\nconspiracy is kept a secret, and merely because the conspirators\n\ntake steps to bury their traces, in order to avoid detection and\n\npunishment   after       the   central     criminal   purpose     has     been\n\naccomplished.\"      Id. at 405.\n\n             Thus, if Upton's tax evasion were conduct designed to\n\ncover up the money laundering conspiracy after the crime had been\n\naccomplished,      rather   than   conduct    undertaken   to   further   the\n\nconspiracy's central criminal purpose – laundering the stolen money\n\n– the money laundering conspiracy charge would be time-barred. Two\n\npossible theories, however, could support a conclusion that the\n\nfailure to file a 1999 tax return furthered the charged conspiracy\n\nfor purposes of the statute of limitations. First, if the evidence\n\nshowed that the conspiracy embraced \"an express original agreement\n\namong the conspirators to continue to act in concert in order to\n\ncover up\" the crime, those acts of concealment could \"properly be\n\nregarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"             Id. at 404, 397.\n\nIn such instances, the cover-up would be not only foreseeable – as\n\nit would be with all crimes – but the explicit objective of \"a\n\nsubsidiary conspiracy to conceal.\"           Id. at 402.\n\n          Second, the tax fraud would be within the scope of the\n\nmoney laundering conspiracy if it could be viewed as an act of\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fconcealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objective of\n\nthe conspiracy.     In Grunewald, the defendants had fraudulently\n\nobtained \"no prosecution\" rulings from the Bureau of Internal\n\nRevenue on behalf of two companies seeking to avoid tax evasion\n\ncharges, and the defendants later took steps to conceal their\n\nfraudulent activity.    Id. at 395-96.     The Supreme Court observed\n\nthat the \"no prosecution\" rulings obtained in 1948 and 1949 had\n\nbeen the main objective of the conspiracy presented to the jury,\n\nand the subsequent efforts to conceal the irregularities – the\n\nconduct occurring within the statute of limitations period – could\n\nonly have been for the purpose of avoiding apprehension, rather\n\nthan to further the conspiracy's already completed objective.            Id.\n\nat 405-06.    The Court acknowledged, however, that some acts of\n\nconcealment are so closely linked in time and purpose to the\n\naccomplishment of the conspiracy that they are \"in furtherance of\n\nthe objectives of the conspiracy itself.\"        Id. at 405.   The Court\n\ncited the concealment of kidnappers who hide while awaiting ransom\n\nand the repainting of a stolen car as instances in which \"the\n\nsuccessful accomplishment of the crime necessitates concealment.\"\n\nId.\n\n           The majority premises its analysis primarily on the\n\nsecond   theory,   concluding   that   \"[n]ot   filing   returns   was    an\n\n'integral and self-evident part of' the conspiracy,\" but it asserts\n\nin a footnote that a reasonable jury could have concluded as well\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fthat Upton and Alberico had expressly agreed to engage in acts of\n\nconcealment.    I therefore consider both theories, looking first at\n\nthe possibility of an express agreement to conceal.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            In asserting that the conspiracy in this case embraced\n\nthe acts of concealment in the aftermath of the money laundering\n\ntransactions, the majority emphasizes that, pursuant to the money\n\nlaundering statute, the indictment charged Upton with conspiring\n\n\"to conceal or disguise,\" inter alia, the source and control of the\n\nstolen $900,000.      See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B).15       The majority\n\nconcludes    that,   because   of   this   concealment   language,   \"[t]he\n\nobjective of the conspiracy was more than the specific monetary\n\ntransactions of buying and selling 89 Iyanough Road,\" but included\n\nthe purpose \"to obscure the illicit source of the funds and the\n\nconspirators' continued control of the proceeds.\" It reasons that,\n\nbecause the money laundering crime that was the objective of the\n\n\n\n15\n     That provision states, in relevant part:\n\n       (a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a\n       financial transaction represents the proceeds of some\n       form of unlawful activity, conducts . . . such a\n       financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds\n       of specified unlawful activity––\n             (B) knowing that the transaction is designed in\n       whole or in part––\n             (i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location,\n       the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds\n       of specified unlawful activity . . . .\n       shall    be    sentenced   to   a   fine    .   .   .   or\n       imprisonment . . . .\n\n                                    -32-\n\fconspiracy included a concealment element, the tax fraud was within\n\nthe conspiracy's scope.\n\n             The concealment element in the money laundering statute\n\ndoes not, however, bring within the scope of the money laundering\n\nconspiracy all conduct undertaken by the defendants to conceal the\n\ntheft   of   the   $900,000.    The   concealment    element   of   section\n\n1956(a)(1)(B) goes to the defendant's state-of-mind when engaging\n\nin the prohibited transactions.        The statute makes unlawful the\n\nconduct of a financial transaction \"knowing that the transaction is\n\ndesigned in whole or in part . . . to conceal or disguise\" the\n\norigin or control of unlawfully obtained property. In other words,\n\nthe jury in this case had to find that Upton conspired to commit\n\nmoney laundering transactions that were undertaken for the purpose\n\nof concealing the crime from which the laundered proceeds were\n\nderived (here, the theft of the $900,000). The statutory state-of-\n\nmind requirement does not, however, transform subsequent acts of\n\nconcealment that do not involve financial transactions – whether\n\ndesigned to hide the money laundering activity or, like the money\n\nlaundering itself, to hide the original theft – into conduct that\n\nis within the money laundering conspiracy.\n\n             Under Grunewald, efforts to conceal the money laundering\n\nconspiracy    after   the   conspiracy's   primary   aim   (the   deceptive\n\nfinancial transactions) has been achieved may be included within\n\nthe scope of the conspiracy only if the evidence permits the jury\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fto   find   that    the   defendants'    \"original      agreement\"     explicitly\n\nincluded a subsidiary objective to cover up their crime.                       See\n\nGrunewald, 353 U.S. at 404 (emphasis added). In other words, there\n\nmust be some evidence of an agreement between the defendants,\n\nentered into before they commit the crime that is the object of the\n\nconspiracy, to continue to act jointly to cover up their unlawful\n\nactivity. Only where there is such a pre-crime agreement will acts\n\nof   covering      up   after   the   crime    reveal   \"more   than    that   the\n\nconspirators do not wish to be apprehended – a concomitant . . . of\n\nevery crime since Cain attempted to conceal the murder of Abel from\n\nthe Lord.\"      Id. at 406.\n\n            As in Grunewald, \"[t]here is not a shred of direct\n\nevidence in this record to show anything like an express original\n\nagreement among the conspirators to continue to act in concert in\n\norder to cover up, for their own self-protection, traces of the\n\ncrime after its commission.\"          Id. at 404.       Nor does the fact that\n\nboth Upton and Alberico failed to file 1999 tax returns reporting\n\nthe gain earned from the stolen funds constitute indirect evidence\n\nof such an agreement to conceal.              The Supreme Court in Grunewald\n\nunequivocally held that such post-crime evidence was insufficient\n\nto show the required pre-crime agreement:\n\n            [A] conspiracy to conceal is being implied [by\n            the government] from elements which will be\n            present in virtually every conspiracy case,\n            that   is,  secrecy   plus   overt   acts   of\n            concealment. . . .\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\f           Acts of covering up, even though done in the\n           context of a mutually understood need for\n           secrecy, cannot themselves constitute proof\n           that concealment of the crime after its\n           commission was part of the initial agreement\n           among the conspirators.\n\nId. at 404, 402; see also SEC v.

The inference of an\n\noriginal agreement to conceal is particularly unwarranted here\n\ngiven that, as the majority acknowledges, Upton and Alberico did\n\nnot consistently act in tandem following the money laundering.\n\nAlberico filed a false return for 1997 that omitted the stolen\n\n$900,000, while Upton filed his false return for that year in 2000.\n\n               In sum, \"the essential missing element is a showing\n\nthat the act [of concealment] was done in furtherance of a prior\n\n                                   -35-\n\fcriminal agreement among the conspirators.\" Grunewald, 353 U.S. at\n\n404 n.16.   Because there is no evidence permitting the jury to find\n\nthat    Upton   and    Alberico   entered    into   an   \"express    original\n\nagreement\" to cover up their money laundering activity, the tax\n\nfraud may not be considered within the scope of the conspiracy on\n\nthat basis.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            Nor can the failure to file the 1999 tax return be viewed\n\nas an act of concealment done in furtherance of the main objective\n\nof the money laundering conspiracy.            Although tax evasion is a\n\nforeseeable     consequence     of   virtually   every    financial       crime,\n\nGoldberg, 105 F.3d at 773, it is not inevitably within the scope of\n\nevery conspiracy to commit such crimes.          The question is whether,\n\nconsistent with the second theory permitted by Grunewald, the jury\n\ncould   find    that   \"the   successful    accomplishment   of     the    crime\n\nnecessitate[d]\" that act of concealment.16          Id. at 405.\n\n\n16\n  Count Four of the indictment alleged the following tax-related\nconduct by Upton as part of the money laundering conspiracy:\n\n            5. It was a part of the conspiracy that defendants\n       George L. Upton and Lynn M. Alberico attempted to conceal\n       or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or\n       control of the illegal cash proceeds by failing to file\n       income tax returns, or declare a capital gain from the\n       sale of the commercial property, for the tax year 1999.\n            6. It was a part of the conspiracy that George L.\n       Upton attempted to conceal or disguise the nature,\n       location, source, ownership, or control of the illegal\n       cash proceeds by filing a materially false federal income\n       tax return in or about July 2000 that failed to declare\n       the receipt of the illegal income or the rental income\n\n                                     -36-\n\f             The majority states that, because the purpose of the\n\nmoney   laundering       conspiracy   was    to    conceal      the    Queen      theft,\n\n\"additional acts of concealment that facilitate the central aim of\n\nthe conspiracy are in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" The majority\n\nasserts that the tax evasion meets this description: \"[C]oncealing\n\nthe   existence     or    financial   impact       of     the   money    laundering\n\ntransactions[] is as much a part of the ongoing conspiracy to\n\nlaunder     money   as   repainting    the    car    is    a    part    of    a    theft\n\nconspiracy.\"\n\n             This   case    does   not,     however,       involve     an     \"ongoing\n\nconspiracy\" that allegedly was intended to last beyond the set of\n\ntransactions that laundered the stolen $900,000.

In such cases, where the\n\nconcealment occurs before the object of the conspiracy is completed\n\n(as with the kidnapers awaiting ransom) or coincident with its\n\ncompletion (as with the new paint job on a stolen car), the\n\nconcealment is closely related in time to the commission of the\n\ncrime that is the conspiracy's goal.

By confining \"necessary\" acts of\n\nconcealment to those that occur contemporaneously with the overt\n\nacts that comprise the substantive crime, the Supreme Court's\n\nconcern in Grunewald – that acts of concealment not be used to\n\nindefinitely extend the duration of a conspiracy – does not arise.\n\n            Here, too, the concealment relied upon by the government\n\nto extend the duration of the conspiracy is more akin to the cover-\n\nup   conduct     of   kidnapers    who    have   pocketed   their     ransom     and\n\nabandoned their victim.          There is no dispute that the overt acts\n\nthat were the objective of the charged conspiracy – the financial\n\ntransactions prohibited by section 1956(a)(1)(B) – had ended, at\n\nthe latest, with the sale of the Iyanough Road property in January\n\n1999.17   The failure to file a tax return more than a year later –\n\n\n17\n   Although Upton appears to presume that the money laundering\ntransactions included the house sale, the list of transactions in\nthe indictment concludes with the purchase of the house.\n\n                                         -39-\n\fassuming the usual April 15th deadline – is materially different\n\nfrom    either   of   the    Supreme    Court's   examples      of   within-the-\n\nconspiracy concealment.        First, the tax evasion was remote in time\n\nfrom the targeted transactions.           Second, the tax conduct did not\n\nfacilitate those transactions.           Upton and Alberico successfully\n\nchanged the cash into cashiers' checks and purchased the house in\n\n1997,    completing    the    money    laundering     conduct    that      was   the\n\nobjective of the charged conspiracy. Their failure to file returns\n\nshowing the gain from the house protected the scheme after the fact\n\nby concealing it, but that function is not enough to bring the tax\n\nevasion within the scope of the money laundering conspiracy.\n\n            Indeed, that tax evasion is precisely the sort of post-\n\nconspiracy concealment that the Court in Grunewald – as a matter of\n\npolicy – deemed insufficient to extend the statute of limitations.\n\nBy contrast, a car thief's repainting of the car – and, even more\n\nso, the hiding of kidnapers waiting for ransom – is necessary for\n\nthe successful accomplishment of the crime that is the object of\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n            The problem with the majority's logic is demonstrable by\n\napplying it to a scenario in which Upton and Alberico had sold the\n\nIyanough Road house ten years later, in 2009, and similarly failed\n\nto file tax returns reporting their gain.             The majority's analysis\n\nleads to the conclusion – impermissible under Grunewald – that the\n\nmoney   laundering    conspiracy       would   have   continued      for   another\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\fdecade,   despite   the   lack   of   money    laundering   transactions\n\nthroughout that period.    The majority disclaims such a conclusion\n\nin its opinion in Alberico's appeal, noting that \"the failure to\n\nfile [returns for 1999] was within a short time and thus likely to\n\nbe part of the conspirators' agreement.\"\n\n          The majority offers no principled basis, however, for\n\ndrawing a distinction between a failure to file a return disclosing\n\ngain earned in 1999 and a failure to file a return reporting that\n\nsame gain earned at a later date.             The concealment function\n\nperformed by the tax evasion is the same in both instances, and I\n\ndo not see how such concealment can be deemed an essential part of\n\nthe money laundering conspiracy at the earlier time but not later.18\n\nMoreover, in both instances the objective of the money laundering\n\nconspiracy – the commission of the crime of money laundering – had\n\n\n\n18\n  Beyond highlighting the flaw in the majority's reasoning, the\nhypothetical shows the problem in viewing the sale of the Iyanough\nRoad house – as distinguished from its purchase – as part of the\nmoney laundering conspiracy. The laundering was accomplished by\nconverting the cash to cashier's checks that were then converted\ninto real estate, from which Upton and Alberico earned rent of\n$1,000 a month.    As Upton points out, if the failure to report\ndown-the-line profits from the laundered money (such as gain from\nthe house sale) is held to be within the scope of the original\nmoney laundering conspiracy, the result would be an open-ended\nstatute of limitations – the Supreme Court's concern in Grunewald.\nSee 353 U.S. at 402 (\"Sanctioning the Government's theory would for\nall practical purposes wipe out the statute of limitations in\nconspiracy cases . . . .\"); see also United States v.

Hence, the timing of the tax evasion does\n\nnot support the majority's conclusion that it was within the scope\n\nof the original money laundering conspiracy.                        To the contrary, the\n\ntax   conduct's         remoteness       from    the    charged      objective     of   the\n\nconspiracy      –    to      launder    the     $900,000     by     means   of   financial\n\ntransactions        –     confirms      that     it    was    not    necessary     to   the\n\naccomplishment          of    the    conspiracy        in    the    sense   required     by\n\nGrunewald.\n\n                                               IV.\n\n         The majority's confusion undoubtedly stems in part from its\n\nfailure    to       appreciate         the    critical       difference     between     the\n\nconspiracy alleged here and the type of conspiracy charged in\n\nGrunewald and other cases on which the majority relies, including\n\nGoldberg and United States v. Mann, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 859 (5th Cir.\n\n1998).    Those cases involved conspiracies brought under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371, which criminalizes any conspiracy \"to defraud the United\n\nStates, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 371.          Such a conspiracy \"can have multiple objects, and\n\nany agreed-upon object can be a purpose of the conspiracy and used\n\nto define its character.\" Goldberg, 105 F.3d at 774 (citing Ingram\n\nv.

In\n\nMann, for example, the government alleged five separate objects of\n\nthe single conspiracy charged under section 371 in the indictment's\n\nfirst count, including misuse of bank funds and the filing of false\n\nincome tax returns.    Mann, 161 F.3d at 847-48.      The court rejected\n\nthe defendants' Grunewald argument because \"[t]he central aim of\n\nthe conspiracy\" – as alleged in the indictment – included a purpose\n\nto evade taxes.    Mann, 161 F.3d at 859.\n\n           Grunewald   also    illustrates   the   potential     breadth   of\n\nconspiracies under section 371. Although the case was tried on the\n\ntheory that the defendants' conspiratorial objective was to obtain\n\n\"no prosecution\" rulings for certain taxpayers, the indictment\n\nembraced the theory that the conspiracy's central object extended\n\nbeyond   those   provisional    rulings   \"to   immunize   the    taxpayers\n\ncompletely from prosecution for tax evasion.\"        Grunewald, 353 U.S.\n\nat 408. The Supreme Court concluded that, under the limited theory\n\npresented to the jury, the acts of concealment following the \"no\n\nprosecution\" rulings could only be viewed as post-conspiracy cover-\n\nup to protect the defendants.      Under the broader theory, however,\n\nthose acts could be viewed as conduct in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy to fully protect the taxpayers from tax liability.              Id.\n\nat 409-411.\n\n           The Court remanded the case for a new trial because the\n\njury charge did not distinguish between concealment in order to\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fachieve the central purpose of the more broadly stated conspiracy\n\n(immunization of the taxpayers from tax-evasion prosecution), and\n\nconcealment   intended   solely   to     cover   up    a   completed    crime\n\n(obtaining the \"no prosecution\" rulings).        Id.   at 413-14.      To find\n\nthat the acts of concealment that took place within the limitations\n\nperiod were in furtherance of the conspiracy, the jury needed to\n\nfind that \"the basic aim of the conspiracy was not yet attained\" at\n\nthat time – a determination the jury was not asked to make.             Id. at\n\n414.\n\n          As far as we know, therefore, the present\n          convictions were based on the impermissible\n          theory . . . that a subordinate agreement to\n          conceal the conspiracy continued after the\n          central aim of the conspiracy had been\n          accomplished. . . .\n\n          [T]he judge's charge left it open for the jury\n          to convict even though they found that the\n          acts of concealment were motivated purely by\n          the purpose of the conspirators to cover up\n          their already accomplished crime. And this,\n          we think, was fatal error.\n\nId.\n\n          The majority fails to recognize that the indictment here\n\nis not similarly elastic.   The indictment charged a conspiracy to\n\ncommit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B),\n\nnot a more general conspiracy under section 371 \"to defraud the\n\nUnited States, or any agency thereof\" by concealing, through\n\nvarious unlawful actions, the theft of Queen's money. Although the\n\nindictment's conspiracy allegations included, under the heading\n\n\n                                  -44-\n\f\"Manner and Means,\" that \"[i]t was part of the conspiracy that\n\n[defendants] attempted to conceal or disguise the . . . source\n\n. . . or control of the illegal cash proceeds by failing to file\n\nincome tax returns . . . for the tax year 1999,\" the government's\n\ndescription   of    a   subsequent   tax    fraud   that   shared   the   same\n\nconcealment objective of the money laundering transactions cannot\n\nturn the specific conspiracy alleged – to commit money laundering\n\n– into a general conspiracy to conceal funds.19\n\n          Unlike the section 371 conspiracy charged in Mann, which\n\nincluded a separate tax fraud objective, or the conspiracy charged\n\nin Grunewald, whose general purpose to defraud the United States\n\ncould   embrace     acts   of   concealment     subsequent     to   the   \"no\n\nprosecution\" ruling, a conspiracy to commit money laundering –\n\ni.e., a conspiracy to conduct financial transactions – cannot, by\n\nits terms, include a \"central criminal purpose\" to conceal income\n\nfrom the IRS.      Grunewald, 353 U.S. at 405.        Put most simply, the\n\ntax evasion did not further the \"central aim\" of the conspiracy,\n\nwhich was to conduct financial transactions in order to conceal the\n\nsource of the $900,000.      Hence, the tax evasion was not within the\n\n\n\n\n19\n   The indictment originally included a count under section 371\nalleging a conspiracy to structure transactions for the purpose of\nevading federal currency reporting requirements.    See 31 U.S.C.\n§§ 5324(a)(3), 5322.      As noted earlier, the district court\ndismissed that count on the basis of the statute of limitations.\nSee United States v. Upton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2463883\"><a href=\"/opinion/2463883/united-states-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The      conspiracy    charge   was\n\ntherefore barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n                                       V.\n\n             The majority is correct, of course, that Upton's failure\n\nto file the 1999 tax return bears some relationship to the money\n\nlaundering conspiracy.        As I have noted, both crimes share a\n\npurpose to cover up the theft from Queen, with the tax evasion\n\npresumably    having   the    added    purpose   to    cover   up   the   money\n\nlaundering.        Both the facts and the law, however, preclude a\n\nfinding by the jury that there was an express original subsidiary\n\nagreement among the conspirators to cover up their crime, or a\n\nfinding that the failure to file the 1999 return was an act of\n\nconcealment done in furtherance of the money laundering conspiracy\n\nwithin the meaning of Grunewald. Thus, while Upton was charged and\n\nproperly convicted of the separate crime of failing to file a tax\n\nreturn, the majority errs in treating that independent crime as a\n\npart of the money laundering conspiracy.\n\n             Because the conspiracy charge was time-barred, Upton's\n\nconviction on Count 4 of the indictment should be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -46-\n\f</pre>",
