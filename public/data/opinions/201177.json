R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-2599\n\n                   FREDERICK J.

Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Selya, Torruella and Lynch,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Frederick J. and June M. Barry on brief pro se.\n     Donald E. Gardner and Devine, Millimet & Branch, P.A., on\nbrief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             August 6, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam.           The sole issue in this case is whether the\n\ndistrict    court     properly     denied    the     plaintiffs'   motion    for\n\nreconsideration       of    the   underlying      judgment   granting    summary\n\njudgment for the defendants.          Because the plaintiffs' brief does\n\nnot address the propriety of the order denying reconsideration, the\n\nissue is waived.       Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records, 370 F.3d\n\n183, 188 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n     The denial of the motion for reconsideration was proper in any\n\nevent.   The plaintiffs' motion sought to set aside the judgment as\n\nlegally erroneous.         Such a motion is properly treated as a motion\n\nbrought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).              Feinstein v. Moses, 951 F.2d\n\n16, 19 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991).          Rule 59(e) gives an aggrieved party\n\nten days (excluding intermediate weekends and legal holidays)\n\nwithin which     to    file   a   motion    for    reconsideration.      Garcia-\n\nVelazquez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean, 358 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).     The ten-day deadline is mandatory, Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b),\n\nand a district court has no power or discretion to modify it.\n\nVargas v. Gonzalez, 975 F.2d 916, 917 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam).\n\n     In this case, the district court entered judgment on October\n\n7, 2003.    The Rule 59(e) motion was thus due on October 22, 2003.\n\nThe plaintiffs did not file their motion until October 23, 2003.\n\nTherefore, the motion was untimely.               A district court is without\n\njurisdiction to grant an untimely Rule 59(e) motion.                  Browder v.\n\nDirector, Dep't of Corr., 434 U.S. 257, 263 & n.7 (1978); Garcia-\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fVelazquez, 358 F.3d at 11.      Accordingly, the order denying the\n\nmotion for reconsideration was proper.1\n\n      The plaintiffs' attempt to secure review of the underlying\n\njudgment is to no avail.   The plaintiffs ask that we excuse their\n\nuntimely filings and review the merits of the judgment because of\n\ntheir pro se status and because they were \"lulled\" by the district\n\ncourt into believing that their notice of appeal was timely as to\n\nboth the motion for reconsideration and the underlying judgment.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has recognized that an untimely appeal may\n\nbe heard under \"unique circumstances,\" this exception \"applies only\n\nwhere a party has performed an act which, if properly done, would\n\npostpone the deadline for filing his appeal and has received\n\nspecific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been\n\nproperly done.\" Osterneck v. Ernst & Whinney, 489 U.S. 169, 178-79\n\n(1989).\n\n      In this case, the district court did not take any action or\n\nmake any statement regarding the timeliness of the motion for\n\nreconsideration, nor do the plaintiffs point to any such statement\n\nor   action.   Rather,   the   plaintiffs'   sole   support   for   their\n\ncontention that they were \"lulled into complacency\" is the fact\n\n\n      1\n        Even if we consider the merits of the motion for\nreconsideration, it was still properly denied.         The motion\nessentially reiterated the arguments the plaintiffs made in\nopposing the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Relief under\nRule 59(e) is for manifest errors of law or newly discovered\nevidence. Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d\n607, 612 (1st Cir. 2000). The plaintiffs pointed to neither.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthat the district court accepted their motion for reconsideration\n\nfor filing and denied it without any explanation.                 The district\n\ncourt's acceptance and subsequent denial of the motion, without\n\nmore, is simply not the sort of \"specific assurance\" required to\n\njustify the application of the \"unique circumstances\" exception.\n\nSee Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 20 (holding that order which erroneously\n\ngranted motion to enlarge time for filing nondescript motion for\n\nreconsideration in no way excused late notice of appeal). Nor does\n\nthe plaintiffs' pro se status absolve them from compliance with the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.            Id.\n\n     Accordingly,      insofar    as   the   plaintiffs'   appeal    seeks   to\n\nchallenge the October 7, 2003 judgment, it is dismissed for lack of\n\nappellate jurisdiction.          Insofar as it seeks to challenge the\n\nNovember   4,   2003    order    denying      the   plaintiffs'    motion    for\n\nreconsideration, the order is affirmed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f",
