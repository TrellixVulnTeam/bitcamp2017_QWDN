R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 04-1018\n\n                             UNITED STATES,\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                     DIANA VEGERANO-RODRIGUEZ,\n                       Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                                                               Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond Sanchez-Maceira on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez Sosa,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                             April 13, 2005\n\f          Per Curiam. Appellant, Diana Vegerano-Rodriguez, appeals\n\nfrom the United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico's (Perez-Gimenez, J.) denial of her motion for an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the issue of the propriety of the government's motives\n\nin refusing to file a downward departure motion for substantial\n\nassistance pursuant to a plea agreement.    She further appeals the\n\ncourt's imposition of the drug-testing condition on her supervised\n\nrelease term.\n\n          Considering first the denial of an evidentiary hearing,\n\nwe find no abuse of discretion.    See United States v. Alegria, 192\n\nF.3d 179, 189 (1st Cir. 1999); David v. United States, 134 F.3d\n\n470, 477 (1st Cir. 1998).       The government met its burden of\n\nproduction: it provided facially adequate reasons for its belief\n\nthat Vegerano-Rodriguez did not satisfy the terms of the plea\n\nagreement for substantial assistance.      See Alegria, 192 F.3d at\n\n189; United States v. Garcia, 698 F.2d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 1983).   The\n\nplea agreement conditioned substantial assistance upon Vegerano-\n\nRodriguez providing, inter alia, \"full, complete, and substantial\n\ncooperation.\"   According to the government's proffer, however, she\n\ndid not initially provide all information known to her and only\n\nlater told the complete truth when the government made efforts to\n\nextract it from her.\n\n          Moreover,    the   district   court   correctly   concluded\n\nVegerano-Rodriguez did not meet her burden of making a \"substantial\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthreshold showing\" that the government had an unconstitutional\n\nmotive in refusing to file a substantial assistance motion.                Wade\n\nv. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 186 (1992); Alegria, 192 F.3d at\n\n188.       In her motion, she largely ignored the issue of whether the\n\ngovernment acted in an unconstitutional manner, putting the bulk of\n\nher    effort     into   proving   that     she   had   provided    substantial\n\nassistance. See Wade, 504 U.S. at 186.                  The few allegations\n\nVegerano-Rodriguez         made     that      concern     the      government's\n\nunconstitutional motives state conclusions instead of facts and\n\nsupport, at most, government carelessness.              See Alegria, 192 F.3d\n\nat 189; United States v. Doe, 170 F.3d 223, 225-26 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n               Considering the drug testing condition, we hold that the\n\ndistrict court improperly delegated its authority.                 The district\n\ncourt's sentence included a five-year term of supervised release\n\nwith the condition that, \"[Vegerano-Rodriguez] shall refrain from\n\nany unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to one drug\n\ntest within fifteen days of release and thereafter, as required by\n\nthe probation officer.\"1           The parties do not dispute that this\n\n\n       1\n      The written sentence differs from the oral sentence.      It\nstates, \"[t]he defendant shall submit to one drug test within 15\ndays of release from imprisonment.    If any such samples detect\nsubstance abuse, the defendant shall participate in a substance\nabuse treatment program arranged and approved by the Probation\nofficer until duly discharged by authorized program personnel with\napproval of the Probation officer.\" Where a district court's oral\nexpression of its sentencing rationale varies materially from its\nsubsequent written expression of that rationale, appellate courts\nhave tended to honor the former at the expense of the latter.\nUnited States v. Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 579 (1st Cir. 1996); United\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcondition constitutes an improper delegation of authority to the\n\nprobation officer.      We agree.     In United States v. Melendez-\n\nSantana, 353 F.3d 93, 102-106 (1st Cir. 2003), we held that\n\nvirtually identical language violated the \"clear Congressional\n\nmandate\" that, following the initial drug test within fifteen days\n\nof release, there must be at least two periodic drug tests as\n\ndetermined by the court.    18 U.S.C. § 3583(d).\n\n          Accordingly, we vacate the sentence to the extent it\n\nimproperly delegates the district court's authority to determine\n\nthe maximum number of drug tests required during the appellant's\n\nsupervised release term, and we remand to the district court for\n\nfurther action consistent with this opinion.       We affirm, however,\n\nthe district court's denial of Vegerano-Rodriguez's request for an\n\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\nStates v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 42 n.5 (1st Cir. 1995). Here, both\nthe oral and written condition improperly delegate authority to the\nprobation officer, so the fact that our analysis concerns the oral\nsentence is of no consequence.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
