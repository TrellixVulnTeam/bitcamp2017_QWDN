In this  appeal, plaintiff-\n                               \n\nappellant Allan S. Bird challenges the district court's entry\n\nof summary judgment  against him and  in favor of  defendant-\n\nappellee  Centennial  Insurance  Company  on  his  claim that\n\ndefendant breached  two  fidelity  insurance  policies  (\"the\n\nPolicies\").    After  careful  consideration  of  plaintiff's\n\narguments, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiff is the general partner of fifteen limited\n\npartnerships that  own and  operate residential  multi-family\n\nhousing  projects throughout the United States.  The projects\n\nare  subsidized to  varying  degrees  by  the  United  States\n\nDepartment  of Housing  and Urban  Development  (\"HUD\").   To\n\nassist in the operation of the projects, the partnerships had\n\nentered into certain management agreements  with Capital Site\n\nManagement  Company   (\"Capital\")  and/or   Asset  Management\n\nCorporation (\"Asset\").   Capital managed all of  the projects\n\nuntil September 1987, at which  time it became inactive.  The\n\nagreements were then taken over by Asset, which can fairly be\n\ndescribed as the corporate reincarnation of Capital.  \n\n          John Panagako  was the  president and  treasurer of\n\nCapital and  owned 50% of  the company's  stock.   Panagako's\n\nwife, Janice Panagako, owned the  other 50%.  John and Janice\n\nPanagako  were also the  only directors of  Capital; however,\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nJanice  Panagako's duties  were clerical  and secretarial  in\n\nnature.   No  formal  directors'  meetings  were  ever  held.\n\nAsset's structure was  identical to Capital's except  for the\n\nfact that John Panagako was  Asset's sole shareholder.  It is\n\nclear from the record that John Panagako had complete control\n\nover both of these corporations.\n\n          Each  of  the  management  agreements  contained  a\n\nprovision  requiring the  managing  agent,  i.e., Capital  or\n\nAsset,  to procure fidelity insurance to protect against loss\n\ndue   to  fraudulent  or  dishonest  acts  committed  by  its\n\nemployees.  In relevant part, the provision states:\n\n          19.   Fidelity  Bond.    The  Agent  will\n                               \n          furnish, at  his  [sic]  own  expense,  a\n          fidality [sic] bond  in the principal sum\n          of  at  least  an  amount  equal  to  the\n          [project's]  gross  potential  income for\n          two  months and  is [sic]  conditioned to\n                                                   \n          protect the Owner  and [the Secretary  of\n                                                   \n          HUD    and    the    mortgagee]   against\n                                        \n          misapplication  of project  funds by  the\n          Agent and its employees.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Plaintiff  contends that the  inclusion of this provision\nwas mandated by HUD \"regulations.\"   However, the record does\nnot  reflect, and we cannot locate,  any HUD regulation which\n                                                       \naffirmatively  requires  managing  agents  of  HUD-subsidized\nproperties  to purchase fidelity  bonds.  Rather,  it appears\nthat plaintiff's argument is premised upon (1) a provision of\nthe HUD  Handbook,    4381.5 REV-1,  which requires  property\nmanagers to obtain  fidelity coverage for both  principals of\nthe  management  entity  and  \"all  persons  who  participate\ndirectly or indirectly  in the management and  maintenance of\nthe project and  its assets, accounts  and records\"; and  (2)\nthe affidavit of G. Richard Dunnells, former Deputy Assistant\nSecretary  for Housing Management  at HUD, which  states that\nthe  aforementioned  Handbook  provision  was promulgated  in\nresponse to 24 C.F.R.    207.10, which requires the mortgagor\nof HUD-insured properties \"to keep the property  insured by a\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n(Emphasis  supplied).     Apparently  in  response   to  this\n\nprovision,  Capital  and  Asset  secured from  defendant  the\n\nPolicies at issue in this  litigation.  In relevant part, the\n\nPolicies  provided   coverage  for  the   \"[l]oss  of  money,\n\nsecurities and other property which the insured shall sustain\n\n.  .  . through  any  fraudulent  or  dishonest act  or  acts\n\ncommitted  by  any  of  the  employees  acting  alone  or  in\n                                      \n\ncollusion  with  others.\"   (Emphasis  supplied).    The term\n\n\"employee\" was then, in relevant part, defined as follows:\n\n          [A]ny natural  person (except  a director\n          or   trustee   of  the   insured,   if  a\n          corporation, who  is not also  an officer\n          or   employee  thereof   in  some   other\n          capacity) while in the regular service of\n          the insured in the ordinary course of the\n          insured's business  during the  Effective\n          Period of this insuring form and whom the\n                                                   \n          insured . . . has the right to govern and\n                                                   \n          direct   in  the   performance  of   such\n                                                   \n          service, but  does not  mean any  broker,\n                 \n          factor,  commission merchant,  consignee,\n          contractor    or    agent     or    other\n          representative   of   the   same  general\n          character.\n\n(Emphasis  supplied).    Importantly,  however,  despite  the\n\ndirectives  of paragraph 19 of the management agreements, (1)\n\nonly  Capital and  Asset  were named  as  insureds under  the\n\nPolicies,  and (2)  the terms of  the Policies  excluded from\n\n                    \n\nstandard  policy  or  policies against  fire  and  such other\nhazards  as the  Commissioner,  upon  the  insurance  of  the\nmortgage, may stipulate.\" \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ncoverage misapplications  by the  managing agents,  i.e., the\n\ninsureds, themselves.2\n\n          By February  1989, plaintiff  had become  concerned\n\nthat  John Panagako was making improper payments from project\n\nfunds.   Accordingly,  plaintiff  terminated  the  management\n\nagreements.    Subsequently,  plaintiff filed  a  state court\n\naction against John  Panagako, Capital, and Asset  for breach\n\nof  fiduciary   duty,   breach   of   contract,   conversion,\n\nmisrepresentation, fraud, money  had and received, breach  of\n\nthe covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of\n\nthe Massachusetts Unfair  Trade Practices statute.   See Bird\n                                                             \n\nv.  Capital Site Management  Co., Civil No.  89-1713-C (Mass.\n                                \n\nSuper. Ct. 1989).  A jury verdict was returned in plaintiff's\n\nfavor on all counts, and damages were ultimately  assessed at\n\nnearly $1.2 million.\n\n          In  July  1990,  plaintiff  initiated  the  instant\n\naction in Massachusetts Superior Court, asserting that he was\n\nentitled  to collect as  a third-party beneficiary  under the\n\nPolicies.  Defendant  removed the case to the  district court\n\nand  subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that no\n\ncoverage existed because  plaintiff was not an  insured under\n\nthe Policies.   Thereafter, plaintiff obtained  an assignment\n\n                    \n\n2.  Specifically,  Exclusion  A  of  the  Policies  provided:\n\"This insuring form does not apply .  . . to loss due to  any\nfraudulent, dishonest  or criminal  act by  any insured or  a\npartner  therein, whether acting  alone or in  collusion with\nothers . . . .\"\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nof all the right, title, and interest of Capital and Asset in\n\nthe  Policies,  and  moved  for  leave  to  file  an  amended\n\ncomplaint  so  as  to  jettison  his third-party  beneficiary\n\ntheory and assert in its  place an entitlement to coverage as\n\na  direct beneficiary  under  the Policies.   The  motion for\n\nleave to file the amended complaint was allowed.\n\n          In January  1992, defendant  filed a  second motion\n\nfor summary judgment, arguing  primarily that plaintiff could\n\nnot collect  under the  Policies because  the fraudulent  and\n\ndishonest acts giving rise to the claim were not committed by\n\nan \"employee\" of the insureds,  but instead were committed by\n\nthe  insureds' \"alter ego.\"3   Plaintiff opposed  the motion,\n\narguing  inter alia, that  defendant should be  estopped from\n                   \n\ndenying  coverage  under  the  policies.    He  also filed  a\n\nconditional  motion, pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(f),4 for\n\n                    \n\n3.  We  use  the term  \"alter  ego\"  as  a shorthand  way  of\nidentifying  any  natural person  whom the  corporate insured\ndoes  not  have  \"the  right  to govern  and  direct  in  the\nperformance of  [his/her]  service.\"   As  noted  previously,\nunder the terms  of the Policies,  such an alter  ego is  not\nconsidered  an employee  of  the  corporate  insured.    And,\nbecause  the Policies only cover fraudulent or dishonest acts\nby   employees  of  the  corporate  insureds,  fraudulent  or\ndishonest acts  by an alter  ego of the insureds  are outside\nthe scope of coverage.\n\n4.  Rule 56(f) provides:\n\n          When Affidavits  are Unavailable.   Should  it\n          When Affidavits  are Unavailable.\n     appear  from the affidavits of a party opposing the\n     [Rule  56] motion that the party cannot for reasons\n     stated  present  by  affidavit  facts essential  to\n     justify  the  party's  opposition,  the  court  may\n     refuse  the application for judgment or may order a\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nfurther  discovery  relevant  to  his  newly-raised  estoppel\n\nargument.   In  February 1993,  the district  court issued  a\n\nmemorandum  and order granting  defendant's second motion for\n\nsummary  judgment.   In so  doing, the  court held  that John\n\nPanagako was  not an employee  of the insureds, and  that the\n\nPolicies  therefore  did  not  cover  his  fraudulent  and/or\n\ndishonest  acts.    See  supra  note 3.    It  also  rejected\n                              \n\nplaintiff's estoppel argument, reasoning that the doctrine of\n\n\"unclean hands\" barred  any recovery by plaintiff.   Finally,\n\nthe court denied  plaintiff's Rule 56(f) motion.   It is from\n\nthese decisions that plaintiff appeals.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                  SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n                                           \n\n          Summary judgment  permits a  court to  \"`pierce the\n\nboilerplate of the  pleadings and assay the parties' proof in\n\norder  to  determine whether  trial  is  actually required.'\"\n\nSantiago v. Sherwin  Williams Co., 3 F.3d 546,  548 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1993) (quoting Wynne  v. Tufts  Univ.

Oct. 19, 1993).\n\n          It  is  against  this  backdrop  that  we  evaluate\n\nplaintiff's contentions.  \n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                         DISCUSSION5\n\n                         DISCUSSION5\n                                    \n\n          Plaintiff  essentially  makes  three  arguments  on\n\nappeal:  (1) that the  district court erred in concluding, as\n\na  matter of  law,  that the  fraudulent  and dishonest  acts\n\ngiving  rise to  plaintiff's claim were  not committed  by an\n\nemployee of the  insureds, but instead were  committed by the\n\ninsureds' alter  ego; (2) that  the court erred  in rejecting\n\nhis  claim that  defendant should,  as  a matter  of law,  be\n\nestopped  from denying coverage  under the Policies;  and (3)\n\nthat the  court erred in  denying his alternative  Rule 56(f)\n\nmotion for additional discovery on the issue of estoppel.  We\n\ndiscuss each argument in turn.\n\n     A.  Was John Panagako  an Employee of Capital and Allied\n                                                             \nor was he their Alter Ego?\n                          \n\n                    \n\n5.  Because the parties agree  that Massachusetts law governs\nthis dispute,  and because  there is  at least  a \"reasonable\nrelation\" between the  dispute and  the forum  whose law  has\nbeen  selected by the parties, we  will forego an independent\nanalysis of the  choice-of-law issue and apply  Massachusetts\nlaw.   See Commercial  Union Ins. Co.  v. Walbrook  Ins. Co.,\n                                                             \nLtd., No.  92-2415, slip  op. at 2,  n.1 (1st Cir.

First,\n\naccepting the district court's conclusion that the definition\n\nof  the term \"employee\" is unambiguous, plaintiff argues that\n\nthe court erred in concluding that John Panagako fell outside\n\nthe definition's  boundaries.    Second,  and  alternatively,\n\nplaintiff argues that the definition of  the term employee is\n\nambiguous,  and that this  ambiguity must be  resolved in his\n\nfavor  under  Massachusetts  law.    E.g.,  Massachusetts Bay\n                                                             \n\nTransp. Auth. v. Allianz Ins.

Plaintiff's First Argument \n          1.  Plaintiff's First Argument\n                                        \n\n          In addressing plaintiff's  first argument, that the\n\nPolicies unambiguously  provide coverage  for the  fraudulent\n\nand/or  dishonest acts committed  by John Panagako,  we begin\n\n                    \n\n6.  Relying  on a series  of cases regarding  corporate \"veil\npiercing,\" and defining the \"alter ego defense\" here at issue\nas  the  mere  defensive application  of  this  veil piercing\ndoctrine, plaintiff also  devotes several pages of  his brief\nto  arguing that Massachusetts courts would not recognize the\ndefense.      Plaintiff's   argument   in   this   regard  is\nfundamentally  flawed.   The alter  ego  defense asserted  by\ndefendant  is not  a  common  law defense;  rather,  it is  a\n                 \ndefense derived from the language of the Policies themselves.\n                                                            \nAs such, the  common law tort cases relied  upon by plaintiff\nin his reverse  veil piercing argument are  inapposite to the\ncontract dispute before us. \n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nwith  some general  ground rules  for interpreting  insurance\n\ncontracts.

See 13  Ronald A. Anderson and Mark S.\n                          \n\nRhodes, Couch on  Insurance 2d,   46:25 at 33  (1982).  Here,\n                              \n\nthe  parties  agreed  that, inter  alia,  only  those natural\n                                       \n\npersons \"whom the insured  . . . has the right  to govern and\n\ndirect  in the  performance  of  [their]  service\"  would  be\n\n\"employees\" covered by the Policies.   Thus, if John Panagako\n\nwas not subject to governance and direction by Capital and/or\n\nAllied, he was not  an employee of the insureds as  that term\n\nis defined by the Policies.\n\n          As  we have said,  the record clearly  reveals that\n\nJohn Panagako was not subject to governance  and direction by\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nCapital or Allied, in that he was in complete control of both\n\ncorporations.  He owned 50% of Capital's and 100% of Allied's\n\nstock  and   was  the   president  and   treasurer  of   both\n\ncorporations.  He  and  his wife  Janice,  whose  duties were\n\nclerical  and  secretarial  in  nature,  were  the  only  two\n\ndirectors of the corporations.  No formal directors' meetings\n\nwere ever held.\n\n          Indeed, plaintiff  does not  dispute the  fact that\n\nJohn Panagako was in complete control  of Capital and Allied.\n\nInstead,  he premises his  challenge to the  district court's\n\ndetermination  that Panagako  was not  an  employee upon  two\n\ncontentions:  (1)  that the corporations had  the theoretical\n\nright to govern  and direct Panagako, making  him an employee\n\nunder the terms of the  Policies; and (2) that \"the right  to\n\ngovern and direct language was merely intended to distinguish\n\nthose  persons within the  corporation[s] whose acts  are not\n\ncovered  by the Policies (i.e., employees) from those persons\n\noutside of the corporation[s]  whose acts are not  covered by\n\nthe Policies (i.e., independent contractors and the like).\"\n\n          With respect  to plaintiff's  first contention,  we\n\njoin those  courts that have  passed on the issue  and reject\n\nthe claim that  the theoretical right to govern  and direct a\n\ndominant corporate actor  is sufficient to render  that actor\n\nan employee under the definition of employee set forth in the\n\nPolicies.

We think it\n         \n\napparent that the \"right\" to govern and direct referred to in\n\nthe Policies  must be more  than an ephemeral  right inhering\n\ngenerally in  the corporate form;  rather, it must  have some\n\ngrounding in reality.

In this\n\ncase, the argument  that Capital and Allied had  the right to\n\ngovern and  direct John  Panagako lacks  any credible  basis.\n\nAccordingly, we  do not accept it.   Cf. J.I.

It is obvious  that this language, far from being\n\nincluded  merely to  distinguish  employees  from those  non-\n\nemployee actors specified in the  Policies, materially limits\n\nthe definition of  the term \"employee\" to those  persons over\n\nwhom the corporate insureds have control.  Accordingly, we so\n\n                    \n\n7.  Our   conclusion    also   is    supported   by    policy\nconsiderations.  As the Fifth Circuit has observed:\n\n     A corporation can only act through its officers and\n     directors.   When  one  person  owns a  controlling\n     interest  in  the  corporation  and  dominates  the\n     corporation's   actions,    his   acts    are   the\n     corporation's  acts.   Allowing the  corporation to\n     recover  for  the owner's  fraudulent  or dishonest\n     conduct would essentially allow the corporation  to\n     recover  for its own  fraudulent or dishonest acts.\n     The   [fidelity]  bonds,   however,  were   clearly\n     designed to  insure the corporations  against their\n     employee's [sic]  dishonest acts and not  their own\n     dishonest acts.\n\nMatter   of  World  Hospitality,  983  F.2d  at  652  (citing\n                               \nCalifornia  Union Ins.,  948 F.2d  at  566).   The fact  that\n                      \nplaintiff,  and not the  insureds, is seeking  coverage under\nthe  Policies   does  not   diminish  the   force  of   these\nconsiderations  in this case,  for plaintiff is  pressing his\nclaim as an assignee.  As such, his rights under the Policies\nare limited  to those  of  the assignors.   See  17 Couch  on\n                                                             \nInsurance 2d,   63A:267 at 146 (1983) (\"It must be recognized\n            \nthat the assignee can receive no greater rights than those of\nthe assignor.\").\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nread it.

Plaintiff's Second Argument\n                                         \n\n          Plaintiff's second  and alternative  argument, that\n\nthe definition of the  term \"employee\" is ambiguous and  that\n\nthis ambiguity must be resolved in his favor, requires little\n\ndiscussion.   In making  his alternative  argument, plaintiff\n\ndoes  not explain  how the  definition of  the term  might be\n\nambiguous.     Nor  does  he  make  any   attempt  either  to\n\ndistinguish or to disagree with  the several cases which have\n\ntreated  this very  definition as  unambiguous.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nMatter of World  Hospitality, 983 F.2d at  651-53; California\n                                                             \n\nUnion  Ins., 948 F.2d  at 566-67;  Three Garden  Village, 567\n                                                        \n\nA.2d  at 90-92;  Employer's Admin.

Innamorati, 996  F.2d 456, 468\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir.)

In  that   section   of   his   brief   where   plaintiff\nperfunctorily   asserts  that   the   terms  \"employee\"   and\n\"insured,\" see infra note 9,  are ambiguous, he also seeks to\n                    \nintroduce  extrinsic evidence that the Policies at issue were\nmandated by HUD  \"regulations,\" but see supra note 1.   In so\n                                             \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          In  sum, we  reject  plaintiff's  challenge to  the\n\ndistrict  court's determination that John Panagako was not an\n\nemployee, but rather was  an alter ego, of the insureds.9    \n\n     B.  Should  Defendant be Estopped from  Denying Coverage\n                                                             \nUnder the Policies?\n                   \n\n          Plaintiff's  second  argument,  that  the  district\n\ncourt  erred  in  refusing,  as  a matter  of  law,  to  hold\n\ndefendant estopped from  denying coverage, is based  upon his\n\nclaim that defendant knew of Capital's and Allied's corporate\n\nstructures  at  the  time  the  Policies  were  issued.   See\n                                                             \n\nFidelity and Deposit  Co. v.

At most,\nthe \"regulations\" to which plaintiff draws our attention tend\nto  reinforce the  perception  that  the  Policies  were  not\nwritten  in accordance  with the  specifications  of HUD  and\nparagraph  19 of  the management  agreements.   They do  not,\n                                                            \nhowever,  shed light on  what the parties  intended when they\nincluded the disputed terms in the Policies.\n\n9.  Because we so  rule, we need not  reach defendant's other\nproffered basis for  affirmance, i.e., that Exclusion  A, see\n                                                             \nsupra note  2, is applicable  because John  Panagako, as  the\n     \nalter ego of  Capital and Allied, was an  \"insured\" under the\nterms  of  the Policies.    Nor, obviously,  need  we discuss\nplaintiff's cursory  argument that  the meaning  of the  term\n\"insured\" in Exclusion A is ambiguous.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nunder  the fidelity bond, and (2) \"knew everything\" about the\n\ninsured's  operation), affirmed in part, vacated in part, 463\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 4 (5th Cir. 1972).  While we think that the USAFORM case\n                                                        \n\nis  easily distinguishable  from  the present  situation,  we\n\nbelieve  that plaintiff's estoppel claim founders for an even\n\nsimpler  reason.    As  the  district  court  noted,  because\n\nplaintiff  is proceeding  as the  assignee  of Capital's  and\n\nAllied's rights  under the  Policies, he  is  subject to  any\n\ndefenses that defendant could have interposed against Capital\n\nand Allied, the  assignors.  See Great Am. Ins. Co. v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 575 F.2d 1031,  1034 (2d Cir. 1978).  One  defense to\n      \n\nthe equitable  claim of estoppel is the  doctrine of \"unclean\n\nhands.\"   See Peabody Gas &amp; Oil Co.  v. Standard Oil Co., 187\n                                                        \n\nN.E. 112, 113 (Mass. 1933) (\"[O]ne must come  into a court of\n\nequity with clean hands in order to  secure relief . . . .\").\n\nHere,  Capital  and  Allied  were  adjudged  liable  for  the\n\nfraudulent and/or dishonest actions underlying this suit.  As\n\nsuch, the district  court correctly ruled  that any claim  of\n\nestoppel they  might have  asserted  against defendant  would\n\nhave failed  because of their  unclean hands.   Plaintiff, as\n\ntheir assignee, is therefore subject to the same fate.\n\n          Accordingly, we reject plaintiff's challenge to the\n\ndistrict  court's  refusal to  hold  defendant  estopped from\n\ndenying coverage.\n\n     C.

Once  again, his  argument  is without\n\nmerit. \n\n          Rule  56(f) offers an  \"`escape hatch'\" to  a party\n\nopposing a  summary judgment  motion who \"genuinely  requires\n\nadditional  time to marshal  `facts essential to  justify its\n\nopposition.'\"  Mattoon  v.

Bird challenges the district court's entry of summary judgment against him and in favor of defendant-appellee Centennial Insurance Company on his claim that defendant breached two fidelity insurance policies (\"the Policies\").  After careful consideration of plaintiff's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff is the general partner of fifteen limited partnerships that own and operate residential multi-family housing projects throughout the United States.  The projects are subsidized to varying degrees by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\").  To assist in the operation of the projects, the partnerships had entered into certain management agreements with Capital Site Management Company (\"Capital\") and/or Asset Management Corporation (\"Asset\").  Capital managed all of the projects until September 1987, at which time it became inactive.  The agreements were then taken over by Asset, which can fairly be described as the corporate reincarnation of Capital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Panagako was the president and treasurer of Capital and owned 50% of the company's stock.  Panagako's wife, Janice Panagako, owned the other 50%.  John and Janice Panagako were also the only directors of Capital;  however, Janice Panagako's duties were clerical and secretarial in nature.  No formal directors' meetings were ever held.  Asset's structure was identical to Capital's except for the fact that John Panagako was Asset's sole shareholder.  It is clear from the record that John Panagako had complete control over both of these corporations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the management agreements contained a provision requiring the managing agent, i.e., Capital or Asset, to procure fidelity insurance to protect against loss due to fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by its employees.  In relevant part, the provision states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>19.  Fidelity Bond.   The Agent will furnish, at his [sic] own expense, a fidality [sic] bond in the principal sum of at least an amount equal to the [project's] gross potential income for two months and is [sic] conditioned to protect the Owner and [the Secretary of HUD and the mortgagee ] against misapplication of project funds by the Agent and its employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).  Apparently in response to this provision, Capital and Asset secured from defendant the Policies at issue in this litigation.  In relevant part, the Policies provided coverage for the \"[l]oss of money, securities and other property which the insured shall sustain ... through any fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by any of the employees acting alone or in collusion with others.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  The term \"employee\" was then, in relevant part, defined as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[A]ny natural person (except a director or trustee of the insured, if a corporation, who is not also an officer or employee thereof in some other capacity) while in the regular service of the insured in the ordinary course of the insured's business during the Effective Period of this insuring form and whom the insured ... has the right to govern and direct in the performance of such service, but does not mean any broker, factor, commission merchant, consignee, contractor or agent or other representative of the same general character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).  Importantly, however, despite the directives of paragraph 19 of the management agreements, (1) only Capital and Asset were named as insureds under the Policies, and (2) the terms of the Policies excluded from coverage misapplications by the managing agents, i.e., the insureds, themselves.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By February 1989, plaintiff had become concerned that John Panagako was making improper payments from project funds.  Accordingly, plaintiff terminated the management agreements.  Subsequently, plaintiff filed a state court action against John Panagako, Capital, and Asset for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, conversion, misrepresentation, fraud, money had and received, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of the Massachusetts Unfair Trade Practices statute.  See Bird v. Capital Site Management Co., Civil No. 89-1713-C (Mass.Super.Ct.1989).  A jury verdict was returned in plaintiff's favor on all counts, and damages were ultimately assessed at nearly $1.2 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1990, plaintiff initiated the instant action in Massachusetts Superior Court, asserting that he was entitled to collect as a third-party beneficiary under the Policies.  Defendant removed the case to the district court and subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that no coverage existed because plaintiff was not an insured under the Policies.  Thereafter, plaintiff obtained an assignment of all the right, title, and interest of Capital and Asset in the Policies, and moved for leave to file an amended complaint so as to jettison his third-party beneficiary theory and assert in its place an entitlement to coverage as a direct beneficiary under the Policies.  The motion for leave to file the amended complaint was allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1992, defendant filed a second motion for summary judgment, arguing primarily that plaintiff could not collect under the Policies because the fraudulent and dishonest acts giving rise to the claim were not committed by an \"employee\" of the insureds, but instead were committed by the insureds' \"alter ego.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing inter alia, that defendant should be estopped from denying coverage under the policies.  He also filed a conditional motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> for further discovery relevant to his newly-raised estoppel argument.  In February 1993, the district court issued a memorandum and order granting defendant's second motion for summary judgment.  In so doing, the court held that John Panagako was not an employee of the insureds, and that the Policies therefore did not cover his fraudulent and/or dishonest acts.  See supra note 3.  It also rejected plaintiff's estoppel argument, reasoning that the doctrine of \"unclean hands\" barred any recovery by plaintiff.  Finally, the court denied plaintiff's Rule 56(f) motion.  It is from these decisions that plaintiff appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment permits a court to \" 'pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.' \"  Santiago v.

Sch. of Medicine, 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1845, 123 L.Ed.2d 470 (1993)).  It must be granted when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Our review of the allowance of a summary judgment motion is plenary.  Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this backdrop that we evaluate plaintiff's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff essentially makes three arguments on appeal:  (1) that the district court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that the fraudulent and dishonest acts giving rise to plaintiff's claim were not committed by an employee of the insureds, but instead were committed by the insureds' alter ego;  (2) that the court erred in rejecting his claim that defendant should, as a matter of law, be estopped from denying coverage under the Policies;  and (3) that the court erred in denying his alternative Rule 56(f) motion for additional discovery on the issue of estoppel.  We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Was John Panagako an Employee of Capital and Allied or was he their Alter Ego?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk of plaintiff's brief is directed at attacking the district court's ruling that Panagako was an alter ego, and not an employee, of the corporate insureds.  The attack primarily is carried out on two fronts.  First, accepting the district court's conclusion that the definition of the term \"employee\" is unambiguous, plaintiff argues that the court erred in concluding that John Panagako fell outside the definition's boundaries.  Second, and alternatively, plaintiff argues that the definition of the term employee is ambiguous, and that this ambiguity must be resolved in his favor under Massachusetts law.  E.g., Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. v. Allianz Ins. Co., Inc., 413 Mass. 473, 597 N.E.2d 439, 441 (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We disagree with both of plaintiff's positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Plaintiff's First Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing plaintiff's first argument, that the Policies unambiguously provide coverage for the fraudulent and/or dishonest acts committed by John Panagako, we begin with some general ground rules for interpreting insurance contracts.  The construction of language in an insurance contract is a legal determination, see J.I. Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., 920 F.2d 118, 119 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting Massachusetts cases), which we review de novo, see Falmouth Nat'l Bank v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 920 F.2d 1058, 1061 (1st Cir.1990).  Where there is no ambiguity in the language at issue, we will interpret it \"according to the ordinary meaning of the words contained in its provisions.\"  J.I. Corp., 920 F.2d at 119.   The language of a contract is considered ambiguous only if its terms \"are fairly susceptible to more than one construction.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the intention of the parties as to who are employees is expressed in a fidelity policy, that intention will be given effect.  See 13 Ronald A. Anderson and Mark S. Rhodes, Couch on Insurance 2d, Sec. 46:25 at 33 (1982).  Here, the parties agreed that, inter alia, only those natural persons \"whom the insured ... has the right to govern and direct in the performance of [their] service\" would be \"employees\" covered by the Policies.  Thus, if John Panagako was not subject to governance and direction by Capital and/or Allied, he was not an employee of the insureds as that term is defined by the Policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, the record clearly reveals that John Panagako was not subject to governance and direction by Capital or Allied, in that he was in complete control of both corporations.  He owned 50% of Capital's and 100% of Allied's stock and was the president and treasurer of both corporations.  He and his wife Janice, whose duties were clerical and secretarial in nature, were the only two directors of the corporations.  No formal directors' meetings were ever held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, plaintiff does not dispute the fact that John Panagako was in complete control of Capital and Allied.  Instead, he premises his challenge to the district court's determination that Panagako was not an employee upon two contentions:  (1) that the corporations had the theoretical right to govern and direct Panagako, making him an employee under the terms of the Policies;  and (2) that \"the right to govern and direct language was merely intended to distinguish those persons within the corporation[s] whose acts are not covered by the Policies (i.e., employees) from those persons outside of the corporation[s] whose acts are not covered by the Policies (i.e., independent contractors and the like).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiff's first contention, we join those courts that have passed on the issue and reject the claim that the theoretical right to govern and direct a dominant corporate actor is sufficient to render that actor an employee under the definition of employee set forth in the Policies.  See Employer's Admin. Servs., Inc. v. Hartford Accident and Indem. Co., 709 P.2d 559, 562-63 (Ariz.App.1985);  Kerr v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 350 F.2d 146, 154-55 (4th Cir.1965);  see also, e.g., Matter of World Hospitality Ltd., 983 F.2d 650, 651-53 (5th Cir.1993) (interpreting identical \"right to govern and direct\" language in a fidelity policy as excluding from the definition of employee a majority shareholder who dominated his corporation);  California Union Ins. v. American Diversified Sav. Bank, 948 F.2d 556, 566 (9th Cir.1991) (same);  Three Garden Village Ltd. Partnership v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 567 A.2d 85, 90-92 (Md.1989) (same).  We think it apparent that the \"right\" to govern and direct referred to in the Policies must be more than an ephemeral right inhering generally in the corporate form;  rather, it must have some grounding in reality.  Cf. Kerr, 350 F.2d at 154 (describing corporation's \"right,\" under circumstances similar to those presented here, as \"unrealistic\" and \"theoretical\").  In this case, the argument that Capital and Allied had the right to govern and direct John Panagako lacks any credible basis.  Accordingly, we do not accept it.  Cf. J.I. Corp., 920 F.2d at 119 (insurance contracts should be construed according to the \" 'fair and reasonable meaning of the words in which the agreement of the parties is expressed' \") (emphasis supplied) (quoting Cody v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 387 Mass. 142, 439 N.E.2d 234, 237 (Mass.1982)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiff's second contention, we think it sufficient to state that the interpretation plaintiff would have us ascribe to the \"right to govern and direct\" language in the Policies is tortured to the point of absurdity.  It is obvious that this language, far from being included merely to distinguish employees from those non-employee actors specified in the Policies, materially limits the definition of the term \"employee\" to those persons over whom the corporate insureds have control.  Accordingly, we so read it.  Cf. Plymouth Rubber Co. Inc. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 18 Mass.App. 364, 465 N.E.2d 1234, 1238 (1984) (declining to \"torture\" the meaning of a clause in an insurance contract where it was understandable in its \"usual and ordinary sense\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Plaintiff's Second Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's second and alternative argument, that the definition of the term \"employee\" is ambiguous and that this ambiguity must be resolved in his favor, requires little discussion.  In making his alternative argument, plaintiff does not explain how the definition of the term might be ambiguous.  Nor does he make any attempt either to distinguish or to disagree with the several cases which have treated this very definition as unambiguous.  See, e.g., Matter of World Hospitality, 983 F.2d at 651-53;  California Union Ins., 948 F.2d at 566-67;  Three Garden Village, 567 A.2d at 90-92;  Employer's Admin. Servs., 709 P.2d at 562.   Accordingly, his argument being perfunctory, we deem it waived.  See United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 468 (1st Cir.)  (issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner and without developed argumentation deemed waived on appeal), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 409, 126 L.Ed.2d 356 (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we reject plaintiff's challenge to the district court's determination that John Panagako was not an employee, but rather was an alter ego, of the insureds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Should Defendant be Estopped from Denying Coverage Under the Policies?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's second argument, that the district court erred in refusing, as a matter of law, to hold defendant estopped from denying coverage, is based upon his claim that defendant knew of Capital's and Allied's corporate structures at the time the Policies were issued.  See Fidelity and Deposit Co. v. USAFORM Hail Pool, Inc., 318 F.Supp. 1301, 1305, 1308-09 (M.D.Fla.1970) (insurer estopped from asserting alter ego defense where, inter alia, it (1) stipulated that the dominant shareholder was an employee under the fidelity bond, and (2) \"knew everything\" about the insured's operation), affirmed in part, vacated in part, 463 F.2d 4 (5th Cir.1972).  While we think that the USAFORM case is easily distinguishable from the present situation, we believe that plaintiff's estoppel claim founders for an even simpler reason.  As the district court noted, because plaintiff is proceeding as the assignee of Capital's and Allied's rights under the Policies, he is subject to any defenses that defendant could have interposed against Capital and Allied, the assignors.  See Great Am.  Ins. Co. v. United States, 575 F.2d 1031, 1034 (2d Cir.1978).  One defense to the equitable claim of estoppel is the doctrine of \"unclean hands.\"   See Peabody Gas &amp; Oil Co. v. Standard Oil Co., 284 Mass. 87, 187 N.E. 112, 113 (1933) (\"[O]ne must come into a court of equity with clean hands in order to secure relief....\").  Here, Capital and Allied were adjudged liable for the fraudulent and/or dishonest actions underlying this suit.  As such, the district court correctly ruled that any claim of estoppel they might have asserted against defendant would have failed because of their unclean hands.  Plaintiff, as their assignee, is therefore subject to the same fate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject plaintiff's challenge to the district court's refusal to hold defendant estopped from denying coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Should Plaintiff's Rule 56(f) Motion Have Been Granted?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiff contends that the court erred in denying his Rule 56(f) motion for additional discovery on the issue of estoppel.  Once again, his argument is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56(f) offers an \" 'escape hatch' \" to a party opposing a summary judgment motion who \"genuinely requires additional time to marshal 'facts essential to justify its opposition.' \"  Mattoon v.

Under Rule 56(f), the movant is required (1) to articulate a plausible basis for its belief that the requested discovery would raise a trialworthy issue, and (2) to demonstrate good cause for failing to have conducted the discovery earlier.  Mattoon, 980 F.2d at 7.   Our review of an order denying relief under Rule 56(f) is only for an abuse of discretion.

Moreover, the record reveals that this defense must prevail as a matter of law.

Plaintiff's argument in this regard is fundamentally flawed.  The alter ego defense asserted by defendant is not a common law defense;  rather, it is a defense derived from the language of the Policies themselves.   As such, the common law tort cases relied upon by plaintiff in his reverse veil piercing argument are inapposite to the contract dispute before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Our conclusion also is supported by policy considerations.  As the Fifth Circuit has observed:</p>\n        <p>A corporation can only act through its officers and directors.  When one person owns a controlling interest in the corporation and dominates the corporation's actions, his acts are the corporation's acts.  Allowing the corporation to recover for the owner's fraudulent or dishonest conduct would essentially allow the corporation to recover for its own fraudulent or dishonest acts.  The [fidelity] bonds, however, were clearly designed to insure the corporations against their employee's [sic] dishonest acts and not their own dishonest acts.</p>\n        <p>Matter of World Hospitality, 983 F.2d at 652 (citing California Union Ins., 948 F.2d at 566).   The fact that plaintiff, and not the insureds, is seeking coverage under the Policies does not diminish the force of these considerations in this case, for plaintiff is pressing his claim as an assignee.  As such, his rights under the Policies are limited to those of the assignors.  See 17 Couch on Insurance 2d, Sec. 63A:267 at 146 (1983) (\"It must be recognized that the assignee can receive no greater rights than those of the assignor.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In that section of his brief where plaintiff perfunctorily asserts that the terms \"employee\" and \"insured,\" see infra note 9, are ambiguous, he also seeks to introduce extrinsic evidence that the Policies at issue were mandated by HUD \"regulations,\" but see supra note 1.  In so doing, he asserts that this fact will help to enlighten us as to the meaning of these purportedly ambiguous terms.  See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 986 F.2d 580, 586 (1st Cir.1993) (extrinsic evidence admissible to clarify ambiguous contractual provisions)</p>\n        <p>Even if we were to assume arguendo the truth of plaintiff's assertion, we do not see how such fact would tend to clarify anything at issue in this litigation.  At most, the \"regulations\" to which plaintiff draws our attention tend to reinforce the perception that the Policies were not written in accordance with the specifications of HUD and paragraph 19 of the management agreements.  They do not, however, shed light on what the parties intended when they included the disputed terms in the Policies.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Because we so rule, we need not reach defendant's other proffered basis for affirmance, i.e., that Exclusion A, see supra note 2, is applicable because John Panagako, as the alter ego of Capital and Allied, was an \"insured\" under the terms of the Policies.

Bird challenges the district court's entry of summary judgment against him and in favor of defendant-appellee Centennial Insurance Company on his claim that defendant breached two fidelity insurance policies (\"the Policies\").  After careful consideration of plaintiff's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff is the general partner of fifteen limited partnerships that own and operate residential multi-family housing projects throughout the United States.  The projects are subsidized to varying degrees by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\").  To assist in the operation of the projects, the partnerships had entered into certain management agreements with Capital Site Management Company (\"Capital\") and/or Asset Management Corporation (\"Asset\").  Capital managed all of the projects until September 1987, at which time it became inactive.  The agreements were then taken over by Asset, which can fairly be described as the corporate reincarnation of Capital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Panagako was the president and treasurer of Capital and owned 50% of the company's stock.  Panagako's wife, Janice Panagako, owned the other 50%.  John and Janice Panagako were also the only directors of Capital;  however, Janice Panagako's duties were clerical and secretarial in nature.  No formal directors' meetings were ever held.  Asset's structure was identical to Capital's except for the fact that John Panagako was Asset's sole shareholder.  It is clear from the record that John Panagako had complete control over both of these corporations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the management agreements contained a provision requiring the managing agent, i.e., Capital or Asset, to procure fidelity insurance to protect against loss due to fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by its employees.  In relevant part, the provision states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>19.  Fidelity Bond.   The Agent will furnish, at his [sic] own expense, a fidality [sic] bond in the principal sum of at least an amount equal to the [project's] gross potential income for two months and is [sic] conditioned to protect the Owner and [the Secretary of HUD and the mortgagee ] against misapplication of project funds by the Agent and its employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).  Apparently in response to this provision, Capital and Asset secured from defendant the Policies at issue in this litigation.  In relevant part, the Policies provided coverage for the \"[l]oss of money, securities and other property which the insured shall sustain ... through any fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by any of the employees acting alone or in collusion with others.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  The term \"employee\" was then, in relevant part, defined as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[A]ny natural person (except a director or trustee of the insured, if a corporation, who is not also an officer or employee thereof in some other capacity) while in the regular service of the insured in the ordinary course of the insured's business during the Effective Period of this insuring form and whom the insured ... has the right to govern and direct in the performance of such service, but does not mean any broker, factor, commission merchant, consignee, contractor or agent or other representative of the same general character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).  Importantly, however, despite the directives of paragraph 19 of the management agreements, (1) only Capital and Asset were named as insureds under the Policies, and (2) the terms of the Policies excluded from coverage misapplications by the managing agents, i.e., the insureds, themselves.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By February 1989, plaintiff had become concerned that John Panagako was making improper payments from project funds.  Accordingly, plaintiff terminated the management agreements.  Subsequently, plaintiff filed a state court action against John Panagako, Capital, and Asset for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, conversion, misrepresentation, fraud, money had and received, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of the Massachusetts Unfair Trade Practices statute.  See Bird v. Capital Site Management Co., Civil No. 89-1713-C (Mass.Super.Ct.1989).  A jury verdict was returned in plaintiff's favor on all counts, and damages were ultimately assessed at nearly $1.2 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1990, plaintiff initiated the instant action in Massachusetts Superior Court, asserting that he was entitled to collect as a third-party beneficiary under the Policies.  Defendant removed the case to the district court and subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that no coverage existed because plaintiff was not an insured under the Policies.  Thereafter, plaintiff obtained an assignment of all the right, title, and interest of Capital and Asset in the Policies, and moved for leave to file an amended complaint so as to jettison his third-party beneficiary theory and assert in its place an entitlement to coverage as a direct beneficiary under the Policies.  The motion for leave to file the amended complaint was allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1992, defendant filed a second motion for summary judgment, arguing primarily that plaintiff could not collect under the Policies because the fraudulent and dishonest acts giving rise to the claim were not committed by an \"employee\" of the insureds, but instead were committed by the insureds' \"alter ego.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing inter alia, that defendant should be estopped from denying coverage under the policies.  He also filed a conditional motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> for further discovery relevant to his newly-raised estoppel argument.  In February 1993, the district court issued a memorandum and order granting defendant's second motion for summary judgment.  In so doing, the court held that John Panagako was not an employee of the insureds, and that the Policies therefore did not cover his fraudulent and/or dishonest acts.  See supra note 3.  It also rejected plaintiff's estoppel argument, reasoning that the doctrine of \"unclean hands\" barred any recovery by plaintiff.  Finally, the court denied plaintiff's Rule 56(f) motion.  It is from these decisions that plaintiff appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment permits a court to \" 'pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.' \"  Santiago v.

The attack primarily is carried out on two fronts.  First, accepting the district court's conclusion that the definition of the term \"employee\" is unambiguous, plaintiff argues that the court erred in concluding that John Panagako fell outside the definition's boundaries.  Second, and alternatively, plaintiff argues that the definition of the term employee is ambiguous, and that this ambiguity must be resolved in his favor under Massachusetts law.

Plaintiff's First Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing plaintiff's first argument, that the Policies unambiguously provide coverage for the fraudulent and/or dishonest acts committed by John Panagako, we begin with some general ground rules for interpreting insurance contracts.  The construction of language in an insurance contract is a legal determination, see J.I. Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552337\"><a href=\"/opinion/552337/ji-corp-fka-new-england-rare-coin-galleries-inc-v-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting Massachusetts cases), which we review de novo, see Falmouth Nat'l Bank v.

Where there is no ambiguity in the language at issue, we will interpret it \"according to the ordinary meaning of the words contained in its provisions.\"  J.I. Corp., 920 F.2d at 119.   The language of a contract is considered ambiguous only if its terms \"are fairly susceptible to more than one construction.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the intention of the parties as to who are employees is expressed in a fidelity policy, that intention will be given effect.  See 13 Ronald A. Anderson and Mark S. Rhodes, Couch on Insurance 2d, Sec. 46:25 at 33 (1982).  Here, the parties agreed that, inter alia, only those natural persons \"whom the insured ... has the right to govern and direct in the performance of [their] service\" would be \"employees\" covered by the Policies.  Thus, if John Panagako was not subject to governance and direction by Capital and/or Allied, he was not an employee of the insureds as that term is defined by the Policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, the record clearly reveals that John Panagako was not subject to governance and direction by Capital or Allied, in that he was in complete control of both corporations.  He owned 50% of Capital's and 100% of Allied's stock and was the president and treasurer of both corporations.  He and his wife Janice, whose duties were clerical and secretarial in nature, were the only two directors of the corporations.  No formal directors' meetings were ever held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, plaintiff does not dispute the fact that John Panagako was in complete control of Capital and Allied.  Instead, he premises his challenge to the district court's determination that Panagako was not an employee upon two contentions:  (1) that the corporations had the theoretical right to govern and direct Panagako, making him an employee under the terms of the Policies;  and (2) that \"the right to govern and direct language was merely intended to distinguish those persons within the corporation[s] whose acts are not covered by the Policies (i.e., employees) from those persons outside of the corporation[s] whose acts are not covered by the Policies (i.e., independent contractors and the like).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiff's first contention, we join those courts that have passed on the issue and reject the claim that the theoretical right to govern and direct a dominant corporate actor is sufficient to render that actor an employee under the definition of employee set forth in the Policies.

We think it apparent that the \"right\" to govern and direct referred to in the Policies must be more than an ephemeral right inhering generally in the corporate form;  rather, it must have some grounding in reality.  Cf. Kerr, 350 F.2d at 154 (describing corporation's \"right,\" under circumstances similar to those presented here, as \"unrealistic\" and \"theoretical\").  In this case, the argument that Capital and Allied had the right to govern and direct John Panagako lacks any credible basis.  Accordingly, we do not accept it.  Cf. J.I. Corp., 920 F.2d at 119 (insurance contracts should be construed according to the \" 'fair and reasonable meaning of the words in which the agreement of the parties is expressed' \") (emphasis supplied) (quoting Cody v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins.

It is obvious that this language, far from being included merely to distinguish employees from those non-employee actors specified in the Policies, materially limits the definition of the term \"employee\" to those persons over whom the corporate insureds have control.  Accordingly, we so read it.  Cf. Plymouth Rubber Co. Inc. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 18 Mass.App. 364, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1234</span></span>, 1238 (1984) (declining to \"torture\" the meaning of a clause in an insurance contract where it was understandable in its \"usual and ordinary sense\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Plaintiff's Second Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's second and alternative argument, that the definition of the term \"employee\" is ambiguous and that this ambiguity must be resolved in his favor, requires little discussion.  In making his alternative argument, plaintiff does not explain how the definition of the term might be ambiguous.  Nor does he make any attempt either to distinguish or to disagree with the several cases which have treated this very definition as unambiguous.  See, e.g., Matter of World Hospitality, 983 F.2d at 651-53;  California Union Ins., 948 F.2d at 566-67;  Three Garden Village, 567 A.2d at 90-92;  Employer's Admin. Servs., 709 P.2d at 562.   Accordingly, his argument being perfunctory, we deem it waived.  See United States v.

See Fidelity and Deposit Co. v. USAFORM Hail Pool, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1480993\"><a href=\"/opinion/1480993/fidelity-deposit-co-of-md-v-usaform-hail-pool-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

While we think that the USAFORM case is easily distinguishable from the present situation, we believe that plaintiff's estoppel claim founders for an even simpler reason.  As the district court noted, because plaintiff is proceeding as the assignee of Capital's and Allied's rights under the Policies, he is subject to any defenses that defendant could have interposed against Capital and Allied, the assignors.  See Great Am.  Ins. Co. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355671\"><a href=\"/opinion/355671/great-american-insurance-company-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span>, 1034 (2d Cir.1978).  One defense to the equitable claim of estoppel is the doctrine of \"unclean hands.\"   See Peabody Gas &amp; Oil Co. v. Standard Oil Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></span>, 113 (1933) (\"[O]ne must come into a court of equity with clean hands in order to secure relief....\").  Here, Capital and Allied were adjudged liable for the fraudulent and/or dishonest actions underlying this suit.  As such, the district court correctly ruled that any claim of estoppel they might have asserted against defendant would have failed because of their unclean hands.  Plaintiff, as their assignee, is therefore subject to the same fate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject plaintiff's challenge to the district court's refusal to hold defendant estopped from denying coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Rather, it appears that plaintiff's argument is premised upon (1) a provision of the HUD Handbook, Sec. 4381.5 REV-1, which requires property managers to obtain fidelity coverage for both principals of the management entity and \"all persons who participate directly or indirectly in the management and maintenance of the project and its assets, accounts and records\";  and (2) the affidavit of G. Richard Dunnells, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Management at HUD, which states that the aforementioned Handbook provision was promulgated in response to 24 C.F.R. Sec. 207.10, which requires the mortgagor of HUD-insured properties \"to keep the property insured by a standard policy or policies against fire and such other hazards as the Commissioner, upon the insurance of the mortgage, may stipulate.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Specifically, Exclusion A of the Policies provided:  \"This insuring form does not apply ... to loss due to any fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act by any insured or a partner therein, whether acting alone or in collusion with others....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We use the term \"alter ego\" as a shorthand way of identifying any natural person whom the corporate insured does not have \"the right to govern and direct in the performance of [his/her] service.\"   As noted previously, under the terms of the Policies, such an alter ego is not considered an employee of the corporate insured.  And, because the Policies only cover fraudulent or dishonest acts by employees of the corporate insureds, fraudulent or dishonest acts by an alter ego of the insureds are outside the scope of coverage</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Rule 56(f) provides:</p>\n        <p>When Affidavits are Unavailable.

See Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655503\"><a href=\"/opinion/655503/commercial-union-insurance-co-v-walbrook-insurance-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span>, 1048 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Relying on a series of cases regarding corporate \"veil piercing,\" and defining the \"alter ego defense\" here at issue as the mere defensive application of this veil piercing doctrine, plaintiff also devotes several pages of his brief to arguing that Massachusetts courts would not recognize the defense.  Plaintiff's argument in this regard is fundamentally flawed.  The alter ego defense asserted by defendant is not a common law defense;  rather, it is a defense derived from the language of the Policies themselves.   As such, the common law tort cases relied upon by plaintiff in his reverse veil piercing argument are inapposite to the contract dispute before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Our conclusion also is supported by policy considerations.  As the Fifth Circuit has observed:</p>\n        <p>A corporation can only act through its officers and directors.  When one person owns a controlling interest in the corporation and dominates the corporation's actions, his acts are the corporation's acts.  Allowing the corporation to recover for the owner's fraudulent or dishonest conduct would essentially allow the corporation to recover for its own fraudulent or dishonest acts.  The [fidelity] bonds, however, were clearly designed to insure the corporations against their employee's [sic] dishonest acts and not their own dishonest acts.</p>\n        <p>Matter of World Hospitality, 983 F.2d at 652 (citing California Union Ins., 948 F.2d at 566).   The fact that plaintiff, and not the insureds, is seeking coverage under the Policies does not diminish the force of these considerations in this case, for plaintiff is pressing his claim as an assignee.  As such, his rights under the Policies are limited to those of the assignors.  See 17 Couch on Insurance 2d, Sec. 63A:267 at 146 (1983) (\"It must be recognized that the assignee can receive no greater rights than those of the assignor.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In that section of his brief where plaintiff perfunctorily asserts that the terms \"employee\" and \"insured,\" see infra note 9, are ambiguous, he also seeks to introduce extrinsic evidence that the Policies at issue were mandated by HUD \"regulations,\" but see supra note 1.  In so doing, he asserts that this fact will help to enlighten us as to the meaning of these purportedly ambiguous terms.  See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600732\"><a href=\"/opinion/600732/luis-e-rodriguez-abreu-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 586 (1st Cir.1993) (extrinsic evidence admissible to clarify ambiguous contractual provisions)</p>\n        <p>Even if we were to assume arguendo the truth of plaintiff's assertion, we do not see how such fact would tend to clarify anything at issue in this litigation.  At most, the \"regulations\" to which plaintiff draws our attention tend to reinforce the perception that the Policies were not written in accordance with the specifications of HUD and paragraph 19 of the management agreements.  They do not, however, shed light on what the parties intended when they included the disputed terms in the Policies.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Because we so rule, we need not reach defendant's other proffered basis for affirmance, i.e., that Exclusion A, see supra note 2, is applicable because John Panagako, as the alter ego of Capital and Allied, was an \"insured\" under the terms of the Policies.  Nor, obviously, need we discuss plaintiff's cursory argument that the meaning of the term \"insured\" in Exclusion A is ambiguous</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
