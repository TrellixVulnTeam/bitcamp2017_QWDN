Moos, Nathan M. Rymer and Smith, Rymer, Moore &\nMoos, P.C. on brief for appellee Alan T. Robillard.\n     John J. Cloherty, III, John J. Davis and Pierce, Davis &\nPerritano, LLP on brief for appellees Kenneth D. Collins, George\nBussiere, Arthur Brillon and City of Attleboro.\n\n\n\n                         August 8, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam. Arthur D'Amario, III, appeals a district\n\ncourt judgment that dismissed his complaint on the ground that\n\nhis current claims are barred by a release that settled a prior\n\nlawsuit (\"the Dufort lawsuit\" or \"the Dufort release\") and/or\n\nby Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994).            We affirm.\n\n            D'Amario contended that he was falsely arrested in\n\nSeptember     1998   on   a   fugitive   from    justice    warrant    and\n\nsubsequently     \"falsely       imprisoned\"     during      court-ordered\n\npsychiatric evaluations in retaliation for his bringing of the\n\nDufort lawsuit.      He claims that both were \"proceedings\" that\n\n\"terminated in his favor\" and that, contrary to the district\n\ncourt's conclusion, these claims were not encompassed within\nthe Dufort release, but had been specifically reserved.               Even\nif not barred by the Dufort release, however, these contentions\n\nfail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and,\nthus, dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) was\nwarranted.\n\n             The classification of fugitive from justice does not\nconstitute a substantive criminal offense and, thus, D'Amario's\ncharacterization     of   the    resolution     of   this   status    as   a\n\n\"proceeding\" which was resolved in his favor (because that\nfugitive warrant was dismissed) is dubious.                 The fugitive\nwarrant was simply used to secure D'Amario's attendance at\n\ncourt proceedings intended to determine whether D'Amario had\nviolated the Sellers' protective order. Rather than \"terminate\n\nin his favor,\" the fugitive warrant was presumably dismissed\n\nwhen he, in fact, appeared.           Similarly, that D'Amario was\n\n                                   -2-\n\fdetermined to be competent, in terms of both ability to stand\n\ntrial on, and criminal responsibility for, charges of violating\n\nthe Sellers' protective order, is also hardly a termination in\n\nhis favor.       Moreover, the proceedings did not terminate in\n\nD'Amario's favor; he was convicted of violating that protective\n\norder and placed on probation.           From aught that appears,\n\nD'Amario   was    validly   convicted   of   violating   the   Sellers'\n\nprotective order.      He, thus, suffered no injury as a result of\n\na conspiracy to retaliate against him for filing the Dufort\n\nlawsuit.   See Haddle v. Garrison, 525 U.S. 121, 124-25 (1998)\n\n(plaintiff must allege an injury by defendants in violation of\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1985(2)).        D'Amario \"does not state a cause of\naction by merely adding a subjective assertion that the conduct\n[which is constitutionally unobjectionable] was improperly\n\nmotivated.\"      Lyons v. Sullivan, 602 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir.) (per\n\ncuriam), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 876 (1979).\n\n           D'Amario also alleged that the February 1999 search\n\nof his apartment was conducted without probable cause.              He\nargues that this claim is not barred by Heck because he is not\n\nchallenging      his   federal   felon-in-possession      conviction.\n\nAssuming, dubitante, that this claim is not barred by Heck,\n\nD'Amario nonetheless does not prevail.        He raised the issue of\n\nprobable cause in his criminal appeal.        We rejected that claim\n\nthen, concluding there was probable cause for the warrant,\n\nUnited States v. D'Amario, 2 Fed. Appx. 25, 2001WL120055 (1st\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fCir. 2001) (unpublished per curiam), and D'Amario may not\n\nrelitigate it now.\n\n          We have considered the rest of the arguments raised\nby D'Amario in his appellate brief.   They have no merit and do\n\nnot warrant further mention.\n\n          The motion for recusal is denied.\n\n          The renewed motion for counsel is denied.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
