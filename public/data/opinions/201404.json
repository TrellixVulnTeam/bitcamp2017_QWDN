Defendant-Third     Party\n\nPlaintiff Sociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo y Beneficiencia de\n\nPuerto Rico (hereinafter “Hospital”) appeals from an order of the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\ngranting third party defendant Dr. Celia Mendez Martir’s Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment.      Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n     Plaintiffs     Darlene     Rojas-Ithier     and    Victor   Varela   Teron\n\ninitiated this medical malpractice action following the death of\n\ntheir infant son.\n\n     Rojas was admitted to the Hospital on March 3, 2000, after a\n\nseries    of   pregnancy      complications,     including       a    threatened\n\nabortion at twelve weeks’ gestation, first trimester bleeding, a\n\nurinary   tract    infection,    and   premature       rupture   of   membranes.\n\nDuring this hospital stay, Rojas was ordered to remain in bed by\n\nher obstetrician, Dr. Mendez.          At approximately 2:00 AM on April\n\n26, 2000, twenty-nine weeks into the pregnancy, Dr. Mendez was\n\nnotified at home by the attending nurses that Rojas was having\n\ngas pain and abdominal pain.            Although Dr. Mendez ordered the\n\nhospital staff to keep Rojas under strict bed rest, Rojas moved\n\nfrom her bed to the adjacent bathroom in an effort to relieve her\n\ngas pains.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f      While in the bathroom, Rojas delivered her baby into the\n\ntoilet.     The baby boy remained in the toilet for an undetermined\n\nperiod     of     time   before    being      discovered.         Thereafter,    a\n\nneonatologist attempted to resuscitate the baby, but his efforts\n\nultimately proved unsuccessful.            Approximately eleven hours after\n\nthe live birth, the baby was pronounced dead.\n\n      Plaintiffs brought this diversity suit1 against the Hospital\n\non February 6, 2002.          Defendant Hospital subsequently brought a\n\nthird     party   complaint      against   Dr.   Mendez     and   her   insurance\n\ncarrier,        Sindicato    de    Aseguradores      de     Impericia      Medico\n\nHospitalaria.       The district court, finding no genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact, granted Dr. Mendez’s Motion for Summary Judgment.2\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\nII.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying\n\nthe     same    standard    as    did   the    district     court.      Leon    v.\n\nMunicipality of San Juan, 320 F.3d 69, 71 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      At the time this suit was commenced, Plaintiffs were residents\nof the State of Florida.\n      2\n      While Dr. Mendez’s Motion for Summary Judgment was pending\nbefore the district court, Plaintiffs and the Hospital settled\ntheir dispute. The Hospital filed a motion for voluntary dismissal\nwithout prejudice of all claims, including its third party\ncomplaint against Dr. Mendez, following the settlement between the\nHospital and Plaintiffs.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f     The     objective       of    summary    judgment       “is     to     pierce      the\n\nboilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties’ proof in\n\norder to determine whether trial is actually required.”                           Wynne v.\n\nTufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nSummary     judgment      is      appropriate       only     if    “the         pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\n\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”                      Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).     “In this regard, ‘material’ means that a contested fact\n\nhas the potential to change the outcome of the suit under the\n\ngoverning law if the dispute over it is resolved favorably to the\n\nnonmovant.        By like token, ‘genuine’ means that the evidence\n\nabout the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the\n\npoint in favor of the nonmoving party.”                Navarro v. Pfizer Corp.,\n\n261 F.3d 90, 93-94 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing McCarthy v. Northeast\n\nAirlines,       Inc.,   56     F.3d   313,    315     (1st    Cir.        1995)).       “A\n\ntrialworthy issue exists if the evidence is such that there is a\n\nfactual controversy pertaining to an issue that may affect the\n\noutcome    of     the   litigation    under     the    governing      law,        and   the\n\nevidence     is    ‘sufficiently       open-ended       to    permit        a     rational\n\nfactfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.’” De-\n\nJesus-Adorno v. Browning Ferris Indus., 160 F.3d 839, 841-42 (1st\n\n                                        -4-\n\fCir. 1998) (quoting Nat’l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43\n\nF.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n       The Court views the record on summary judgment in the light\n\nmost    favorable   to   the    nonmovant.         See    Santiago-Ramos    v.\n\nCentennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nHowever, summary judgment is appropriate “against a party who\n\nfails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of\n\nan element essential to that party's case, and on which that\n\nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial.”              Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).            Once the moving party has\n\npresented   evidence     of   the   absence   of   a     genuine   issue,   the\n\nnonmoving party must respond by “placing at least one material\n\nfact into dispute.”      FDIC v. Anchor Props., 13 F.3d 27, 30 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (citing Darr v. Muratore, 8 F.3d 854, 859 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)).\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\n       Because this is a diversity action, the substantive law of\n\nPuerto Rico applies.      See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64,\n\n92 (1938); Daniels-Recio v. Hospital del Maestro, 109 F.3d 88, 90\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n       The Puerto Rico Civil Code provides that “[a] person who by\n\nan act or omission causes damage to another through fault or\n\nnegligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.”                  31\n\n                                     -5-\n\fP.R. Laws Ann. § 5141.            Three elements comprise a prima facie\n\ncase of medical malpractice under Puerto Rico law.                          To prevail\n\nagainst a doctor, a party must establish (1) the duty owed; (2)\n\nan act or omission transgressing that duty; and (3) a sufficient\n\ncausal nexus between the breach and the harm.                   Cortes-Irizarry v.\n\nCorporacion       Insular   de   Seguros,       111   F.3d   184,     189   (1st    Cir.\n\n1997); Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 478 (1st Cir. 1994); Medina\n\nSantiago v. Velez, 120 P.R. Dec. 380, 385 (1988).\n\n     Puerto Rico law holds physicians to a national standard of\n\ncare.3   “[B]ecause         Puerto      Rico    law   presumes      that    physicians\n\nexercise reasonable care, a plaintiff bent on establishing a\n\nbreach of     a    physician’s    duty     of    care    ordinarily        must   adduce\n\nexpert testimony to limn the minimum acceptable standard and\n\nconfirm the defendant doctor’s failure to meet it.”                               Cortes-\n\nIrizarry, 111 F.3d at 190.                Without the assistance of expert\n\ntestimony,    a    trier    of   fact    is     rarely   able    to   determine      the\n\napplicable standard of care in the medical profession.                            Rolon-\n\nAlvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   Similarly, a factfinder normally cannot find causation\n\n\n\n     3\n     The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has described this national\nstandard as “[t]hat [level of care] which, recognizing the modern\nmeans of communication and education, ... meets the professional\nrequirements generally acknowledged by the medical profession.”\nOliveros v. Abreu, 101 P.R. Dec. 209, 226 (1973).\n\n                                          -6-\n\fwithout the assistance of expert testimony to clarify complex\n\nmedical and scientific issues that are more prevalent in medical\n\nmalpractice cases than in standard negligence cases.                          Lama, 16\n\nF.3d at 478.\n\n     To bring into question an element of the Hospital’s prima\n\nfacie case,       Dr.    Mendez     submitted      two   expert    opinions     to   the\n\ndistrict    court,      both   of    which    attributed     the     infant’s    death\n\nsolely to the negligence of the Hospital and its nurses.                         It is\n\nundisputed that the Hospital has failed to furnish a medical\n\nexpert opinion suggesting that Dr. Mendez breached the standard\n\nof care.    Instead, the Hospital first urges us to conclude that\n\nbecause    of    discrepancies        between      the   nurses’     notes    and    Dr.\n\nMendez’s notes recounting the events of April 26, 2000, a genuine\n\nissue of material fact exists.               The existence of contradictions,\n\nstanding    alone,       however,    is    not     enough   to    preclude     summary\n\njudgment.       The Hospital fails to establish any nexus between the\n\ninconsistencies         in   the   notes    and    the   resulting    death     of   the\n\ninfant.    Accordingly, we do not find any alleged discrepancies in\n\nthe notes sufficient to create an issue of material fact.\n\n     Realizing its predicament after failing to file any expert\n\nopinions    with     the     district      court    to   support     its   claims     of\n\nnegligent conduct by Dr. Mendez, the Hospital next asks us to\n\nfind that Dr. Mendez’s conduct alone was so egregious that an\n\n                                           -7-\n\fexpert is not necessary to find such a nexus.4                 We decline this\n\ninvitation.     The Hospital offers no support for its claim of\n\negregious conduct other than its own unsubstantiated allegations\n\nand theories.     It is a long standing principle in this Circuit\n\nthat bald assertions and unsupportable conclusions are not enough\n\nto create a genuine issue of material fact.                See, e.g., Aulson v.\n\nBlanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n     Finally, Appellant challenges the expert opinions offered by\n\nDr. Mendez.     “The Hospital submits that a plain reading by the\n\ncourt of the experts [sic] reports suffices to conclude that they\n\nare fundamentally written around the experts’ interpretation and\n\nrecreation of fragments of depositions containing no specific\n\nreferences either to the medical record.”                  App. Br. at 15.       A\n\nthorough review of the record by this Court clearly indicates\n\nthat both experts retained by Dr. Mendez, in formulating their\n\nexpert   opinions,   carefully     examined     the    hospital     records     and\n\navailable     depositions    in   the   case.         We    find   no   merit   to\n\nAppellant’s argument.       The appropriate method for the Hospital to\n\n\n     4\n     Citing to Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242\n(1986), the Hospital contends that to create a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact, it only need produce evidence that would allow a\nreasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor.       Appellant’s\nproblem is that Anderson’s requirement could be met in a libel case\nwithout expert evidence; by contrast, under Puerto Rico law,\nappellant did need an expert to establish medical malpractice,\ngiven the state of the record in this case.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fchallenge these expert reports is not through legal argument, but\n\nby    retaining   its   own   medical   expert   and   submitting   to   the\n\ndistrict court an expert opinion in accordance with Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.    This Court will not on its own create a dispute of medical\n\nfacts when the Hospital had an appropriate avenue in which to do\n\nso during the discovery process in the district court.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       Dr. Mendez, through the submission of two expert opinions,\n\npresented evidence of the absence of a genuine factual issue\n\ncentral to the Hospital’s case.           The Hospital failed to respond\n\nwith appropriate expert evidence and failed to adduce support for\n\nits claim that Dr. Mendez breached the standard of care.            Without\n\nsuch evidence, the Hospital cannot establish an element of its\n\nprima facie case.       As such, the Hospital fails to meet its burden\n\nof showing that there is a fact issue requiring trial.              Because\n\nwe affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor\n\nof     Dr.   Mendez,    the    Hospital’s    arguments    addressing     the\n\nappropriateness of a dismissal with prejudice are moot.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

During this hospital stay, Rojas was ordered to remain in bed by her obstetrician, Dr. Mendez. At approximately 2:00 AM on April 26, 2000, twenty-nine weeks into the pregnancy, Dr. Mendez was notified at home by the attending nurses that Rojas was having gas pain and abdominal pain. Although Dr. Mendez ordered the hospital staff to keep Rojas under strict bed rest, Rojas moved from her bed to the adjacent bathroom in an effort to relieve her gas pains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While in the bathroom, Rojas delivered her baby into the toilet. The baby boy remained in the toilet for an undetermined period of time before being discovered. Thereafter, a neonatologist attempted to resuscitate the baby, but his efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful. Approximately eleven hours after the live birth, the baby was pronounced dead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought this diversity suit<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> against the Hospital on February 6, 2002.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Mendez, through the submission of two expert opinions, presented evidence of the absence of a genuine factual issue central to the Hospital's case. The Hospital failed to respond with appropriate expert evidence and failed to adduce support for its claim that Dr. Mendez breached the standard of care. Without such evidence, the Hospital cannot establish an element of its prima facie case. As such, the Hospital fails to meet its burden of showing that there is a fact issue requiring trial. Because we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Dr. Mendez, the Hospital's arguments addressing the appropriateness of a dismissal with prejudice are moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the time this suit was commenced, Plaintiffs were residents of the State of Florida</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> While Dr. Mendez's Motion for Summary Judgment was pending before the district court, Plaintiffs and the Hospital settled their dispute.

Appellant's problem is that <i>Anderson's</i> requirement could be met in a libel case without expert evidence; by contrast, under Puerto Rico law, appellant did need an expert to establish medical malpractice, given the state of the record in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
