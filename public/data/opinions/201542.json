Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n              Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Luis A. Guzmán-Dupont for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom H.S.\nGarcia, U.S. Attorney, and German Rieckehoff, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 19, 2005\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. José Figuereo pled guilty to being\n\nfound in the United States after having been deported, a violation\n\nof 8 U.S.C. § 1326 (2003).      In calculating Figuereo's sentence of\n\n57 months' imprisonment and three years of supervised release, the\n\ndistrict court added two criminal history points pursuant to United\n\nStates Sentencing Guideline (\"U.S.S.G.\") § 4A1.1(d) (2003) because\n\nFiguereo committed the instant offense -- being found in the United\n\nStates -- while serving a state prison sentence.         Figuereo appeals\n\nhis sentence, arguing that the district court erred in applying\n\n§ 4A1.1(d) and in treating the Guidelines as mandatory.            He also\n\nchallenges    the   drug   testing   and   treatment   condition   of   his\n\nsupervised release, arguing that the court improperly delegated its\n\nauthority to a probation officer.           We remand for the limited\n\npurpose of adjusting the drug treatment and testing condition but\n\naffirm the rest of the sentence.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            The facts in this case are undisputed.           Figuereo, a\n\nDominican national, was deported from the United States in 1992\n\nfollowing his conviction for various drug-related misdemeanors and\n\nfelonies.    He re-entered the country without permission in 1999.\n\n            In May 2002, Figuereo was arrested in Puerto Rico on drug\n\ncharges.     He was subsequently convicted in Puerto Rico Superior\n\nCourt and sentenced to one year in prison.             While Figuereo was\n\nserving his sentence, he participated in a routine interview with\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe Alien Criminal Apprehension Program for the Department of\n\nHomeland Security. In that interview, Figuereo claimed to be David\n\nFigueroa-Figuereo, a legal permanent resident of the United States.\n\nFurther investigation revealed Figuereo's true identity and the\n\nfact of his previous conviction and deportation.\n\n            On April 30, 2003, a federal grand jury indicted Figuereo\n\non one count of entering the United States as an alien previously\n\ndeported following a conviction for an aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(b)(2).1    Figuereo pled guilty to this count on July 14,\n\n2003.    On November 10, 2003, the district court sentenced Figuereo\n\n\n     1\n         8 U.S.C. § 1326 provides that:\n     (a) In general\n     Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien\n     who--\n     . . .\n     (2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found\n     in, the United States . . .\n     shall be fined under Title 18 [of the United States\n     Code], or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.\n     (b) Criminal penalties for reentry of certain removed\n     aliens\n     Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the\n     case of any alien described in such subsection--\n     . . .\n     (2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for\n     commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be\n     fined under such Title, imprisoned not more than 20\n     years, or both . . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\funder the then mandatory Guidelines to 57 months in prison, the\n\nbottom of the applicable sentencing range, and three years of\n\nsupervised release. That sentence reflects a two-point increase in\n\nFiguereo's   criminal   history   under   U.S.S.G.   §   4A1.1(d),   which\n\nmandates such an increase \"if the defendant committed the instant\n\noffense while under any criminal justice sentence.\" The court also\n\nimposed numerous conditions of supervised release, one of which\n\nprovided that:\n\n     The defendant shall . . . submit to a drug test within\n     fifteen (15) days of release . . . and at least two (2)\n     tests thereafter when so requested by the U.S. Probation\n     Officer. If any such samples detect substance abuse, the\n     defendant shall, at the discretion of the U.S. Probation\n     Officer, participate in a substance abuse treatment\n     program, arranged and approved by the U.S. Probation\n     Officer.\n\n          Figuereo filed a timely appeal, challenging his sentence\n\nand the condition of supervised release relating to drug testing\n\nand treatment.\n\n                                  II.\n\nA. U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d) enhancement\n\n          Section 4A1.1(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines instructs\n\na court calculating a defendant's criminal history level to \"[a]dd\n\n2 points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under\n\nany criminal justice sentence, including . . . imprisonment.\"\n\nHere, Figuereo's offense was being \"found in[] the United States\"\n\nin violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.        Because he was serving a state\n\nprison sentence when the Department of Homeland Security \"found\"\n\n                                  -4-\n\fhim, the district court concluded that § 4A1.1(d) applied and added\n\ntwo criminal history points.    Figuereo now asserts for the first\n\ntime on appeal that § 4A1.1(d) cannot apply without a mens rea\n\ncomponent.2\n\n          We typically review the district court's factual findings\n\nfor clear error and its interpretation and application of the\n\nsentencing guidelines de novo. United States v. Savarese, 385 F.3d\n\n15, 18 (1st Cir. 2004).   Where the defendant raises objections on\n\nappeal that were not presented to the district court, however, the\n\nstandard is different.3   Under these circumstances, \"our review is\n\n\n     2\n      Figuereo also contends that the § 4A1.1(d) enhancement was\nimproper in light of U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a) (2003), which limits\nrelevant conduct (i.e., factors that determine the offense level)\nto acts that are willful and related to the instant offense. He\nasserts that because the conduct that led to the § 4A1.1(d)\nenhancement -- being in prison when he was \"found\" in the United\nStates -- was unrelated to the instant offense and not willful, it\nshould not have affected the Guidelines calculation.\n     This reasoning rests on an erroneous reading of § 1B1.3(a).\nBy its own terms, § 1B1.3(a) defines relevant conduct only for\npurposes of Chapters 2 and 3 of the Guidelines.       The criminal\nhistory enhancement at issue here falls under Chapter 4 of the\nGuidelines, and is thus governed instead by § 1B1.3(b) (2003).\nSection 1B1.3(b) specifically provides that factors affecting the\nguideline range under Chapter 4 are determined not by § 1B1.3(a),\nbut rather \"on the basis of the conduct and information specified\nin the respective guidelines.\" Here, the relevant guideline, §\n4A1.1(d), provides for a two-point increase if the defendant\n\"committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice\nsentence,\" without reference to any mens rea requirement or whether\nthe sentence was related to the instant offense.\n     3\n      Figuereo did object at sentencing, but he did so solely on a\nbasis not now before us -- namely, that the Guidelines calculation\ngave too much weight to his Puerto Rico conviction because it added\npoints both under § 4A1.1(b), as a \"prior sentence of imprisonment\nexceeding one year and one month,\" and under § 4A1.1(d).         He\n\n                                -5-\n\frestricted to plain error.\"       United States v. Carrasco-Mateo, 389\n\nF.3d 239, 243 (1st Cir. 2004).            Plain error is a deferential\n\nstandard under which errors will be corrected only if the defendant\n\nshows \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious\n\nand which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights,\n\nbut also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"        United States v. Duarte, 246\n\nF.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Emphasizing Supreme Court precedent disfavoring offenses\n\nthat lack a mens rea requirement, see Staples v. United States, 511\n\nU.S. 600, 606 (1994), Figuereo asserts that the court erred in\n\napplying   the   §   4A1.1(d)    enhancement   without    regard    to    the\n\nvoluntariness of his conduct.        In other words, he contends that\n\nbecause he did not have the option of leaving the United States\n\nonce he was imprisoned, his sentence for being \"found\" while in\n\nprison cannot be more severe than if he had been \"found\" before\n\nbeing imprisoned.     We disagree.\n\n           Section 4A1.1(d) defines a sentencing enhancement, not an\n\nelement of the offense.    See Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545,\n\n549   (2002)   (distinguishing    between    elements    of   a   crime   and\n\nsentencing factors on the ground that the latter are \"not subject\n\nto the Constitution's indictment, jury, and proof requirements\").\n\n\nacknowledged that the court had calculated the sentence correctly\nbut raised this \"double-dipping\" argument as a structural flaw in\nthe Guidelines themselves.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fSeveral of our sister circuits have concluded that Guidelines\n\nsentencing factors need not include a mens rea requirement.   See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 262 F.3d 867, 870 (9th Cir. 2001);\n\nbut see United States v. Schnell, 982 F.2d 216, 220-21 (7th Cir.\n\n1992) (rejecting a categorical rule that sentencing enhancements do\n\nnot require a mens rea element, but concluding that the particular\n\nenhancement at issue did not violate due process despite absence of\n\nsuch an element).    Moreover, at least two of our sister circuits\n\nhave upheld § 4A1.1(d) enhancements for defendants who were \"found\"\n\nin the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326 while they\n\nwere imprisoned.    See United States v. Coeur, 196 F.3d 1344, 1346\n\n(11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Santana-Castellano, 74 F.3d 593,\n\n598 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n          The fact of being under a criminal justice sentence is a\n\nsentencing factor for violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1326, not an element\n\nof the crime of being \"found\" in the United States.4   It was thus\n\nnot plain error for the district court to follow our sister\n\ncircuits in applying the § 4A1.1(d) enhancement to a defendant who\n\nwas \"found\" in the United States while imprisoned.5\n\n\n     4\n      Figuereo's constitutional challenge on mens rea grounds is\nlimited to the § 4A1.1(d) sentencing enhancement.    He does not\ndispute the constitutionality of the statute under which he was\nconvicted, and we do not reach that issue.\n     5\n      Although it was not plain error   for the court to apply the\n§ 4A1.1(d) enhancement without regard   to Figuereo's mens rea, we\nnote that Figuereo did in fact have      a culpable state of mind\nrelating to his illegal entry when he   was \"found\" in prison. He\n\n                                -7-\n\fB. Booker\n\n             Figuereo also argues for the first time on appeal that he\n\nis entitled to resentencing in light of the Supreme Court's recent\n\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738, 764-75 (2005)\n\n(Breyer, J.), which rendered the Guidelines advisory rather than\n\nmandatory.     To prevail on an unpreserved Booker claim, a defendant\n\nmust show not only that he was sentenced under the mandatory\n\nGuidelines, but also that there are \"circumstances creating a\n\nreasonable probability that the district court would impose a\n\ndifferent sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new\n\n'advisory      Guidelines'   Booker        regime.\"     United      States   v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005); see also United\n\nStates v. Heldeman,          F.3d        , No. 04-1915, 2005 WL 708397, at\n\n*3 (1st Cir. Mar. 29, 2005) (describing the Booker plain error\n\ninquiry   as    whether   \"there    is    reasonable   indication    that    the\n\ndistrict judge might well have reached a different result under\n\nadvisory guidelines\").\n\n             At sentencing, Figuereo asked the district court to \"be\n\nconsiderate\" to him, explaining that, \"I came here on account of my\n\nchildren, because as you know, I have my children [in the United\n\nStates], and I was just coming here to try to see them, and all the\n\n\n\nattempted to conceal his identity and immigration status from\nfederal officials, identifying himself to Department of Homeland\nSecurity officials as David Figueroa-Figuereo, a legal permanent\nresident of the United States.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcrimes that I have committed have been the result of my drug\n\nabuse.\"      Emphasizing       that   mandatory   Guidelines   precluded   the\n\nsentencing court from taking such mitigating factors into account,\n\nsee Antonakopolous, 399 F.3d at 81, Figuereo asserts that he should\n\nbe resentenced under the advisory regime to allow the court to\n\nreconsider his request.\n\n          There is no indication, however, that the court would\n\nhave imposed a more lenient sentence in light of Figuereo's request\n\neven if it had been free to do so, particularly given what it\n\ndescribed as Figuereo's \"extensive\" criminal history.6              The court\n\ndid not comment on Figuereo's family ties or history of drug abuse\n\ndespite Figuereo's invocation of these factors at sentencing and\n\nreferences    to   them   in    the   pre-sentence   report    (\"PSR\").    Cf.\n\nHeldeman, 2005 WL 708397, at *3.          Moreover, the PSR indicated that\n\nalthough Figuereo has four children in the United States, he does\n\nnot have a relationship with any of them beyond providing child\n\nsupport for one daughter.         Thus, the court might well have viewed\n\n\n\n     6\n      The district court described Figuereo's \"extensive criminal\nrecord\" at the sentencing hearing, noting that it included\npossession of stolen property in the Bronx, New York. Criminal\ntheft, also in New York.    Possession with intent to distribute\nnarcotics in New Jersey. Another case of possession of a weapon in\nthe third degree in New York, and possession of a stolen motor\nvehicle in Providence, Rhode Island. Then, also, simple assault\nand battery in Rhode Island, and finally, violation of drugs in\nPuerto Rico, possession with intent to distribute.\n     The court then warned Figuereo that \"[i]f you commit another\noffense after this sentence . . . then you will be considered a\ncriminal career offender, which might entail a life sentence.\"\n\n                                        -9-\n\fhis claim to have returned to the United States \"on account of my\n\nchildren\" with some skepticism.\n\n            \"Even post-Booker, the district court 'must consult [the]\n\nGuidelines and take them into account when sentencing.'\"                  United\n\nStates v.    Serrano-Beauvaix,   400     F.3d   50,   55    (1st   Cir.   2005)\n\n(quoting Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 767).        The Guidelines in this case\n\ndictated a sentencing range of 57 to 71 months in prison.              Pursuant\n\nto the plea agreement, the district court sentenced Figuereo to the\n\nbottom of that range.        Figuereo has failed to demonstrate a\n\nreasonable probability that, having consulted the Guidelines, the\n\ndistrict court would impose a lower sentence on remand. His Booker\n\nclaim therefore fails.\n\nC. Drug testing and treatment release condition\n\n            Figuereo also contends for the first time on appeal that\n\nthe   district   court   impermissibly    delegated        authority    to   the\n\nprobation officer to decide how many drug tests to administer and\n\nwhether to order him to attend a drug treatment program if he\n\nfailed a drug test while on supervised release.              This delegation\n\nconstitutes plain error under United States v. Meléndez-Santana,\n\n353 F.3d 93 (1st Cir. 2003), in which we held that a sentencing\n\ncourt \"may not . . . vest the probation officer with the discretion\n\nto order an unlimited number of drug tests\" and must determine\n\nwhether the defendant has to undergo drug treatment \"either at the\n\ntime of sentencing, or later in response to a motion by the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fprobation officer.\"        Id.   at   101-03   (footnote   omitted).   The\n\ngovernment concedes plain error and agrees that this court should\n\nremand for limited resentencing on this basis. We therefore remand\n\nfor an adjustment of the drug testing and treatment portion of the\n\nsentence.7    See United States v. Vega, 398 F.3d 149, 154 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (vacating the defendant's sentence \"only to the extent it\n\ndelegates the terms of his drug testing and treatment during the\n\nperiod of his supervised release, and remand[ing] for resentencing\n\non this sole issue\").       The remainder of Figuereo's sentence is\n\naffirmed.\n\n             So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      The explicit delegation of authority to the probation officer\nin this case distinguishes it from United States v. Lewandowski,\n372 F.3d 470 (1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam), in which we construed a\ndrug testing condition of supervised release to avoid a defect\ninstead of vacating the condition and remanding for resentencing.\nThe drug testing condition at issue in Lewandowski required the\ndefendant to \"submit to one drug test within 15 days of release\nfrom imprisonment and at least two periodic tests thereafter,\" but\ndid not specify who had the authority to determine the maximum\nnumber of tests. Id. at 470-71. Noting that the determination was\nnot explicitly delegated to a probation officer, we \"construe[d]\nthe supervised release condition to avoid any delegation problem\n. . . [and] to cap the number of drug tests at three.\" Id. at 471\n(emphasis in original).\n\n                                      -11-\n\f",

To prevail on an unpreserved <i>Booker</i> claim, a defendant must show not only that he was sentenced under the mandatory Guidelines, but also that there are \"circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also United States v.

Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 222. Moreover, the PSR indicated that although Figuereo has four children in the United States, he does not have a relationship with any of them beyond providing child support for one daughter. Thus, the court might well have viewed his claim to have returned to the United States \"on account of my children\" with some skepticism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Even post-<i>Booker,</i> the district court `must consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.'\" <i>United States v.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, the district court sentenced Figuereo to the bottom of that range. Figuereo has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, having consulted the Guidelines, the district court would impose a lower sentence on remand.

This delegation constitutes plain error under <i>United States v. Mel&#233;ndez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93 (1st Cir.2003), in which we held that a sentencing court \"may not ... vest the probation officer with the discretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests\" and must determine whether the defendant has to undergo drug treatment \"either at the time of sentencing, or later in response to a motion by the probation officer.\" <i>Id.</i> at 101-03 (footnote omitted). The government concedes plain error and agrees that this court should remand for limited resentencing on this basis.

Section 1B1.3(b) specifically provides that factors affecting the guideline range under Chapter 4 are determined not by &#167; 1B1.3(a), but rather \"on the basis of the conduct and information specified in the respective guidelines.\" Here, the relevant guideline, &#167; 4A1.1(d), provides for a two-point increase if the defendant \"committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence,\" without reference to any <i>mens rea</i> requirement or whether the sentence was related to the instant offense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Figuereo did object at sentencing, but he did so solely on a basis not now before us &#8212; namely, that the Guidelines calculation gave too much weight to his Puerto Rico conviction because it added points both under &#167; 4A1.1(b), as a \"prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month,\" and under &#167; 4A1.1(d).

Moreover, the PSR indicated that although Figuereo has four children in the United States, he does not have a relationship with any of them beyond providing child support for one daughter.

The Guidelines in this case dictated a sentencing range of 57 to 71 months in prison. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the district court sentenced Figuereo to the bottom of that range. Figuereo has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, having consulted the Guidelines, the district court would impose a lower sentence on remand.

He asserts that because the conduct that led to the &#167; 4A1.1(d) enhancement &#8212; being in prison when he was \"found\" in the United States &#8212; was unrelated to the instant offense and not willful, it should not have affected the Guidelines calculation</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning rests on an erroneous reading of &#167; 1B1.3(a). By its own terms, &#167; 1B1.3(a) defines relevant conduct only for purposes of Chapters 2 and 3 of the Guidelines. The criminal history enhancement at issue here falls under Chapter 4 of the Guidelines, and is thus governed instead by &#167; 1B1.3(b) (2003). Section 1B1.3(b) specifically provides that factors affecting the guideline range under Chapter 4 are determined not by &#167; 1B1.3(a), but rather \"on the basis of the conduct and information specified in the respective guidelines.\" Here, the relevant guideline, &#167; 4A1.1(d), provides for a two-point increase if the defendant \"committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence,\" without reference to any <i>mens rea</i> requirement or whether the sentence was related to the instant offense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Figuereo did object at sentencing, but he did so solely on a basis not now before us &#8212; namely, that the Guidelines calculation gave too much weight to his Puerto Rico conviction because it added points both under &#167; 4A1.1(b), as a \"prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month,\" and under &#167; 4A1.1(d). He acknowledged that the court had calculated the sentence correctly but raised this \"double-dipping\" argument as a structural flaw in the Guidelines themselves</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Figuereo's constitutional challenge on<i>mens rea</i> grounds is limited to the &#167; 4A1.1(d) sentencing enhancement.

He attempted to conceal his identity and immigration status from federal officials, identifying himself to Department of Homeland Security officials as David Figueroa-Figuereo, a legal permanent resident of the United States.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The district court described Figuereo's \"extensive criminal record\" at the sentencing hearing, noting that it included possession of stolen property in the Bronx, New York. Criminal theft, also in New York. Possession with intent to distribute narcotics in New Jersey.
