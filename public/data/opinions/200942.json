Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n                          Howard, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Angel Ruiz Rivera on brief pro se.\n     Julio Morillo Limardo on brief for appellants.\n     Curtis C. Pett and John A. Dudeck Jr., Tax Division,\nDepartment of Justice, and Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral.\n\n\n                              March 30, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam. Appellants Angel Ruiz-Rivera and Compania de\n\nInversiones Urayoan, Inc. (CIU) appeal from the district court's\n\ngrant of the motion for summary judgment filed by the Internal\n\nRevenue Service (IRS).    Appellants also appeal from the district\n\ncourt's (1) denial of their motion for reconsideration of that\n\ncourt's dismissal of CIU from the case due to CIU's failure to\n\ntimely secure counsel to represent it and (2) denial of Ruiz-\n\nRivera's motion to file an amended complaint.         We affirm the\n\ndistrict court in all respects.\n\n          As for the merits, we affirm the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment to the IRS for essentially the reasons stated\n\nin that court's Opinion and Order.     See Ruiz Rivera v. I.R.S., 226\n\nF. Supp. 2d 345 (D.P.R. 2002).    We only add two comments.   First,\n\nconstitutional claims against the IRS, a federal agency, plainly\n\nare barred.   See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 484-86 (1994)\n\n(refusing to imply a Bivens-type cause of action directly against\n\na federal agency).   Second, any tort claims against the IRS must be\n\nbrought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346,\n\n2671-2680, which \"waives the sovereign immunity of the United\n\nStates to suits in tort.\"     See Santiago-Ramirez v. Secretary of\n\nDep't of Defense, 984 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1993).     However, such\n\na suit would be barred here under the exceptions to sovereign\n\nimmunity contained in § 2680(c) (barring \"[a]ny claim arising in\n\nrespect of the assessment or collection of any tax\") and (h)\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f(barring    \"[a]ny    claim     arising        out     of    .   .   .   libel,     slander,\n\nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights\").\n\n            In relation to the failure of CIU to retain counsel, the\n\ndistrict    court     gave      CIU      over     two       years     to    secure     legal\n\nrepresentation, and CIU missed all of the deadlines the court had\n\nset for an attorney to appear on CIU's behalf.                       Indeed, an attorney\n\ndid not file an appearance for CIU until after the court had\n\ndismissed CIU from the case.             To be entitled to reconsideration of\n\nthis dismissal, which was not a \"final\" order, appellants would\n\nhave   to   show    that     the    interests          of    justice       required    CIU's\n\nreinstatement as a plaintiff. See Greene v. Union Mutual Life Ins.\n\nCo., 764 F.2d 19, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1985).                         We review a district\n\ncourt's denial of an interlocutory motion for reconsideration for\n\nabuse of discretion.         Douglas v. York County, No. 03-2086, 2004 WL\n\n439922, at *4 (1st Cir. March 11, 2004).\n\n            We    simply   do      not   see     how    the      interests     of    justice\n\nrequired    the    reinstatement          of     CIU,       given    the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding      appellants'       failure       to     timely       secure    counsel    to\n\nrepresent CIU.       First, appellants do not claim that they were\n\nunaware of the court orders directing CIU to obtain counsel or that\n\nthey somehow misunderstood the orders or the deadlines contained in\n\nthe orders.        Rather, appellants, knowing of their obligations,\n\nsimply did not comply with the district court's orders until two\n\nyears had elapsed and until CIU had been dismissed from the case.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fCompare Douglas, 2004 WL 439922, at *4 (where the district court\n\ninjected a new issue into the case without notifying the parties,\n\nit was an abuse of discretion to deny a promptly-filed motion for\n\nreconsideration).\n\n          Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying Ruiz-Rivera's motion to amend the complaint.             In this\n\nregard, it     is   undisputed   that   both   Ruiz-Rivera   and   CIU   were\n\nrepresented by counsel when the district court, in its scheduling\n\norder, set August 31, 1999 as the deadline for filing amended\n\npleadings.      Similarly, it is undisputed that appellants were\n\nrepresented by these same attorneys when the August 31 deadline\n\npassed.   Appellants' counsel did not request an extension of time\n\nto file an amended complaint at this point, but rather waited until\n\nthe conference held on November 22, 1999 to announce that they\n\nwould be filing an amended complaint on or before January 3, 2000.\n\nSignificantly, counsel also missed this deadline.\n\n             \"We review the denial of a motion to amend the pleadings\n\nfor an abuse of discretion and will affirm if any adequate reason\n\nfor the denial is apparent from the record.\"          O'Connell v. Hyatt\n\nHotels of Puerto Rico, 357 F.3d 152, 154 (1st Cir. 2004).           Where a\n\nresponsive pleading has been filed and the district court has\n\nentered a scheduling order, as here, Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b) supplies\n\nthe standard for obtaining an extension of time. Thus, Ruiz-Rivera\n\nwas required to show \"good cause\" for missing the deadline.              Id.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f          Here, Ruiz-Rivera did not file a motion to amend the\n\ncomplaint until August 13, 2002, which was almost three years after\n\nthe expiration of the scheduling order deadline of August 31, 1999.\n\nIn attempting to excuse this length of time, appellants focus on\n\nthe fact that the motion to amend was filed only 30 days after\n\nattorney Morillo appeared in the case.           This period of time,\n\nhowever, is not determinative.\n\n          Rather, the focus of the \"good cause\" inquiry must be on\n\nthe reasons for the failure of appellants' original attorneys to\n\nmeet the scheduling order deadline, as well as on the reasons for\n\nthe failure of these attorneys to meet their own deadline of\n\nJanuary   3,   2000   for   the   filing   of   an   amended   complaint.\n\nAppellants, however, do not present any arguments concerning these\n\nattorneys nor do they address these early deadlines.            Plainly,\n\nthen, appellants have failed to show either \"good cause\" for\n\nmissing the earlier deadline or \"diligence\" in pursing an extension\n\nof time to file an amended complaint.       See Rule 16(b).\n\n          Moreover, there is no evidence that appellants exercised\n\nany diligence during the year and four months that expired between\n\nthe date their original attorneys were permitted to withdraw --\n\nMarch 26, 2001 -- and the date they finally filed the motion to\n\namend -- August 13, 2002.         That they were without an attorney\n\nduring this time cannot pardon the delay where, as discussed supra,\n\nthey failed to show excusable neglect for the length of time it\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\ftook them to secure counsel.    We therefore cannot see that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying permission to file\n\nan amended complaint.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
