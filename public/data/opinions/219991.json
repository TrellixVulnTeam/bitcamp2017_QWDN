Woodcock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Peter J. Cyr for appellant.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas E. Delahanty II, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           June 29, 2011\n\f              THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.        A Maine jury found Horace W.\n\nSalley,   III    guilty     of   possession    of   a   firearm    following   a\n\nconviction of misdemeanor domestic violence in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   922(g)(9).1        Salley   appeals   claiming      prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.2     Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       \"It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted\nin any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, to ship\nor transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or\naffecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any\nfirearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in\ninterstate or foreign commence.\" 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).\n     2\n       As a housekeeping matter, we note that Salley supplemented\nhis counsel's prosecutorial misconduct argument by raising a host\nof other issues in a pro se brief. In particular, Salley claimed\nhis conviction violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms and\nthat he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel.\nSalley also simply listed in numerical form what he termed\n\"miscellaneous other issues\" with no corresponding arguments. The\n\"issues\" related to, among other things, the chain of evidence,\nsentencing, and the applicability of the Interstate Commerce\nClause.\n     We will not address any of Salley's pro se arguments as they\nare not properly before us.      Salley did not raise the Second\nAmendment argument below in his motion for a new trial and\ntherefore it is waived. See United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d\n1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997). Salley's \"miscellaneous other issues\"\nare also waived for his failure to raise them below and for their\nperfunctory treatment on appeal.     Id.  Finally, Salley's Sixth\nAmendment argument is also procedurally deficient because a habeas\ncorpus petition, not a direct appeal, is the proper vehicle for an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.     See United States v.\nGarcía-Pastrana, 584 F.3d 351, 388 (1st Cir. 2009).      We do not\nreview ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal\nabsent an evidentiary record that would allow us to sufficiently\nevaluate the claim, and we do not have such a record here. Id.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                            BACKGROUND\n\n                            The Arrest\n\n          Horace and Skyla Salley began dating in May 2005 and were\n\nmarried in December of that year.3   Skyla had two children from a\n\nprevious relationship and was pregnant with Salley's baby at the\n\ntime of the wedding. From the start, the couple's relationship was\n\na tumultuous one and things came to a head on November 25, 2006,\n\nwhen a 911 operator received a domestic assault complaint from\n\nSkyla, who indicated that Salley had a gun.   State trooper Carmen\n\nLilley was dispatched to the couple's home in Smyrna Mills, Maine.\n\n          Upon arrival, Lilley met Salley in the yard.      Salley\n\nfirst tried to deny that the 911 call originated from his home but\n\nLilley was not buying it.   Salley then admitted his identity and\n\nLilley cuffed him on suspicion of domestic assault.    Lilley next\n\nasked Salley three times where his gun was and each time Salley\n\ndenied having a gun or that there was a gun in the house.   Lilley\n\nleft a cuffed Salley in the squad car and went into the home where\n\nhe found a visibly shaken Skyla with the couple's baby in the\n\nbedroom. Skyla and Lilley spoke about what had happened, including\n\nthe fact that Salley had a gun, with which he had previously\n\nthreatened her.   Skyla also informed Lilley about the specific\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      For ease of reference, we refer to Horace Salley as \"Salley\"\nand Skyla Salley as \"Skyla\".\n\n                               -3-\n\fcircumstances surrounding Salley obtaining the gun (discussed fully\n\nbelow).    She then retrieved the gun out of the bedroom closet.\n\n                                 The Trial\n\n            Salley was arrested and charged with knowingly possessing\n\na firearm after being convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault.\n\nThe underlying domestic assault conviction involved an assault\n\nagainst an ex-girlfriend.       At the time of trial, Skyla and Salley\n\nhad divorced.\n\n            The main focus of the trial was whether the gun that\n\npolice seized from the Salley home (a Bushmaster Bullpup assault\n\nrifle) was in fact Salley's.      To establish this critical fact, the\n\ngovernment first called William Steinhagen, who had purchased a\n\nBushmaster Bullpup rifle at a shop in New Hampshire in 2003.\n\nSteinhagen testified that he traded the rifle sometime around 2005\n\nto a man in Maine for a 1946 Chevy.                 The trade came about when\n\nSteinhagen answered an advertisement the man had placed in a\n\nregional classified ad magazine called Uncle Henry's Swap and Sell\n\nGuide.    Steinhagen traveled to Maine to make the trade and though\n\nhe could not recall the man's name, he described his appearance and\n\nage as being similar to Salley's.            Steinhagen also testified that\n\nhe called the man's cell phone en route to the trade and the\n\ngovernment established through cell phone records that the phone\n\nnumber    Steinhagen   called    was    Salley's.         The   Uncle      Henry's\n\nadvertisement   was    also   admitted       into    evidence   and   it    listed\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fSalley's cell phone number as the contact number and the town he\n\nwas living in as the relevant town.          Steinhagen went on to identify\n\nthe firearm seized from Salley's home as the gun that he had\n\npurchased and then traded.            Steinhagen also confirmed that the\n\nserial number on the gun seized from the Salley home matched the\n\nserial number on the paperwork for the gun he bought.\n\n             Skyla also offered testimony regarding the gun's origins.\n\nShe was with Salley, she recalled, when he placed the Uncle Henry's\n\nadvertisement and when a man called in response to the ad.           Then in\n\nlate 2005, Skyla went with Salley to Detroit, Maine where she\n\nwaited in the car while Salley met with the man and obtained the\n\ngun.    Skyla thought Salley traded his flatbed truck for the gun.\n\n             The government also called two of Salley's acquaintances,\n\nDavid Smith and his father, James Smith.               As David remembered,\n\nSalley visited the Smith home in November 2005 with a woman.\n\nSkyla, being that woman, confirmed this gathering. David indicated\n\nthat during the visit Salley showed them a gun, fired it at an old\n\ncar in the yard, and let David fire it too.            David identified the\n\ngun police seized from the Salley home as the gun he fired with\n\nSalley.     James Smith, David's father, also testified that Salley\n\ncame to his home in November 2005 and that he caught a glimpse of\n\nSalley with a gun.         James also heard the gun being fired, leading\n\nhim    to   believe   it    was   a   semi-automatic   gun.    It   was   his\n\nunderstanding that Salley received the gun via trade in exchange\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffor either his flatbed wrecker or Chevy coupe.    James said he knew\n\nSalley from trading items with him.\n\n           In addition to testifying about Salley's acquisition of\n\nthe gun, Skyla also described her and Salley's home-life.        The\n\nfollowing testimony is relevant to this appeal.     In October 2005,\n\nthe Maine Department of Health and Human Services (\"DHHS\") took\n\nSkyla's oldest child away from her because caseworkers believed\n\nthat Salley was a threat to the child.    Realizing she had to make\n\na decision between Salley and her children - and choosing the\n\nlatter - Skyla broke it off with Salley.         Her first step was\n\nchecking into a women's shelter and obtaining a protection-from-\n\nabuse order against Salley out of fear for her life and safety.\n\nSkyla obtained the order in December 2005, and in the underlying\n\ncomplaint she claimed Salley owned a gun and had threatened her\n\nwith it.\n\n           The couple's separation was short-lived, and in January\n\n2006 the reunited pair moved into the Smyrna Mills home, which was\n\npurchased partially in Skyla's name.     About two weeks after they\n\nbought the house, Skyla said Salley retrieved his gun from a\n\nstorage unit and brought it into the home where he primarily kept\n\nit in his tool room.   Skyla recalled seeing Salley handle the gun\n\nand in particular she noted an instance a month before he got\n\narrested where he had the gun in his hands while he sat on the bed\n\nin the bedroom.   During the month leading up to his arrest, Salley,\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fas Skyla recounted, threatened more than once to shoot her with the\n\ngun.\n\n            After the government concluded its case, Salley presented\n\na series of witnesses though he chose not to testify himself.\n\nSalley called among others, DHHS case workers, the realtor who\n\nhandled the Smyrna Mills property sale, and neighbors. Significant\n\nfor purposes of this appeal, Salley called Rebecca Hughes, the\n\nwoman who purchased the Salleys' Smyrna Mills home from them.\n\nHughes testified that she began moving boxes containing her and her\n\nroommates' belongings into the home around November 11, 2006, which\n\nwas just prior to Salley's arrest.\n\n            Defense counsel rested and closing arguments followed.\n\nThe government highlighted the testimony of Steinhagen, Lilley, and\n\nthe Smiths.    The prosecutor argued that this testimony was enough\n\nto convict Salley, in the event the jury did not find Skyla\n\ncredible.     While the prosecutor downplayed Skyla's significance,\n\ndefense counsel's summation focused on her.        Essentially, the\n\ndefense theory was that Skyla (perhaps in cahoots with David Smith)\n\nconnived to put Salley in jail in order to keep DHHS off her back\n\nand so she could keep the sale proceeds from the Smyrna Mills home\n\nfor herself.     The jury wasn't convinced and found Salley guilty\n\nafter a short deliberation.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f                                   Post-Trial\n\n           Four days after the jury issued its verdict, the trial\n\njudge sua sponte raised a concern about statements made by the\n\nprosecutor during the government's closing.              The statements were:\n\n     Prosecutor: The bottom line is, the gun that                     Mr.\n     Steinhagen bought in New Hampshire was recovered from            the\n     defendant's bedroom on the date alleged in                       the\n     indictment.   There's been no suggestion that it                 was\n     planted there.    There's been no suggestion that                Mr.\n     Salley didn't know it was there.\n\nThe trial judge expressed concern that this statement might (1)\n\ncontradict the evidence, (2) imply Salley had the burden of proof,\n\nand/or (3) be perceived as a comment on Salley's decision not to\n\ntestify.   Apprised of the court's concerns, Salley filed a motion\n\nfor a new trial based on the prosecutor's statements.\n\n           In a written decision, the district court denied Salley's\n\nmotion.    While    the    court   found    that   the   prosecutor's    second\n\nstatement4 was inaccurate and that the jury would likely perceive\n\nit as a commentary on Salley's failure to take the stand; the court\n\nconcluded that the error was harmless in light of the cumulative\n\nevidence and the court's jury instructions.              Salley appealed the\n\ndenial of his new trial motion to this court.\n\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           Salley    did     not    contemporaneously        object     to   the\n\nprosecutor's statements and therefore we review for plain error.\n\n     4\n       \"There's been no suggestion that Mr. Salley didn't know it\nwas there.\"\n\n                                      -8-\n\fSee United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\"Plain error requires a showing (1) that an error occurred (2)\n\nwhich was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the\n\ndefendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited   States    v.   Landry,   631    F.3d   597,    606   (1st    Cir.     2011)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).               In other words,\n\nwe must question whether Salley can show both error and prejudice.\n\nSee United States v. Kinsella, 622 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\nPlain error reversals are limited to blockbuster errors and not\n\nordinary backfires.       See United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 35\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           We     determine   the       legal   question      of     whether     the\n\nprosecutor's comments constituted misconduct de novo.                  See United\n\nStates v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 39 (1st Cir. 2005).                     However, we\n\nreview whether the misconduct, if any, warranted a new trial for\n\nabuse of discretion.      See Robinson, 473 F.3d at 393.\n\n                                  ANALYSIS\n\n                           The First Statement\n\n           We begin with the first statement: \"There's been no\n\nsuggestion that it was planted there.\"                 Simply put, there is\n\nnothing improper about this statement.                 By his own admission,\n\nSalley's defense theory was that Skyla framed him - obtaining and\n\nplanting the gun herself. Defense counsel's closing reflected this\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\ftheory.5       Additionally, Salley presented the testimony of Rebecca\n\nHughes, who purchased the Smyrna Mills home and moved boxes in\n\nprior to Salley's arrest.           Obviously Salley's purpose in calling\n\nthis witness was to imply that the gun was amongst Hughes' boxed\n\npossessions.\n\n               By advancing these two theories, Salley opened the door\n\nto the statement at issue.          The government is permitted to comment\n\non the plausibility of the theory that Skyla or Hughes planted the\n\ngun.       See United States v. Glover, 558 F.3d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nWhen       commenting   on   the   tenability   of   a   defense   theory,   the\n\nprosecutor must focus on what the evidence has or hasn't shown,\n\n\"rather than on the defendant and what he or she has shown or\n\nfailed to show.\" Id. Here the prosecutor, referencing the defense\n\ntrial theory, did just that by saying \"[t]here's been no suggestion\n\n. . .\"       See United States v. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (finding prosecutor's remark that \"there's no real evidence\"\n\nwould likely be construed by a jury to refer to defendant's failure\n\nto produce evidence supporting his theory, as opposed to his\n\n\n       5\n       Defense counsel queried during closing: \"Does [Skyla] have\nan incentive herself to put Mr. Salley away so she can continue to\nmake some more bad choices with different men?\"       Later in the\nclosing, counsel speculated as to Skyla's thought process: \"So what\ndo I have to do? I have to get rid of Mr. Salley in a way that\ndoesn't bounce back on me. What's a good way to do that, put him\nin jail? Perhaps.\" Counsel drove the point home: \"Ms. Salley has,\nfrankly, so many reasons and lies that she has told and reasons and\nincentives that she has to put [Salley] away that it's, frankly,\nimpossible to sort out what her incentives, rationales, and\nmotivations are, but clearly they're there.\"\n\n                                       -10-\n\ffailure to testify).         This court has previously been reluctant to\n\nfind plain error when a prosecutor's remarks are made to rebut an\n\nargument by defense counsel and are commensurate with that purpose.\n\nSee United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 978 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nConsidering the above and given the high standard for plain error,\n\nwe find no plain error with respect to the first statement.\n\n                             The Second Statement\n\n               We proceed to the second statement: \"There's been no\n\nsuggestion that Mr. Salley didn't know it was there.\"                    This\n\nstatement is more problematic and requires a deeper delving. We do\n\nso by addressing the arguments raised by Salley, which mirror the\n\ndistrict court's concerns: (1) the statement shifts the burden of\n\nproof    and    (2)   the   statement   comments   on   Salley's   failure   to\n\ntestify.6\n\n               With respect to Salley's first argument, we have held\n\nthat \"as to comments that shift the burden . . . 'a prosecutor may\n\ncross the line [into impermissibility] by arguing to the jury that\n\nthe defendant is obligated to present evidence of his innocence.'\"\n\nGlover, 558 F.3d at 77 (internal citation omitted).                 We do not\n\nbelieve that line was crossed here.            In particular, the prosecutor\n\ndid not argue that Salley \"had the burden to prove another set of\n\n\n     6\n       As noted above, the district court was also concerned (and\nultimately found) that the second statement was inaccurate in light\nof Officer Lilley's testimony that Salley three times over denied\nknowledge of a gun in his home. Salley has not however raised the\nstatement's inaccuracy as a ground for this appeal.\n\n                                        -11-\n\ffacts.\"    Wilkerson,    411   F.3d   at   8.     Rather,      the     prosecutor's\n\nstatement drew attention to the lack of evidence that Salley was\n\nunaware of the gun's presence in his home.                Such a statement is\n\ndistinguishable from those we have previously found to be improper\n\nburden shifting comments.         See United States v. Roberts, 119 F.3d\n\n1006, 1015 (1st Cir. 1997) (prosecutor remarked that \"when a\n\ndefendant does 'go forward' to offer evidence, 'the defendant has\n\nthe same responsibility [as the government] and that is to present\n\na compelling case'\"); United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 769\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (prosecutor stated \"if [defense counsel] can stand\n\nup and explain away that conversation to you, then you should\n\n[acquit] . . . There's just no other explanation except the one\n\nthat's been provided . . . by the government.\").                 In these cases,\n\nthe prosecutor specifically said that the defense had a burden to\n\npresent evidence.        That is not so with the comment at issue.\n\nSalley's burden shifting claim is without traction.\n\n            Salley's     second     argument     -      that     the    prosecutor\n\nimpermissibly commented on his failure to testify - presents us\n\nwith a closer question.        To determine whether a comment trod on a\n\ndefendant's Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, this\n\ncourt \"ask[s] whether the language used was manifestly intended or\n\nwas   of   such   a   character    that    the   jury    would    naturally    and\n\nnecessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused\n\nto testify.\"      Glover, 558 F.3d at 77.        Here it is undisputed that\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fthe prosecutor did not intend to comment on Salley's failure to\n\ntestify.   Therefore our focus is on how the jury may have perceived\n\nthe comment.\n\n            Undoubtedly      the     prosecutor's        statement        is     not    a\n\nbarefaced reference to Salley's choice not to take the stand.                          Cf.\n\nUnited    States    v.

Cox, 752 F.2d 741, 745 (1st Cir. 1985) (prosecutor stated \"how\n\ndoes [defendant] explain\" certain evidence). However, because only\n\nSkyla and Salley lived in their home - and Skyla testified that\n\nSalley knew the gun was in the home - it can be argued that Salley\n\nwas the only other person who could have testified as to his\n\nknowledge of the gun's locale.             Thus the jury may have perceived\n\nthe statement as commentary on Salley not testifying.

Factors to be\n\nconsidered are: (1) the severity of the misconduct, (2) whether it\n\nwas   deliberate   or    inadvertent,   (3)    the    context   in   which    it\n\noccurred, (4) the likely effect of any curative instructions, and\n\n(5) the strength of the government's evidence of guilt.

Further there is zero indication that\n\nthe prosecutor's comment was a deliberate reference to Salley's\n\nfailure to testify.         The statement was made only once during\n\nclosing arguments and not elaborated on.

And\n\nalthough the lack of an objection means there was no specific\n\ncurative instruction, the court did instruct the jury in both its\n\npreliminary and final jury instructions that the lawyers' comments\n\nand closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury's memory\n\nof the evidence controlled.     The court also drew attention to\n\nSalley's constitutional right not to testify and cautioned the jury\n\nthat it should not draw a negative inference from this choice.    We\n\nassume the jury to have followed these instructions.   See Morales-\n\nVallellanes v. Potter, 605 F.3d 27, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n            Last but not least, the evidence linking Salley to the\n\ngun was tremendous: (1) the Uncle Henry ad, (2) phone records, (3)\n\nSkyla's testimony (including an in-court identification of the\n\nseized gun as Salley's), (4) Steinhagen's testimony (including an\n\nin-court identification of the seized gun as the one he traded),\n\n(5) David Smith's testimony (including an in-court identification\n\n\n     7\n       The prosecutor stated: \"[Lilley] then asked [Salley] three\ndifferent times if there was a gun in the house, if he had a gun,\nwhere's the gun, and on each occasion, Mr. Salley said, no, I don't\nhave a gun, I don't know anything about a gun.\"\n     8\n       Defense counsel indicated: \"Mr. Salley denied ever having\nknown anything about a gun.

And    despite   Salley's   contention      to   the\n\ncontrary, it is not a foregone conclusion that Skyla's testimony\n\nshould be discounted as unreliable.           The defense theory that Skyla\n\nentered into a year long conspiracy with some unknown accomplice to\n\nframe Salley is entirely unsupported by the evidence.\n\n           The statement at issue was not significant enough to\n\naffect Salley's rights or seriously impair his trial.                See Landry,\n\n631 F.3d at 606.      Salley has not surmounted the high hurdle of the\n\nplain error standard.

Delahanty II, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>A Maine jury found Horace W. Salley, III guilty of possession of a firearm following a conviction of misdemeanor domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).<sup>[1]</sup> Salley appeals claiming prosecutorial misconduct.<sup>[2]</sup> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*162</span> BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Arrest</h2>\n<p>Horace and Skyla Salley began dating in May 2005 and were married in December of that year.<sup>[3]</sup> Skyla had two children from a previous relationship and was pregnant with Salley's baby at the time of the wedding. From the start, the couple's relationship was a tumultuous one and things came to a head on November 25, 2006, when a 911 operator received a domestic assault complaint from Skyla, who indicated that Salley had a gun. State trooper Carmen Lilley was dispatched to the couple's home in Smyrna Mills, Maine.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, Lilley met Salley in the yard. Salley first tried to deny that the 911 call originated from his home but Lilley was not buying it. Salley then admitted his identity and Lilley cuffed him on suspicion of domestic assault. Lilley next asked Salley three times where his gun was and each time Salley denied having a gun or that there was a gun in the house. Lilley left a cuffed Salley in the squad car and went into the home where he found a visibly shaken Skyla with the couple's baby in the bedroom. Skyla and Lilley spoke about what had happened, including the fact that Salley had a gun, with which he had previously threatened her. Skyla also informed Lilley about the specific circumstances surrounding Salley obtaining the gun (discussed fully below). She then retrieved the gun out of the bedroom closet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Trial</h2>\n<p>Salley was arrested and charged with knowingly possessing a firearm after being convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault. The underlying domestic assault conviction involved an assault against an ex-girlfriend. At the time of trial, Skyla and Salley had divorced.</p>\n<p>The main focus of the trial was whether the gun that police seized from the Salley home (a Bushmaster Bullpup assault rifle) was in fact Salley's. To establish this critical fact, the government first called William Steinhagen, who had purchased a Bushmaster Bullpup rifle at a shop in New Hampshire in 2003. Steinhagen testified that he traded the rifle sometime around 2005 to a man in Maine for a 1946 Chevy. The trade came about when Steinhagen answered an advertisement the man had placed in a regional classified ad magazine called Uncle Henry's Swap and Sell Guide. Steinhagen traveled to Maine to make the trade and though he could not recall the man's name, he described his appearance and age as being similar to Salley's. Steinhagen also testified that he called the man's cell phone en route to the trade and the government established through cell phone records that the phone number Steinhagen called was Salley's. The Uncle Henry's advertisement was also admitted into evidence and it listed Salley's cell phone number as the contact number and the town he was living in as the relevant town. Steinhagen went on to identify the firearm seized from Salley's home as the gun that he had purchased and then traded. Steinhagen also confirmed that the serial number on the gun seized from the Salley home matched the serial number on the paperwork for the gun he bought.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*163</span> Skyla also offered testimony regarding the gun's origins. She was with Salley, she recalled, when he placed the Uncle Henry's advertisement and when a man called in response to the ad. Then in late 2005, Skyla went with Salley to Detroit, Maine where she waited in the car while Salley met with the man and obtained the gun. Skyla thought Salley traded his flatbed truck for the gun.</p>\n<p>The government also called two of Salley's acquaintances, David Smith and his father, James Smith. As David remembered, Salley visited the Smith home in November 2005 with a woman. Skyla, being that woman, confirmed this gathering. David indicated that during the visit Salley showed them a gun, fired it at an old car in the yard, and let David fire it too. David identified the gun police seized from the Salley home as the gun he fired with Salley. James Smith, David's father, also testified that Salley came to his home in November 2005 and that he caught a glimpse of Salley with a gun. James also heard the gun being fired, leading him to believe it was a semi-automatic gun. It was his understanding that Salley received the gun via trade in exchange for either his flatbed wrecker or Chevy coupe. James said he knew Salley from trading items with him.</p>\n<p>In addition to testifying about Salley's acquisition of the gun, Skyla also described her and Salley's home-life. The following testimony is relevant to this appeal. In October 2005, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (\"DHHS\") took Skyla's oldest child away from her because caseworkers believed that Salley was a threat to the child. Realizing she had to make a decision between Salley and her children  and choosing the latter  Skyla broke it off with Salley. Her first step was checking into a women's shelter and obtaining a protection-from-abuse order against Salley out of fear for her life and safety. Skyla obtained the order in December 2005, and in the underlying complaint she claimed Salley owned a gun and had threatened her with it.</p>\n<p>The couple's separation was short-lived, and in January 2006 the reunited pair moved into the Smyrna Mills home, which was purchased partially in Skyla's name. About two weeks after they bought the house, Skyla said Salley retrieved his gun from a storage unit and brought it into the home where he primarily kept it in his tool room. Skyla recalled seeing Salley handle the gun and in particular she noted an instance a month before he got arrested where he had the gun in his hands while he sat on the bed in the bedroom. During the month leading up to his arrest, Salley, as Skyla recounted, threatened more than once to shoot her with the gun.</p>\n<p>After the government concluded its case, Salley presented a series of witnesses though he chose not to testify himself. Salley called among others, DHHS case workers, the realtor who handled the Smyrna Mills property sale, and neighbors. Significant for purposes of this appeal, Salley called Rebecca Hughes, the woman who purchased the Salleys' Smyrna Mills home from them. Hughes testified that she began moving boxes containing her and her roommates' belongings into the home around November 11, 2006, which was just prior to Salley's arrest.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel rested and closing arguments followed. The government highlighted the testimony of Steinhagen, Lilley, and the Smiths. The prosecutor argued that this testimony was enough to convict Salley, in the event the jury did not find Skyla credible. While the prosecutor downplayed Skyla's significance, defense counsel's summation focused on her. Essentially, the defense theory was that Skyla (perhaps in cahoots <span class=\"star-pagination\">*164</span> with David Smith) connived to put Salley in jail in order to keep DHHS off her back and so she could keep the sale proceeds from the Smyrna Mills home for herself. The jury wasn't convinced and found Salley guilty after a short deliberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Post-Trial</h2>\n<p>Four days after the jury issued its verdict, the trial judge sua sponte raised a concern about statements made by the prosecutor during the government's closing. The statements were:</p>\n<blockquote>Prosecutor: The bottom line is, the gun that Mr. Steinhagen bought in New Hampshire was recovered from the defendant's bedroom on the date alleged in the indictment. There's been no suggestion that it was planted there. There's been no suggestion that Mr. Salley didn't know it was there.</blockquote>\n<p>The trial judge expressed concern that this statement might (1) contradict the evidence, (2) imply Salley had the burden of proof, and/or (3) be perceived as a comment on Salley's decision not to testify. Apprised of the court's concerns, Salley filed a motion for a new trial based on the prosecutor's statements.</p>\n<p>In a written decision, the district court denied Salley's motion. While the court found that the prosecutor's second statement<sup>[4]</sup> was inaccurate and that the jury would likely perceive it as a commentary on Salley's failure to take the stand; the court concluded that the error was harmless in light of the cumulative evidence and the court's jury instructions. Salley appealed the denial of his new trial motion to this court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>Salley did not contemporaneously object to the prosecutor's statements and therefore we review for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 473 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir.2007). \"Plain error requires a showing (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Landry,</i> 631 F.3d 597, 606 (1st Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, we must question whether Salley can show both error and prejudice. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Kinsella,</i> 622 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir.2010). Plain error reversals are limited to blockbuster errors and not ordinary backfires. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 447 F.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>We determine the legal question of whether the prosecutor's comments constituted misconduct de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Casas,</i> 425 F.3d 23, 39 (1st Cir. 2005). However, we review whether the misconduct, if any, warranted a new trial for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Robinson,</i> 473 F.3d at 393.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The First Statement</h2>\n<p>We begin with the first statement: \"There's been no suggestion that it was planted there.\" Simply put, there is nothing improper about this statement. By his own admission, Salley's defense theory was that Skyla framed him  obtaining and planting the gun herself. Defense counsel's closing reflected this theory.<sup>[5]</sup> Additionally, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*165</span> Salley presented the testimony of Rebecca Hughes, who purchased the Smyrna Mills home and moved boxes in prior to Salley's arrest. Obviously Salley's purpose in calling this witness was to imply that the gun was amongst Hughes' boxed possessions.</p>\n<p>By advancing these two theories, Salley opened the door to the statement at issue. The government is permitted to comment on the plausibility of the theory that Skyla or Hughes planted the gun. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Glover,</i> 558 F.3d 71, 78 (1st Cir.2009). When commenting on the tenability of a defense theory, the prosecutor must focus on what the evidence has or hasn't shown, \"rather than on the defendant and what he or she has shown or failed to show.\" <i>Id.</i> Here the prosecutor, referencing the defense trial theory, did just that by saying \"[t]here's been no suggestion...\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wilkerson,</i> 411 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.2005) (finding prosecutor's remark that \"there's no real evidence\" would likely be construed by a jury to refer to defendant's failure to produce evidence supporting his theory, as opposed to his failure to testify). This court has previously been reluctant to find plain error when a prosecutor's remarks are made to rebut an argument by defense counsel and are commensurate with that purpose. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 978 (1st Cir.1995). Considering the above and given the high standard for plain error, we find no plain error with respect to the first statement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Second Statement</h2>\n<p>We proceed to the second statement: \"There's been no suggestion that Mr. Salley didn't know it was there.\" This statement is more problematic and requires a deeper delving. We do so by addressing the arguments raised by Salley, which mirror the district court's concerns: (1) the statement shifts the burden of proof and (2) the statement comments on Salley's failure to testify.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>With respect to Salley's first argument, we have held that \"as to comments that shift the burden ... `a prosecutor may cross the line [into impermissibility] by arguing to the jury that the defendant is obligated to present evidence of his innocence.'\" <i>Glover,</i> 558 F.3d at 77 (internal citation omitted). We do not believe that line was crossed here. In particular, the prosecutor did not argue that Salley \"had the burden to prove another set of facts.\" <i>Wilkerson,</i> 411 F.3d at 8. Rather, the prosecutor's statement drew attention to the lack of evidence that Salley was unaware of the gun's presence in his home. Such a statement is distinguishable from those we have previously found to be improper burden shifting comments. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Roberts,</i> 119 F.3d 1006, 1015 (1st Cir.1997) (prosecutor remarked that \"when a defendant does `go forward' to offer evidence, `the defendant has the same responsibility [as the government] and that is to present a compelling case'\"); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*166</span> <i>United States v. Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d 761, 769 (1st Cir.1996) (prosecutor stated \"if [defense counsel] can stand up and explain away that conversation to you, then you should [acquit] ... There's just no other explanation except the one that's been provided... by the government.\"). In these cases, the prosecutor specifically said that the defense had a burden to present evidence. That is not so with the comment at issue. Salley's burden shifting claim is without traction.</p>\n<p>Salley's second argument  that the prosecutor impermissibly commented on his failure to testify  presents us with a closer question. To determine whether a comment trod on a defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, this court \"ask[s] whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\" <i>Glover,</i> 558 F.3d at 77. Here it is undisputed that the prosecutor did not intend to comment on Salley's failure to testify. Therefore our focus is on how the jury may have perceived the comment.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the prosecutor's statement is not a barefaced reference to Salley's choice not to take the stand. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Skandier,</i> 758 F.2d 43, 45 (1st Cir.1985) (prosecutor asked the jury to \"see if [defense counsel] can explain the story\" any differently than the prosecutor had); <i>United States v. Cox,</i> 752 F.2d 741, 745 (1st Cir.1985) (prosecutor stated \"how does [defendant] explain\" certain evidence). However, because only Skyla and Salley lived in their home  and Skyla testified that Salley knew the gun was in the home  it can be argued that Salley was the only other person who could have testified as to his knowledge of the gun's locale. Thus the jury may have perceived the statement as commentary on Salley not testifying. At the same time, it is conceivable that the statement (albeit clumsily) highlighted for the jury the absence of any testimony from defense witness Rebecca Hughes that she put the gun in the closet and that, to her knowledge, Salley was not aware of its presence.</p>\n<p>This second interpretation finds favor in the principle that courts \"should not lightly infer ... that a jury, sitting through a lengthy exhortation, will draw [the most damaging] meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\" <i>United States v. Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st Cir.1992). Further, we \"are especially reluctant to `fish in the pool of ambiguity' when, as now, the complaining party failed to bring a dubious comment, easily corrected on proper notice, to the immediate attention of the trial court.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 979 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Ultimately we need not grapple with this issue further. Although the prosecutor's statement debatably could be perceived as a reference to Salley's failure to testify, the statement is not grounds for reversal because there was no prejudice.</p>\n<p>This court \"will not reverse unless the prosecutor's remarks so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>United States v. Shoup,</i> 476 F.3d 38, 43 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Factors to be considered are: (1) the severity of the misconduct, (2) whether it was deliberate or inadvertent, (3) the context in which it occurred, (4) the likely effect of any curative instructions, and (5) the strength of the government's evidence of guilt. <i>Id.</i> at 44.</p>\n<p>Assuming the prosecutor's statement was misconduct, it was not severe but rather a limited (though admittedly inaccurate) reference to the evidence. Further there is zero indication that the prosecutor's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*167</span> comment was a deliberate reference to Salley's failure to testify. The statement was made only once during closing arguments and not elaborated on. In fact, the prosecutor herself contradicted the statement (correctly stating the evidence) earlier in her closing.<sup>[7]</sup> Defense counsel did the same during his closing.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>To boot, defense counsel's failure to object to the comment \"increases the likelihood that the effect on the jury was likewise fleeting and evanescent.\" <i>Shoup,</i> 476 F.3d at 44. And although the lack of an objection means there was no specific curative instruction, the court did instruct the jury in both its preliminary and final jury instructions that the lawyers' comments and closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury's memory of the evidence controlled. The court also drew attention to Salley's constitutional right not to testify and cautioned the jury that it should not draw a negative inference from this choice. We assume the jury to have followed these instructions. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter,</i> 605 F.3d 27, 34-35 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the evidence linking Salley to the gun was tremendous: (1) the Uncle Henry ad, (2) phone records, (3) Skyla's testimony (including an in-court identification of the seized gun as Salley's), (4) Steinhagen's testimony (including an in-court identification of the seized gun as the one he traded), (5) David Smith's testimony (including an in-court identification of the seized gun as the one he shot with Salley), and (6) James Smith's testimony. And despite Salley's contention to the contrary, it is not a foregone conclusion that Skyla's testimony should be discounted as unreliable. The defense theory that Skyla entered into a year long conspiracy with some unknown accomplice to frame Salley is entirely unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p>The statement at issue was not significant enough to affect Salley's rights or seriously impair his trial. <i>See </i><i>Landry,</i> 631 F.3d at 606. Salley has not surmounted the high hurdle of the plain error standard. <i>See </i><i>Ortiz,</i> 447 F.3d at 36.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To sum up, the prosecutor's statements did not constitute plain error and thus the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Salley's motion for a new trial. The district court is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commence.\" 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).</p>\n<p>[2]  As a housekeeping matter, we note that Salley supplemented his counsel's prosecutorial misconduct argument by raising a host of other issues in a pro se brief. In particular, Salley claimed his conviction violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms and that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. Salley also simply listed in numerical form what he termed \"miscellaneous other issues\" with no corresponding arguments. The \"issues\" related to, among other things, the chain of evidence, sentencing, and the applicability of the Interstate Commerce Clause.\n</p>\n<p>We will not address any of Salley's pro se arguments as they are not properly before us. Salley did not raise the Second Amendment argument below in his motion for a new trial and therefore it is waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bongiorno,</i> 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997). Salley's \"miscellaneous other issues\" are also waived for his failure to raise them below and for their perfunctory treatment on appeal. <i>Id.</i> Finally, Salley's Sixth Amendment argument is also procedurally deficient because a habeas corpus petition, not a direct appeal, is the proper vehicle for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <i>See </i><i>United States v. García-Pastrana,</i> 584 F.3d 351, 388 (1st Cir.2009). We do not review ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal absent an evidentiary record that would allow us to sufficiently evaluate the claim, and we do not have such a record here. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[3]  For ease of reference, we refer to Horace Salley as \"Salley\" and Skyla Salley as \"Skyla\".</p>\n<p>[4]  \"There's been no suggestion that Mr. Salley didn't know it was there.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  Defense counsel queried during closing: \"Does [Skyla] have an incentive herself to put Mr. Salley away so she can continue to make some more bad choices with different men?\" Later in the closing, counsel speculated as to Skyla's thought process: \"So what do I have to do? I have to get rid of Mr. Salley in a way that doesn't bounce back on me. What's a good way to do that, put him in jail? Perhaps.\" Counsel drove the point home: \"Ms. Salley has, frankly, so many reasons and lies that she has told and reasons and incentives that she has to put [Salley] away that it's, frankly, impossible to sort out what her incentives, rationales, and motivations are, but clearly they're there.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  As noted above, the district court was also concerned (and ultimately found) that the second statement was inaccurate in light of Officer Lilley's testimony that Salley three times over denied knowledge of a gun in his home. Salley has not however raised the statement's inaccuracy as a ground for this appeal.</p>\n<p>[7]  The prosecutor stated: \"[Lilley] then asked [Salley] three different times if there was a gun in the house, if he had a gun, where's the gun, and on each occasion, Mr. Salley said, no, I don't have a gun, I don't know anything about a gun.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Defense counsel indicated: \"Mr. Salley denied ever having known anything about a gun.

Salley, III guilty of possession of a firearm following a conviction of misdemeanor domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).<sup>[1]</sup> Salley appeals claiming prosecutorial misconduct.<sup>[2]</sup> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*162</span> BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Arrest</h2>\n<p>Horace and Skyla Salley began dating in May 2005 and were married in December of that year.<sup>[3]</sup> Skyla had two children from a previous relationship and was pregnant with Salley's baby at the time of the wedding. From the start, the couple's relationship was a tumultuous one and things came to a head on November 25, 2006, when a 911 operator received a domestic assault complaint from Skyla, who indicated that Salley had a gun. State trooper Carmen Lilley was dispatched to the couple's home in Smyrna Mills, Maine.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, Lilley met Salley in the yard. Salley first tried to deny that the 911 call originated from his home but Lilley was not buying it. Salley then admitted his identity and Lilley cuffed him on suspicion of domestic assault. Lilley next asked Salley three times where his gun was and each time Salley denied having a gun or that there was a gun in the house. Lilley left a cuffed Salley in the squad car and went into the home where he found a visibly shaken Skyla with the couple's baby in the bedroom. Skyla and Lilley spoke about what had happened, including the fact that Salley had a gun, with which he had previously threatened her. Skyla also informed Lilley about the specific circumstances surrounding Salley obtaining the gun (discussed fully below). She then retrieved the gun out of the bedroom closet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Trial</h2>\n<p>Salley was arrested and charged with knowingly possessing a firearm after being convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault. The underlying domestic assault conviction involved an assault against an ex-girlfriend. At the time of trial, Skyla and Salley had divorced.</p>\n<p>The main focus of the trial was whether the gun that police seized from the Salley home (a Bushmaster Bullpup assault rifle) was in fact Salley's. To establish this critical fact, the government first called William Steinhagen, who had purchased a Bushmaster Bullpup rifle at a shop in New Hampshire in 2003. Steinhagen testified that he traded the rifle sometime around 2005 to a man in Maine for a 1946 Chevy. The trade came about when Steinhagen answered an advertisement the man had placed in a regional classified ad magazine called Uncle Henry's Swap and Sell Guide. Steinhagen traveled to Maine to make the trade and though he could not recall the man's name, he described his appearance and age as being similar to Salley's. Steinhagen also testified that he called the man's cell phone en route to the trade and the government established through cell phone records that the phone number Steinhagen called was Salley's. The Uncle Henry's advertisement was also admitted into evidence and it listed Salley's cell phone number as the contact number and the town he was living in as the relevant town. Steinhagen went on to identify the firearm seized from Salley's home as the gun that he had purchased and then traded. Steinhagen also confirmed that the serial number on the gun seized from the Salley home matched the serial number on the paperwork for the gun he bought.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*163</span> Skyla also offered testimony regarding the gun's origins. She was with Salley, she recalled, when he placed the Uncle Henry's advertisement and when a man called in response to the ad. Then in late 2005, Skyla went with Salley to Detroit, Maine where she waited in the car while Salley met with the man and obtained the gun. Skyla thought Salley traded his flatbed truck for the gun.</p>\n<p>The government also called two of Salley's acquaintances, David Smith and his father, James Smith. As David remembered, Salley visited the Smith home in November 2005 with a woman. Skyla, being that woman, confirmed this gathering. David indicated that during the visit Salley showed them a gun, fired it at an old car in the yard, and let David fire it too. David identified the gun police seized from the Salley home as the gun he fired with Salley. James Smith, David's father, also testified that Salley came to his home in November 2005 and that he caught a glimpse of Salley with a gun. James also heard the gun being fired, leading him to believe it was a semi-automatic gun. It was his understanding that Salley received the gun via trade in exchange for either his flatbed wrecker or Chevy coupe. James said he knew Salley from trading items with him.</p>\n<p>In addition to testifying about Salley's acquisition of the gun, Skyla also described her and Salley's home-life. The following testimony is relevant to this appeal. In October 2005, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (\"DHHS\") took Skyla's oldest child away from her because caseworkers believed that Salley was a threat to the child. Realizing she had to make a decision between Salley and her children  and choosing the latter  Skyla broke it off with Salley. Her first step was checking into a women's shelter and obtaining a protection-from-abuse order against Salley out of fear for her life and safety. Skyla obtained the order in December 2005, and in the underlying complaint she claimed Salley owned a gun and had threatened her with it.</p>\n<p>The couple's separation was short-lived, and in January 2006 the reunited pair moved into the Smyrna Mills home, which was purchased partially in Skyla's name. About two weeks after they bought the house, Skyla said Salley retrieved his gun from a storage unit and brought it into the home where he primarily kept it in his tool room. Skyla recalled seeing Salley handle the gun and in particular she noted an instance a month before he got arrested where he had the gun in his hands while he sat on the bed in the bedroom. During the month leading up to his arrest, Salley, as Skyla recounted, threatened more than once to shoot her with the gun.</p>\n<p>After the government concluded its case, Salley presented a series of witnesses though he chose not to testify himself. Salley called among others, DHHS case workers, the realtor who handled the Smyrna Mills property sale, and neighbors. Significant for purposes of this appeal, Salley called Rebecca Hughes, the woman who purchased the Salleys' Smyrna Mills home from them. Hughes testified that she began moving boxes containing her and her roommates' belongings into the home around November 11, 2006, which was just prior to Salley's arrest.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel rested and closing arguments followed. The government highlighted the testimony of Steinhagen, Lilley, and the Smiths. The prosecutor argued that this testimony was enough to convict Salley, in the event the jury did not find Skyla credible. While the prosecutor downplayed Skyla's significance, defense counsel's summation focused on her. Essentially, the defense theory was that Skyla (perhaps in cahoots <span class=\"star-pagination\">*164</span> with David Smith) connived to put Salley in jail in order to keep DHHS off her back and so she could keep the sale proceeds from the Smyrna Mills home for herself. The jury wasn't convinced and found Salley guilty after a short deliberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Post-Trial</h2>\n<p>Four days after the jury issued its verdict, the trial judge sua sponte raised a concern about statements made by the prosecutor during the government's closing. The statements were:</p>\n<blockquote>Prosecutor: The bottom line is, the gun that Mr. Steinhagen bought in New Hampshire was recovered from the defendant's bedroom on the date alleged in the indictment. There's been no suggestion that it was planted there. There's been no suggestion that Mr. Salley didn't know it was there.</blockquote>\n<p>The trial judge expressed concern that this statement might (1) contradict the evidence, (2) imply Salley had the burden of proof, and/or (3) be perceived as a comment on Salley's decision not to testify. Apprised of the court's concerns, Salley filed a motion for a new trial based on the prosecutor's statements.</p>\n<p>In a written decision, the district court denied Salley's motion. While the court found that the prosecutor's second statement<sup>[4]</sup> was inaccurate and that the jury would likely perceive it as a commentary on Salley's failure to take the stand; the court concluded that the error was harmless in light of the cumulative evidence and the court's jury instructions. Salley appealed the denial of his new trial motion to this court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>Salley did not contemporaneously object to the prosecutor's statements and therefore we review for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202591\"><a href=\"/opinion/202591/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span>, 393 (1st Cir.2007). \"Plain error requires a showing (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Landry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183881\"><a href=\"/opinion/183881/united-states-v-landry/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, we must question whether Salley can show both error and prejudice. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Kinsella,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"177231\"><a href=\"/opinion/177231/united-states-v-kinsella/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2010). Plain error reversals are limited to blockbuster errors and not ordinary backfires. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202188\"><a href=\"/opinion/202188/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>We determine the legal question of whether the prosecutor's comments constituted misconduct de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792073\"><a href=\"/opinion/792073/united-states-v-angel-casas-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir. 2005). However, we review whether the misconduct, if any, warranted a new trial for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Robinson,</i> 473 F.3d at 393.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The First Statement</h2>\n<p>We begin with the first statement: \"There's been no suggestion that it was planted there.\" Simply put, there is nothing improper about this statement. By his own admission, Salley's defense theory was that Skyla framed him  obtaining and planting the gun herself. Defense counsel's closing reflected this theory.<sup>[5]</sup> Additionally, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*165</span> Salley presented the testimony of Rebecca Hughes, who purchased the Smyrna Mills home and moved boxes in prior to Salley's arrest. Obviously Salley's purpose in calling this witness was to imply that the gun was amongst Hughes' boxed possessions.</p>\n<p>By advancing these two theories, Salley opened the door to the statement at issue. The government is permitted to comment on the plausibility of the theory that Skyla or Hughes planted the gun. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Glover,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203740\"><a href=\"/opinion/203740/united-states-v-glover/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.2009). When commenting on the tenability of a defense theory, the prosecutor must focus on what the evidence has or hasn't shown, \"rather than on the defendant and what he or she has shown or failed to show.\" <i>Id.</i> Here the prosecutor, referencing the defense trial theory, did just that by saying \"[t]here's been no suggestion...\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wilkerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201628\"><a href=\"/opinion/201628/united-states-v-wilkerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir.2005) (finding prosecutor's remark that \"there's no real evidence\" would likely be construed by a jury to refer to defendant's failure to produce evidence supporting his theory, as opposed to his failure to testify). This court has previously been reluctant to find plain error when a prosecutor's remarks are made to rebut an argument by defense counsel and are commensurate with that purpose. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 978 (1st Cir.1995). Considering the above and given the high standard for plain error, we find no plain error with respect to the first statement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Second Statement</h2>\n<p>We proceed to the second statement: \"There's been no suggestion that Mr. Salley didn't know it was there.\" This statement is more problematic and requires a deeper delving. We do so by addressing the arguments raised by Salley, which mirror the district court's concerns: (1) the statement shifts the burden of proof and (2) the statement comments on Salley's failure to testify.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>With respect to Salley's first argument, we have held that \"as to comments that shift the burden ... `a prosecutor may cross the line [into impermissibility] by arguing to the jury that the defendant is obligated to present evidence of his innocence.'\" <i>Glover,</i> 558 F.3d at 77 (internal citation omitted). We do not believe that line was crossed here. In particular, the prosecutor did not argue that Salley \"had the burden to prove another set of facts.\" <i>Wilkerson,</i> 411 F.3d at 8. Rather, the prosecutor's statement drew attention to the lack of evidence that Salley was unaware of the gun's presence in his home. Such a statement is distinguishable from those we have previously found to be improper burden shifting comments. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197474\"><a href=\"/opinion/197474/united-states-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1015 (1st Cir.1997) (prosecutor remarked that \"when a defendant does `go forward' to offer evidence, `the defendant has the same responsibility [as the government] and that is to present a compelling case'\"); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*166</span> <i>United States v. Wihbey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196557\"><a href=\"/opinion/196557/united-states-v-wihbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir.1996) (prosecutor stated \"if [defense counsel] can stand up and explain away that conversation to you, then you should [acquit] ... There's just no other explanation except the one that's been provided... by the government.\"). In these cases, the prosecutor specifically said that the defense had a burden to present evidence. That is not so with the comment at issue. Salley's burden shifting claim is without traction.</p>\n<p>Salley's second argument  that the prosecutor impermissibly commented on his failure to testify  presents us with a closer question. To determine whether a comment trod on a defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, this court \"ask[s] whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\" <i>Glover,</i> 558 F.3d at 77. Here it is undisputed that the prosecutor did not intend to comment on Salley's failure to testify. Therefore our focus is on how the jury may have perceived the comment.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the prosecutor's statement is not a barefaced reference to Salley's choice not to take the stand. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Skandier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449680\"><a href=\"/opinion/449680/united-states-v-john-p-skandier/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.1985) (prosecutor asked the jury to \"see if [defense counsel] can explain the story\" any differently than the prosecutor had); <i>United States v. Cox,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446763\"><a href=\"/opinion/446763/united-states-v-dorothy-cox-united-states-of-america-v-anthony-marra/\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>, 745 (1st Cir.1985) (prosecutor stated \"how does [defendant] explain\" certain evidence). However, because only Skyla and Salley lived in their home  and Skyla testified that Salley knew the gun was in the home  it can be argued that Salley was the only other person who could have testified as to his knowledge of the gun's locale. Thus the jury may have perceived the statement as commentary on Salley not testifying. At the same time, it is conceivable that the statement (albeit clumsily) highlighted for the jury the absence of any testimony from defense witness Rebecca Hughes that she put the gun in the closet and that, to her knowledge, Salley was not aware of its presence.</p>\n<p>This second interpretation finds favor in the principle that courts \"should not lightly infer ... that a jury, sitting through a lengthy exhortation, will draw [the most damaging] meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\" <i>United States v. Lilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir.1992). Further, we \"are especially reluctant to `fish in the pool of ambiguity' when, as now, the complaining party failed to bring a dubious comment, easily corrected on proper notice, to the immediate attention of the trial court.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 979 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Ultimately we need not grapple with this issue further. Although the prosecutor's statement debatably could be perceived as a reference to Salley's failure to testify, the statement is not grounds for reversal because there was no prejudice.</p>\n<p>This court \"will not reverse unless the prosecutor's remarks so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>United States v. Shoup,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202624\"><a href=\"/opinion/202624/united-states-v-shoup/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Factors to be considered are: (1) the severity of the misconduct, (2) whether it was deliberate or inadvertent, (3) the context in which it occurred, (4) the likely effect of any curative instructions, and (5) the strength of the government's evidence of guilt. <i>Id.</i> at 44.</p>\n<p>Assuming the prosecutor's statement was misconduct, it was not severe but rather a limited (though admittedly inaccurate) reference to the evidence. Further there is zero indication that the prosecutor's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*167</span> comment was a deliberate reference to Salley's failure to testify. The statement was made only once during closing arguments and not elaborated on. In fact, the prosecutor herself contradicted the statement (correctly stating the evidence) earlier in her closing.<sup>[7]</sup> Defense counsel did the same during his closing.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>To boot, defense counsel's failure to object to the comment \"increases the likelihood that the effect on the jury was likewise fleeting and evanescent.\" <i>Shoup,</i> 476 F.3d at 44. And although the lack of an objection means there was no specific curative instruction, the court did instruct the jury in both its preliminary and final jury instructions that the lawyers' comments and closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury's memory of the evidence controlled. The court also drew attention to Salley's constitutional right not to testify and cautioned the jury that it should not draw a negative inference from this choice. We assume the jury to have followed these instructions. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146224\"><a href=\"/opinion/146224/morales-vallellanes-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 34-35 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the evidence linking Salley to the gun was tremendous: (1) the Uncle Henry ad, (2) phone records, (3) Skyla's testimony (including an in-court identification of the seized gun as Salley's), (4) Steinhagen's testimony (including an in-court identification of the seized gun as the one he traded), (5) David Smith's testimony (including an in-court identification of the seized gun as the one he shot with Salley), and (6) James Smith's testimony. And despite Salley's contention to the contrary, it is not a foregone conclusion that Skyla's testimony should be discounted as unreliable. The defense theory that Skyla entered into a year long conspiracy with some unknown accomplice to frame Salley is entirely unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p>The statement at issue was not significant enough to affect Salley's rights or seriously impair his trial. <i>See </i><i>Landry,</i> 631 F.3d at 606. Salley has not surmounted the high hurdle of the plain error standard. <i>See </i><i>Ortiz,</i> 447 F.3d at 36.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To sum up, the prosecutor's statements did not constitute plain error and thus the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Salley's motion for a new trial. The district court is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commence.\" 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).</p>\n<p>[2]  As a housekeeping matter, we note that Salley supplemented his counsel's prosecutorial misconduct argument by raising a host of other issues in a pro se brief. In particular, Salley claimed his conviction violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms and that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. Salley also simply listed in numerical form what he termed \"miscellaneous other issues\" with no corresponding arguments. The \"issues\" related to, among other things, the chain of evidence, sentencing, and the applicability of the Interstate Commerce Clause.\n</p>\n<p>We will not address any of Salley's pro se arguments as they are not properly before us. Salley did not raise the Second Amendment argument below in his motion for a new trial and therefore it is waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bongiorno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735399\"><a href=\"/opinion/735399/united-states-v-frank-p-bongiorno-united-states-of-america-v-frank-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span>, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997). Salley's \"miscellaneous other issues\" are also waived for his failure to raise them below and for their perfunctory treatment on appeal. <i>Id.</i> Finally, Salley's Sixth Amendment argument is also procedurally deficient because a habeas corpus petition, not a direct appeal, is the proper vehicle for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <i>See </i><i>United States v. García-Pastrana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204077\"><a href=\"/opinion/204077/united-states-v-garcia-pastrana/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 388 (1st Cir.2009). We do not review ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal absent an evidentiary record that would allow us to sufficiently evaluate the claim, and we do not have such a record here. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[3]  For ease of reference, we refer to Horace Salley as \"Salley\" and Skyla Salley as \"Skyla\".</p>\n<p>[4]  \"There's been no suggestion that Mr. Salley didn't know it was there.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  Defense counsel queried during closing: \"Does [Skyla] have an incentive herself to put Mr. Salley away so she can continue to make some more bad choices with different men?\" Later in the closing, counsel speculated as to Skyla's thought process: \"So what do I have to do? I have to get rid of Mr. Salley in a way that doesn't bounce back on me. What's a good way to do that, put him in jail? Perhaps.\" Counsel drove the point home: \"Ms. Salley has, frankly, so many reasons and lies that she has told and reasons and incentives that she has to put [Salley] away that it's, frankly, impossible to sort out what her incentives, rationales, and motivations are, but clearly they're there.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  As noted above, the district court was also concerned (and ultimately found) that the second statement was inaccurate in light of Officer Lilley's testimony that Salley three times over denied knowledge of a gun in his home. Salley has not however raised the statement's inaccuracy as a ground for this appeal.</p>\n<p>[7]  The prosecutor stated: \"[Lilley] then asked [Salley] three different times if there was a gun in the house, if he had a gun, where's the gun, and on each occasion, Mr. Salley said, no, I don't have a gun, I don't know anything about a gun.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Defense counsel indicated: \"Mr. Salley denied ever having known anything about a gun. The government pointed that out.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
