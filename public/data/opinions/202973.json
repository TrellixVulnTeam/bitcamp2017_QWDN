John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Richard L. Hartley for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          October 11, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n        Of the    Northern   District   of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f               LYNCH, Circuit Judge. In this case we decline to enforce\n\na defendant's waiver of rights contained in a plea agreement.\n\n               It has become common for the prosecution to require that\n\nplea    agreements      which   defendants    enter     contain   a   waiver    of\n\nconstitutional and statutory rights.               The Supreme Court has, in\n\nspecific contexts, upheld the practice.             See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 629-33 (2002) (defendant can waive right to\n\ngovernment's      required      disclosure    of   evidence   related    to    any\n\naffirmative defense or impeachment of witnesses); United States v.\n\nMezzanatto, 513 U.S. 196, 210 (1995) (defendant can waive right\n\nunder    the    rules   of   evidence    to   exclude    guilty   pleas,      plea\n\ndiscussions, and related statements); see also Halbert v. Michigan,\n\n545 U.S. 605, 624 n.8 (2005) (recognizing that defendant can waive\n\nright to all forms of appeal); Ricketts v. Adamson, 483 U.S. 1, 10\n\n(1987) (defendant can effectively waive double jeopardy protection\n\nby signing and then breaching plea agreement); Brady v. United\n\nStates, 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970) (noting that a guilty plea\n\nnecessarily is a waiver of the right against self-incrimination and\n\nthe right to trial by jury).\n\n               This court, following suit, will enforce knowing and\n\nvoluntary waivers by defendants in plea agreements of their rights\n\nto appeal, except when it would work a miscarriage of justice.\n\nUnited States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 23-25 (1st Cir. 2001).                   We\n\nhave also suggested that we will enforce defendants' waivers in\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fplea agreements or during plea colloquies of their Fifth Amendment\n\nright against self-incrimination, United States v. Conway, 81 F.3d\n\n15, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1996), their right to collaterally attack their\n\nconvictions through habeas proceedings, United States v. Ciampi,\n\n419 F.3d 20, 25-27 (1st Cir. 2005), their rights to trial by jury\n\nand assistance of counsel, United States v. Frechette, 456 F.3d 1,\n\n12-14 (1st Cir. 2006), and their right to receive any exculpatory\n\ninformation in the government's possession, United States v. Yeje-\n\nCabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 24 (1st Cir. 2005).               Further, we have\n\nrepeatedly   recognized    that   an   unconditional    guilty   plea   is\n\ninherently a waiver of all non-jurisdictional claims predating the\n\nplea.   See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez-Castillo, 350 F.3d 1,\n\n3-4 (1st Cir. 2003); see also Acevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961\n\nF.2d 305, 307-08 (1st Cir. 1992) (statute of limitations defense\n\nwaived); United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 442 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(challenge to voluntariness of confession waived).\n\n           This case concerns a type of waiver our court has not\n\naddressed before. This waiver has several distinct components. It\n\noccurs only when the defendant is, by terms of the agreement, in\n\nbreach of the plea agreement.     The alleged breach involved is the\n\ndefendant's motion to withdraw his plea, which has been granted by\n\nthe district court.       The waiver affects the defendant's later\n\nrights in the trial court after withdrawal of the plea, and not in\n\nthe court of appeals.     What are waived are that defendant's rights\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\funder Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 11(f) not to have his plea agreement or associated\n\nstatements admitted into evidence in later proceedings.1\n\n          Here,   defendant   Winslow   Newbert   originally   pleaded\n\nguilty; he was later permitted to withdraw his plea by the court\n\nbased on post-plea new plausible evidence of innocence.        United\n\nStates v. Newbert (Newbert I), 471 F. Supp. 2d 182, 199 (D. Me.\n\n2007).   The government contended that by successfully withdrawing\n\nhis plea, Newbert was in breach of his plea agreement and thus had\n\nwaived his Rule 410 rights.     The district court disagreed that\n\ndefendant was in breach of the agreement and refused to enforce the\n\nwaiver. Thus, on motion in limine, the court barred the government\n\nfrom using evidence excluded by Rule 410. United States v. Newbert\n\n(Newbert II), 477 F. Supp. 2d 287, 294 (D. Me. 2007).\n\n          The prosecution took this interlocutory appeal from the\n\npre-trial ruling excluding this evidence.     See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3731.\n\nWe affirm, finding no error in the court's construction of the\n\nagreement and in its exclusion order.\n\n\n     1\n           Rule 410 provides in relevant part: \"[E]vidence of the\nfollowing is not . . . admissible against the defendant who made\nthe plea . . .: (1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn; .\n. . (3) any statement made in the course of any proceedings under\nRule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure . . .; or (4)\nany statement made in the course of plea discussions with an\nattorney for the prosecuting authority . . . which result in a plea\nof guilty later withdrawn.\" Fed. R. Evid. 410.\n     Rule 11(f) provides: \"The admissibility or inadmissability of\na plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by\nFederal Rule of Evidence 410.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(f).\n\n                                 -4-\n\f                                    I.\n\n           During a February 2002 search of Newbert's home, the\n\npolice discovered, among other things, 18.3 grams of cocaine.\n\nBased on this evidence, Newbert pleaded guilty in June 2006 to a\n\nsingle violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1), possession with intent\n\nto distribute a controlled substance.       His plea agreement with the\n\ngovernment included waivers of his rights to appeal and to a speedy\n\ntrial; it also included the following provision, at issue in the\n\npresent case:\n\n           If defendant fails to enter a guilty plea or seeks and is\n           allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty entered pursuant\n           to this Agreement, under circumstances constituting a\n           breach of this Agreement, or if Defendant's guilty plea\n           is rejected due to Defendant's conduct constituting a\n           breach of this Agreement, he hereby waives any rights\n           that he has under Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of\n           Evidence and Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n           Procedure. Defendant understands that by waiving such\n           right, the following would be admissible against him in\n           any subsequent prosecution for the conduct underlying the\n           charges in the case: (a) the fact that he pleaded guilty\n           in this case; (b) all statements made in the course of\n           the guilty plea; and (c) all statements made during the\n           course of plea discussions.\n\nNewbert II, 477 F. Supp. 2d at 290 (quoting clause 5 of the plea\n\nagreement).\n\n           Less than two months later, Newbert moved to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea.    He argued that his plea had been based on a desire to\n\nprotect his wife and his friend James Michael Smith, but he had\n\nsince learned that his wife had moved in with Smith and that Smith\n\nwas   preparing   to   testify   against   him.   Further,   one   of   his\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fdaughters had informed Newbert that she had seen Smith place a pill\n\nbottle in Newbert's house near where the cocaine was found shortly\n\nbefore the February 2002 police search; his other daughter told him\n\nthat Smith had confessed to her that it was his cocaine the police\n\nhad discovered.2    Smith was to be the government's sole civilian\n\nwitness   against   Newbert,   and   the   government   had   no   physical\n\nevidence linking the cocaine to Newbert other than the location of\n\nits discovery.\n\n           The court ruled that Newbert's guilty plea had been\n\nknowing, intelligent and voluntary, but that there was nevertheless\n\na \"fair and just\" reason to allow Newbert to withdraw his plea.\n\nNewbert I, 471 F. Supp. 2d at 199; see also Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(d)(2)(B).     The court reasoned that Newbert had presented not\n\nonly new evidence as to his innocence, but also a plausible\n\nexplanation for why he would have pleaded guilty in the first place\n\n-- and why his motivation to do so had since changed.          Newbert I,\n\n471 F. Supp. 2d at 199.        Further, Newbert had moved quickly to\n\nwithdraw his plea before his sentencing, and the court emphasized\n\nthat the government would suffer no prejudice as a result.           It was\n\nthe government that had waited for more than three years to indict\n\nNewbert in the first place, and the government's case relied\n\nprimarily on law enforcement witnesses and experts, whose memories\n\n\n     2\n          This information was not entirely new, although its\nsource was. Newbert's wife had told him, prior to his plea, that\nthe cocaine may have been Smith's.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwere assumed to be more reliable than those of civilian witnesses.\n\nId.   Further, \"[t]here [was] no suggestion that critical witnesses\n\n[were] unavailable, that evidence [had] been lost, or that any\n\nsimilar prejudice would obtain.\"               Id.   \"Ultimately,\" the court\n\nconcluded, \"because a man's reputation and freedom hang in the\n\nbalance, . . . the better course is to allow a jury to determine\"\n\nwhether or not Newbert is in fact guilty.             Id.\n\n            The government was not pleased with this result and\n\nquickly   filed    a    motion   to   reconsider     the   order   granting    the\n\nwithdrawal; when that motion was denied, the government filed a\n\nmotion to reopen the hearing on withdrawal to present further\n\nevidence.      That motion was also denied.          Trying a different tack,\n\nthe government moved in limine for a ruling that Newbert's guilty\n\nplea and all related statements could be introduced against him at\n\nhis   trial,    based    on   the     waiver   language     in   Newbert's    plea\n\nagreement.      Newbert filed a competing motion in limine to exclude\n\nthis evidence.\n\n            The district court ruled that Newbert was not in breach\n\nof his plea agreement when he withdrew his plea and thus that\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 410 still applied in full.                 Newbert II,\n\n477 F. Supp. 2d. at 288.              The court referred to contract law\n\nprinciples and noted that the clause assumed that some withdrawals\n\nof guilty pleas would not constitute a breach.                   Id. at 290-91.\n\nRejecting the government's argument, repeated before this court,\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthat only guilty plea withdrawals based on government error or\n\nagreed to by the government would not breach the agreement, the\n\njudge concluded that if \"the defendant's post-plea evidence is\n\nsufficient   to    substantially       affect   the       basis   upon   which   the\n\ndefendant entered the plea agreement, a motion to withdraw cannot\n\nconstitute a breach of this agreement.\"               Id. at 293.        This, the\n\njudge noted, was the logical corollary of the government's argument\n\nthat withdrawal would not be in breach if the government \"agrees\n\nthat new evidence establishes the defendant's innocence,\" for \"the\n\nphrase must be interpreted evenly to allow for withdrawal without\n\nbreach when the defendant presents post-plea evidence of innocence\n\nand the Court concurs, even if the government does not.\"                    Id. at\n\n294.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           We review the district court's order excluding evidence\n\nfor abuse of discretion.         White v. N.H. Dept. of Corrections, 221\n\nF.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir. 2000).            Here the exclusion is based on\n\nconstruction      of    the   plea   agreement.       A    construction    of    the\n\nagreement based on an error of law would constitute an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. To the extent the district court's conclusion involved\n\nquestions of law as to the construction of the agreement, our\n\nreview is de novo.       United States v. Clark, 55 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).   This includes the question of whether there was a breach of\n\nthe agreement.         United States v. Doe, 233 F.3d 642, 643-44 (1st\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fCir. 2000); Clark, 55 F.3d at 11; United States v. Atwood, 963 F.2d\n\n476, 478 (1st Cir. 1992).            To the extent the court made factual\n\nfindings, such as the interpretation of ambiguous terms in light of\n\nthe intent and conduct of the parties, our review of the underlying\n\nfactual findings is for clear error.              Clark, 55 F.3d at 11.       The\n\ncourt made no error of fact or law, and there was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n              Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and Rule 11(f)\n\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by incorporation, is the\n\nlegacy of Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220 (1927), in which\n\nthe Supreme Court recognized that allowing a withdrawn guilty plea\n\nto be used against a defendant defeats the purpose of allowing the\n\nwithdrawal in the first place.                 Id. at 224 (\"Giving to the\n\nwithdrawn plea any weight is in principle quite as inconsistent\n\nwith the prior order [allowing withdrawal of the plea] as it would\n\nbe to hold the plea conclusive.\"); Fed. R. Evid. 410 note (citing\n\nKercheval). As the order allowing the withdrawal is an exercise of\n\nthe court's sound discretion, to effectively negate that order\n\nwould   not    only   harm     the   defendant's    rights,   but   would    also\n\nundermine the conclusiveness of the court's ruling. See Kercheval,\n\n274   U.S.    at   224;   23   Wright   &     Graham,   Federal   Practice   and\n\nProcedure: Evidence ยง 5342 (1980); see also 1A Wright, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure: Criminal ยง 171 (3d ed. 1999) (discussing\n\nthe policies underlying Rule 11 as including ensuring the court's\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\foversight of plea agreements and the prevention of abuse of the\n\nplea agreement process).       Further, providing some protection for\n\ndefendants    from   pleas   gone   awry   fosters   plea    bargaining   by\n\nencouraging openness and honesty during plea negotiations. Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 410 note.      These Rules thus protect important rights and\n\ninterests, but their protection can be waived by defendants.\n\nMezzanatto, 513 U.S. at 806.          The question presented here is\n\nwhether Newbert's successful motion to withdraw his guilty plea,\n\nbased on post-plea evidence of actual innocence, constitutes a\n\nbreach of his plea agreement such that he has waived his Rule 410\n\nand Rule 11(f) rights.\n\n          Basic contract principles apply to the construction of\n\nplea agreements.     Clark, 55 F.3d at 12; Atwood, 963 F.2d at 479.\n\nAmbiguities    in    plea    agreements    are   construed    against     the\n\ngovernment. United States v. Giorgi, 840 F.2d 1022, 1026 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (\"[W]e find that the costs of an unclear agreement must fall\n\nupon the government. . . . [W]e hold that the government must\n\nshoulder a greater degree of responsibility for lack of clarity in\n\na plea agreement.\").3        In this case, the \"under circumstances\n\nconstituting a breach\" clause is clearly ambiguous.          The agreement\n\n\n\n     3\n          This is not only because ambiguities in contracts are\ntraditionally interpreted against the drafter, Restatement (Second)\nof Contracts ยง 206 (1981), but also because plea agreements\nimplicate broader societal interests, some of constitutional\nmagnitude, Giorgi, 840 F.2d at 1026 (citing United States v.\nHarvey, 791 F.2d 294 (4th Cir. 1986)).\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcontains no definitions for when the withdrawal of a plea allowed\n\nby a court could constitute a breach.         The district court aptly\n\nnoted that the phrase \"under circumstances constituting a breach\"\n\nwhen applied to successful withdrawals of pleas is also not self-\n\ndefining.   Newbert II, 477 F. Supp. 2d at 291.         This clause by its\n\nterms does not purport to govern situations where a defendant has\n\nviolated other terms of a plea agreement, such as a failure to\n\ntestify or to testify honestly.\n\n            The government's construction of the agreement is that\n\nthe \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" of the agreement\n\nlanguage was meant to exclude situations in which government\n\nconduct was the cause of the defendant's successful motion to\n\nwithdraw the plea, as well as situations in which the government\n\nagreed to withdrawal of the plea, such as when new evidence has\n\nconvinced the government of the defendant's innocence.                This\n\nargument from the negative makes an inherent assumption that every\n\nsuccessful motion to withdraw is a breach unless the government\n\nprovokes it or agrees to it.    The government reads into the clause\n\nlanguage which is not there.        Taken literally, the government's\n\nposition would lead to the absurd conclusion that where a court,\n\nover the government's opposition, had found a plea not knowing,\n\nintelligent, and voluntary and vacated the plea, a defendant could\n\nnonetheless be in breach of the agreement and thus deemed to have\n\nwaived   the   defendant's   Rule    410   right   to   exclude   evidence\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fconcerning that defective plea. See Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. at 210 (a\n\nwaiver of a defendant's Rule 410 right will not be enforced if\n\nfound to be unknowing or involuntary).           If the government had such\n\na clear idea of what the breach language did or did not cover, it\n\ncould have said as much in the agreement itself.            Instead, not only\n\ndoes the government fail to acknowledge that it must bear the cost\n\nof   ambiguities    in   the   plea    agreement,      it   also   firmly   and\n\nincorrectly argues that the ambiguous language should be construed\n\nagainst the defendant.     It is the prosecution's locution which is\n\nodd.\n\n           Thus with unintended irony, the prosecution argues on\n\nappeal that the district court read into the agreement language\n\nwhich is not there.      It says the court construed the term \"under\n\ncircumstances      constituting   a    breach\"    to    mean   \"circumstances\n\ngenerated by the defendant, not necessarily agreed to by the\n\ngovernment.\"    But the court did not make that construction at all.\n\nThe court's full statement is instructive: \"The question here is\n\nwhat circumstances generated by the defendant, not necessarily\n\nagreed to by the government, should not be considered a breach.\"\n\nNewbert II, 477 F. Supp. 2d at 292.          The court was responding to\n\nthe one-sided interpretation of the government, noting that the\n\ngovernment could not be the sole arbiter of when a judicially\n\nsanctioned withdrawal would or would not constitute a breach;\n\n\"rather, [that decision] must rest with the court,\" which will\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fsometimes be swayed by defendant's arguments even if the government\n\nis not.    Id. at 293.\n\n            The government argues its construction is mandated by\n\nprior case law.       Not so.    In United States v. Swick, 262 F.3d 684\n\n(8th Cir. 2001), and United States v. Young, 223 F.3d 905 (8th Cir.\n\n2000), the Eighth Circuit considered only whether waivers of Rule\n\n410   rights   were    knowing    and    voluntary;   no   claims   of   actual\n\ninnocence were raised, nor any questions of interpretation.                 In\n\nYoung, the defendant breached his agreement by absconding before\n\nhis plea hearing.        223 F.3d at 907.         In Swick, the defendant\n\nwithdrew his plea apparently without much explanation. 262 F.3d at\n\n686 (noting that the district court \"act[ed] out of what appears to\n\nus to be an abundance of discretion\" in granting the withdrawal\n\nmotion).    In neither case did the defendants dispute that their\n\nactions constituted a breach.           The government also cites to United\n\nStates v. Molinaro, 11 F.3d 853 (9th Cir. 1993), but again in that\n\ncase the defendant's withdrawal of his plea was not based on a\n\nclaim of actual innocence.4\n\n            The prosecution misreads the district court as having\n\nheld that every time it is arguable that defendant would not\n\notherwise have entered the plea had he known then what he later\n\n\n\n      4\n          The court in Molinaro did not discuss the grounds for\nMolinaro's withdrawal of his guilty plea or explain why this\nwithdrawal constituted a breach under the terms of his agreement.\nSee 11 F.3d at 864.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fknew, then the withdrawal of a plea cannot be a breach of the\n\nagreement.   That was not the court's holding.   The district court\n\nenunciated a number of limiting principles on its decision that\n\ndefendant was not in breach, emphasizing the restrictions it had\n\nalready employed in deciding whether to permit withdrawal of the\n\nplea:\n\n          [T]he defendant must first be successful in his motion to\n          withdraw his guilty plea, a motion fraught with\n          difficulty; the defendant must also demonstrate that the\n          basis of the motion is evidence that he discovered only\n          after he entered his guilty plea, that he could not,\n          acting with due diligence, have discovered the evidence\n          before entering into the guilty plea, that the evidence\n          establishes a plausible basis for concluding that the\n          defendant was not guilty of the crime to which he pleaded\n          guilty, and that the evidence would have materially\n          affected his decision as to whether to plead guilty.\n\nNewbert II, 477 F. Supp. 2d at 294.   As the court noted, \"[t]hese\n\nsignificant limitations are rarely met, but they happen to be met\n\nin this case.\"    Id.   It was only as one of several limiting\n\nprinciples that the court noted that Newbert had a credible claim\n\nthat he would never have entered the plea agreement if he had had\n\nthe post-plea evidence available at the time he entered the plea.\n\n          Moreover, the prosecution's argument spins out from our\n\nstatement in Clark that the government was in breach of a plea\n\nagreement even though the government \"would not have made this\n\nagreement had it known then what it knows now.\"    55 F.3d at 113.\n\nIn that case, the government learned post-plea that the defendant\n\nmight have obstructed justice, and as a result it effectively\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fargued against the sentencing reduction it had promised in the plea\n\nagreement not to oppose.    There is an important difference between\n\nnew   information   suggesting   the    defendant   deserves   a   stronger\n\nsentence   and   new   information     suggesting   the   defendant   might\n\nactually be innocent.5    Cf. United States v. Barron, 172 F.3d 1153,\n\n1158 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"What is at stake for the defendant is his\n\nliberty. . . . What is at stake for the government is its interest\n\nin securing just punishment for violation of the law and its\n\ninterest that an innocent act not be punished at all.\").              This\n\ndifference limits the application of contract law principles to\n\nplea agreements; the analogy between plea agreements and commercial\n\ncontracts is not exact, and the parties do not necessarily bear\n\nequal obligations. See United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, 825 F.2d\n\n572, 578 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Contractual principles apply [to plea\n\nagreements] insofar as they are relevant in determining what the\n\ngovernment 'owes' the defendant.\"); United States v. Baldacchino,\n\n762 F.2d 170, 179 (1st Cir. 1985) (same); see also United States v.\n\nHarvey, 791 F.2d 294, 300 (4th Cir. 1986) (\"[T]he defendant's\n\nunderlying 'contract' right is constitutionally based and therefore\n\n\n\n\n      5\n          Newbert's original plea is not dispositive of his guilt.\nThore v. Howe, 466 F.3d 173, 185 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[T]here are a\nnumber of reasons why a defendant might choose to plead guilty.\").\n\n                                  -15-\n\freflects concerns that differ fundamentally from and run wider than\n\nthose of commercial contract law.\").6\n\n          The government's underlying quarrel is with the court's\n\ndecision to allow defendant's motion to withdraw the plea.            That\n\nissue is not before us, nor could it be.          See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3731\n\n(describing limited circumstances when the government may seek an\n\ninterlocutory appeal, which do not include withdrawals of pleas).\n\nIn pressing this dispute here, the prosecution is attempting an end\n\nrun around the limits of interlocutory appeal.\n\n          Indeed,   adoption   of    the   government's   argument   could\n\ncreate undesirable incentives in the system.        Cf. Mezzanatto, 513\n\nU.S. at 211 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (\"It may be . . . that a\n\nwaiver to use [plea-related] statements in the case in chief would\n\nmore severely undermine a defendant's incentive to negotiate, and\n\nthereby inhibit plea bargaining.\").\n\n\n     6\n           The prosecution has another attack, which again\nfundamentally misapprehends the ruling by the district court. The\nprosecution argues that the reasons the court gave for allowing the\nmotion to withdraw are irrelevant to whether the defendant is in\nbreach.   As a matter of logic, this is nonsensical.       The two\nquestions are inherently interrelated.      As a matter of basic\ncontract law, it is incorrect. Contracts may fail for a variety of\nreasons, including mistake, impracticability of performance, and\nfrustration of purpose. Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยงยง 152,\n261, 265 (1981). These contract law principles run parallel to,\nbut are not fully coextensive with, the reasons for which a federal\njudge may decide that the government or defendant is not in breach\nof a plea agreement. See, e.g., United States v. Bradley, 381 F.3d\n641, 648 (7th Cir. 2004) (invalidating plea agreement based on\nmutual mistake); United States v. Bunner, 134 F.3d 1000, 1004-05\n(10th Cir. 1998) (invalidating plea agreement based on frustration\nof purpose).\n\n                                    -16-\n\fThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n         Concurring opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n                    -17-\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.                   The plea agreement\n\nprovided   that    the    defendant    \"agrees     to    plead    guilty    to   the\n\nindictment\" charging him with possessing cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute; in exchange the government agreed to recommend a\n\nreduced sentence.         So the government perhaps has a plausible\n\nargument that the agreement, which was to plead guilty on specific\n\nterms and understandings, was breached when the defendant chose--\n\nhowever legitimately--to withdraw his plea and go to trial.\n\n           Yet because of the vague qualifier on the waiver (\"under\n\ncircumstances     constituting    a    breach     of    this    Agreement\"),     the\n\nlanguage is less airtight than it might have been; and ambiguity\n\ncounts   against    the    drafter    who,   in    this       case,   has   greater\n\nbargaining power and more expertise.                   Even if the qualifying\n\nlanguage was inserted to help the defendant, as the government\n\nclaims, it muddles the meaning.           So, on a strict reading of the\n\nplea language, the interpretation issue can reasonably be resolved\n\nagainst the government.\n\n           Policy might at first also suggest that the waiver clause\n\nbe narrowly construed, tipping the balance decisively against the\n\ngovernment.     That the government might use the admissions against\n\nthe   defendant    would     surely    discourage        an    otherwise     proper\n\nwithdrawal of a guilty plea.         Yet the government has some basis for\n\nasking for such a waiver (apart from discouraging withdrawals).\n\nOtherwise, a defendant might claim that information provided in the\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fplea       agreement   tainted   evidence    that   the   government   had\n\nindependently derived.       Cf. United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d\n\n369, 394-95 (D.C. Cir. 1991).7      But even if policy is neutral, the\n\npresent language leaves unclear whether it applies to a plea\n\nwithdrawal approved by the court based on new evidence.\n\n              Because the government may well redraft its language, a\n\nfurther point ought to be stressed.         Even if the withdrawal motion\n\nwere plainly a breach of the agreement, the district court would\n\nnot be required automatically to enforce the waiver.           The waiver\n\nconcerned trial rights--here, the right under Rule 410 to exclude\n\nplea discussions and related statements.            For good cause, the\n\ndistrict court can relieve a defendant of such a waiver--just as it\n\ncan relieve parties from a stipulation or refuse to honor a plea\n\nagreement's waiver of the right to appeal when the waiver would\n\neffect a \"miscarriage of justice.\"8\n\n              In the present circumstances, the district judge thought\n\nthat the withdrawal of the plea was adequately justified.              The\n\ndefendant had previously conceded that he had possessed and sold\n\ncocaine, and admission of these statements would largely have\n\n\n\n       7\n      The claim would not necessarily succeed. Rule 410 does not\nin terms apply to fruits and one circuit has said the fruits\ndoctrine would not apply. See United States v. Rutkowski, 814 F.2d\n594, 599 (11th Cir. 1987).\n       8\n      See Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc. v. Richard Lundgren, Inc., 314\nF.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 2002) (stipulation); United States v. Teeter,\n257 F.3d 14, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2001) (waiver of right to appeal).\n\n                                    -19-\n\fundercut   the    utility   of    the    new   trial   that   the   court   was\n\npermitting.      And, the waiver clause was less than pellucid.              In\n\nthese circumstances, a refusal to enforce the waiver would arguably\n\nhave been justified even if \"the contract\" were read in the\n\ngovernment's favor.\n\n           Defendants often have second thoughts about guilty pleas,\n\nwithdrawals      impose   costs    and    sometimes    seriously     prejudice\n\ngovernment    interests,     and    the     government    properly    resists\n\npromiscuous efforts to disavow such agreements.               But a claim of\n\ninnocence supported by new evidence is not lightly ignored by\n\njudges.    Where a trial judge has endorsed a plausible motion to\n\nwithdraw a plea on such a ground, the government--in considering\n\nappeal--should consider that the principle established may turn out\n\nto be one not much to its liking.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f",

The Supreme Court has, in specific contexts, upheld the practice. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ruiz,</i> 536 U.S. 622, 629-33, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002) (defendant can waive right to government's required disclosure of evidence related to any affirmative defense or impeachment of witnesses); <i>United States v. Mezzanatto,</i> 513 U.S. 196, 210, 115 S.Ct. 797, 130 L.Ed.2d 697 (1995) (defendant can waive right under the rules of evidence to exclude guilty pleas, plea discussions, and related statements); <i>see also </i><i>Halbert v. Michigan,</i> 545 U.S. 605, 624 n. 8, 125 S.Ct. 2582, 162 L.Ed.2d 552 (2005) (recognizing that defendant can waive right to all forms of appeal); <i>Ricketts v. Adamson,</i> 483 U.S. 1, 10, 107 S.Ct. 2680, 97 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987) (defendant can effectively waive double jeopardy protection by signing and then breaching plea agreement); <i>Brady v. United States,</i> 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970) (noting that a guilty plea necessarily is a waiver of the right against self-incrimination and the right to trial by jury).</p>\n<p>This court, following suit, will enforce knowing and voluntary waivers by defendants in plea agreements of their rights to appeal, except when it would work a miscarriage of justice. <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 23-25 (1st Cir.2001). We have also suggested that we will enforce defendants' waivers in plea agreements or during plea colloquies of their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, <i>United States v. Conway,</i> 81 F.3d 15, 16-17 (1st Cir.1996), their right to collaterally attack their convictions through habeas proceedings, <i>United States v. Ciampi,</i> 419 F.3d 20, 25-27 (1st Cir. 2005), their rights to trial by jury and assistance of counsel, <i>United States v. Frechette,</i> 456 F.3d 1, 12-14 (1st Cir.2006), and their right to receive any exculpatory information in the government's possession, <i>United States v. Yeje-Cabrera,</i> 430 F.3d 1, 24 (1st Cir.2005). Further, we have repeatedly recognized that an unconditional guilty plea is inherently a waiver of all non-jurisdictional claims predating the plea. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Castillo,</i> 350 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2003); <i>see also </i><i>Acevedo-Ramos v. United States,</i> 961 F.2d 305, 307-08 (1st Cir.1992) (statute of limitations defense waived); <i>United States v. Wright,</i> 873 F.2d 437, 442 (1st Cir.1989) (challenge to voluntariness of confession waived).</p>\n<p>This case concerns a type of waiver our court has not addressed before. This waiver has several distinct components. It occurs only when the defendant is, by terms of the agreement, in breach of the plea agreement. The alleged breach involved is the defendant's motion to withdraw his plea, which has been granted by the district court. The waiver affects the defendant's later rights in the trial court after withdrawal of the plea, and not in the court of appeals. What are waived are that defendant's rights under Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) not to have his plea agreement or associated statements admitted into evidence in later proceedings.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> Here, defendant Winslow Newbert originally pleaded guilty; he was later permitted to withdraw his plea by the court based on post-plea new plausible evidence of innocence. <i>United States v. Newbert</i> (<i>Newbert I</i>), 471 F.Supp.2d 182, 199 (D.Me.2007). The government contended that by successfully withdrawing his plea, Newbert was in breach of his plea agreement and thus had waived his Rule 410 rights. The district court disagreed that defendant was in breach of the agreement and refused to enforce the waiver. Thus, on motion in limine, the court barred the government from using evidence excluded by Rule 410. <i>United States v. Newbert</i> (<i>Newbert II</i>), 477 F.Supp.2d 287, 294 (D.Me.2007).</p>\n<p>The prosecution took this interlocutory appeal from the pre-trial ruling excluding this evidence. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. ยง 3731. We affirm, finding no error in the court's construction of the agreement and in its exclusion order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>During a February 2002 search of Newbert's home, the police discovered, among other things, 18.3 grams of cocaine. Based on this evidence, Newbert pleaded guilty in June 2006 to a single violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1), possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. His plea agreement with the government included waivers of his rights to appeal and to a speedy trial; it also included the following provision, at issue in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>If defendant</i> fails to enter a guilty plea or <i>seeks and is allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty entered pursuant to this Agreement, under circumstances constituting a breach of this Agreement,</i> or if Defendant's guilty plea is rejected due to Defendant's conduct constituting a breach of this Agreement, <i>he hereby waives any rights that he has under Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</i> Defendant understands that by waiving such right, the following would be admissible against him in any subsequent prosecution for the conduct underlying the charges in the case: (a) the fact that he pleaded guilty in this case; (b) all statements made in the course of the guilty plea; and (c) all statements made during the course of plea discussions.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d at 290 (quoting clause 5 of the plea agreement).</p>\n<p>Less than two months later, Newbert moved to withdraw his guilty plea. He argued that his plea had been based on a desire to protect his wife and his friend James Michael Smith, but he had since learned that his wife had moved in with Smith and that Smith was preparing to testify against him. Further, one of his daughters had informed Newbert that she had seen Smith place a pill bottle in Newbert's house near where the cocaine was found shortly before the February 2002 police search; his other daughter told him that Smith had confessed to her that it was his cocaine the police had discovered.<sup>[2]</sup> Smith was to be the government's sole civilian witness against Newbert, and the government had no physical evidence linking the cocaine to Newbert other than the location of its discovery.</p>\n<p>The court ruled that Newbert's guilty plea had been knowing, intelligent and voluntary, but that there was nevertheless a \"fair and just\" reason to allow Newbert to withdraw his plea. <i>Newbert I,</i> 471 F.Supp.2d at 199; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> 11(d)(2)(B). The court reasoned that Newbert had presented not only new evidence as to his innocence, but also a plausible explanation for why he would have pleaded guilty in the first placeยand why his motivation to do so had since changed. <i>Newbert I,</i> 471 F.Supp.2d at 199. Further, Newbert had moved quickly to withdraw his plea before his sentencing, and the court emphasized that the government would suffer no prejudice as a result. It was the government that had waited for more than three years to indict Newbert in the first place, and the government's case relied primarily on law enforcement witnesses and experts, whose memories were assumed to be more reliable than those of civilian witnesses. <i>Id.</i> Further, \"[t]here [was] no suggestion that critical witnesses [were] unavailable, that evidence [had] been lost, or that any similar prejudice would obtain.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Ultimately,\" the court concluded, \"because a man's reputation and freedom hang in the balance, . . . the better course is to allow a jury to determine\" whether or not Newbert is in fact guilty. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The government was not pleased with this result and quickly filed a motion to reconsider the order granting the withdrawal; when that motion was denied, the government filed a motion to reopen the hearing on withdrawal to present further evidence. That motion was also denied. Trying a different tack, the government moved in limine for a ruling that Newbert's guilty plea and all related statements could be introduced against him at his trial, based on the waiver language in Newbert's plea agreement. Newbert filed a competing motion in limine to exclude this evidence.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled that Newbert was not in breach of his plea agreement when he withdrew his plea and thus that Federal Rule of Evidence 410 still applied in full. <i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d. at 288. The court referred to contract law principles and noted that the clause assumed that some withdrawals of guilty pleas would not constitute a breach. <i>Id.</i> at 290-91. Rejecting the government's argument, repeated before this court, that only guilty plea withdrawals based on government error or agreed to by the government would not breach the agreement, the judge concluded that if \"the defendant's post-plea evidence is sufficient to substantially affect the basis upon which the defendant entered the plea agreement, a motion to withdraw cannot constitute a breach of this agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 293. This, the judge noted, was the logical corollary of the government's argument that withdrawal would not be in breach if <i>the government</i> \"agrees that new evidence establishes the defendant's innocence,\" for \"the phrase must be interpreted evenly to allow for withdrawal without breach when the defendant presents post-plea evidence of innocence and the Court concurs, even if the government does not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 294.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's order excluding evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>White v. N.H. Dept. of Corrections,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir.2000). Here the exclusion is based on construction of the plea agreement. A construction of the agreement based on an error of law would constitute an abuse of discretion. To the extent the district court's conclusion involved questions of law as to the construction of the agreement, our review is de novo. <i>United States v. Clark,</i> 55 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1995). This includes the question of whether there was a breach of the agreement. <i>United States v. Doe,</i> 233 F.3d 642, 643-44 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 11; <i>United States v. Atwood,</i> 963 F.2d 476, 478 (1st Cir.1992). To the extent the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*185</span> court made factual findings, such as the interpretation of ambiguous terms in light of the intent and conduct of the parties, our review of the underlying factual findings is for clear error. <i>Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 11. The court made no error of fact or law, and there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by incorporation, is the legacy of <i>Kercheval v. United States,</i> 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927), in which the Supreme Court recognized that allowing a withdrawn guilty plea to be used against a defendant defeats the purpose of allowing the withdrawal in the first place. <i>Id.</i> at 224, 47 S.Ct. 582 (\"Giving to the withdrawn plea any weight is in principle quite as inconsistent with the prior order [allowing withdrawal of the plea] as it would be to hold the plea conclusive.\"); Fed.R.Evid. 410 note (citing <i>Kercheval</i>). As the order allowing the withdrawal is an exercise of the court's sound discretion, to effectively negate that order would not only harm the defendant's rights, but would also undermine the conclusiveness of the court's ruling. <i>See </i><i>Kercheval,</i> 274 U.S. at 224, 47 S.Ct. 582; 23 Wright &amp; Graham, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence</i> ยง 5342 (1980); <i>see also</i> 1A Wright, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal</i> ยง 171 (3d ed.1999) (discussing the policies underlying Rule 11 as including ensuring the court's oversight of plea agreements and the prevention of abuse of the plea agreement process). Further, providing some protection for defendants from pleas gone awry fosters plea bargaining by encouraging openness and honesty during plea negotiations. Fed.R.Evid. 410 note. These Rules thus protect important rights and interests, but their protection can be waived by defendants. <i>Mezzanatto,</i> 513 U.S. at 210, 115 S.Ct. 797. The question presented here is whether Newbert's successful motion to withdraw his guilty plea, based on post-plea evidence of actual innocence, constitutes a breach of his plea agreement such that he has waived his Rule 410 and Rule 11(f) rights.</p>\n<p>Basic contract principles apply to the construction of plea agreements. <i>Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 12; <i>Atwood,</i> 963 F.2d at 479. Ambiguities in plea agreements are construed against the government. <i>United States v. Giorgi,</i> 840 F.2d 1022, 1026 (1st Cir.1988) (\"[W]e find that the costs of an unclear agreement must fall upon the government. . . . [W]e hold that the government must shoulder a greater degree of responsibility for lack of clarity in a plea agreement.\").<sup>[3]</sup> In this case, the \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" clause is clearly ambiguous. The agreement contains no definitions for when the withdrawal of a plea allowed by a court could constitute a breach. The district court aptly noted that the phrase \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" when applied to successful withdrawals of pleas is also not self-defining. <i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d at 291. This clause by its terms does not purport to govern situations where a defendant has violated other terms of a plea agreement, such as a failure to testify or to testify honestly.</p>\n<p>The government's construction of the agreement is that the \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" of the agreement language was meant to exclude situations in which government conduct was the cause of the defendant's successful <span class=\"star-pagination\">*186</span> motion to withdraw the plea, as well as situations in which the government agreed to withdrawal of the plea, such as when new evidence has convinced the government of the defendant's innocence. This argument from the negative makes an inherent assumption that every successful motion to withdraw is a breach unless the government provokes it or agrees to it. The government reads into the clause language which is not there. Taken literally, the government's position would lead to the absurd conclusion that where a court, over the government's opposition, had found a plea not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary and vacated the plea, a defendant could nonetheless be in breach of the agreement and thus deemed to have waived the defendant's Rule 410 right to exclude evidence concerning that defective plea. <i>See </i><i>Mezzanatto,</i> 513 U.S. at 210, 115 S.Ct. 797 (a waiver of a defendant's Rule 410 right will not be enforced if found to be unknowing or involuntary). If the government had such a clear idea of what the breach language did or did not cover, it could have said as much in the agreement itself. Instead, not only does the government fail to acknowledge that it must bear the cost of ambiguities in the plea agreement, it also firmly and incorrectly argues that the ambiguous language should be construed <i>against</i> the defendant. It is the prosecution's locution which is odd.</p>\n<p>Thus with unintended irony, the prosecution argues on appeal that the district court read into the agreement language which is not there. It says the court construed the term \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" to mean \"circumstances generated by the defendant, not necessarily agreed to by the government.\" But the court did not make that construction at all. The court's full statement is instructive: \"The question here is what circumstances generated by the defendant, not necessarily agreed to by the government, should not be considered a breach.\" <i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d at 292. The court was responding to the one-sided interpretation of the government, noting that the government could not be the sole arbiter of when a judicially sanctioned withdrawal would or would not constitute a breach; \"rather, [that decision] must rest with the court,\" which will sometimes be swayed by defendant's arguments even if the government is not. <i>Id.</i> at 293.</p>\n<p>The government argues its construction is mandated by prior case law. Not so. In <i>United States v. Swick,</i> 262 F.3d 684 (8th Cir.2001), and <i>United States v. Young,</i> 223 F.3d 905 (8th Cir.2000), the Eighth Circuit considered only whether waivers of Rule 410 rights were knowing and voluntary; no claims of actual innocence were raised, nor any questions of interpretation. In <i>Young,</i> the defendant breached his agreement by absconding before his plea hearing. 223 F.3d at 907. In <i>Swick,</i> the defendant withdrew his plea apparently without much explanation. 262 F.3d at 686 (noting that the district court \"act[ed] out of what appears to us to be an abundance of discretion\" in granting the withdrawal motion). In neither case did the defendants dispute that their actions constituted a breach. The government also cites to <i>United States v. Molinaro,</i> 11 F.3d 853 (9th Cir.1993), but again in that case the defendant's withdrawal of his plea was not based on a claim of actual innocence.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The prosecution misreads the district court as having held that every time it is arguable that defendant would not otherwise have entered the plea had he known <span class=\"star-pagination\">*187</span> then what he later knew, then the withdrawal of a plea cannot be a breach of the agreement. That was not the court's holding. The district court enunciated a number of limiting principles on its decision that defendant was not in breach, emphasizing the restrictions it had already employed in deciding whether to permit withdrawal of the plea:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he defendant must first be successful in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, a motion fraught with difficulty; the defendant must also demonstrate that the basis of the motion is evidence that he discovered only after he entered his guilty plea, that he could not, acting with due diligence, have discovered the evidence before entering into the guilty plea, that the evidence establishes a plausible basis for concluding that the defendant was not guilty of the crime to which he pleaded guilty, and that the evidence would have materially affected his decision as to whether to plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d at 294. As the court noted, \"[t]hese significant limitations are rarely met, but they happen to be met in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> It was only as one of several limiting principles that the court noted that Newbert had a credible claim that he would never have entered the plea agreement if he had had the post-plea evidence available at the time he entered the plea.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the prosecution's argument spins out from our statement in <i>Clark</i> that the government was in breach of a plea agreement even though the government \"would not have made this agreement had it known then what it knows now.\" 55 F.3d at 113. In that case, the government learned post-plea that the defendant might have obstructed justice, and as a result it effectively argued against the sentencing reduction it had promised in the plea agreement not to oppose. There is an important difference between new information suggesting the defendant deserves a stronger sentence and new information suggesting the defendant might actually be innocent.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Barron,</i> 172 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir.1999) (\"What is at stake for the defendant is his liberty. . . . What is at stake for the government is its interest in securing just punishment for violation of the law and its interest that an innocent act not be punished at all.\"). This difference limits the application of contract law principles to plea agreements; the analogy between plea agreements and commercial contracts is not exact, and the parties do not necessarily bear equal obligations. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez,</i> 825 F.2d 572, 578 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Contractual principles apply [to plea agreements] insofar as they are relevant in determining what the government `owes' the defendant.\"); <i>United States v. Baldacchino,</i> 762 F.2d 170, 179 (1st Cir.1985) (same); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Harvey,</i> 791 F.2d 294, 300 (4th Cir.1986) (\"[T]he defendant's underlying `contract' right is constitutionally based and therefore reflects concerns that differ fundamentally from and run wider than those of commercial contract law.\").<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*188</span> The government's underlying quarrel is with the court's decision to allow defendant's motion to withdraw the plea. That issue is not before us, nor could it be. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. ยง 3731 (describing limited circumstances when the government may seek an interlocutory appeal, which do not include withdrawals of pleas). In pressing this dispute here, the prosecution is attempting an end run around the limits of interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p>Indeed, adoption of the government's argument could create undesirable incentives in the system. <i>Cf. </i><i>Mezzanatto,</i> 513 U.S. at 211, 115 S.Ct. 797 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (\"It may be . . . that a waiver to use [plea-related] statements in the case in chief would more severely undermine a defendant's incentive to negotiate, and thereby inhibit plea bargaining.\").</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>The plea agreement provided that the defendant \"agrees to plead guilty to the indictment\" charging him with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute; in exchange the government agreed to recommend a reduced sentence. So the government perhaps has a plausible argument that the agreement, which was to plead guilty on specific terms and understandings, was breached when the defendant choseยhowever legitimatelyยto withdraw his plea and go to trial.</p>\n<p>Yet because of the vague qualifier on the waiver (\"under circumstances constituting a breach of this Agreement\"), the language is less airtight than it might have been; and ambiguity counts against the drafter who, in this case, has greater bargaining power and more expertise. Even if the qualifying language was inserted to help the defendant, as the government claims, it muddles the meaning. So, on a strict reading of the plea language, the interpretation issue can reasonably be resolved against the government.</p>\n<p>Policy might at first also suggest that the waiver clause be narrowly construed, tipping the balance decisively against the government. That the government might use the admissions against the defendant would surely discourage an otherwise proper withdrawal of a guilty plea. Yet the government has some basis for asking for such a waiver (apart from discouraging withdrawals). Otherwise, a defendant might claim that information provided in the plea agreement tainted evidence that the government had independently derived. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Poindexter,</i> 951 F.2d 369, 392 (D.C.Cir.1991).<sup>[7]</sup> But even if policy is neutral, the present language leaves unclear whether it applies to a plea withdrawal approved by the court based on new evidence.</p>\n<p>Because the government may well redraft its language, a further point ought to be stressed. Even if the withdrawal motion were plainly a breach of the agreement, the district court would not be required <span class=\"star-pagination\">*189</span> automatically to enforce the waiver. The waiver concerned trial rightsยhere, the right under Rule 410 to exclude plea discussions and related statements. For good cause, the district court can relieve a defendant of such a waiverยjust as it can relieve parties from a stipulation or refuse to honor a plea agreement's waiver of the right to appeal when the waiver would effect a \"miscarriage of justice.\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In the present circumstances, the district judge thought that the withdrawal of the plea was adequately justified. The defendant had previously conceded that he had possessed and sold cocaine, and admission of these statements would largely have undercut the utility of the new trial that the court was permitting. And, the waiver clause was less than pellucid. In these circumstances, a refusal to enforce the waiver would arguably have been justified even if \"the contract\" were read in the government's favor.</p>\n<p>Defendants often have second thoughts about guilty pleas, withdrawals impose costs and sometimes seriously prejudice government interests, and the government properly resists promiscuous efforts to disavow such agreements. But a claim of innocence supported by new evidence is not lightly ignored by judges. Where a trial judge has endorsed a plausible motion to withdraw a plea on such a ground, the governmentยin considering appealย should consider that the principle established may turn out to be one not much to its liking.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Rule 410 provides in relevant part: \"[E]vidence of the following is not . . . admissible against the defendant who made the plea . . . :(1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn; . . . (3) any statement made in the course of any proceedings under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure . . .; or (4) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority . . . which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.\" Fed.R.Evid. 410.\n</p>\n<p>Rule 11(f) provides: \"The admissibility or inadmissability of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 410.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f).</p>\n<p>[2]  This information was not entirely new, although its source was. Newbert's wife had told him, prior to his plea, that the cocaine may have been Smith's.</p>\n<p>[3]  This is not only because ambiguities in contracts are traditionally interpreted against the drafter, <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> ยง 206 (1981), but also because plea agreements implicate broader societal interests, some of constitutional magnitude, <i>Giorgi,</i> 840 F.2d at 1026 (citing <i>United States v. Harvey,</i> 791 F.2d 294 (4th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p>[4]  The court in <i>Molinaro</i> did not discuss the grounds for Molinaro's withdrawal of his guilty plea or explain why this withdrawal constituted a breach under the terms of his agreement. <i>See</i> 11 F.3d at 864.</p>\n<p>[5]  Newbert's original plea is not dispositive of his guilt. <i>Thore v. Howe,</i> 466 F.3d 173, 185 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[T]here are a number of reasons why a defendant might choose to plead guilty.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  The prosecution has another attack, which again fundamentally misapprehends the ruling by the district court. The prosecution argues that the reasons the court gave for allowing the motion to withdraw are irrelevant to whether the defendant is in breach. As a matter of logic, this is nonsensical. The two questions are inherently interrelated. As a matter of basic contract law, it is incorrect. Contracts may fail for a variety of reasons, including mistake, impracticability of performance, and frustration of purpose. <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> ยงยง 152, 261, 265 (1981). These contract law principles run parallel to, but are not fully coextensive with, the reasons for which a federal judge may decide that the government or defendant is not in breach of a plea agreement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Bradley,</i> 381 F.3d 641, 648 (7th Cir.2004) (invalidating plea agreement based on mutual mistake); <i>United States v. Bunner,</i> 134 F.3d 1000, 1004-05 (10th Cir. 1998) (invalidating plea agreement based on frustration of purpose).</p>\n<p>[7]  The claim would not necessarily succeed. Rule 410 does not in terms apply to fruits and one circuit has said the fruits doctrine would not apply. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rutkowski,</i> 814 F.2d 594, 599 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>See </i><i>Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc. v. Richard Lundgren, Inc.,</i> 314 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir.2002) (stipulation); <i>United States v.

This waiver has several distinct components. It occurs only when the defendant is, by terms of the agreement, in breach of the plea agreement. The alleged breach involved is the defendant's motion to withdraw his plea, which has been granted by the district court. The waiver affects the defendant's later rights in the trial court after withdrawal of the plea, and not in the court of appeals. What are waived are that defendant's rights under Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) not to have his plea agreement or associated statements admitted into evidence in later proceedings.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> Here, defendant Winslow Newbert originally pleaded guilty; he was later permitted to withdraw his plea by the court based on post-plea new plausible evidence of innocence. <i>United States v.

The government contended that by successfully withdrawing his plea, Newbert was in breach of his plea agreement and thus had waived his Rule 410 rights. The district court disagreed that defendant was in breach of the agreement and refused to enforce the waiver. Thus, on motion in limine, the court barred the government from using evidence excluded by Rule 410. <i>United States v.

Based on this evidence, Newbert pleaded guilty in June 2006 to a single violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1), possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. His plea agreement with the government included waivers of his rights to appeal and to a speedy trial; it also included the following provision, at issue in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>If defendant</i> fails to enter a guilty plea or <i>seeks and is allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty entered pursuant to this Agreement, under circumstances constituting a breach of this Agreement,</i> or if Defendant's guilty plea is rejected due to Defendant's conduct constituting a breach of this Agreement, <i>he hereby waives any rights that he has under Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</i> Defendant understands that by waiving such right, the following would be admissible against him in any subsequent prosecution for the conduct underlying the charges in the case: (a) the fact that he pleaded guilty in this case; (b) all statements made in the course of the guilty plea; and (c) all statements made during the course of plea discussions.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d at 290 (quoting clause 5 of the plea agreement).</p>\n<p>Less than two months later, Newbert moved to withdraw his guilty plea. He argued that his plea had been based on a desire to protect his wife and his friend James Michael Smith, but he had since learned that his wife had moved in with Smith and that Smith was preparing to testify against him. Further, one of his daughters had informed Newbert that she had seen Smith place a pill bottle in Newbert's house near where the cocaine was found shortly before the February 2002 police search; his other daughter told him that Smith had confessed to her that it was his cocaine the police had discovered.<sup>[2]</sup> Smith was to be the government's sole civilian witness against Newbert, and the government had no physical evidence linking the cocaine to Newbert other than the location of its discovery.</p>\n<p>The court ruled that Newbert's guilty plea had been knowing, intelligent and voluntary, but that there was nevertheless a \"fair and just\" reason to allow Newbert to withdraw his plea. <i>Newbert I,</i> 471 F.Supp.2d at 199; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> 11(d)(2)(B). The court reasoned that Newbert had presented not only new evidence as to his innocence, but also a plausible explanation for why he would have pleaded guilty in the first placeยand why his motivation to do so had since changed. <i>Newbert I,</i> 471 F.Supp.2d at 199. Further, Newbert had moved quickly to withdraw his plea before his sentencing, and the court emphasized that the government would suffer no prejudice as a result. It was the government that had waited for more than three years to indict Newbert in the first place, and the government's case relied primarily on law enforcement witnesses and experts, whose memories were assumed to be more reliable than those of civilian witnesses. <i>Id.</i> Further, \"[t]here [was] no suggestion that critical witnesses [were] unavailable, that evidence [had] been lost, or that any similar prejudice would obtain.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Ultimately,\" the court concluded, \"because a man's reputation and freedom hang in the balance, . . . the better course is to allow a jury to determine\" whether or not Newbert is in fact guilty. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The government was not pleased with this result and quickly filed a motion to reconsider the order granting the withdrawal; when that motion was denied, the government filed a motion to reopen the hearing on withdrawal to present further evidence. That motion was also denied. Trying a different tack, the government moved in limine for a ruling that Newbert's guilty plea and all related statements could be introduced against him at his trial, based on the waiver language in Newbert's plea agreement. Newbert filed a competing motion in limine to exclude this evidence.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled that Newbert was not in breach of his plea agreement when he withdrew his plea and thus that Federal Rule of Evidence 410 still applied in full. <i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d. at 288. The court referred to contract law principles and noted that the clause assumed that some withdrawals of guilty pleas would not constitute a breach. <i>Id.</i> at 290-91. Rejecting the government's argument, repeated before this court, that only guilty plea withdrawals based on government error or agreed to by the government would not breach the agreement, the judge concluded that if \"the defendant's post-plea evidence is sufficient to substantially affect the basis upon which the defendant entered the plea agreement, a motion to withdraw cannot constitute a breach of this agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 293. This, the judge noted, was the logical corollary of the government's argument that withdrawal would not be in breach if <i>the government</i> \"agrees that new evidence establishes the defendant's innocence,\" for \"the phrase must be interpreted evenly to allow for withdrawal without breach when the defendant presents post-plea evidence of innocence and the Court concurs, even if the government does not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 294.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's order excluding evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>White v.

Further, providing some protection for defendants from pleas gone awry fosters plea bargaining by encouraging openness and honesty during plea negotiations. Fed.R.Evid. 410 note. These Rules thus protect important rights and interests, but their protection can be waived by defendants. <i>Mezzanatto,</i> 513 U.S. at 210, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117889\"><a href=\"/opinion/117889/united-states-v-mezzanatto/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span>. The question presented here is whether Newbert's successful motion to withdraw his guilty plea, based on post-plea evidence of actual innocence, constitutes a breach of his plea agreement such that he has waived his Rule 410 and Rule 11(f) rights.</p>\n<p>Basic contract principles apply to the construction of plea agreements. <i>Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 12; <i>Atwood,</i> 963 F.2d at 479. Ambiguities in plea agreements are construed against the government. <i>United States v. Giorgi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502427\"><a href=\"/opinion/502427/united-states-v-edgardo-giorgi-united-states-of-america-v-gilberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span>, 1026 (1st Cir.1988) (\"[W]e find that the costs of an unclear agreement must fall upon the government. . . . [W]e hold that the government must shoulder a greater degree of responsibility for lack of clarity in a plea agreement.\").<sup>[3]</sup> In this case, the \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" clause is clearly ambiguous. The agreement contains no definitions for when the withdrawal of a plea allowed by a court could constitute a breach. The district court aptly noted that the phrase \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" when applied to successful withdrawals of pleas is also not self-defining. <i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d at 291. This clause by its terms does not purport to govern situations where a defendant has violated other terms of a plea agreement, such as a failure to testify or to testify honestly.</p>\n<p>The government's construction of the agreement is that the \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" of the agreement language was meant to exclude situations in which government conduct was the cause of the defendant's successful <span class=\"star-pagination\">*186</span> motion to withdraw the plea, as well as situations in which the government agreed to withdrawal of the plea, such as when new evidence has convinced the government of the defendant's innocence. This argument from the negative makes an inherent assumption that every successful motion to withdraw is a breach unless the government provokes it or agrees to it. The government reads into the clause language which is not there. Taken literally, the government's position would lead to the absurd conclusion that where a court, over the government's opposition, had found a plea not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary and vacated the plea, a defendant could nonetheless be in breach of the agreement and thus deemed to have waived the defendant's Rule 410 right to exclude evidence concerning that defective plea. <i>See </i><i>Mezzanatto,</i> 513 U.S. at 210, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117889\"><a href=\"/opinion/117889/united-states-v-mezzanatto/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span> (a waiver of a defendant's Rule 410 right will not be enforced if found to be unknowing or involuntary). If the government had such a clear idea of what the breach language did or did not cover, it could have said as much in the agreement itself. Instead, not only does the government fail to acknowledge that it must bear the cost of ambiguities in the plea agreement, it also firmly and incorrectly argues that the ambiguous language should be construed <i>against</i> the defendant. It is the prosecution's locution which is odd.</p>\n<p>Thus with unintended irony, the prosecution argues on appeal that the district court read into the agreement language which is not there. It says the court construed the term \"under circumstances constituting a breach\" to mean \"circumstances generated by the defendant, not necessarily agreed to by the government.\" But the court did not make that construction at all. The court's full statement is instructive: \"The question here is what circumstances generated by the defendant, not necessarily agreed to by the government, should not be considered a breach.\" <i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d at 292. The court was responding to the one-sided interpretation of the government, noting that the government could not be the sole arbiter of when a judicially sanctioned withdrawal would or would not constitute a breach; \"rather, [that decision] must rest with the court,\" which will sometimes be swayed by defendant's arguments even if the government is not. <i>Id.</i> at 293.</p>\n<p>The government argues its construction is mandated by prior case law. Not so. In <i>United States v. Swick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774622\"><a href=\"/opinion/774622/united-states-v-marvin-l-swick/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2001), and <i>United States v. Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770051\"><a href=\"/opinion/770051/united-states-v-leland-duane-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2000), the Eighth Circuit considered only whether waivers of Rule 410 rights were knowing and voluntary; no claims of actual innocence were raised, nor any questions of interpretation. In <i>Young,</i> the defendant breached his agreement by absconding before his plea hearing. 223 F.3d at 907. In <i>Swick,</i> the defendant withdrew his plea apparently without much explanation. 262 F.3d at 686 (noting that the district court \"act[ed] out of what appears to us to be an abundance of discretion\" in granting the withdrawal motion). In neither case did the defendants dispute that their actions constituted a breach. The government also cites to <i>United States v. Molinaro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658614\"><a href=\"/opinion/658614/united-states-v-john-lee-molinaro-united-states-of-america-v-donald-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1993), but again in that case the defendant's withdrawal of his plea was not based on a claim of actual innocence.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The prosecution misreads the district court as having held that every time it is arguable that defendant would not otherwise have entered the plea had he known <span class=\"star-pagination\">*187</span> then what he later knew, then the withdrawal of a plea cannot be a breach of the agreement. That was not the court's holding. The district court enunciated a number of limiting principles on its decision that defendant was not in breach, emphasizing the restrictions it had already employed in deciding whether to permit withdrawal of the plea:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he defendant must first be successful in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, a motion fraught with difficulty; the defendant must also demonstrate that the basis of the motion is evidence that he discovered only after he entered his guilty plea, that he could not, acting with due diligence, have discovered the evidence before entering into the guilty plea, that the evidence establishes a plausible basis for concluding that the defendant was not guilty of the crime to which he pleaded guilty, and that the evidence would have materially affected his decision as to whether to plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Newbert II,</i> 477 F.Supp.2d at 294. As the court noted, \"[t]hese significant limitations are rarely met, but they happen to be met in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> It was only as one of several limiting principles that the court noted that Newbert had a credible claim that he would never have entered the plea agreement if he had had the post-plea evidence available at the time he entered the plea.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the prosecution's argument spins out from our statement in <i>Clark</i> that the government was in breach of a plea agreement even though the government \"would not have made this agreement had it known then what it knows now.\" 55 F.3d at 113. In that case, the government learned post-plea that the defendant might have obstructed justice, and as a result it effectively argued against the sentencing reduction it had promised in the plea agreement not to oppose. There is an important difference between new information suggesting the defendant deserves a stronger sentence and new information suggesting the defendant might actually be innocent.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Barron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763078\"><a href=\"/opinion/763078/99-cal-daily-op-serv-2765-1999-daily-journal-dar-3598-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span>, 1158 (9th Cir.1999) (\"What is at stake for the defendant is his liberty. . . . What is at stake for the government is its interest in securing just punishment for violation of the law and its interest that an innocent act not be punished at all.\"). This difference limits the application of contract law principles to plea agreements; the analogy between plea agreements and commercial contracts is not exact, and the parties do not necessarily bear equal obligations. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492352\"><a href=\"/opinion/492352/united-states-v-pedro-m-gonzalez-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span>, 578 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Contractual principles apply [to plea agreements] insofar as they are relevant in determining what the government `owes' the defendant.\"); <i>United States v.

That issue is not before us, nor could it be. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. ยง 3731 (describing limited circumstances when the government may seek an interlocutory appeal, which do not include withdrawals of pleas). In pressing this dispute here, the prosecution is attempting an end run around the limits of interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p>Indeed, adoption of the government's argument could create undesirable incentives in the system. <i>Cf. </i><i>Mezzanatto,</i> 513 U.S. at 211, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117889\"><a href=\"/opinion/117889/united-states-v-mezzanatto/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span> (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (\"It may be . . . that a waiver to use [plea-related] statements in the case in chief would more severely undermine a defendant's incentive to negotiate, and thereby inhibit plea bargaining.\").</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>The plea agreement provided that the defendant \"agrees to plead guilty to the indictment\" charging him with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute; in exchange the government agreed to recommend a reduced sentence. So the government perhaps has a plausible argument that the agreement, which was to plead guilty on specific terms and understandings, was breached when the defendant choseยhowever legitimatelyยto withdraw his plea and go to trial.</p>\n<p>Yet because of the vague qualifier on the waiver (\"under circumstances constituting a breach of this Agreement\"), the language is less airtight than it might have been; and ambiguity counts against the drafter who, in this case, has greater bargaining power and more expertise. Even if the qualifying language was inserted to help the defendant, as the government claims, it muddles the meaning. So, on a strict reading of the plea language, the interpretation issue can reasonably be resolved against the government.</p>\n<p>Policy might at first also suggest that the waiver clause be narrowly construed, tipping the balance decisively against the government. That the government might use the admissions against the defendant would surely discourage an otherwise proper withdrawal of a guilty plea. Yet the government has some basis for asking for such a waiver (apart from discouraging withdrawals). Otherwise, a defendant might claim that information provided in the plea agreement tainted evidence that the government had independently derived. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Poindexter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573867\"><a href=\"/opinion/573867/united-states-v-john-m-poindexter/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, 392 (D.C.Cir.1991).<sup>[7]</sup> But even if policy is neutral, the present language leaves unclear whether it applies to a plea withdrawal approved by the court based on new evidence.</p>\n<p>Because the government may well redraft its language, a further point ought to be stressed. Even if the withdrawal motion were plainly a breach of the agreement, the district court would not be required <span class=\"star-pagination\">*189</span> automatically to enforce the waiver. The waiver concerned trial rightsยhere, the right under Rule 410 to exclude plea discussions and related statements. For good cause, the district court can relieve a defendant of such a waiverยjust as it can relieve parties from a stipulation or refuse to honor a plea agreement's waiver of the right to appeal when the waiver would effect a \"miscarriage of justice.\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In the present circumstances, the district judge thought that the withdrawal of the plea was adequately justified. The defendant had previously conceded that he had possessed and sold cocaine, and admission of these statements would largely have undercut the utility of the new trial that the court was permitting. And, the waiver clause was less than pellucid. In these circumstances, a refusal to enforce the waiver would arguably have been justified even if \"the contract\" were read in the government's favor.</p>\n<p>Defendants often have second thoughts about guilty pleas, withdrawals impose costs and sometimes seriously prejudice government interests, and the government properly resists promiscuous efforts to disavow such agreements. But a claim of innocence supported by new evidence is not lightly ignored by judges. Where a trial judge has endorsed a plausible motion to withdraw a plea on such a ground, the governmentยin considering appealย should consider that the principle established may turn out to be one not much to its liking.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Rule 410 provides in relevant part: \"[E]vidence of the following is not . . . admissible against the defendant who made the plea . . . :(1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn; . . .

The prosecution argues that the reasons the court gave for allowing the motion to withdraw are irrelevant to whether the defendant is in breach. As a matter of logic, this is nonsensical. The two questions are inherently interrelated. As a matter of basic contract law, it is incorrect. Contracts may fail for a variety of reasons, including mistake, impracticability of performance, and frustration of purpose. <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> ยงยง 152, 261, 265 (1981). These contract law principles run parallel to, but are not fully coextensive with, the reasons for which a federal judge may decide that the government or defendant is not in breach of a plea agreement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v.
