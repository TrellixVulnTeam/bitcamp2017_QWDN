Jimenez on brief pro se.\n     Ramón E. Dávila-Carlos on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                              March 5, 2007\n\f               Per Curiam.       Pro se appellants Orlando Colon-Jimenez and\n\nhis mother, Lydia E. Jimenez, timely appeal from the dismissal of\n\ntheir discrimination complaint against the company and individuals\n\nwho manage the Proyecto Residencial Las Flores housing project in\n\nAibonito, Puerto Rico, where they have lived for over twenty years.\n\nWe affirm the entry of summary judgment for appellees essentially\n\nfor the reasons stated in the district court's decisions dated\n\nOctober 13, 2005 and March 30, 2006, adding only the following.\n\n               Appellants    claim    that     they   each   suffer   from   mental\n\ndisabilities and that they requested a transfer to a different\n\napartment at Las Flores as a reasonable accommodation of those\n\ndisabilities.        Appellants further claim that appellees' denial of\n\ntheir transfer request constituted impermissible discrimination\n\nagainst them on the basis of their disabilities in violation of the\n\nFair Housing Act (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 3613, and section 504 of the\n\n1974 Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.1               In order to make out a\n\nprima       facie   case   for    failure    to   accommodate   under   the   FHA,\n\nappellants bear the burden of establishing three things:                 that the\n\nrequested accommodation is (1) reasonable and (2) necessary to (3)\n\nafford the handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy\n\nthe housing.        Bryant Woods Inn v. Howard County, 124 F.3d 597, 603\n\n\n\n        1\n         Appellants have not appealed the dismissal without\nprejudice of their supplemental claims based on Articles 1802 and\n1803 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 L.P.R.A. §§ 5141-42.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f(4th Cir. 1997); Schroeder v. Bertolo, 942 F. Supp. 72, 75 (D.P.R.\n\n1996).      But before a district court can assess whether a plaintiff\n\nhas met his or her burden of establishing each of the elements of\n\na   prima    facie   case,    the   plaintiff   must    show   that   a   special\n\naccommodation of a disability was, in fact, requested.                  A routine\n\nor \"mundane\" request, Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254,\n\n260 (1st Cir. 2001), such as a request to transfer to a different\n\napartment, does not rise to the level of a request for a reasonable\n\naccommodation unless the plaintiff specifically explains \"how the\n\naccommodation requested is linked to some disability.\" Id. at 261.\n\n              Even after indulging all inferences in appellants' favor,\n\nour de novo review of the record shows that at the time appellants\n\nrequested a transfer to apartment #G-5, and for several months\n\nafter that request was denied, appellants repeatedly informed\n\nappellees that they needed the transfer in order to get away from\n\nconflicts with noisy neighbors, which they had been unable to\n\nresolve.      Appellants claim that throughout this time, appellees\n\nwere     \"well   aware\"      of   their    disabilities   and    need     for   an\n\naccommodation.       To be sure, there is evidence in the record that\n\nindicates that appellees made changes to appellants' apartment to\n\nmake it physically more accessible for Lydia E. Jimenez, who was\n\nthen 71 years old, and that Orlando Colon-Jimenez received Social\n\nSecurity      disability      insurance     benefits.     But    such     general\n\n\"awareness\" does not transform appellants' request to move to a\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fdifferent apartment into a request for a reasonable accommodation.\n\nIt is appellants' responsibility to put appellees \"on notice by\n\nmaking 'a sufficiently direct and specific request for special\n\naccommodations.'\" Gill v. Franklin Pierce Law School, 899 F. Supp.\n\n850, 855 (D.N.H. 1995) (quoting Nathanson v. Med. Coll. of Pa., 926\n\nF.2d 1368, 1381 (3d Cir. 1991)).          Indeed, beyond asserting that\n\nappellants needed a quiet apartment in order to protect their\n\nmental health, it was never made clear precisely how the transfer\n\nrequest    was   linked   to   or   made     necessary    by   appellants'\n\ndisabilities.\n\n           In view of the lack of evidence on this crucial point,\n\nthe district court was correct in concluding that appellants'\n\ntransfer   request   represents     not    \"even-handed   treatment,\"    as\n\nrequired by the FHA, but an action that would give appellants\n\n\"greater opportunity than nonhandicapped persons,\" Bryant Woods\n\nInn, 124 F.3d at 604 (citing Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442\n\nU.S. 397, 410-11 (1979)), as transfers solely because of noise are\n\nnot permitted as of right at Las Flores and, as the district court\n\nexplained, virtually any tenant would prefer a quiet apartment over\n\na noisy one.     Because appellants have failed to show appellees'\n\nactions were discriminatory, their pretext claim also fails. Lewis\n\nv. Gillette Co., 22 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1994) (per curiam).           And,\n\nfinally, we find no evidence of retaliation against appellants.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f             The district court also correctly dismissed appellants'\n\ndue process claims.         Appellants assert that appellees violated\n\ntheir procedural due process rights by failing to restore Orlando\n\nColon-Jimenez to his mother's lease, yet nowhere in the record does\n\nit appear that Colon-Jimenez ever applied for admission to the Las\n\nFlores project after he voluntarily terminated his lease, nor does\n\nthe record contain any facts indicating that appellees' admissions\n\nprocess was unavailable or inadequate.              El Dia, Inc. v. Rossello,\n\n20 F. Supp. 2d 296, 306 (D.P.R. 1998), aff'd, 165 F.3d 106 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n             To the extent that appellants also claim violations of\n\ntheir substantive due process rights, we observe that, \"[w]here, as\n\nhere,   a   plaintiff's     substantive       due   process     claim   challenges\n\nspecific acts of a state officer, the plaintiff must show both that\n\nthe acts were so egregious as to shock the conscience and that they\n\ndeprived     him   of   a   protected    interest        in   life,   liberty,   or\n\nproperty.\"     Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(citing Rivera v. Rhode Island, 402 F.3d 27, 34 (1st Cir. 2005)).\n\nThere is no \"conscience-shocking\" conduct in this record, and\n\nappellants have not been deprived of housing -- they still reside\n\nin   the    apartment   that   was   modified       to    accommodate    Lydia   E.\n\nJimenez's physical disabilities.\n\n             The   district    court's    grant     of    summary     judgment   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f",
