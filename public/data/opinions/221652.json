GERRY, WARDEN, NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE PRISON,\n\n                      Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n           APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n       [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Boudin, Lipez and Howard,\n\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David M. Rothstein, Deputy Chief Appellate Defender, New\nHampshire Appellate Defender Program, for appellant.\n     Elizabeth C. Woodcock, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nJustice Bureau, with whom Michael A. Delaney, Attorney General, was\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 22, 2011\n\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.        On December 21, 2001, a jury\n\nconvicted Chad Evans of reckless second-degree murder, five counts\n\nof second-degree assault, endangering the welfare of a minor, and\n\nsimple assault--the murder charge for the death of his girlfriend's\n\n21-month-old daughter Kassidy on November 9, 2000.           See State v.\n\nEvans, 839 A.2d 8, 10-12 (N.H. 2003).      The evidence, recounted in\n\nthe just cited decision affirming the conviction, describes the\n\nunderlying facts, which have some bearing on Evans' ultimate state\n\nsentence--the subject of the present federal case.\n\n          The state's evidence showed that Chad Evans had regularly\n\nbattered and eventually killed the young child.               The autopsy\n\nrevealed that Kassidy had died from multiple blunt-force injuries\n\nthat had caused bleeding in her brain and abdomen.            The medical\n\nexaminer said that in the hours before her death Kassidy had\n\nreceived eight to ten blows to the head and at least two blows to\n\nthe abdomen from something like a fist or foot.       Evans, 839 A.2d at\n\n12.   Evans lied about the death to the police, id., and at trial\n\nsought unsuccessfully to cast the blame on a babysitter.             Id. at\n\n15.\n\n          At sentencing, the trial court ordered a term of 28 years\n\nto life on the murder conviction, but imposed suspended sentences\n\non the remaining charges.   See In re Evans, 908 A.2d 796, 799 (N.H.\n\n2006).   New Hampshire, then as now, had a procedure by which a\n\nsentence could   be   modified   by   appeal   to   the   Sentence   Review\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fDivision of the Superior Court, but at the time of Evans' crime,\n\nsuch appeals could be filed only by the defendant. Three and a half\n\nmonths before Evans was sentenced, New Hampshire changed the law to\n\nallow the state as well to apply for review of sentences.       2001\n\nN.H. Laws 35; see also N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 651:58 (2007).\n\nWhichever side sought review, the review panel could raise or lower\n\nthe sentence or leave it alone.        N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 651:59\n\n(2007).\n\n           The state filed a petition for sentence review, and after\n\nfurther proceedings not germane to the present case, In re State,\n\n837 A.2d 291, 292 (N.H. 2003), the division imposed consecutive\n\nsentences of 5 to 10 years on one of the second degree assault\n\ncharges and 10 to 30 years on a second such charge.     In re Evans,\n\n908 A.2d at 799.   This increased Evans' minimum term from 28 to 43\n\nyears.    All of the charges on which the trial court had initially\n\nsuspended sentence entirely related to earlier abuse of Kassidy (or\n\nher mother) in the months prior to her death.\n\n           On Evans' new appeal, the New Hampshire Supreme Court\n\naffirmed the sentence increase, In re Evans, 908 A.2d at 798,\n\nrejecting inter alia Evans' claim of a violation of the Ex Post\n\nFacto clause of the U.S. Constitution.      U.S. Const. art. I, § 10,\n\ncl. 1.    Evans petitioned the federal district court for habeas\n\nrelief, 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (2006), raising solely the Ex Post Facto\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fclaim.1    The district court dismissed the claim on summary judgment\n\nbut granted a certificate of appealability on one question:\n\n                Whether the application of RSA § 651:58, I to\n                Evans was contrary to clearly established\n                federal constitutional law as set forth in\n                Garner v. Jones, 529 U.S. 244 (2000), because\n                Garner is not limited to retroactive changes\n                in rules governing parole.\n\n                The district court denied a certificate of appealability\n\nto    Evans'      second    question:     whether     the   decision    \"was   an\n\nunreasonable application of federal law, as set forth in Garner;\n\nDobbert v. Florida, 432 U.S. 282 (1977), and United States v.\n\nMallon, 345 F.3d 943 (7th Cir. 2003).\"              Ordinarily the distinction\n\nbetween     the     \"contrary     to\"    question     and   the   \"unreasonable\n\napplication\" question is easily made, but in this case Evans'\n\nargument falls pretty close to the dividing line and, in fairness\n\nto Evans, we treat both issues together.\n\n                 A decision is \"contrary to\" governing Supreme Court\n\nauthority \"if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the\n\ngoverning law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases,\" Williams v.\n\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405 (2000), or \"if the state court confronts\n\na    set   of    facts   that   are   materially    indistinguishable    from a\n\ndecision of [the Supreme Court]\" but reaches a different result.\n\n\n\n       1\n      Under the habeas statute, relief is available inter alia\nwhere a state court adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court . . .\n.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fId. at 406.     Evans has conceded that no Supreme Court case has\n\nmaterially indistinguishable facts. The \"unreasonable application\"\n\ntest applies where the facts are different but the state court\n\nmanifestly and unreasonably misapplies the relevant Supreme Court\n\ncase law.    Id. at 412.\n\n            The classic Supreme Court formulation in Calder v. Bull,\n\n3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386 (1798), described the four categories to which\n\nthe Ex Post Facto clause is directed:\n\n            1st.   Every law that makes an action done\n            before the passing of the law, and which was\n            innocent when done, criminal; and punishes\n            such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a\n            crime, or makes it greater than it was, when\n            committed.   3d.  Every law that changes the\n            punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment,\n            than the law annexed to the crime, when\n            committed.   4th.  Every law that alters the\n            legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or\n            different, testimony, than the law required at\n            the time of the commission of the offence, in\n            order to convict the offender.\n\nId. at 390 (emphasis omitted).        Literally, this formulation would\n\nnot apply to Evans.        Although Evans argues that the statutory\n\nchange in question subjects a defendant to \"greater punishment,\"\n\nthe statutory punishment laid down by \"the law annexed to the\n\ncrime\" he committed has not been altered.\n\n            However, the Supreme Court has extended the Ex Post Facto\n\nclause beyond the core protections in Calder v. Bull although with\n\ncaution.    Under   the    third   category,    relating    to   increased\n\npunishment,   the   Supreme   Court   focused   primarily   on   substance\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fchanges that may not strictly increase the stated maximum or\n\nminimum sentence for a crime but come pretty close: the Court\n\napplied the clause to increases in state sentencing guidelines that\n\nprescribe higher penalties, Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423 (1987),\n\nand to a statutory reduction in good-time credits that would\n\notherwise reduce the length of a sentence.             Weaver v. Graham, 450\n\nU.S. 24 (1981).\n\n          The statutory change here is a change not in the length\n\nof sentences or guidelines but in procedures related to sentencing,\n\nspecifically,    the   alteration       in   the   structure   for    review   of\n\nsentences.      Still, the Supreme Court has said that, in some\n\ncircumstances and on some conditions, the Ex Post Facto clause\n\ncould apply to statutes adopting procedural changes.                 See Carmell\n\nv. Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 539 (2000).                Both of the leading cases\n\ninvolved changes that altered or permitted alteration of the dates\n\nfor parole hearings.        Morales v. Cal. Dep't of Corr., 514 U.S. 499\n\n(1995);      Garner    v.      Jones,        529    U.S.   244       (2000).\n\n          In neither case did the Court find such a violation,\n\nrejecting the Ex Post Facto claim in Morales and vacating the lower\n\ncourt's finding of such a violation in Garner and remanding for\n\nfurther analysis.      In each case the Court said that the question\n\nwas whether the procedural change imposed a \"sufficient risk of\n\nincreasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered\n\ncrimes,\" Morales, 514 U.S. at 509, or a \"significant risk of\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fprolonging respondent's incarceration,\" Garner, 529 U.S. at 251.\n\nThis is the language on which Evans bases his appeal, but just how\n\nthe test is to be applied requires some attention to the facts of\n\nthe two Supreme Court cases.\n\n            In Morales, at the time of the crime a prisoner was\n\nentitled to be considered for parole after a fixed period; and if\n\nparole was denied, the board had to revisit the matter each year.\n\n514 U.S. at 502-03.         After Morales' crime, a statutory change\n\nallowed   the   board     after    an   initial   denial   to   defer    further\n\nsuitability hearings for up to three years in certain cases and\n\nMorales' was among them.          Id. at 503-04.    The Ninth Circuit found\n\nan Ex Post Facto violation and the Supreme Court reversed, finding\n\nthat the adverse effect of the change was speculative.              Id. at 508-\n\n09.\n\n            Then, in Garner, the Supreme Court remanded another such\n\ncase involving a regulatory change in the frequency of parole\n\nreconsideration of life-sentenced defendants from three years to\n\neight.    529 U.S. at 247.        The Eleventh Circuit had held this an Ex\n\nPost Facto violation, distinguishing Morales as involving a more\n\nspeculative     impact,    but    the   Supreme   Court    found   the   showing\n\ninsufficient and remanded to consider its actual impact under the\n\n\"significant risk\" test.          Id. at 255.\n\n            On Evans' appeal from his increased sentence, the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court noted Morales' \"sufficient risk\" test.                In\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fre Evans, 908 A.2d at 802.        The state court pointed out that unlike\n\ndeferral of parole hearings which lengthens incarceration, the New\n\nHampshire statute merely alters who gets finally to decide what\n\ninitial sentence is reasonable, id. at 804, and it cited federal\n\ncase       law   upholding   post-crime   changes    in   the   federal   review\n\nstructure for initial sentences.2           Such a procedural change, it\n\nconcluded, did not violate the Constitution.              Id.\n\n                 Thus, the state court apparently thought that it was\n\nrespecting the Morales test while also finding that the test did\n\nnot require a result in Evans' favor.               Right or wrong, this is\n\nhardly a case where \"the state court applie[d] a rule\" different\n\nthan \"the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases,\"\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 405 (O'Connor, J.).             That rubric requires a\n\nfailure to recognize the Supreme Court's test or, one where (even\n\nif lip service is paid to the test), \"the state court confronts a\n\nset of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision\n\nof this Court\" but reaches a different result.              Id. at 406.3\n\n\n       2\n      The federal circuit court opinions rejected Ex Post Facto\nclaims when Congress amended 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e) to allow de novo\nreview of the district court's application of sentencing\nguidelines, see, e.g., United States v. Andrews, 447 F.3d 806, 809-\n10 (10th Cir. 2006); United States v. Riley, 376 F.3d 1160, 1165\n(D.C. Cir 2004); United States v. Mallon, 345 F.3d 943, 946-47 (7th\nCir. 2003).\n       3\n      Justice O'Connor emphasized at length that the \"direct\nconflict\" prong depends on whether the state court properly\nexpressed the Supreme Court's rule and not on whether a federal\nhabeas court would have reached the same outcome under that rule.\n529 U.S. at 406. The importance of the gloss is underscored by the\n\n                                      -8-\n\f          Whether      the   state   court   \"unreasonably    applied\"     the\n\nMorales/Garner significant risk test might well appear to be a more\n\nrelevant and perhaps closer question in this case.           In principle a\n\nstate court might echo the Supreme Court's language as to the rule\n\nof law but, in fitting the rubric to different facts, reach a\n\nresult   that   was    objectively     unreasonable.   Cf.    Woodford      v.\n\nVisciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24-27 (2002) (per curiam).                While the\n\n\"unreasonably    applied\"     test   provides   latitude,    it   cannot    be\n\nunlimited.\n\n          This takes us to the reasoning of the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court.        The federal circuit precedents it cited were\n\nadmittedly post-Morales decisions (see note 2, above) but they\n\nconcerned a shift in the final decision-making for both sides.\n\nHere, the New Hampshire statute gave the prosecution a second\n\nchance to seek the sentence it wanted.          While this equalized the\n\nposition of both sides, most defendants would doubtless prefer that\n\nthey alone had the right to appeal from an initial sentence--so the\n\nstatute does, in some sense, \"disadvantage\" defendants.             Weaver,\n\n450 U.S. at 29.\n\n          But many acts of the legislature occurring after a crime\n\nwas committed could increase both the chance of a conviction and\n\nthe risk of more punishment.         Merely to boost the budget of the\n\n\nfact that, on the scope of the habeas statute, the separate opinion\nof Justice O'Connor commanded five votes, supplanting on this issue\nJustice Stevens' opinion delivering the judgment. Id. at 402-13.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fprosecutor's office and supporting forensic resources means that\n\nthere is some chance that more defendants will be tried and on more\n\nserious charges and will in some cases likely receive longer\n\nsentences. \"Disadvantage\" is a minimum condition but, based on the\n\nauthorities      Evans      himself    invokes,   there    must   at   least    be   a\n\nsubstantial or significant risk.\n\n              Whether the New Hampshire change in this case constituted\n\na \"substantial risk\" of a higher sentence turns very much on the\n\ntime as of which that question is asked.              Any procedural change in\n\na law affecting criminal trials or sentences can after the fact\n\nprove    to    have   had    an   adverse   effect    on   the    defendant     in   a\n\nparticular case--as the New Hampshire law here clearly did on\n\nEvans. Morales himself had his opportunity to get parole deferred,\n\nMorales, 514 U.S. at 503, but the Supreme Court emphasized that\n\n(judged in advance) Morales and others like him faced a relatively\n\nlow risk of a substantial increase in their incarceration.                 Id. at\n\n510-12.\n\n              Absent this kind of ex ante analysis, any legislative\n\nchange    in    procedural        or    evidentiary    law    that     turned    out\n\nincidentally to work against a defendant would be condemned. Every\n\ntrial would have to use a set of procedural and evidence rules not\n\ndetermined by the date of the trial, as is ordinarily done, but by\n\nthe date of the crime committed by the particular defendant--who\n\nmight, of course, be on trial for multiple crimes committed at\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fdifferent times.   The \"significant risk\" test works to avoid this\n\noutcome by filtering out changes--like the parole deferral change\n\nin Morales--that do not pose the kind or degree of risk against\n\nwhich the Ex Post Facto clause was meant to guard.\n\n          The usual perspective from which Ex Post Facto analysis\n\nviews statutory changes is that of the time of the criminal act,\n\nWeaver, 450 U.S. at 28, 30, and the usual question is what an\n\nactor's reasonable expectations would be.     The latter may be a\n\nfanciful question since most defendants do not plan their crimes\n\nwith close attention to the criminal code and its penalties, United\n\nStates v. Demaree, 459 F.3d 791, 793 (7th Cir. 2006); but the\n\ninsistence on the protection has deeper roots in our conception of\n\n\"fair warning.\" Weaver, 450 U.S. at 28-30;   Miller v. Florida, 482\n\nU.S. at 430.   And yet not every change in procedure or evidence\n\noccurring after the crime offends the sense of fairness.\n\n          From the ex ante standpoint, the New Hampshire statutory\n\nchange could affect any defendant but in general would hardly pose\n\na significant risk.   Trial judges usually enjoy great latitude in\n\nexercising their discretion, see N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 651:1-70,\n\nand--where the sentence is within the trial court's discretion--\n\nreversals are ordinarily rare unless the trial judge has imposed a\n\npatently unreasonable sentence.   See State v. Kelly, 986 A.2d 575,\n\n576 (N.H. 2009) (\"We review a trial court's imposition of a\n\ndeferred sentence for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\").\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f            Evans, who bears the burden of proof in establishing a\n\nviolation of the Ex Post Facto clause, apparently presented no\n\nevidence below or in state court to suggest that the Sentence\n\nReview Division commonly raises or lowers sentences.              The New\n\nHampshire   Sentence   Review   Division   of   the   Superior   Court   is\n\ncomprised of three trial judges, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 651:57\n\n(2007), and it is a fair supposition that the review procedure was\n\nprimarily designed to provide a consistent check on patent outlier\n\nsentences by subjecting them to the scrutiny of other trial judges\n\nwho regularly deal with such cases.\n\n            In all events, Evans' own situation hardly suggests that\n\nthe sentences are routinely adjusted.       Evans was initially given\n\nonly suspended sentences for all of his brutal acts toward a\n\nhelpless infant of which at least a number were committed on\n\nearlier occasions prior to the murder, and the Sentence Review\n\nDivision simply unsuspended some of these suspended sentences.\n\nViewing the matter prior to the commission of the offense, the\n\nexpectation of one about to commit a crime would be a reasonable\n\nsentence--just what the New Hampshire amendment aims to achieve.\n\n            The state court in this case could have decided this case\n\ndifferently by saying (for example) that the statutory change does\n\npotentially \"disadvantage\" defendants and entails some \"risk\" of an\n\nincrease in sentence.     But circuit courts that reasoned in this\n\nmechanical fashion in Morales and Garner were reversed; and it is\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fclear enough from the outcome in both cases--especially Morales\n\nwhere the parole date was deferred--that more subtle weighing of\n\nrisk is required.\n\n          Anyway, to ask whether the state court, or we ourselves\n\non de novo review, could reach a different result is to ask the\n\nwrong question.

Woodcock, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Justice Bureau, with whom Michael A. Delaney, Attorney General, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>On December 21, 2001, a jury convicted Chad Evans of reckless second-degree murder, five counts of second-degree assault, endangering the welfare of a minor, and simple assaultthe murder charge for the death of his girlfriend's 21-month-old daughter Kassidy on November 9, 2000. <i>See </i><i>State v. Evans,</i> 150 N.H. 416, 839 A.2d 8, 10-12 (2003). The evidence, recounted in the just cited decision affirming the conviction, describes the underlying facts, which have some bearing on Evans' ultimate state sentencethe subject of the present federal case.</p>\n<p>The state's evidence showed that Chad Evans had regularly battered and eventually killed the young child. The autopsy revealed that Kassidy had died from multiple blunt-force injuries that had caused bleeding in her brain and abdomen. The medical examiner said that in the hours before her death Kassidy had received eight to ten blows to the head and at least two blows to the abdomen from something like a fist or foot. <i>Evans,</i> 839 A.2d at 12. Evans lied about the death to the police, <i>id.,</i> and at trial sought unsuccessfully to cast the blame on a babysitter. <i>Id.</i> at 15.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the trial court ordered a term of 28 years to life on the murder conviction, but imposed suspended sentences on the remaining charges. <i>See </i><i>In re Evans,</i> 154 N.H. 142, 908 A.2d 796, 799 (2006). New Hampshire, then as now, had a procedure by which a sentence could be modified by appeal to the Sentence Review Division of the Superior Court, but at the time of Evans' crime, such appeals could be filed only by the defendant. Three and a half months before Evans was sentenced, New Hampshire changed the law to allow the state as well to apply for review of sentences. 2001 N.H. Laws 35; <i>see also</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 651:58 (2007). Whichever side sought review, the review panel could raise or lower the sentence or leave it alone. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 651:59 (2007).</p>\n<p>The state filed a petition for sentence review, and after further proceedings not germane to the present case, <i>In re State,</i> 150 N.H. 296, 837 A.2d 291, 292 (2003), the division imposed <i>consecutive</i> sentences of 5 to 10 years on one of the second degree assault charges and 10 to 30 years on a second such charge. <i>In re Evans,</i> 908 A.2d at 799. This increased Evans' minimum term from 28 to 43 years. All of the charges on which the trial court had initially suspended sentence entirely related to earlier abuse of Kassidy (or her mother) in the months prior to her death.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> On Evans' new appeal, the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the sentence increase, <i>In re Evans,</i> 908 A.2d at 798, rejecting <i>inter alia</i> Evans' claim of a violation of the Ex Post Facto clause of the U.S. Constitution. U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1. Evans petitioned the federal district court for habeas relief, 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (2006), raising solely the Ex Post Facto claim.<sup>[1]</sup> The district court dismissed the claim on summary judgment but granted a certificate of appealability on one question:</p>\n<blockquote>Whether the application of RSA § 651:58, I to Evans was contrary to clearly established federal constitutional law as set forth in <i>Garner v. Jones,</i> 529 U.S. 244 [120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236] (2000), because <i>Garner</i> is not limited to retroactive changes in rules governing parole.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court denied a certificate of appealability to Evans' second question: whether the decision \"was an unreasonable application of federal law, as set forth in <i>Garner; </i><i>Dobbert v. Florida,</i> 432 U.S. 282, 97 S.Ct. 2290, 53 L.Ed.2d 344 (1977), and <i>United States v. Mallon,</i> 345 F.3d 943 (7th Cir.2003).\" Ordinarily the distinction between the \"contrary to\" question and the \"unreasonable application\" question is easily made, but in this case Evans' argument falls pretty close to the dividing line and, in fairness to Evans, we treat both issues together.</p>\n<p>A decision is \"contrary to\" governing Supreme Court authority \"if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases,\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), or \"if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme Court]\" but reaches a different result. <i>Id.</i> at 406, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Evans has conceded that no Supreme Court case has materially indistinguishable facts. The \"unreasonable application\" test applies where the facts are different but the state court manifestly and unreasonably misapplies the relevant Supreme Court case law. <i>Id.</i> at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>The classic Supreme Court formulation in <i>Calder v. Bull,</i> 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798), described the four categories to which the Ex Post Facto clause is directed:</p>\n<blockquote>1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 390 (emphasis omitted). Literally, this formulation would not apply to Evans. Although Evans argues that the statutory change in question subjects a defendant to \"greater punishment,\" the statutory punishment laid down by \"the law annexed to the crime\" he committed has not been altered.</p>\n<p>However, the Supreme Court has extended the Ex Post Facto clause beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> the core protections in <i>Calder v. Bull</i> although with caution. Under the third category, relating to increased punishment, the Supreme Court focused primarily on substance changes that may not strictly increase the stated maximum or minimum sentence for a crime but come pretty close: the Court applied the clause to increases in state sentencing guidelines that prescribe higher penalties, <i>Miller v. Florida,</i> 482 U.S. 423, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987), and to a statutory reduction in good-time credits that would otherwise reduce the length of a sentence. <i>Weaver v. Graham,</i> 450 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981).</p>\n<p>The statutory change here is a change not in the length of sentences or guidelines but in procedures related to sentencing, specifically, the alteration in the structure for review of sentences. Still, the Supreme Court has said that, in some circumstances and on some conditions, the Ex Post Facto clause could apply to statutes adopting procedural changes. <i>See </i><i>Carmell v. Texas,</i> 529 U.S. 513, 539, 120 S.Ct. 1620, 146 L.Ed.2d 577 (2000). Both of the leading cases involved changes that altered or permitted alteration of the dates for parole hearings. <i>Cal. Dep't of Corr. v. Morales,</i> 514 U.S. 499, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995); <i>Garner v. Jones,</i> 529 U.S. 244, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000). In neither case did the Court <i>find</i> such a violation, rejecting the Ex Post Facto claim in <i>Morales</i> and vacating the lower court's finding of such a violation in <i>Garner</i> and remanding for further analysis. In each case the Court said that the question was whether the procedural change imposed a \"sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes,\" <i>Morales,</i> 514 U.S. at 509, 115 S.Ct. 1597, or a \"significant risk of prolonging respondent's incarceration,\" <i>Garner,</i> 529 U.S. at 251, 120 S.Ct. 1362. This is the language on which Evans bases his appeal, but just how the test is to be applied requires some attention to the facts of the two Supreme Court cases.</p>\n<p>In <i>Morales,</i> at the time of the crime a prisoner was entitled to be considered for parole after a fixed period; and if parole was denied, the board had to revisit the matter each year. 514 U.S. at 502-03, 115 S.Ct. 1597. After Morales' crime, a statutory change allowed the board after an initial denial to defer further suitability hearings for up to three years in certain cases and Morales' was among them. <i>Id.</i> at 503-04, 115 S.Ct. 1597. The Ninth Circuit found an Ex Post Facto violation and the Supreme Court reversed, finding that the adverse effect of the change was speculative. <i>Id.</i> at 508-09, 115 S.Ct. 1597.</p>\n<p>Then, in <i>Garner,</i> the Supreme Court remanded another such case involving a regulatory change in the frequency of parole reconsideration of life-sentenced defendants from three years to eight. 529 U.S. at 247, 120 S.Ct. 1362. The Eleventh Circuit had held this an Ex Post Facto violation, distinguishing <i>Morales</i> as involving a more speculative impact, but the Supreme Court found the showing insufficient and remanded to consider its actual impact under the \"significant risk\" test. <i>Id.</i> at 255, 120 S.Ct. 1362.</p>\n<p>On Evans' appeal from his increased sentence, the New Hampshire Supreme Court noted <i>Morales</i>' \"sufficient risk\" test. <i>In re Evans,</i> 908 A.2d at 802. The state court pointed out that unlike deferral of parole hearings which lengthens incarceration, the New Hampshire statute merely alters who gets finally to decide what initial sentence is reasonable, <i>id.</i> at 804, and it cited federal case law upholding post-crime changes in the federal review structure for initial sentences.<sup>[2]</sup> Such a procedural <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> change, it concluded, did not violate the Constitution. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Thus, the state court apparently thought that it was respecting the <i>Morales</i> test while also finding that the test did not require a result in Evans' favor. Right or wrong, this is hardly a case where \"the state court applie[d] a rule\" different than \"the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases,\" <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (O'Connor, J.). That rubric requires a failure to recognize the Supreme Court's test or, one where (even if lip service is paid to the test), \"the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court\" but reaches a different result. <i>Id.</i> at 406, 120 S.Ct. 1495.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Whether the state court \"unreasonably applied\" the <i>Morales/Garner</i> significant risk test might well appear to be a more relevant and perhaps closer question in this case. In principle a state court might echo the Supreme Court's language as to the rule of law but, in fitting the rubric to different facts, reach a result that was objectively unreasonable. <i>Cf. </i><i>Woodford v. Visciotti,</i> 537 U.S. 19, 24-27, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (<i>per curiam</i>). While the \"unreasonably applied\" test provides latitude, it cannot be unlimited.</p>\n<p>This takes us to the reasoning of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The federal circuit precedents it cited were admittedly post-<i>Morales</i> decisions (see note 2, above) but they concerned a shift in the final decision-making for <i>both</i> sides. Here, the New Hampshire statute gave the prosecution a second chance to seek the sentence it wanted. While this equalized the position of both sides, most defendants would doubtless prefer that they alone had the right to appeal from an initial sentenceso the statute does, in some sense, \"disadvantage\" defendants. <i>Weaver,</i> 450 U.S. at 29, 101 S.Ct. 960.</p>\n<p>But many acts of the legislature occurring after a crime was committed could increase both the chance of a conviction and the risk of more punishment. Merely to boost the budget of the prosecutor's office and supporting forensic resources means that there is some chance that more defendants will be tried and on more serious charges and will in some cases likely receive longer sentences. \"Disadvantage\" is a minimum condition but, based on the authorities Evans himself invokes, there must at least be a substantial or significant risk.</p>\n<p>Whether the New Hampshire change in this case constituted a \"substantial risk\" of a higher sentence turns very much <i>on the time as of which that question is asked.</i> Any procedural change in a law affecting criminal trials or sentences can after the fact prove to have had an adverse effect on the defendant <i>in a particular case</i>as the New Hampshire law here clearly did on Evans. Morales himself had his opportunity to get parole deferred, <i>Morales,</i> 514 U.S. at 503, 115 S.Ct. 1597, but the Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> Court emphasized that (judged in advance) Morales and others like him faced a relatively low risk of a substantial increase in their incarceration. <i>Id.</i> at 510-12, 115 S.Ct. 1597.</p>\n<p>Absent this kind of <i>ex ante</i> analysis, <i>any</i> legislative change in procedural or evidentiary law that turned out incidentally to work against a defendant would be condemned. Every trial would have to use a set of procedural and evidence rules not determined by the date of the trial, as is ordinarily done, but by the date of the crime committed by the particular defendantwho might, of course, be on trial for multiple crimes committed at different times. The \"significant risk\" test works to avoid this outcome by filtering out changeslike the parole deferral change in <i>Morales</i>that do not pose the kind or degree of risk against which the Ex Post Facto clause was meant to guard.</p>\n<p>The usual perspective from which Ex Post Facto analysis views statutory changes is that of the time of the criminal act, <i>Weaver,</i> 450 U.S. at 28, 30, 101 S.Ct. 960, and the usual question is what an actor's reasonable expectations would be. The latter may be a fanciful question since most defendants do not plan their crimes with close attention to the criminal code and its penalties, <i>United States v. Demaree,</i> 459 F.3d 791, 793 (7th Cir.2006); but the insistence on the protection has deeper roots in our conception of \"fair warning.\" <i>Weaver,</i> 450 U.S. at 28-30, 101 S.Ct. 960; <i>Miller v. Florida,</i> 482 U.S. at 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446. And yet not every change in procedure or evidence occurring after the crime offends the sense of fairness.</p>\n<p>From the <i>ex ante</i> standpoint, the New Hampshire statutory change could affect any defendant but in general would hardly pose a significant risk. Trial judges usually enjoy great latitude in exercising their discretion, <i>see</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. §§ 651:1-70, andwhere the sentence is within the trial court's discretionreversals are ordinarily rare unless the trial judge has imposed a patently unreasonable sentence. <i>See </i><i>State v. Kelly,</i> 159 N.H. 390, 986 A.2d 575, 576 (2009) (\"We review a trial court's imposition of a deferred sentence for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\").</p>\n<p>Evans, who bears the burden of proof in establishing a violation of the Ex Post Facto clause, apparently presented no evidence below or in state court to suggest that the Sentence Review Division commonly raises or lowers sentences. The New Hampshire Sentence Review Division of the Superior Court is comprised of three trial judges, N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 651:57 (2007), and it is a fair supposition that the review procedure was primarily designed to provide a consistent check on patent outlier sentences by subjecting them to the scrutiny of other trial judges who regularly deal with such cases.</p>\n<p>In all events, Evans' own situation hardly suggests that the sentences are routinely adjusted. Evans was initially given only suspended sentences for <i>all</i> of his brutal acts toward a helpless infant of which at least a number were committed on earlier occasions prior to the murder, and the Sentence Review Division simply unsuspended some of these suspended sentences. Viewing the matter prior to the commission of the offense, the expectation of one about to commit a crime would be a <i>reasonable sentence</i>just what the New Hampshire amendment aims to achieve.</p>\n<p>The state court in this case could have decided this case differently by saying (for example) that the statutory change does potentially \"disadvantage\" defendants and entails some \"risk\" of an increase in sentence. But circuit courts that reasoned in this mechanical fashion in <i>Morales</i> and <i>Garner</i> were reversed; and it is clear <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> enough from the outcome in both cases especially <i>Morales</i> where the parole date was deferredthat more subtle weighing of risk is required.</p>\n<p>Anyway, to ask whether the state court, or we ourselves on de novo review, <i>could</i> reach a different result is to ask the wrong question. The current habeas statute was intended by Congress to narrow the occasions for collateral attacks, <i>see </i><i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 404, 120 S.Ct. 1495, and that decision makes clear that the question for us is not whether we would necessarily have reached the same result but whether the state court misstated the law or reached an unreasonable result in its application. As we said in <i>Brown v. Ruane,</i> 630 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir.2011), quoting in part <i>Wright v. Van Patten,</i> 552 U.S. 120, 128, 128 S.Ct. 743, 169 L.Ed.2d 583 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote>If Supreme Court cases `give no clear answer to the question presented,' a state court's resolution of a constitutional question may not serve as a basis for habeas relief.</blockquote>\n<p>Here, no one can be sure what the Supreme Court would do in a case involving Ex Post Facto doctrine in this new and different context. Modern Ex Post Facto doctrine, extending protection beyond enlargement of crimes or of statutory ranges for punishment, is more the product of judicial precedent than of express constitutional language or history. But in Evans' case, the habeas standards for overturning the state court have not been met.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Under the habeas statute, relief is available <i>inter alia</i> where a state court adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court....\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>[2]  The federal circuit court opinions rejected Ex Post Facto claims when Congress amended 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e) to allow de novo review of the district court's application of sentencing guidelines, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Andrews,</i> 447 F.3d 806, 809-10 (10th Cir. 2006); <i>United States v. Riley,</i> 376 F.3d 1160, 1165 (D.C.Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Mallon,</i> 345 F.3d 943, 946-47 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>[3]  Justice O'Connor emphasized at length that the \"direct conflict\" prong depends on whether the state court properly expressed the Supreme Court's rule and not on whether a federal habeas court would have reached the same outcome under that rule. 529 U.S. at 406, 120 S.Ct. 1495. The importance of the gloss is underscored by the fact that, on the scope of the habeas statute, the separate opinion of Justice O'Connor commanded five votes, supplanting on this issue Justice Stevens' opinion delivering the judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 402-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n\n</div>",

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></span> (1798), described the four categories to which the Ex Post Facto clause is directed:</p>\n<blockquote>1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 390 (emphasis omitted). Literally, this formulation would not apply to Evans. Although Evans argues that the statutory change in question subjects a defendant to \"greater punishment,\" the statutory punishment laid down by \"the law annexed to the crime\" he committed has not been altered.</p>\n<p>However, the Supreme Court has extended the Ex Post Facto clause beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> the core protections in <i>Calder v. Bull</i> although with caution. Under the third category, relating to increased punishment, the Supreme Court focused primarily on substance changes that may not strictly increase the stated maximum or minimum sentence for a crime but come pretty close: the Court applied the clause to increases in state sentencing guidelines that prescribe higher penalties, <i>Miller v.

Still, the Supreme Court has said that, in some circumstances and on some conditions, the Ex Post Facto clause could apply to statutes adopting procedural changes. <i>See </i><i>Carmell v.

In neither case did the Court <i>find</i> such a violation, rejecting the Ex Post Facto claim in <i>Morales</i> and vacating the lower court's finding of such a violation in <i>Garner</i> and remanding for further analysis.

The Eleventh Circuit had held this an Ex Post Facto violation, distinguishing <i>Morales</i> as involving a more speculative impact, but the Supreme Court found the showing insufficient and remanded to consider its actual impact under the \"significant risk\" test. <i>Id.</i> at 255, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118351\"><a href=\"/opinion/118351/garner-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1362</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>On Evans' appeal from his increased sentence, the New Hampshire Supreme Court noted <i>Morales</i>' \"sufficient risk\" test. <i>In re Evans,</i> 908 A.2d at 802. The state court pointed out that unlike deferral of parole hearings which lengthens incarceration, the New Hampshire statute merely alters who gets finally to decide what initial sentence is reasonable, <i>id.</i> at 804, and it cited federal case law upholding post-crime changes in the federal review structure for initial sentences.<sup>[2]</sup> Such a procedural <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> change, it concluded, did not violate the Constitution. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Thus, the state court apparently thought that it was respecting the <i>Morales</i> test while also finding that the test did not require a result in Evans' favor. Right or wrong, this is hardly a case where \"the state court applie[d] a rule\" different than \"the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases,\" <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 405, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span> (O'Connor, J.). That rubric requires a failure to recognize the Supreme Court's test or, one where (even if lip service is paid to the test), \"the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court\" but reaches a different result. <i>Id.</i> at 406, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In principle a state court might echo the Supreme Court's language as to the rule of law but, in fitting the rubric to different facts, reach a result that was objectively unreasonable. <i>Cf. </i><i>Woodford v. Visciotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122243\"><a href=\"/opinion/122243/woodford-v-visciotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 24-27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122243\"><a href=\"/opinion/122243/woodford-v-visciotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span> (2002) (<i>per curiam</i>). While the \"unreasonably applied\" test provides latitude, it cannot be unlimited.</p>\n<p>This takes us to the reasoning of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The federal circuit precedents it cited were admittedly post-<i>Morales</i> decisions (see note 2, above) but they concerned a shift in the final decision-making for <i>both</i> sides. Here, the New Hampshire statute gave the prosecution a second chance to seek the sentence it wanted. While this equalized the position of both sides, most defendants would doubtless prefer that they alone had the right to appeal from an initial sentenceso the statute does, in some sense, \"disadvantage\" defendants. <i>Weaver,</i> 450 U.S. at 29, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110413\"><a href=\"/opinion/110413/weaver-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>But many acts of the legislature occurring after a crime was committed could increase both the chance of a conviction and the risk of more punishment. Merely to boost the budget of the prosecutor's office and supporting forensic resources means that there is some chance that more defendants will be tried and on more serious charges and will in some cases likely receive longer sentences. \"Disadvantage\" is a minimum condition but, based on the authorities Evans himself invokes, there must at least be a substantial or significant risk.</p>\n<p>Whether the New Hampshire change in this case constituted a \"substantial risk\" of a higher sentence turns very much <i>on the time as of which that question is asked.</i> Any procedural change in a law affecting criminal trials or sentences can after the fact prove to have had an adverse effect on the defendant <i>in a particular case</i>as the New Hampshire law here clearly did on Evans. Morales himself had his opportunity to get parole deferred, <i>Morales,</i> 514 U.S. at 503, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117925\"><a href=\"/opinion/117925/california-dept-of-corrections-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1597</span></a></span>, but the Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> Court emphasized that (judged in advance) Morales and others like him faced a relatively low risk of a substantial increase in their incarceration. <i>Id.</i> at 510-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117925\"><a href=\"/opinion/117925/california-dept-of-corrections-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1597</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Absent this kind of <i>ex ante</i> analysis, <i>any</i> legislative change in procedural or evidentiary law that turned out incidentally to work against a defendant would be condemned. Every trial would have to use a set of procedural and evidence rules not determined by the date of the trial, as is ordinarily done, but by the date of the crime committed by the particular defendantwho might, of course, be on trial for multiple crimes committed at different times. The \"significant risk\" test works to avoid this outcome by filtering out changeslike the parole deferral change in <i>Morales</i>that do not pose the kind or degree of risk against which the Ex Post Facto clause was meant to guard.</p>\n<p>The usual perspective from which Ex Post Facto analysis views statutory changes is that of the time of the criminal act, <i>Weaver,</i> 450 U.S. at 28, 30, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110413\"><a href=\"/opinion/110413/weaver-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>, and the usual question is what an actor's reasonable expectations would be. The latter may be a fanciful question since most defendants do not plan their crimes with close attention to the criminal code and its penalties, <i>United States v. Demaree,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795377\"><a href=\"/opinion/795377/united-states-v-rebecca-s-demaree/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 793 (7th Cir.2006); but the insistence on the protection has deeper roots in our conception of \"fair warning.\" <i>Weaver,</i> 450 U.S. at 28-30, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110413\"><a href=\"/opinion/110413/weaver-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>; <i>Miller v. Florida,</i> 482 U.S. at 430, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111917\"><a href=\"/opinion/111917/miller-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2446</span></a></span>. And yet not every change in procedure or evidence occurring after the crime offends the sense of fairness.</p>\n<p>From the <i>ex ante</i> standpoint, the New Hampshire statutory change could affect any defendant but in general would hardly pose a significant risk. Trial judges usually enjoy great latitude in exercising their discretion, <i>see</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. §§ 651:1-70, andwhere the sentence is within the trial court's discretionreversals are ordinarily rare unless the trial judge has imposed a patently unreasonable sentence. <i>See </i><i>State v. Kelly,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1888222\"><a href=\"/opinion/1888222/state-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 576 (2009) (\"We review a trial court's imposition of a deferred sentence for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\").</p>\n<p>Evans, who bears the burden of proof in establishing a violation of the Ex Post Facto clause, apparently presented no evidence below or in state court to suggest that the Sentence Review Division commonly raises or lowers sentences. The New Hampshire Sentence Review Division of the Superior Court is comprised of three trial judges, N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 651:57 (2007), and it is a fair supposition that the review procedure was primarily designed to provide a consistent check on patent outlier sentences by subjecting them to the scrutiny of other trial judges who regularly deal with such cases.</p>\n<p>In all events, Evans' own situation hardly suggests that the sentences are routinely adjusted. Evans was initially given only suspended sentences for <i>all</i> of his brutal acts toward a helpless infant of which at least a number were committed on earlier occasions prior to the murder, and the Sentence Review Division simply unsuspended some of these suspended sentences. Viewing the matter prior to the commission of the offense, the expectation of one about to commit a crime would be a <i>reasonable sentence</i>just what the New Hampshire amendment aims to achieve.</p>\n<p>The state court in this case could have decided this case differently by saying (for example) that the statutory change does potentially \"disadvantage\" defendants and entails some \"risk\" of an increase in sentence. But circuit courts that reasoned in this mechanical fashion in <i>Morales</i> and <i>Garner</i> were reversed; and it is clear <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> enough from the outcome in both cases especially <i>Morales</i> where the parole date was deferredthat more subtle weighing of risk is required.</p>\n<p>Anyway, to ask whether the state court, or we ourselves on de novo review, <i>could</i> reach a different result is to ask the wrong question. The current habeas statute was intended by Congress to narrow the occasions for collateral attacks, <i>see </i><i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 404, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span>, and that decision makes clear that the question for us is not whether we would necessarily have reached the same result but whether the state court misstated the law or reached an unreasonable result in its application. As we said in <i>Brown v. Ruane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182274\"><a href=\"/opinion/182274/brown-v-ruane/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.2011), quoting in part <i>Wright v.
