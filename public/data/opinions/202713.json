Mintz on brief for petitioner.\n     Peter D. Kessler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nMark Walters, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nand Dalin R. Holyoak, Trial Attorney, United States Department of\nJustice, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          April 19, 2007\n\f            SELYA,   Senior   Circuit    Judge.   The    petitioner   seeks\n\njudicial review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) denying his motion to reopen a removal proceeding.                He\n\nasserts that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to consider\n\nchanged circumstances in his homeland and, instead, ruling that his\n\nmotion was numerically and temporally barred.           Discerning neither\n\nan abuse of discretion nor an error of any kind, we deny the\n\npetition.\n\n            The basic facts are relatively straightforward.            The\n\npetitioner, Mudaser Raza,1 is a twenty-seven-year-old Pakistani\n\nnational who unlawfully entered the United States in the fall of\n\n2000. On December 6, 2000, the authorities arrested the petitioner\n\nand initiated a removal proceeding.\n\n            In an appearance before an immigration judge (IJ) on\n\nNovember 29, 2001, the petitioner conceded removability and applied\n\nfor an adjustment of status based on an ostensible marriage to an\n\nAmerican citizen.      On July 2, 2002, the IJ pretermitted this\n\napplication, finding that the petitioner had lied, had submitted\n\nfalse documents, and in any event, had failed to satisfy the\n\nrequirements of the applicable adjustment of status statute.           See\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).     Accordingly, the IJ ordered removal.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The record reflects various spellings of the petitioner's\nfirst name. For simplicity's sake, we use the spelling employed in\nthe petitioner's brief.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            The petitioner did not perfect an appeal of this removal\n\norder to the BIA.        That lapse did not signal the end of the matter,\n\nhowever;    a    month    after    the    appeal     period    had   expired,     the\n\npetitioner asked the BIA to remand his case to the IJ.                      The BIA\n\ndenied the motion to remand on December 23, 2003.\n\n            On March 22, 2004, the petitioner lodged another motion\n\nwith the BIA.      This motion, denominated as a motion to reopen the\n\nremoval proceeding, hinged on a claim that he had remarried.                      The\n\nBIA   denied     the   motion     on   May   10,    2004,   concluding     that   the\n\npetitioner was not eligible for adjustment of status as he was not\n\nlegally admitted into the United States and that, in any event, he\n\nhad failed to make a showing sufficient to warrant reopening.                     See\n\nid. § 1255(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2.                  The petitioner accepted this\n\nrebuff without seeking judicial review.\n\n            On October 17, 2005, the petitioner filed yet another\n\nmotion to reopen.          In this filing, he alleged that, after his\n\narrival in the United States, he had apostatized his former Sunni\n\nIslam faith and become an adherent of the Shia Islam faith.                        He\n\noffered no dates or details in support of these bare assertions,\n\nnor   did   he    furnish    any       evidence     corroborating    his    claimed\n\nconversion.      He further averred — again, without corroboration —\n\nthat his Sunni Muslim family members in Pakistan had not only\n\ndisowned him but also had threatened him with harm.                  He said that\n\nhe feared what they might do upon his return.                 Finally, he claimed\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fthat sectarian violence against Shiite Muslims had escalated in\n\nPakistan, and that this change in country conditions substantiated\n\nhis fear of persecution incident to forced repatriation.                     To\n\nsupport that claim, the petitioner proffered a series of internet\n\narticles describing contemporaneous country conditions in Pakistan.\n\n           On March 27, 2006, the BIA denied the petitioner's motion\n\nto reopen.     It noted that the motion was successive as well as\n\nuntimely and, thus, subject to dismissal on numerical and temporal\n\ngrounds.   Weighing the propriety of a possible exception to these\n\nprocedural bars, the BIA determined that the motion (i) rested\n\n\"upon mere speculation about what may happen to [the petitioner]\n\nupon his return\" and (ii) failed to make out a prima facie case of\n\neligibility    for     either   asylum      or   withholding       of   removal.\n\nAccordingly, the BIA concluded that the motion did not fall within\n\nthe scope of any recognized exception to the numerical and temporal\n\nlimitations and, so, denied the petitioner's motion.                This timely\n\npetition for judicial review followed.\n\n           We preface our inquiry into the correctness of the BIA's\n\nruling with a précis of the applicable legal standards. Motions to\n\nreopen removal proceedings are disfavored as contrary to \"the\n\ncompelling    public    interests    in     finality   and   the    expeditious\n\nprocessing of proceedings.\"         Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Falae v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 11, 14-15 (1st\n\nCir. 2005)).   As a result, the BIA enjoys considerable latitude in\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdeciding whether to grant or deny such a motion.        See INS v.\n\nDoherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992).        Judicial review of such\n\ndecisions is solely for abuse of discretion. See Roberts, 422 F.3d\n\nat 35; Falae, 411 F.3d at 14.    This means, in effect, that such a\n\ndecision will stand unless the complaining party can show that the\n\nBIA committed an error of law or exercised its judgment in an\n\narbitrary, capricious, or irrational way.   See Maryam v. Gonzales,\n\n421 F.3d 60, 62 (1st Cir. 2005); Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 27\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          A maze of regulations affects the conduct of removal\n\nproceedings. Under this regulatory scheme, an alien ordinarily may\n\nfile only a single motion to reopen a removal proceeding — and that\n\nmotion must be submitted within ninety days of the rendition of the\n\nfinal administrative decision.   See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).   This\n\nmeans that motions to reopen are limited both numerically (one to\n\na customer) and temporally (a ninety-day window).\n\n          The petitioner concedes that the motion sub judice fails\n\nto meet these requirements.   Numerically, this is his second such\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fmotion;2 temporally, the motion was filed more than ninety days\n\nafter the final administrative decision ordering his removal.\n\n            These   numerical     and    temporal    limitations      are    not\n\nabsolute.   Of particular pertinence here, a showing of exceptional\n\ncircumstances may operate to relax them.            See id. § 1003.2(c)(3);\n\nsee also Roberts, 422 F.3d at 36.          Under this rubric, the agency\n\nmay waive numerical and temporal bars to reopening if an alien\n\nmakes a convincing demonstration of changed conditions in his\n\nhomeland.      Those   changes,   however,    must    be   material    to     the\n\nunderlying substantive relief that the alien is seeking (here,\n\nasylum or withholding of removal) and the evidence tendered in\n\nsupport   thereof   must   have   been    unavailable      during   the     prior\n\nproceedings.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).            Moreover, such a\n\nshowing requires more than a conclusory claim that the sky is\n\nfalling: the evidence proffered in support of the motion must, at\n\na bare minimum, establish a prima facie case sufficient to ground\n\na claim of eligibility for the underlying substantive relief.                See\n\nINS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988); Maryam, 421 F.3d at 62.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Actually, this may well be the petitioner's third motion to\nreopen.    The government contends, with some force, that the\npetitioner's initial motion to remand, regardless of its label, in\nfact constituted a motion to reopen.     In that case, the motion\nunder review here would be the petitioner's third motion to reopen.\nBecause it makes no difference to the outcome of this proceeding\nwhether the current motion is the petitioner's second or third\nmotion to reopen, we do not pursue this line of inquiry.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           Against this backdrop, we return to the case at hand.\n\nThe petitioner asseverates that the BIA failed to appreciate the\n\nsignificance of, or even address, the proffered evidence of changed\n\ncountry conditions.         Building on this foundation, he argues that\n\nthis failure, which cemented into place the BIA's decision to deny\n\nhis   motion   to    reopen    as    numerically       and    temporally     barred,\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion.              The record, however, belies\n\nthe foundational premise on which this argument rests: it shows\n\nbeyond any peradventure of doubt that the BIA took cognizance of\n\nthe   petitioner's        proffer    and    adequately       explained     why     the\n\nconclusion that the petitioner urged should not carry the day.\n\n           The BIA's memorandum of decision tells the tale. In that\n\nrescript, the BIA explicitly acknowledged the petitioner's claim\n\nthat his case fit within the \"changed circumstances\" exception to\n\nthe   numerical     and   temporal    limitations.           It   then   limned    the\n\nrelevant legal standard, considered the petitioner's allegations\n\n(including those pertaining to conversion and evolving country\n\nconditions),      and     found     those     thinly    supported        allegations\n\ninsufficient to bring the exception into play. In the process, the\n\nBIA observed that the \"country conditions information\" did not\n\nspecifically refer to the petitioner and that in several critical\n\naspects the motion was \"based upon mere speculation about what may\n\nhappen to the [petitioner] upon his return\" to Pakistan.                         Thus,\n\nnotwithstanding the contents of his proffer, the petitioner had\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\ffailed to meet the requirements for an exception to the numerical\n\nand temporal limitations.\n\n            We discern no flaw in the BIA's analysis.                An agency is\n\nnot required to dissect in minute detail every contention that a\n\ncomplaining party advances.             It is enough if the agency fairly\n\nconsiders the points raised by the complainant and articulates its\n\ndecision in terms adequate to allow a reviewing court to conclude\n\nthat the agency has thought about the evidence and the issues and\n\nreached a reasoned conclusion.           See Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.-\n\nBest Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 285-286 (1974); see also\n\nMansour v. INS, 230 F.3d 902, 908 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that\n\nthe decision must be sufficient to show that the BIA did not\n\n\"merely react[]\").      The BIA's decision in this case satisfies that\n\nstandard.\n\n            Alternatively, the petitioner argues that, even if the\n\nBIA   did   not    ignore   his    proffer,   it     nonetheless      abused     its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion to reopen. Even without regard to\n\nnumerical   and    temporal    limitations,     an    alien    making     such   an\n\nargument    must    overcome      the    obstacle    imposed    by    a   \"highly\n\ndeferential\" standard of review.          Roberts, 422 F.3d at 35.        In this\n\ninstance, the petitioner cannot surmount that obstacle.                     As we\n\nexplain below, the BIA's determination that he failed to make out\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fa prima facie case of eligibility for appropriate substantive\n\nrelief seems unimpugnable.3\n\n                  We start with the petitioner's claim that he had made out\n\na case of eligibility for asylum. To qualify for asylum, an\n\napplicant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of one of five enumerated grounds, namely, \"race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2)(A). Neither the statute nor the\n\nregulations defines \"persecution\" for purposes of asylum, and this\n\ncourt       has    opted   to   decide   the    question    of   what   constitutes\n\npersecution case by case. See, e.g., Orelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d\n\n67, 71 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                  There are, however, some guiding principles.                 One of\n\nthese       guidelines     is    that    persecution       \"always   implies     some\n\nconnection         to   governmental     action   or   inaction,     related    to   a\n\nprotected ground . . . .\"          Id. at 72.     When an asylum claim focuses\n\non non-governmental conduct, its fate depends on some showing\n\neither that the alleged persecutors are aligned with the government\n\nor that the government is unwilling or unable to control them.                    See\n\nid.\n\n\n\n\n        3\n      We note in passing that, under the applicable regulations,\nthe BIA would have had some leeway to deny the motion to reopen\neven if the petitioner had made out a prima facie case of\neligibility for substantive relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).\n\n                                          -9-\n\f           In the case at hand, the petitioner experienced no\n\npersecution while in Pakistan.              His professed fear of future\n\npersecution arises out of the possibility of victimization as a\n\nresult of his religious conversion.           The motion papers, however,\n\nfail to intimate the slightest connection between the forecasted\n\npersecution and any governmental action or inaction.              Indeed, the\n\npetitioner's principal claim is that he fears the wrath of his\n\nimmediate family because of his apostasy.          There is nothing of any\n\nsubstance to connect those possible depredations to the government.\n\nBy the same token, there is nothing that might suffice to ground a\n\nfinding — let alone to compel a finding — that the government is\n\nunable   or   unwilling    to    combat     violence   based    on   religious\n\npreference.\n\n           Nor do the internet articles regarding sporadic Sunni-\n\nShiite violence establish a prima facie case of asylum eligibility.\n\nEven assuming that one accepts the petitioner's claim of conversion\n\n— and that claim is wholly uncorroborated — the fourteen articles\n\nthat he has submitted refer generally to militant activity and\n\nepisodic violence within Pakistan. This violence is not widespread\n\nbut, rather, largely confined to the city of Karachi and Punjab\n\nprovince. Tellingly, the articles, taken as a group, make it\n\npellucid   that   most    of    Pakistan's    Sunnis   and     Shiites   reside\n\npeacefully together.      By definition, persecution has a systematic\n\naspect; it requires more than a showing that scattered incidents of\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fviolence or harassment are in prospect.                See Palma-Mazariegos v.\n\nGonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 2005).               To cinch matters, the\n\nreligiously     inspired   unpleasantness       described      in   the    fourteen\n\ninternet articles is, like the feared wrath of the petitioner's\n\nfamily members, unconnected to the Pakistani government.\n\n           To say more would be supererogatory.                On this exiguous\n\nshowing, it cannot plausibly be said that the BIA abused its\n\ndiscretion when it concluded that the petitioner, in failing to\n\ndemonstrate a reasonable possibility of persecution should he be\n\nreturned to Pakistan, fell short of establishing a prima facie case\n\nof eligibility for asylum.\n\n           The other strain of substantive relief sought by the\n\npetitioner is withholding of removal.            A claim for withholding of\n\nremoval \"carries with it a more stringent burden of proof than does\n\na counterpart effort to obtain asylum.\"                Orelien, 467 F.3d at 73\n\n(citing   Ang   v.   Gonzales,    421    F.3d    50,    58   (1st   Cir.    2005)).\n\nPresumably for this reason, the petitioner makes no assertion that,\n\nif he failed to make out a prima facie case of eligibility for\n\nasylum, he somehow can be found to have made out a prima facie case\n\nof eligibility for withholding of removal.\n\n           We need go no further.              The short of it is that the\n\npetitioner's     motion    to   reopen   was    numerically     and   temporally\n\nbarred.   The BIA sufficiently addressed, and supportably rejected,\n\nthe petitioner's argument that he qualified for an exception to\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthese numerical and temporal limitations.           Consequently, adhering\n\nto   those   bars   did   not,   in   the    circumstances   of   this   case,\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\nThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f",

He said that he feared what they might do upon his return.

As a result, the BIA enjoys considerable latitude in deciding whether to grant or deny such a motion. <i>See INS v. Doherty,</i> 502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Judicial review of such decisions is solely for abuse of discretion. <i>See Roberts,</i> 422 F.3d at 35; <i>Falae,</i> 411 F.3d at 14. This means, in effect, that such a decision will stand unless the complaining party can show that the BIA committed an error of law or exercised its judgment in an arbitrary, capricious, or irrational way. <i>See Maryam v. Gonzales,</i> 421 F.3d 60, 62 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Wang v.

Under this rubric, the agency may waive numerical and temporal bars to reopening if an alien makes a convincing demonstration of changed conditions in his homeland. Those changes, however, must be material to the underlying substantive relief that the alien is seeking (here, asylum or withholding of removal) and the evidence tendered in support thereof must have been unavailable during the prior proceedings. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Moreover, such a showing requires more than a conclusory claim that the sky is falling: the evidence proffered in support of the motion must, at a bare minimum, establish a prima facie case sufficient to ground a claim of eligibility for the underlying substantive relief. <i>See INS v. Abudu,</i> 485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988); <i>Maryam,</i> 421 F.3d at 62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we return to the case at hand. The petitioner asseverates that the BIA failed to appreciate the significance of, or even address, the proffered evidence of changed country conditions. Building on this foundation, he argues that this failure, which cemented into place the BIA's decision to deny his motion to reopen as numerically and temporally barred, constituted an abuse of discretion. The record, however, belies the foundational premise on which this argument rests: it shows beyond any peradventure of doubt that the BIA took cognizance of the petitioner's proffer and adequately explained why the conclusion that the petitioner urged should not carry the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's memorandum of decision tells the tale. In that rescript, the BIA explicitly acknowledged the petitioner's claim that his case fit within the \"changed circumstances\" exception to the numerical and temporal limitations. It then limned the relevant legal standard, considered the petitioner's allegations (including those pertaining to conversion and evolving country conditions), and found those thinly supported allegations insufficient to bring the exception into play. In the process, the BIA observed that the \"country conditions information\" did not specifically refer to the petitioner and that in several critical aspects the motion was \"based upon mere speculation about what may happen to the [petitioner] upon his return\" to Pakistan. Thus, notwithstanding the contents of his proffer, the petitioner had failed to meet the requirements for an exception to the numerical and temporal limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no flaw in the BIA's analysis. An agency is not required to dissect in minute detail every contention that a complaining party advances. It is enough if the agency fairly considers the points raised by the complainant and articulates its decision in terms adequate to allow a reviewing court to conclude that the agency has thought about the evidence and the issues and reached a reasoned conclusion. <i>See Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc.,</i> 419 U.S. 281, 285-286, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974); <i>see also Mansour v. INS,</i> 230 F.3d 902, 908 (7th Cir.2000) (explaining that the decision must be sufficient to show that the BIA did not \"merely react[ ]\"). The BIA's decision in this case satisfies that standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the petitioner argues that, even if the BIA did not ignore his proffer, it nonetheless abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. Even without regard to numerical and temporal limitations, an alien making such an argument must overcome the obstacle imposed by a \"highly deferential\" standard of review. <i>Roberts,</i> 422 F.3d at 35. In this instance, the petitioner cannot surmount that obstacle. As we explain below, the BIA's determination that he failed to make out a prima facie case of eligibility for appropriate substantive relief seems unimpugnable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the petitioner's claim that he had made out a case of eligibility for asylum. To qualify for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of five enumerated grounds, namely, \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(2)(i)(A). Neither the statute nor the regulations defines \"persecution\" for purposes of asylum, and this court has opted to decide the question of what constitutes persecution case by case. <i>See, e.g., Orelien v. Gonzales,</i> 467 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, however, some guiding principles. One of these guidelines is that persecution \"always implies some connection to governmental action or inaction, related to a protected ground . . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 72. When an asylum claim focuses on non-governmental conduct, its fate depends on some showing either that the alleged persecutors are aligned with the government or that the government is unwilling or unable to control them. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the petitioner experienced no persecution while in Pakistan. His professed fear of future persecution arises out of the possibility of victimization as a result of his religious conversion. The motion papers, however, fail to intimate the slightest connection between the forecasted persecution and any governmental action or inaction. Indeed, the petitioner's principal claim is that he fears the wrath of his immediate family because of his apostasy. There is nothing of any substance to connect those possible depredations to the government. By the same token, there is nothing that might suffice to ground a finding &#8212; let alone to compel a finding &#8212; that the government is unable or unwilling to combat violence based on religious preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do the internet articles regarding sporadic Sunni-Shiite violence establish a prima facie case of asylum eligibility. Even assuming that one accepts the petitioner's claim of conversion &#8212; and that claim is wholly uncorroborated &#8212; the fourteen articles that he has submitted refer generally to militant activity and episodic violence within Pakistan. This violence is not widespread but, rather, largely confined to the city of Karachi and Punjab province. Tellingly, the articles, taken as a group, make it pellucid that most of Pakistan's Sunnis and Shiites reside peacefully together. By definition, persecution has a systematic aspect; it requires more than a showing that scattered incidents of violence or harassment are in prospect. <i>See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.2005). To cinch matters, the religiously inspired unpleasantness described in the fourteen internet articles is, like the feared wrath of the petitioner's family members, unconnected to the Pakistani government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory. On this exiguous showing, it cannot plausibly be said that the BIA abused its discretion when it concluded that the petitioner, in failing to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of persecution should he be returned to Pakistan, fell short of establishing a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other strain of substantive relief sought by the petitioner is withholding of removal. A claim for withholding of removal \"carries with it a more stringent burden of proof than does a counterpart effort to obtain asylum.\" <i>Orelien,</i> 467 F.3d at 73 (citing <i>Ang v. Gonzales,</i> 430 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir.2005)). Presumably for this reason, the petitioner makes no assertion that, if he failed to make out a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum, he somehow can be found to have made out a prima facie case of eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The short of it is that the petitioner's motion to reopen was numerically and temporally barred. The BIA sufficiently addressed, and supportably rejected, the petitioner's argument that he qualified for an exception to these numerical and temporal limitations. Consequently, adhering to those bars did not, in the circumstances of this case, constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record reflects various spellings of the petitioner's first name.

On July 2, 2002, the IJ pretermitted this application, finding that the petitioner had lied, had submitted false documents, and in any event, had failed to satisfy the requirements of the applicable adjustment of status statute. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a).

The record, however, belies the foundational premise on which this argument rests: it shows beyond any peradventure of doubt that the BIA took cognizance of the petitioner's proffer and adequately explained why the conclusion that the petitioner urged should not carry the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's memorandum of decision tells the tale. In that rescript, the BIA explicitly acknowledged the petitioner's claim that his case fit within the \"changed circumstances\" exception to the numerical and temporal limitations. It then limned the relevant legal standard, considered the petitioner's allegations (including those pertaining to conversion and evolving country conditions), and found those thinly supported allegations insufficient to bring the exception into play. In the process, the BIA observed that the \"country conditions information\" did not specifically refer to the petitioner and that in several critical aspects the motion was \"based upon mere speculation about what may happen to the [petitioner] upon his return\" to Pakistan. Thus, notwithstanding the contents of his proffer, the petitioner had failed to meet the requirements for an exception to the numerical and temporal limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no flaw in the BIA's analysis. An agency is not required to dissect in minute detail every contention that a complaining party advances. It is enough if the agency fairly considers the points raised by the complainant and articulates its decision in terms adequate to allow a reviewing court to conclude that the agency has thought about the evidence and the issues and reached a reasoned conclusion. <i>See Bowman Transp., Inc. v.

The BIA's decision in this case satisfies that standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the petitioner argues that, even if the BIA did not ignore his proffer, it nonetheless abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. Even without regard to numerical and temporal limitations, an alien making such an argument must overcome the obstacle imposed by a \"highly deferential\" standard of review. <i>Roberts,</i> 422 F.3d at 35. In this instance, the petitioner cannot surmount that obstacle. As we explain below, the BIA's determination that he failed to make out a prima facie case of eligibility for appropriate substantive relief seems unimpugnable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the petitioner's claim that he had made out a case of eligibility for asylum. To qualify for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of five enumerated grounds, namely, \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(2)(i)(A). Neither the statute nor the regulations defines \"persecution\" for purposes of asylum, and this court has opted to decide the question of what constitutes persecution case by case. <i>See, e.g., Orelien v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span>, 71 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, however, some guiding principles. One of these guidelines is that persecution \"always implies some connection to governmental action or inaction, related to a protected ground . . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 72. When an asylum claim focuses on non-governmental conduct, its fate depends on some showing either that the alleged persecutors are aligned with the government or that the government is unwilling or unable to control them. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the petitioner experienced no persecution while in Pakistan. His professed fear of future persecution arises out of the possibility of victimization as a result of his religious conversion. The motion papers, however, fail to intimate the slightest connection between the forecasted persecution and any governmental action or inaction. Indeed, the petitioner's principal claim is that he fears the wrath of his immediate family because of his apostasy. There is nothing of any substance to connect those possible depredations to the government. By the same token, there is nothing that might suffice to ground a finding &#8212; let alone to compel a finding &#8212; that the government is unable or unwilling to combat violence based on religious preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do the internet articles regarding sporadic Sunni-Shiite violence establish a prima facie case of asylum eligibility. Even assuming that one accepts the petitioner's claim of conversion &#8212; and that claim is wholly uncorroborated &#8212; the fourteen articles that he has submitted refer generally to militant activity and episodic violence within Pakistan. This violence is not widespread but, rather, largely confined to the city of Karachi and Punjab province. Tellingly, the articles, taken as a group, make it pellucid that most of Pakistan's Sunnis and Shiites reside peacefully together. By definition, persecution has a systematic aspect; it requires more than a showing that scattered incidents of violence or harassment are in prospect. <i>See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201897\"><a href=\"/opinion/201897/palma-mazariegos-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2005). To cinch matters, the religiously inspired unpleasantness described in the fourteen internet articles is, like the feared wrath of the petitioner's family members, unconnected to the Pakistani government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory. On this exiguous showing, it cannot plausibly be said that the BIA abused its discretion when it concluded that the petitioner, in failing to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of persecution should he be returned to Pakistan, fell short of establishing a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other strain of substantive relief sought by the petitioner is withholding of removal. A claim for withholding of removal \"carries with it a more stringent burden of proof than does a counterpart effort to obtain asylum.\" <i>Orelien,</i> 467 F.3d at 73 (citing <i>Ang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201939\"><a href=\"/opinion/201939/ang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2005)). Presumably for this reason, the petitioner makes no assertion that, if he failed to make out a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum, he somehow can be found to have made out a prima facie case of eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The short of it is that the petitioner's motion to reopen was numerically and temporally barred. The BIA sufficiently addressed, and supportably rejected, the petitioner's argument that he qualified for an exception to these numerical and temporal limitations. Consequently, adhering to those bars did not, in the circumstances of this case, constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record reflects various spellings of the petitioner's first name.

The government contends, with some force, that the petitioner's initial motion to remand, regardless of its label, in fact constituted a motion to reopen. In that case, the motion under review here would be the petitioner's third motion to reopen. Because it makes no difference to the outcome of this proceeding whether the current motion is the petitioner's second or third motion to reopen, we do not pursue this line of inquiry</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that, under the applicable regulations, the BIA would have had some leeway to deny the motion to reopen even if the petitioner had made out a prima facie case of eligibility for substantive relief<i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(a).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
