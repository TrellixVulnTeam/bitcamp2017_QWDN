Downing/Salt Pond Partners, L.P.,\n\nfrustrated by two state agencies' restrictions on its development\n\nof a coastal residential subdivision in Narragansett, Rhode Island,\n\nappeals the district court's dismissal of its federal takings\n\nclaims under the Supreme Court's ripeness requirements for such\n\nclaims, set forth in Williamson County Regional Planning Commission\n\nv. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985).\n\n          Downing argues that it is excused from one Williamson\n\nCounty requirement, that it pursue any \"adequate procedure for\n\nseeking just compensation\" that state law provides, id. at 195,\n\nunder a decision of this court.    It argues it is excused from the\n\nother Williamson County ripeness requirement, that the relevant\n\ngovernment agency has reached a \"final decision regarding the\n\napplication of the regulations to the property at issue,\" id. at\n\n186, because the state agency has not yet entered a final decision\n\ndespite Downing's repeated requests that it do so.    We affirm the\n\ndismissal of the complaint, reaching only the first issue. We hold\n\nagain that Rhode Island's inverse condemnation procedure satisfies\n\nthe Williamson County requirements and must be followed.        See\n\nPascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC v. Rhode Island, 337 F.3d 87, 93 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n                      I. Standard of Review\n\n          We review de novo the legal question of whether the\n\ndistrict court properly dismissed Downing's complaint as unripe for\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\flack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).\n\nDeniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo, 285 F.3d 142, 144 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).        We    accept    the   well-plead     factual   allegations    in   the\n\ncomplaint as true and make all reasonable inferences in favor of\n\nthe plaintiff.         Id.    In resolving a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, we may\n\nalso    consider      other    materials      in   the   district   court   record,\n\nincluding where those materials contradict the allegations in the\n\ncomplaint.

Factual Background\n\nA. Facts as Alleged in the Complaint\n\n              In 1992, Downing secured a land use permit, called an\n\nAssent, from the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council\n\n(CRMC), in order to develop a residential community on a tract of\n\nland it owns in Narragansett.              Between 1992 and 2007 Downing built\n\nhomes    on    twenty-six      of   the    planned   seventy-nine    lots   in   the\n\nsubdivision, installed community infrastructure such as roads and\n\na sewer line, and began infrastructure improvements necessary to\n\nbuild on the remaining lots.              While Downing failed to attach a copy\n\nof the Assent to its complaint, Downing alleged that none of the\n\nAssent's thirty-four stipulations and conditions required it to\n\nperform any archaeological or historical surveys on the tract of\n\nland.\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\f                In 2007, a second state agency, the Rhode Island Historic\n\nPreservation           and       Heritage    Commission     (HPHC)   \"became    keenly\n\ninterested in the site of the Salt Pond Residences project from a\n\ncultural and archaeological perspective.\"                    This was because many\n\nartifacts had been found in the course of the Salt Pond development\n\nproject indicating that the land was likely a former Narragansett\n\nIndian settlement.               These artifacts included digging and grinding\n\ntools, fragments of ceramic and stone vessels and a pipe, and\n\nprojectile points.               Downing alleges the HPHC then \"concluded that\n\n[the land] should be preserved for the benefit of the public at\n\nlarge and not developed at all,\" and encouraged the CRMC to\n\nwithdraw the project's CRMC Assent.                    A July 11, 2007 letter from\n\nthe HPHC Executive Director to the CRMC, Downing alleges, stated\n\nthat HPHC \"was resolved 'to acquire title to the [site] in order to\n\nassure its preservation'\" (alteration in Complaint).\n\n                The CRMC sent Downing a letter dated August 22, 2007\n\nstating that the Assent \"is still valid and remains valid pending\n\na determination by the [CRMC] on the issues raised by the Historic\n\nPreservation And Heritage Commission\" (alteration in Complaint).\n\nIn   a       June    2008    HPHC       memorandum,1   Downing    alleges,   the   HPHC\n\nconfirmed           that    it    had    recommended   to   the   CRMC   that   either\n\nconstruction be prohibited or a \"complete archaeological data\n\n\n\n         1\n          The Complaint does not state whether the memorandum was\naddressed to the CRMC or to Downing.\n\n                                               -4-\n\frecovery\"       project   be    required       as    a    condition     of     further\n\nconstruction.      Downing estimates that such a data recovery project\n\nwould cost six million dollars.\n\n            Downing alleges that a year after the initial CRMC\n\nletter,    on    August   21,    2008,   following        a   series    of    informal\n\ndiscussions with the HPHC that did not resolve the dispute, it\n\nformally requested that the CRMC submit the matter for hearing. On\n\nDecember    17,    2008   it    submitted      to   the   CRMC   a    legal    opinion\n\nmemorandum and supporting materials from its lawyers arguing that\n\nthe CRMC and HPHC were violating the United States and Rhode Island\n\nConstitutions' takings clauses.\n\n            On February 23, 2009, Downing formally notified the HPHC\n\nthat it would resume construction under its permits absent some\n\nresponse from the agencies.         There is no evidence in the record as\n\nto whether further communications took place during the months\n\nafter this February 23 notice.\n\n            Downing alleges that neither agency ever responded to any\n\nof these communications.            The defendants deny that they were\n\nnonresponsive, asserting to us as they did to the district court\n\nthat during the two-year period at issue, informal negotiations\n\nwere ongoing between the parties to try to resolve the issue.\n\n            On June 27, 2009, Downing resumed construction. The same\n\nday, the CRMC issued a cease and desist order.                       Downing did not\n\nplace the order into the district court record, and has not\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fdescribed its contents except to claim that the order did not\n\nspecify how Downing's conduct violated its permits.            On July 15,\n\n2009, Downing formally requested a hearing before the CRMC in order\n\nto contest the cease and desist order.       Downing alleges that it had\n\nheard no response by the CRMC to this request by August 6, 2009.\n\nOn this day, Downing says, it then sent a \"final notice\" to the\n\nCRMC warning that if the CRMC did not promptly respond, Downing\n\nwould conclude that its pursuit of administrative remedies was\n\nfutile and would \"proceed accordingly.\"\n\n           Downing alleges that the CRMC did not respond to this\n\nfinal notice, though Downing did not wait long for it to do so.\n\nLess than three weeks later, on August 24, 2009, Downing filed its\n\ncomplaint in federal court alleging, inter alia,2 that the state,\n\nCRMC, and HPHC had taken its property for public purposes without\n\njust compensation, and denied it substantive and procedural due\n\nprocess and equal protection under the law. Downing sought damages\n\nand prospective injunctive relief.\n\n           On December 30, 2009, the CRMC issued to Downing a notice\n\nof   hearing   on   the   issues   surrounding   Downing's   Assent.   The\n\ndistrict court noted in its March 26, 2010 opinion that in February\n\n2010 the parties had \"agreed that the matter would be referred to\n\n\n\n      2\n          Downing also alleged under federal law that the agencies\nhad conspired to violate Downing's civil rights.      Under Rhode\nIsland law, Downing also alleged that the agencies had\nintentionally interfered with its advantageous business relations.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fa CRMC subcommittee for an expedited hearing.\"   Downing/Salt Pond\n\nPartners, L.P. v. Rhode Island, 698 F. Supp. 2d 278, 279 & n.1\n\n(D.R.I. 2010). At oral argument in this court, counsel for Downing\n\nexplained that this hearing process was ongoing.3\n\nB. Motion to Dismiss in the District Court\n\n          Rhode Island moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction, arguing that Downing had failed to meet either of the\n\nWilliamson County ripeness requirements for federal Takings Clause\n\nclaims, and that its other claims were coextensive with the takings\n\nclaims and should be subject to the same requirements.     Downing\n\nresponded that it was excused from both requirements.    As to the\n\nrequirement that it seek compensation in state court, Downing\n\nargued that Rhode Island provided no \"reasonable, certain and\n\nadequate\" procedures \"for obtaining compensation.\"      Williamson\n\nCounty, 473 U.S. at 194 (quoting Reg'l Rail Reorg. Act Cases, 419\n\nU.S. 102, 124-25 (1974)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   This\n\nargument was based on language in an opinion in a case under Puerto\n\nRico law that distinguished between \"general remedial cause[s] of\n\naction under state law\" and \"procedures specifically designed by\n\nthe state\" to provide compensation for takings.      Asociación De\n\nSubscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Resonsabilidad Obligatorio v.\n\n\n     3\n          According to Downing's counsel, the CRMC subcommittee had\nconducted four or five hearings over several months. That stage of\nthe process had concluded. The parties had still to submit closing\nwritten submissions, after which the subcommittee would make a\nrecommendation to the full CRMC.\n\n                               -7-\n\fFlores Galarza, 484 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2007).                    Downing argued\n\nthis language overruled an earlier decision of this court, Pascoag,\n\nwhich affirmed a dismissal under Williamson County for failure to\n\nuse Rhode Island's inverse condemnation procedure.                   See Pascoag,\n\n337   F.3d   at    92-93.      Downing     also    argued   that    the    finality\n\nrequirement was inapplicable to \"direct or physical takings such as\n\nare   alleged      here,\"     and    in    the     alternative     that     further\n\nadministrative proceedings would be futile.                   Downing did not\n\nrespond to Rhode Island's argument that its non-takings claims\n\nshould be dismissed along with its takings claims and did not\n\nassert that those claims were not also subject to the ripeness\n\nconstraints.\n\n             The district court, in a thoughtful and well-reasoned\n\nopinion, granted the motion to dismiss all of Downing's state and\n\nfederal claims.      Downing/Salt Pond Partners, 698 F. Supp. 2d 278.\n\nThe court found Downing's argument that it was excused from the\n\nstate litigation requirement to be foreclosed by binding First\n\nCircuit precedent holding that Rhode Island's procedures were\n\navailable and adequate under the Williamson County ripeness test.\n\nDowning, 698 F.Supp.2d at 284 (citing Pascoag). The court rejected\n\nDowning's    argument       that    Flores      Galarza   implicitly      overruled\n\nPascoag.     Id.    As to Downing's remaining claims, including its\n\nfederal due process claims, the court found that \"Downing has\n\nmerely '[d]ress[ed] a takings claim' in several other costumes,\"\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fand concluded that all of the claims failed on ripeness grounds\n\nunder Williamson County as well.             Id. at 290 (quoting Deniz, 285\n\nF.3d   at   149)   (alteration    in   original).       Downing   appeals    the\n\ndismissal of its claims.\n\n       III. Analysis of the Williamson County Ripeness Prongs\n\nA. Takings Claim Ripeness Requirements\n\n             In Williamson County, the Supreme Court held that the\n\nnature of a federal regulatory takings claim gives rise to two\n\nripeness requirements which plaintiffs bear the burden of proving\n\nthey have met before a federal court has jurisdiction over a\n\ntakings claim.      Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 186; García-Rubiera\n\nv. Calderón, 570 F.3d 443, 521 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"Plaintiffs have\n\nthe burden of demonstrating ripeness.\").              These two requirements\n\narise because \"there is no uncompensated taking,\" and therefore\n\nnothing     to   litigate   in   federal     court,   \"until   the   state   has\n\nestablished (a) what it has taken, and (b) its refusal to pay 'just\n\ncompensation.'\"      Pascoag, 337 F.3d at 91 (quoting SGB Fin. Servs.,\n\nInc. v. Consol. City of Indianapolis-Marion Cnty., Inc., 235 F.3d\n\n1036, 1038 (7th Cir. 2000)).       Downing argues it is exempt from both\n\nrequirements.      We discuss each in turn.\n\n             First, a regulatory takings claim is not ripe until the\n\nrelevant government entity has \"reached a final decision regarding\n\nthe application of the regulations to the property at issue.\"\n\nWilliamson County, 473 U.S. at 186. Determining whether regulatory\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\faction has resulted in a taking involves a complex inquiry into\n\nfacts that \"simply cannot be evaluated until the administrative\n\nagency has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding\" its\n\napplication of the law to the land in question.                        Id. at 191; see\n\nalso          Palazzolo    v.   Rhode   Island,      533    U.S.   606,     618   (2001).\n\nGenerally          plaintiffs      must      complete       ordinary      administrative\n\nprocesses before the impact of regulatory restrictions can be\n\ndetermined with reasonable certainty.                   Palazzolo, 533 U.S. at 621.\n\n                  The second ripeness requirement, which is the focus of\n\nour       analysis,       arises   because     the    Fifth      Amendment    \"does      not\n\nproscribe the taking of property; it proscribes taking without just\n\ncompensation.\"            Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 194.              As a result,\n\n\"if    a       State   provides    an   adequate      procedure     for    seeking    just\n\ncompensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the\n\nJust Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been\n\ndenied just compensation.\" Id. at 195. This is sometimes referred\n\nto as a \"state litigation\" requirement.4                    See San Remo Hotel, L.P.\n\nv. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 545 U.S. 323,                              349 (2005)\n\n(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).                Further, the compensation need not\n\nbe paid in advance or at the time of the taking, as long as there\n\nis    a       procedure    in   place   at   the     time   of   the   taking     that   is\n\n\n\n          4\n          In adopting this \"state litigation\" terminology we do not\nmean to suggest that the requirement would not encompass a non-\njudicial state procedure that was otherwise adequate and available\nunder Williamson County.\n\n                                             -10-\n\f\"reasonable,     certain    and    adequate   .   .   .   for    obtaining\n\ncompensation.\"      Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 194 (quoting Reg'l\n\nRail Reorg. Act Cases, 419 U.S. at 124-25) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).      In Williamson County itself, at the time of the\n\nalleged    taking   an   inverse   condemnation   cause   of    action   was\n\navailable under state law, and the state courts had permitted its\n\ninvocation in cases of regulatory takings as well as physical\n\ntakings.    Id. at 196.      Because the plaintiff in Williamson had\n\nneither pursued an inverse condemnation proceeding nor shown that\n\nit was \"unavailable or inadequate,\" its claim was unripe.           Id. at\n\n196-97.\n\n            Under the Williamson County ripeness rules a plaintiff\n\nmight be precluded from ever bringing a takings claim in federal\n\ncourt if the substance of the federal claim is litigated in state\n\ncourt. The Supreme Court squarely confronted this situation in San\n\nRemo Hotel, in which it acknowledged this implication of Williamson\n\nCounty and refused to create an exception from ordinary preclusion\n\nrules and the full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738,\n\nwhenever \"a case is forced into state court by the ripeness rule of\n\nWilliamson County.\"      San Remo Hotel, 545 U.S. at 342.        The Court\n\nheld that there was no absolute \"right to vindicate . . . federal\n\nclaims in a federal forum . . . . even when the plaintiff would\n\nhave preferred not to litigate in state court, but was required to\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdo so by statute or prudential rules\" like the Williamson County\n\nrequirements.5   Id.\n\n          The    Supreme    Court    has    continued   to   adhere   to   the\n\nWilliamson County state litigation rule, despite Chief Justice\n\nRehnquists's concurrence in San Remo Hotel encouraging the Court to\n\nreconsider the rule.6      In San Remo Hotel itself, twenty years after\n\nWilliamson County, the Court expressly refused to soften the\n\neffects of the rule on takings plaintiffs' access to the federal\n\ncourts.   See id. at 341-42.        Since San Remo Hotel, the Court has\n\nrepeatedly denied petitions for a writ of certiorari that asked the\n\nCourt to abrogate the Williamson County state litigation rule.7\n\n\n     5\n          As a practical matter, the Court emphasized, because the\nfinality requirement was actually \"settled well before Williamson\nCounty,\" regulatory takings were already rarely litigated in\nfederal court.    San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & Cnty. of San\nFrancisco, 545 U.S. 323, 346-47 (2005). This was not concerning:\n\"State courts are fully competent to adjudicate constitutional\nchallenges to local land-use decisions\" and \"undoubtedly have more\nexperience than federal courts do in resolving the complex factual,\ntechnical, and legal questions\" they raise. Id. at 347.\n     6\n          Chief Justice Rehnquist explained that since joining the\nWilliamson County majority, he had come to think that \"the\njustifications for [the] state-litigation requirement are suspect,\nwhile its impact on takings plaintiffs is dramatic\" in that they\nare often entirely precluded from a federal forum for their federal\ntakings claims.   Id. at 352.    He acknowledged that no party or\ncourt had addressed the requirement's validity in San Remo Hotel,\nbut he invited the Court to reconsider in an appropriate case in\nthe future.

Williamson\n\nCounty, then, governs our analysis.\n\n           This court has held, under Williamson County, that a\n\ntakings claim against the state of Rhode Island was unripe where,\n\nas here, the plaintiff had failed to pursue the state's inverse\n\ncondemnation cause of action.   Pascoag, 337 F.3d 87.   In Pascoag,\n\nthe plaintiff owned a lake abutted by state-owned land.    In 1964,\n\nthe state built a public boat ramp jutting into the lake, which the\n\npublic used as a point of access to the lake until at least 1997,\n\nwhen Pascoag put up a \"NO TRESPASSING\" sign.      Id. at 90.   Rhode\n\nIsland won a judgment in the Rhode Island Supreme Court that it had\n\n\"acquired by adverse possession a small portion of the Lake bottom\n\n(occupied by the boat ramp) and had acquired, on the public's\n\nbehalf, a prescriptive easement to use the boat ramp to access the\n\nentire Lake for recreational purposes.\"   Id.   Pascoag then brought\n\nan inverse condemnation action against Rhode Island in federal\n\ncourt.   Id. at 89.\n\n\n\nhave to press most of their judicial takings claims before state\ncourts, which are 'presumptively competent . . . to adjudicate\nclaims arising under the laws of the United States'\" (quoting\nTafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458 (1990))).\n\n                                -13-\n\f               Without deciding \"whether compensation is due when the\n\nstate acquires land by adverse possession or prescription,\" id. at\n\n90, this court held that Pascoag had failed to show that Rhode\n\nIsland state remedies are \"unavailable\" or \"inadequate,\" Williamson\n\nCounty, 473 U.S. at 196-97, the \"narrow\" exceptions to the state\n\nlitigation requirement, Pascoag, 337 F.3d at 92. Those exceptions,\n\nwe held, encompass cases where state law \"did not recognize the\n\ntaking that occurred, or did not permit the relief required to make\n\nthe plaintiff whole,\" for instance, where state law did not permit\n\nan inverse condemnation cause of action for regulatory takings, or\n\nwhere       such   actions   were   limited   to   monetary   damages   and   the\n\nplaintiff's damages were not quantifiable.               Id. (citing cases).\n\nOur opinion in Pascoag concluded:\n\n     Pascoag cannot show that Rhode Island's remedies were\n     inadequate or unavailable. The Rhode Island Constitution\n     prohibits the taking of private property for public use\n     without just compensation and Rhode Island state courts\n     have long allowed recovery through suits for inverse\n     condemnation. Thus, Rhode Island has an adequate process\n     available   to   address   Pascoag's   suit   for   just\n     compensation.\n\nId. at 93 (citations omitted).\n\n               Downing's arguments to the contrary rely on its reading\n\nof Flores Galarza, which itself did not purport to overrule the\n\nholding in Pascoag.8         In Flores Galarza, a divided panel held under\n\n\n        8\n          The majority did cite Pascoag for the proposition that\nthe finality requirement does not apply to physical takings claims,\nbut otherwise did not discuss Pascoag.          See Asociación De\nSubscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Resonsabilidad Obligatorio v.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fPuerto Rico law that an unusual type of takings claim was ripe\n\nbecause the plaintiffs were excused from fulfilling the Williamson\n\nCounty requirements.        Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 13-20.                The\n\nplaintiffs, a group of automobile insurers in Puerto Rico, sued the\n\nPuerto Rico Secretary of the Treasury for withholding from the\n\ninsurers     insurance   premiums   generated       by    Puerto    Rico's    new\n\ncompulsory liability insurance program.             Id. at 6.         Under the\n\nstatutory scheme, the Commonwealth was to transfer to the insurers\n\ninsurance premiums paid when drivers renewed their licenses, but\n\nthe Commonwealth temporarily stopped doing so as a result of its\n\nown   cash-flow    problems.     Id.   at   8-9.         The   insurers   sought\n\ncompensation for this temporary taking, including for the foregone\n\ninterest on the premiums and the amounts they were forced to pay\n\nfrom their own funds for reimbursements to drivers that were\n\nintended to be paid from the amounts retained by the Commonwealth.\n\nId. at 11.    They also sought compensation for the permanent taking\n\nthey alleged resulted from a change in the law that appropriated to\n\nthe   Commonwealth   certain    reserve     funds   accumulated       under   the\n\ninsurance scheme.     Id.\n\n             The majority opinion reasoned that the withholding of\n\nfunds amounted to a physical taking, not a regulatory one, id. at\n\n15, and that because it involved \"the direct appropriation of\n\nfunds,\"      the   Williamson    County      requirements          were   wholly\n\n\nFlores Galarza, 484 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                    -15-\n\finapplicable, id. at 19.        The majority nonetheless discussed the\n\nnature of the state litigation requirement, in language that\n\nDowning reads as reframing the Williamson County state litigation\n\nrequirement:\n\n     The key component of this prong of Williamson County is\n     the availability of a [state] process that is\n     particularly aimed at providing compensation when\n     government action effects a taking. In our view, such\n     procedures do not include litigation of a state takings\n     claim or any general remedial cause of action under state\n     law. Rather, the Supreme Court must have had in mind\n     only those procedures specifically designed by the state\n     to avoid constitutional injury in the first instance by\n     providing a means for a plaintiff to obtain compensation\n     for the government's taking of property.\n\nId. at 16-17 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).            Downing relies\n\non this language to argue that if this is the standard, then\n\nPascoag must be reconsidered.\n\n            Downing also relies on other language in the majority\n\nopinion that attempts to contrast inverse condemnation proceedings\n\nwith \"any generally available state procedure that might provide a\n\nremedy for an uncompensated taking.\"           Id. at 17.      The majority\n\nconcluded that if only the latter was available, a plaintiff need\n\nnot pursue it to satisfy Williamson County.9               Id. at 17.      This\n\npurported   distinction   was    driven   in   part   by   reliance   on   the\n\n\n\n     9\n          As we explain below, Downing argues that Rhode Island's\njudicially created inverse condemnation cause of action is\nactually, under the framework of Flores Galarza, merely a\n\"generally available state procedure\" rather than one \"particularly\naimed\" at addressing its specific type of claim.        See Flores\nGalarza, 484 F.3d at 16-17.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fconcerns in Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurrence in San Remo Hotel\n\nand the panel majority's consideration that the full Supreme Court\n\nmight respond to those concerns by narrowing or overruling the\n\nstate litigation requirement in the near future. See id. at 17-18.\n\nAs we have said, the Supreme Court has since refused to alter the\n\nWilliamson County state litigation requirement, and so that basis\n\nhas disappeared.\n\n          One judge concurred in the judgment, disagreeing strongly\n\nwith the majority's conclusion and analysis on the state litigation\n\nrule.   The concurring opinion argued, \"There is no support in\n\nSupreme Court precedent for the conclusion that claimants are\n\nrelieved of the litigation requirement unless the state has adopted\n\nspecific processes . . . through which such compensation may be\n\nrecovered.\"   Id. at 38 (Howard, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\n\"It is not enough to show only that the adequacy of state process\n\nremains unsure and undeveloped\"; it must be affirmatively shown to\n\nbe unavailable or inadequate.   Id. at 40.\n\n          The majority's analysis was, as the district court in\n\nthis case recognized, called into question by the en banc court.\n\nThree judges (a clear majority of the court's five active judges at\n\nthe time, four of whom participated in the matter) wrote in a\n\nstatement accompanying an order denying en banc review, \"It appears\n\nto us that the panel majority decision likely conflicts directly\n\nwith binding Supreme Court authority and prior decisions in this\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fcourt, as well as the law in other circuits.\"           Id. at 40 (statement\n\naccompanying denial of reh'g en banc) (footnotes omitted).                 The\n\nthree judges emphasized, as had the concurrence, that plaintiffs\n\nmust carry \"the burden of demonstrating the absolute lack of . . .\n\na state proceeding\" in which compensation could be available, and\n\nthat the court's precedent had previously determined that \"such a\n\nproceeding and a remedy may very well exist under the Puerto Rico\n\nConstitution.\"      Id. at 41 (citing Deniz, 285 F.3d at 146-47).\n\nNonetheless, the court denied rehearing en banc because the case\n\nhad arisen on interlocutory appeal and error correction would be\n\navailable   if    necessary    on   appeal    from   final   judgment.    Id.\n\nMoreover, the statement concluded, to the extent the majority\n\nopinion had reached a result contrary to Supreme Court and First\n\nCircuit precedent, it was without authority to do so.             Id. at 40.\n\nAs we explain below, we too now reject application of the language\n\nand   reasoning    in   the    Flores   Galarza      majority   opinion   that\n\npurportedly reworked the Williamson County state litigation test as\n\ncontrary to Supreme Court and circuit precedent.\n\nB. Downing Is Not Excused from Meeting the State Litigation Prong\n\n            Downing acknowledges that it never initiated an inverse\n\ncondemnation proceeding in Rhode Island state court, but went\n\ninstead directly to federal court.             Downing argues that it was\n\nexcused   from    Williamson    County's     state   litigation   requirement\n\nbecause Rhode Island's state law remedies are \"unavailable\" or\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f\"inadequate.\"        See Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 196-97; Pascoag,\n\n337 F.3d at 92.       But we concluded in Pascoag that the Rhode Island\n\ncourts \"have long allowed recovery through suits for inverse\n\ncondemnation.          Thus,    Rhode   Island       has    an     adequate   process\n\navailable\" to takings plaintiffs, and plaintiffs must resort to it\n\nbefore their federal takings claims will ripen.                    Pascoag, 337 F.3d\n\nat 93.    As the district court aptly stated, Pascoag \"looks like a\n\ntrapdoor straight to state court for Downing.\"                         Downing, 698\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 282.\n\n           Downing has two arguments in reply.                     First, it argues\n\nthat Flores Galarza overruled Pascoag as to Rhode Island's inverse\n\ncondemnation cause of action and set forth a higher standard for\n\nstate remedies that Rhode Island's inverse condemnation cause of\n\naction does not meet.          Second, it argues that all the Pascoag court\n\nheld was that the plaintiff in that case had not proven the\n\ninadequacy      or    unavailability      of     the       Rhode    Island    inverse\n\ncondemnation procedure, and that the state procedure suffers from\n\ndefects not considered in Pascoag that make it not a \"reasonable,\n\ncertain   and    adequate       provision      for   obtaining       compensation.\"\n\nWilliamson County, 473 U.S. at 194 (quoting Reg'l Rail Reorg. Act\n\nCases, 419 U.S. at 124-25) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f              1. We Reject Downing's Arguments that We May Alter the\n                 Williamson County Test Based on Flores Galarza\n\n              We turn first to Downing's arguments relating to Flores\n\nGalarza.      Downing argues that Rhode Island's inverse condemnation\n\nproceeding falls on the wrong side of the line drawn in Flores\n\nGalarza between \"a process that is particularly aimed,\" Flores\n\nGalarza, 484 F.3d at 16, at compensating property owners to prevent\n\nconstitutional injury and a \"general remedial cause of action\" such\n\nas a state takings claim that provides damages for a constitutional\n\ninjury, id. at 17.         Downing argues that because in Annicelli v.\n\nTown of South Kingstown, 463 A.2d 133 (R.I. 1983), the case in\n\nwhich   the    Rhode     Island   Supreme    Court    recognized     an   inverse\n\ncondemnation cause of action for regulatory takings, the state\n\ncourt \"did not develop any particularized procedure for obtaining\n\ncompensation for a taking,\" as Downing puts it, the cause of action\n\nis insufficient under the rule in Flores Galarza.                 Downing argues\n\nthat it would be bound to bring a state inverse condemnation claim\n\nonly if the Rhode Island Supreme Court or legislature had crafted\n\nan inverse condemnation scheme as \"particularly aimed,\" Flores\n\nGalarza,   484    F.3d    at   16,   and    as    detailed   as   the   statutory\n\ncompensation     schemes    the   state     has   legislatively     created   for\n\nwetland owners denied permission to alter their land, R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws § 2-1-21(b), and property owners whose land the state takes\n\nfor public use through condemnation, see, e.g., R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f§   42-64-9         (land     condemned       by     state      Economic     Development\n\nCorporation).\n\n               Downing's argument depends on the proposition that Flores\n\nGalarza narrowed Williamson County generally by heightening the\n\nstandard for adequate state procedures.                     If that proposition were\n\ncorrect, Downing might have an argument.                     But Flores Galarza could\n\nnot overrule prior circuit law.                     See Pascoag, 337 F.3d at 93;\n\nDeniz, 285 F.3d at 147; Gilbert v. City of Cambridge, 932 F.2d 51,\n\n65 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding plaintiffs had not satisfied burden of\n\nproving Massachusetts inverse condemnation proceeding could not\n\napply to the type of taking they alleged).10                      Nor could the panel\n\nmajority       revise     a   test    created       by    the   Supreme    Court.      See\n\nWilliamson County, 473 U.S. at 195-97.                     The en banc statement of\n\nthis court made that point, and we elaborate.\n\n               To   the     extent    that    language       in   the   Flores   Galarza\n\nmajority opinion can be read to say the plaintiffs do not bear the\n\nburden    of    proving       the    inadequacy      or    unavailability      of   state\n\nprocedures      for     seeking      compensation,         that   language    cannot   be\n\nsquared with either Supreme Court or First Circuit precedent.                          The\n\nFlores Galarza majority expressly refused to \"requir[e] plaintiffs\n\n\n\n     10\n          The plaintiffs in Gilbert petitioned for a writ of\ncertiorari, asking the Supreme Court to reconsider the Williamson\nCounty state litigation rule. See Opposition to Petition for Writ\nof Certiorari at i, Gilbert v. City of Cambridge, No. 91-209 (U.S.\nAug. 30, 1991), 1991 WL 11178604. The Supreme Court denied the\npetition. Gilbert v. City of Cambridge, 502 U.S. 866 (1991).\n\n                                             -21-\n\fto invoke any generally available state procedure that might\n\nprovide a remedy for an uncompensated taking.\" Flores Galarza, 484\n\nF.3d at 17 (emphasis added).    But in Williamson County the Supreme\n\nCourt clearly placed the burden of proving the inadequacy of state\n\nlaw remedies on the plaintiff.    Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 197\n\n(finding that plaintiff \"has not shown that the [state's] inverse\n\ncondemnation procedure is unavailable or inadequate . . . .\").\n\n           In the First Circuit, \"It is well settled that the burden\n\nof   demonstrating   the   absolute   lack   of   [an   adequate]   state\n\nproceeding is on the plaintiff.\"        Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 41\n\n(statement accompanying denial of reh'g en banc) (citing Deniz, 285\n\nF.3d at 146); see also Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright, 548 F.3d\n\n155, 165 (1st Cir. 2008).    Even where \"the most that can be said is\n\nthat it remains unclear whether the inverse condemnation remedy\n\napplies\" to the type of taking alleged by the plaintiff, the state\n\nlitigation requirement is not excused. Deniz, 285 F.3d at 147; see\n\nalso Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 65; Culebras Enters. Corp. v. Rivera\n\nRios, 813 F.2d 506, 514-15 (1st Cir. 1987).         To be excused, the\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate that the state law \"expressly precludes\n\nuse of the inverse condemnation remedy\" in the plaintiff's case.\n\nDeniz, 285 F.3d at 147.     We have relied on this allocation of the\n\nburden of proof since Flores Galarza as well.       See García-Rubiera,\n\n570 F.3d at 451.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f            Our sister circuits agree that the burden is on the\n\nplaintiff to prove the absolute unavailability or inadequacy of\n\npotential state remedies in order to be excused from the state\n\nlitigation     requirement.        See,   e.g.,       Island    Park,   LLC    v.   CSX\n\nTransp., 559 F.3d 96, 109 (2d Cir. 2009) (plaintiff must pursue\n\neven unsure and undeveloped possibilities for relief); Rockstead v.\n\nCity   of   Crystal   Lake,      486   F.3d    963,    965-66    (7th   Cir.    2007)\n\n(plaintiff must challenge out-of-date state common law precedent\n\ndenying validity of particular type of inverse condemnation claim);\n\nUrban Developers LLC v. City of Jackson, Miss., 468 F.3d 281, 295\n\n(5th Cir. 2006); Austin v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 840 F.2d 678,\n\n680 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n            Other language in Flores Galarza, if read a certain\n\nway,   would   also   conflict     with   Supreme       Court    precedent.         The\n\nmajority held that a plaintiff is excused from the state litigation\n\nrequirement if the only remedy available under state law is a\n\ngeneral state takings claim.            Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 17-18.\n\nBut the Supreme Court in San Remo Hotel, decided two years before\n\nFlores Galarza, abrogated a Second Circuit case holding \"that\n\nparties 'who litigate state-law takings claims in state court\n\ninvoluntarily' pursuant to Williamson County cannot be precluded\n\nfrom having those claims resolved 'by a federal court,'\" San Remo\n\nHotel,   545   U.S.   at   342    (emphasis     added)     (quoting     Santini     v.\n\nConnecticut Hazardous Waste Mgmt. Serv., 342 F.3d 118, 130 (2d Cir.\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f2003)). The Court thereby expressly recognized that to satisfy the\n\nWilliamson County state litigation requirement, plaintiffs must\n\nbring state taking claims in state court where they are available.11\n\n            Indeed, other circuits to face the question have held\n\nthat plaintiffs must pursue claims under the takings clause of a\n\nstate constitution even when there is no judicial or legislative\n\ninverse condemnation procedure already definitively established.\n\nSee,    e.g.,   Island   Park,   559   F.3d   at   110   (Second   Circuit);\n\nBickerstaff Clay Prods. Co., Inc. v. Harris Cnty., Ga., 89 F.3d\n\n1481, 1491 (11th Cir. 1996) (plaintiff must bring suit under\n\neminent domain provision of Georgia Constitution to determine\n\nwhether state law compensates temporary takings); Bateman v. City\n\nof West Bountiful, 89 F.3d 704, 708-09 (10th Cir. 1996); Austin,\n\n840 F.2d at 681 (Ninth Circuit); cf. Peters v. Vill. of Clifton,\n\n498 F.3d 727, 733-34 & n.6 (7th Cir. 2007) (finding Illinois courts\n\nhad developed adequate remedy, but adding that in other circuits\n\nwhere the issue was raised, courts have found adequate the \"self-\n\nexecuting [takings] provision of a state's constitution\").\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          There is also reason to think that, despite its broad\nlanguage, Flores Galarza did not intend to alter the rule in\nPascoag.   The Flores Galarza majority repeatedly referred to\ninverse condemnation proceedings, whether created by statute or\njudicial recognition, as being appropriate state procedures under\nWilliamson County. See Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 16-18 & n.21.\n\n                                   -24-\n\f           2. Downing's Other Attacks on Pascoag Also Fail\n\n           Downing also argues that the holding in Pascoag, that\n\nRhode Island has made available an adequate state-law remedy that\n\nplaintiffs must pursue before their federal takings claims will\n\nripen, has no binding force in its case, even if Pascoag is binding\n\nprecedent.    However, the main thrust of even these arguments is\n\nthat   Pascoag    insufficiently    considered       whether   Rhode    Island's\n\ninverse condemnation proceedings met the adequacy standards set\n\nforth in Flores Galarza, and so the arguments are disposed of under\n\nour rejection of a reading of Flores Galarza as narrowing the state\n\nlitigation requirement.\n\n           Downing      also   attempts    to    distinguish   its   case     from\n\nPascoag on the facts, arguing that Pascoag is inapposite because it\n\ninvolved a different type of alleged taking, arising from the\n\nstate's acquisition of the plaintiff's land by adverse possession\n\nand prescriptive easement, rather than from the actions of state\n\nregulatory agencies as in Downing's case.             The specific mechanism\n\nof the alleged taking had no bearing on our consideration of the\n\nWilliamson County ripeness requirements in Pascoag.              See Pascoag,\n\n337 F.3d at 90.         Because Downing bears the absolute burden of\n\nproving   Rhode       Island's   inverse        condemnation   proceeding       is\n\nunavailable      or   inadequate    in    its     particular    case,    it     is\n\ninsufficient to argue only that the alleged taking in its case is\n\ndifferent from the alleged taking in Pascoag.\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\f           Downing further argues that deficiencies in the remedies\n\navailable to it in state court render those remedies inadequate\n\nunder Williamson County.        Rhode Island, Downing argues, has no\n\nstatute comparable to federal statutes permitting recovery of\n\nattorneys' fees or pre-judgment statutory interest on awarded\n\ncompensation. See 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (interest); 42 U.S.C. § 1988(a)\n\n(fees); Andrade v. State, 448 A.2d 1293, 1295 (R.I. 1982) (holding\n\nRhode Island did not waive sovereign immunity as to pre-judgment\n\ninterest).     Exact equivalence of damages is not required; just\n\ncompensation is. Culebras, 813 F.2d at 514 (holding that potential\n\ndifferences between Puerto Rico and federal remedies did not render\n\npotential Puerto Rico inverse condemnation remedy inadequate, \"[s]o\n\nlong as just compensation is provided\").\n\n           Finally, Downing argues that because Rhode Island has not\n\nstatutorily waived sovereign immunity for inverse condemnation\n\nclaims as it has for statutory condemnation procedures, the remedy\n\nis uncertain.    This allegation cannot satisfy Downing's burden to\n\nshow absolute unavailability in light of the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt's   decisions   repeatedly    reaching   the   merits      in   inverse\n\ncondemnation    cases.    See    Palazzolo,    533   U.S.   at    611,    616\n\n(reviewing, and partially reversing, Rhode Island Supreme Court's\n\ndecision that CRMC's denial of a plaintiff's development permit did\n\nnot constitute a regulatory taking); Woodland Manor III Assocs. v.\n\nKeeney, 713 A.2d 806, 811-12, 814 (R.I. 1998) (remanding for trial\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fon plaintiff's claim of temporary regulatory taking); Annicelli,\n\n463 A.2d at 141 (remanding for determination of property's fair\n\nmarket value for purposes of compensation).\n\n                       IV. Remaining Arguments\n\n          Because Downing must show it has fulfilled or is excused\n\nfrom both prongs of the Williamson ripeness requirements, and we\n\nhave found that Downing has failed to make this showing as to the\n\nstate litigation requirement, we need not address the other prong,\n\nthe finality requirement.\n\n          As to Downing's other federal claims, Downing argues\n\nstrenuously in its reply brief that it has not waived its due\n\nprocess claims, because it has argued that the entire district\n\ncourt decision was erroneous.       Downing's opening brief makes\n\nfrequent passing reference to Downing's due process claims, but\n\nprovides no argument explaining why those claims should survive in\n\nfederal court even if its takings claims are found to be unripe,\n\nthe issue of primary relevance as to these claims at this stage in\n\nthe proceedings.    Nor did Downing make any such argument in the\n\ndistrict court.    The argument is doubly waived.   Cortes-Rivera v.\n\nDep't of Corr. & Rehab., 626 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2010) (\"We\n\ndecline to address the issue both because it was neither preserved\n\nnor adequately presented in the district court and because it is\n\nnot adequately presented on appeal.\"); id. at 26 (holding that an\n\nargument raised in a perfunctory manner is deemed waived).\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f           We decline to address the issues raised for the first\n\ntime by amicus in its brief, which argues that Williamson County's\n\nripeness   rules   apply   only   to   Takings   Clause   claims,   leaving\n\nplaintiffs free to pursue in federal court Due Process Clause and\n\nEqual Protection Clause claims that arise from the same allegedly\n\nillegal state conduct.      \"[A]mici may not make up for waiver by a\n\nparty,\" Family Winemakers of Cal. v. Jenkins, 592 F.3d 1, 17 n.23\n\n(1st Cir. 2010), and may not introduce a new argument into a case,\n\nPharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d 66, 74 n.5\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).    We note only that we have previously held that\n\nplaintiffs cannot, merely by recasting its takings claim \"in the\n\nraiment of a due process violation,\" evade the Williamson County\n\nripeness requirements.     Deniz, 285 F.3d at 149.\n\n           While the two agencies strenuously deny that they have\n\nbeen unresponsive or have unreasonably delayed their decisions on\n\nDowning's project, we express the hope that the parties will\n\npromptly attempt to resolve any remaining disagreements.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f",

Hamilton Bank of Johnson City,</i> 473 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985).</p>\n<p>Downing argues that it is excused from one <i>Williamson County</i> requirement, that it pursue any \"adequate procedure for seeking just compensation\" that state law provides, <i>id.</i> at 195, 105 S.Ct. 3108, under a decision of this court. It argues it is excused from the other <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness requirement, that the relevant government agency has reached a \"final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue,\" <i>id.</i> at 186, 105 S.Ct. 3108, because the state agency has not yet entered a final decision despite Downing's repeated requests that it do so. We affirm the dismissal of the complaint, reaching only the first issue. We hold again that Rhode Island's inverse condemnation procedure satisfies the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements and must be followed. <i>See </i><i>Pascoag Reservoir &amp; Dam, LLC v. Rhode Island,</i> 337 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Standard of Review</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the legal question of whether the district court properly dismissed Downing's complaint as unripe for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). <i>Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> 285 F.3d 142, 144 (1st Cir.2002). We accept the well-pled factual allegations in the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <i>Id.</i> In resolving a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, we may also consider other materials in the district court record, including where those materials contradict the allegations in the complaint. <i>Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement,</i> 510 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Gonzalez v. United States,</i> 284 F.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Factual Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Facts as Alleged in the Complaint</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 1992, Downing secured a land use permit, called an Assent, from the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), in order to develop a residential community on a tract of land it owns in Narragansett. Between 1992 and 2007 Downing built homes on twenty-six of the planned seventy-nine lots in the subdivision, installed community infrastructure such as roads and a sewer line, and began infrastructure improvements necessary to build on the remaining lots. While Downing failed to attach a copy of the Assent to its complaint, Downing alleged that none of the Assent's thirty-four stipulations and conditions required it to perform any archaeological or historical surveys on the tract of land.</p>\n<p>In 2007, a second state agency, the Rhode Island Historic Preservation and Heritage Commission (HPHC) \"became keenly interested in the site of the Salt Pond Residences project from a cultural and archaeological perspective.\" This was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> because many artifacts had been found in the course of the Salt Pond development project indicating that the land was likely a former Narragansett Indian settlement. These artifacts included digging and grinding tools, fragments of ceramic and stone vessels and a pipe, and projectile points. Downing alleges the HPHC then \"concluded that [the land] should be preserved for the benefit of the public at large and not developed at all,\" and encouraged the CRMC to withdraw the project's CRMC Assent. A July 11, 2007 letter from the HPHC Executive Director to the CRMC, Downing alleges, stated that HPHC \"was resolved `to acquire title to the [site] in order to assure its preservation'\" (alteration in Complaint).</p>\n<p>The CRMC sent Downing a letter dated August 22, 2007 stating that the Assent \"is still valid and remains valid pending a determination by the [CRMC] on the issues raised by the Historic Preservation And Heritage Commission\" (alteration in Complaint). In a June 2008 HPHC memorandum,<sup>[1]</sup> Downing alleges, the HPHC confirmed that it had recommended to the CRMC that either construction be prohibited or a \"complete archaeological data recovery\" project be required as a condition of further construction. Downing estimates that such a data recovery project would cost six million dollars.</p>\n<p>Downing alleges that a year after the initial CRMC letter, on August 21, 2008, following a series of informal discussions with the HPHC that did not resolve the dispute, it formally requested that the CRMC submit the matter for hearing. On December 17, 2008 it submitted to the CRMC a legal opinion memorandum and supporting materials from its lawyers arguing that the CRMC and HPHC were violating the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions' takings clauses.</p>\n<p>On February 23, 2009, Downing formally notified the HPHC that it would resume construction under its permits absent some response from the agencies. There is no evidence in the record as to whether further communications took place during the months after this February 23 notice.</p>\n<p>Downing alleges that neither agency ever responded to any of these communications. The defendants deny that they were nonresponsive, asserting to us as they did to the district court that during the two-year period at issue, informal negotiations were ongoing between the parties to try to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>On June 27, 2009, Downing resumed construction. The same day, the CRMC issued a cease-and-desist order. Downing did not place the order into the district court record, and has not described its contents except to claim that the order did not specify how Downing's conduct violated its permits. On July 15, 2009, Downing formally requested a hearing before the CRMC in order to contest the cease-and-desist order. Downing alleges that it had heard no response by the CRMC to this request by August 6, 2009. On this day, Downing says, it then sent a \"final notice\" to the CRMC warning that if the CRMC did not promptly respond, Downing would conclude that its pursuit of administrative remedies was futile and would \"proceed accordingly.\"</p>\n<p>Downing alleges that the CRMC did not respond to this final notice, though Downing did not wait long for it to do so. Less than three weeks later, on August 24, 2009, Downing filed its complaint in federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> court alleging, inter alia,<sup>[2]</sup> that the state, CRMC, and HPHC had taken its property for public purposes without just compensation, and denied it substantive and procedural due process and equal protection under the law. Downing sought damages and prospective injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>On December 30, 2009, the CRMC issued to Downing a notice of hearing on the issues surrounding Downing's Assent. The district court noted in its March 26, 2010 opinion that in February 2010 the parties had \"agreed that the matter would be referred to a CRMC subcommittee for an expedited hearing.\" <i>Downing/Salt Pond Partners, L.P. v. Rhode Island,</i> 698 F.Supp.2d 278, 279 &amp; n. 1 (D.R.I.2010). At oral argument in this court, counsel for Downing explained that this hearing process was ongoing.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Motion to Dismiss in the District Court</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rhode Island moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that Downing had failed to meet either of the <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness requirements for federal Takings Clause claims, and that its other claims were coextensive with the takings claims and should be subject to the same requirements. Downing responded that it was excused from both requirements. As to the requirement that it seek compensation in state court, Downing argued that Rhode Island provided no \"reasonable, certain and adequate\" procedures \"for obtaining compensation.\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (quoting <i>Reg'l Rail Reorg. Act Cases,</i> 419 U.S. 102, 124-25, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This argument was based on language in an opinion in a case under Puerto Rico law that distinguished between \"general remedial cause[s] of action under state law\" and \"procedures specifically designed by the state\" to provide compensation for takings. <i>Asociación De Subscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Responsabilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2007). Downing argued this language overruled an earlier decision of this court, <i>Pascoag,</i> which affirmed a dismissal under <i>Williamson County</i> for failure to use Rhode Island's inverse condemnation procedure. <i>See </i><i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 92-93. Downing also argued that the finality requirement was inapplicable to \"direct or physical takings such as are alleged here,\" and in the alternative that further administrative proceedings would be futile. Downing did not respond to Rhode Island's argument that its non-takings claims should be dismissed along with its takings claims and did not assert that those claims were not also subject to the ripeness constraints.</p>\n<p>The district court, in a thoughtful and well-reasoned opinion, granted the motion to dismiss all of Downing's state and federal claims. <i>Downing/Salt Pond Partners, L.P. v. Rhode Island,</i> 698 F.Supp.2d 278 (D.R.I.2010). The court found Downing's argument that it was excused from the state litigation requirement to be foreclosed by binding First Circuit precedent holding that Rhode Island's procedures were available and adequate under the <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness test. <i>Downing,</i> 698 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> F.Supp.2d at 284 (citing <i>Pascoag</i>). The court rejected Downing's argument that <i>Flores Galarza</i> implicitly overruled <i>Pascoag. Id.</i> As to Downing's remaining claims, including its federal due process claims, the court found that \"Downing has merely `[d]ress[ed] a takings claim' in several other costumes,\" and concluded that all of the claims failed on ripeness grounds under <i>Williamson County</i> as well. <i>Id.</i> at 290 (quoting <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 149) (alteration in original). Downing appeals the dismissal of its claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Analysis of the Williamson County Ripeness Prongs</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Takings Claim Ripeness Requirements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In <i>Williamson County,</i> the Supreme Court held that the nature of a federal regulatory takings claim gives rise to two ripeness requirements which plaintiffs bear the burden of proving they have met before a federal court has jurisdiction over a takings claim. <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 186, 105 S.Ct. 3108; <i>García-Rubiera v. Calderón,</i> 570 F.3d 443, 451 (1st Cir.2009) (\"Plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating ripeness.\"). These two requirements arise because \"there is no uncompensated taking,\" and therefore nothing to litigate in federal court, \"until the state has established (a) what it has taken, and (b) its refusal to pay `just compensation.'\" <i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 91 (quoting <i>SGB Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Consol. City of Indianapolis-Marion Cnty., Inc.,</i> 235 F.3d 1036, 1038 (7th Cir.2000)). Downing argues it is exempt from both requirements. We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p>First, a regulatory takings claim is not ripe until the relevant government entity has \"reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 186, 105 S.Ct. 3108. Determining whether regulatory action has resulted in a taking involves a complex inquiry into facts that \"simply cannot be evaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding\" its application of the law to the land in question. <i>Id.</i> at 191, 105 S.Ct. 3108; <i>see also </i><i>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island,</i> 533 U.S. 606, 618, 121 S.Ct. 2448, 150 L.Ed.2d 592 (2001). Generally plaintiffs must complete ordinary administrative processes before the impact of regulatory restrictions can be determined with reasonable certainty. <i>Palazzolo,</i> 533 U.S. at 621, 121 S.Ct. 2448.</p>\n<p>The second ripeness requirement, which is the focus of our analysis, arises because the Fifth Amendment \"does not proscribe the taking of property; it proscribes taking without just compensation.\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108. As a result, \"if a State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 195, 105 S.Ct. 3108. This is sometimes referred to as a \"state litigation\" requirement.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco,</i> 545 U.S. 323, 349, 125 S.Ct. 2491, 162 L.Ed.2d 315 (2005) (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring). Further, the compensation need not be paid in advance or at the time of the taking, as long as there is a procedure in place at the time of the taking that is \"reasonable, certain and adequate ... for obtaining compensation.\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> (quoting <i>Reg'l Rail Reorg. Act Cases,</i> 419 U.S. at 124-25, 95 S.Ct. 335) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <i>Williamson County</i> itself, at the time of the alleged taking an inverse condemnation cause of action was available under state law, and the state courts had permitted its invocation in cases of regulatory takings as well as physical takings. <i>Id.</i> at 196, 105 S.Ct. 3108. Because the plaintiff in <i>Williamson</i> had neither pursued an inverse condemnation proceeding nor shown that it was \"unavailable or inadequate,\" its claim was unripe. <i>Id.</i> at 196-97, 105 S.Ct. 3108.</p>\n<p>Under the <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness rules a plaintiff might be precluded from ever bringing a takings claim in federal court if the substance of the federal claim is litigated in state court. The Supreme Court squarely confronted this situation in <i>San Remo Hotel,</i> in which it acknowledged this implication of <i>Williamson County</i> and refused to create an exception from ordinary preclusion rules and the full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, whenever \"a case is forced into state court by the ripeness rule of <i>Williamson County.</i>\" <i>San Remo Hotel,</i> 545 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 2491. The Court held that there was no absolute \"right to vindicate . . . federal claims in a federal forum . . . . even when the plaintiff would have preferred not to litigate in state court, but was required to do so by statute or prudential rules\" like the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has continued to adhere to the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation rule, despite Chief Justice Rehnquists's concurrence in <i>San Remo Hotel</i> encouraging the Court to reconsider the rule.<sup>[6]</sup> In <i>San Remo Hotel</i> itself, twenty years after <i>Williamson County,</i> the Court expressly refused to soften the effects of the rule on takings plaintiffs' access to the federal courts. <i>See id.</i> at 341-42, 125 S.Ct. 2491. Since <i>San Remo Hotel,</i> the Court has repeatedly denied petitions for a writ of certiorari that asked the Court to abrogate the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation rule.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Agripost, LLC v. Miami-Dade Cnty., Fla.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1668, 173 L.Ed.2d 1035 (2009); Petition for Writ of Certiorari at <i>i, Agripost, LLC,</i> No. 08-567 (Oct. 27, 2008), 2008 WL 4757424; <i>Howard v. City of Marion, Ind.,</i> 547 U.S. 1179, 126 S.Ct. 2358, 165 L.Ed.2d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> 280 (2006); Petition for Writ of Certiorari at <i>i, Howard,</i> No. 05-1274 (Mar. 31, 2006), 2006 WL 895847. <i>Williamson County,</i> then, governs our analysis.</p>\n<p>This court has held, under <i>Williamson County,</i> that a takings claim against the state of Rhode Island was unripe where, as here, the plaintiff had failed to pursue the state's inverse condemnation cause of action. <i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d 87. In <i>Pascoag,</i> the plaintiff owned a lake abutted by state-owned land. In 1964, the state built a public boat ramp jutting into the lake, which the public used as a point of access to the lake until at least 1997, when Pascoag put up a \"NO TRESPASSING\" sign. <i>Id.</i> at 90. Rhode Island won a judgment in the Rhode Island Supreme Court that it had \"acquired by adverse possession a small portion of the Lake bottom (occupied by the boat ramp) and had acquired, on the public's behalf, a prescriptive easement to use the boat ramp to access the entire Lake for recreational purposes.\" <i>Id.</i> Pascoag then brought an inverse condemnation action against Rhode Island in federal court. <i>Id.</i> at 89.</p>\n<p>Without deciding \"whether compensation is due when the state acquires land by adverse possession or prescription,\" <i>id.</i> at 90, this court held that Pascoag had failed to show that Rhode Island state remedies are \"unavailable\" or \"inadequate,\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 196-97, 105 S.Ct. 3108, the \"narrow\" exceptions to the state litigation requirement, <i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 92. Those exceptions, we held, encompass cases where state law \"did not recognize the taking that occurred, or did not permit the relief required to make the plaintiff whole,\" for instance, where state law did not permit an inverse condemnation cause of action for regulatory takings, or where such actions were limited to monetary damages and the plaintiff's damages were not quantifiable. <i>Id.</i> (citing cases). Our opinion in <i>Pascoag</i> concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>Pascoag cannot show that Rhode Island's remedies were inadequate or unavailable. The Rhode Island Constitution prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation and Rhode Island state courts have long allowed recovery through suits for inverse condemnation. Thus, Rhode Island has an adequate process available to address Pascoag's suit for just compensation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 93 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Downing's arguments to the contrary rely on its reading of <i>Flores Galarza,</i> which itself did not purport to overrule the holding in <i>Pascoag.</i><sup>[8]</sup> In <i>Flores Galarza,</i> a divided panel held under Puerto Rico law that an unusual type of takings claim was ripe because the plaintiffs were excused from fulfilling the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements. <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 13-20. The plaintiffs, a group of automobile insurers in Puerto Rico, sued the Puerto Rico Secretary of the Treasury for withholding from the insurers insurance premiums generated by Puerto Rico's new compulsory liability insurance program. <i>Id.</i> at 6. Under the statutory scheme, the Commonwealth was to transfer to the insurers insurance premiums paid when drivers renewed their licenses, but the Commonwealth temporarily stopped doing so as a result of its own cash-flow problems. <i>Id.</i> at 8-9. The insurers sought compensation for this temporary taking, including for the foregone interest on the premiums and the amounts they were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> forced to pay from their own funds for reimbursements to drivers that were intended to be paid from the amounts retained by the Commonwealth. <i>Id.</i> at 11. They also sought compensation for the permanent taking they alleged resulted from a change in the law that appropriated to the Commonwealth certain reserve funds accumulated under the insurance scheme. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The majority opinion reasoned that the withholding of funds amounted to a physical taking, not a regulatory one, <i>id.</i> at 15, and that because it involved \"the direct appropriation of funds,\" the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements were wholly inapplicable, <i>id.</i> at 19. The majority nonetheless discussed the nature of the state litigation requirement, in language that Downing reads as reframing the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation requirement:</p>\n<blockquote>The key component of this prong of <i>Williamson County</i> is the availability of a [state] process that is <i>particularly aimed</i> at providing compensation when government action effects a taking. In our view, such procedures do not include litigation of a state takings claim or any general remedial cause of action under state law. Rather, the Supreme Court must have had in mind only those procedures specifically designed by the state to avoid constitutional injury in the first instance by providing a means for a plaintiff to obtain compensation for the government's taking of property.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 16-17 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Downing relies on this language to argue that if this is the standard, then <i>Pascoag</i> must be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>Downing also relies on other language in the majority opinion that attempts to contrast inverse condemnation proceedings with \"any generally available state procedure that might provide a remedy for an uncompensated taking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17. The majority concluded that if only the latter was available, a plaintiff need not pursue it to satisfy <i>Williamson County.</i><sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 17. This purported distinction was driven in part by reliance on the concerns in Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurrence in <i>San Remo Hotel</i> and the panel majority's consideration that the full Supreme Court might respond to those concerns by narrowing or overruling the state litigation requirement in the near future. <i>See id.</i> at 17-18. As we have said, the Supreme Court has since refused to alter the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation requirement, and so that basis has disappeared.</p>\n<p>One judge concurred in the judgment, disagreeing strongly with the majority's conclusion and analysis on the state litigation rule. The concurring opinion argued, \"There is no support in Supreme Court precedent for the conclusion that claimants are relieved of the litigation requirement unless the state has adopted specific processes. . . through which such compensation may be recovered.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38 (Howard, J., concurring in the judgment). \"It is not enough to show only that the adequacy of state process remains unsure and undeveloped\"; it must be affirmatively shown to be unavailable or inadequate. <i>Id.</i> at 40.</p>\n<p>The majority's analysis was, as the district court in this case recognized, called into question by the en banc court. Three judges (a clear majority of the court's five active judges at the time, four of whom participated in the matter) wrote in a statement accompanying an order denying en banc review, \"It appears to us that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> panel majority decision likely conflicts directly with binding Supreme Court authority and prior decisions in this court, as well as the law in other circuits.\" <i>Id.</i> at 40 (statement accompanying denial of reh'g en banc) (footnotes omitted). The three judges emphasized, as had the concurrence, that plaintiffs must carry \"the burden of demonstrating the absolute lack of. . . a state proceeding\" in which compensation could be available, and that the court's precedent had previously determined that \"such a proceeding and a remedy may very well exist under the Puerto Rico Constitution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 41 (citing <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 146-47). Nonetheless, the court denied rehearing en banc because the case had arisen on interlocutory appeal and error correction would be available if necessary on appeal from final judgment. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, the statement concluded, to the extent the majority opinion had reached a result contrary to Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent, it was without authority to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 40. As we explain below, we too now reject application of the language and reasoning in the <i>Flores Galarza</i> majority opinion that purportedly reworked the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation test as contrary to Supreme Court and circuit precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Downing Is Not Excused from Meeting the State Litigation Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Downing acknowledges that it never initiated an inverse condemnation proceeding in Rhode Island state court, but went instead directly to federal court. Downing argues that it was excused from <i>Williamson County</i>'s state litigation requirement because Rhode Island's state law remedies are \"unavailable\" or \"inadequate.\" <i>See </i><i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 196-97, 105 S.Ct. 3108; <i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 92. But we concluded in <i>Pascoag</i> that the Rhode Island courts \"have long allowed recovery through suits for inverse condemnation. Thus, Rhode Island has an adequate process available\" to takings plaintiffs, and plaintiffs must resort to it before their federal takings claims will ripen. <i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 93. As the district court aptly stated, <i>Pascoag</i> \"looks like a trapdoor straight to state court for Downing.\" <i>Downing,</i> 698 F.Supp.2d at 282.</p>\n<p>Downing has two arguments in reply. First, it argues that <i>Flores Galarza</i> overruled <i>Pascoag</i> as to Rhode Island's inverse condemnation cause of action and set forth a higher standard for state remedies that Rhode Island's inverse condemnation cause of action does not meet. Second, it argues that all the <i>Pascoag</i> court held was that the plaintiff <i>in that case</i> had not proven the inadequacy or unavailability of the Rhode Island inverse condemnation procedure, and that the state procedure suffers from defects not considered in <i>Pascoag</i> that make it not a \"reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation.\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (quoting <i>Reg'l Rail Reorg. Act Cases,</i> 419 U.S. at 124-25, 95 S.Ct. 335) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>We Reject Downing's Arguments that We May Alter the Williamson County Test Based on Flores Galarza</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn first to Downing's arguments relating to <i>Flores Galarza.</i> Downing argues that Rhode Island's inverse condemnation proceeding falls on the wrong side of the line drawn in <i>Flores Galarza</i> between \"a process that is particularly aimed,\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 16, at compensating property owners to prevent constitutional injury and a \"general remedial cause of action\" such as a state takings claim that provides damages for a constitutional injury, <i>id.</i> at 17. Downing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> argues that because in <i>Annicelli v. Town of South Kingstown,</i> 463 A.2d 133 (R.I. 1983), the case in which the Rhode Island Supreme Court recognized an inverse condemnation cause of action for regulatory takings, the state court \"did not develop any particularized procedure for obtaining compensation for a taking,\" as Downing puts it, the cause of action is insufficient under the rule in <i>Flores Galarza.</i> Downing argues that it would be bound to bring a state inverse condemnation claim only if the Rhode Island Supreme Court or legislature had crafted an inverse condemnation scheme as \"particularly aimed,\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 16, and as detailed as the statutory compensation schemes the state has legislatively created for wetland owners denied permission to alter their land, R.I. Gen. Laws § 2-1-21(b), and property owners whose land the state takes for public use through condemnation, <i>see, e.g.,</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-64-9 (land condemned by state Economic Development Corporation).</p>\n<p>Downing's argument depends on the proposition that <i>Flores Galarza</i> narrowed <i>Williamson County</i> generally by heightening the standard for adequate state procedures. If that proposition were correct, Downing might have an argument. But <i>Flores Galarza</i> could not overrule prior circuit law. <i>See </i><i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 93; <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 147; <i>Gilbert v. City of Cambridge,</i> 932 F.2d 51, 65 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding plaintiffs had not satisfied burden of proving Massachusetts inverse condemnation proceeding could not apply to the type of taking they alleged).<sup>[10]</sup> Nor could the panel majority revise a test created by the Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 195-97, 105 S.Ct. 3108. The en banc statement of this court made that point, and we elaborate.</p>\n<p>To the extent that language in the <i>Flores Galarza</i> majority opinion can be read to say the plaintiffs do not bear the burden of proving the inadequacy or unavailability of state procedures for seeking compensation, that language cannot be squared with either Supreme Court or First Circuit precedent. The <i>Flores Galarza</i> majority expressly refused to \"requir[e] plaintiffs to invoke any generally available state procedure that <i>might</i> provide a remedy for an uncompensated taking.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 17 (emphasis added). But in <i>Williamson County</i> the Supreme Court clearly placed the burden of proving the inadequacy of state law remedies on the plaintiff. <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 197, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (finding that plaintiff \"has not shown that the [state's] inverse condemnation procedure is unavailable or inadequate. . . .\").</p>\n<p>In the First Circuit, \"It is well settled that the burden of demonstrating the absolute lack of [an adequate] state proceeding is on the plaintiff.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 41 (statement accompanying denial of reh'g en banc) (citing <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 146); <i>see also </i><i>Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright,</i> 548 F.3d 155, 165 (1st Cir.2008). Even where \"the most that can be said is that it remains unclear whether the inverse condemnation remedy applies\" to the type of taking alleged by the plaintiff, the state litigation requirement is not excused. <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 147; <i>see also </i><i>Gilbert,</i> 932 F.2d at 65; <i>Culebras Enters. Corp. v. Rivera Rios,</i> 813 F.2d 506, 514-15 (1st Cir.1987). To be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> excused, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the state law \"expressly precludes use of the inverse condemnation remedy\" in the plaintiff's case. <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 147. We have relied on this allocation of the burden of proof since <i>Flores Galarza</i> as well. <i>See </i><i>García-Rubiera,</i> 570 F.3d at 451.</p>\n<p>Our sister circuits agree that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the absolute unavailability or inadequacy of potential state remedies in order to be excused from the state litigation requirement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Island Park, LLC v. CSX Transp.,</i> 559 F.3d 96, 109 (2d Cir.2009) (plaintiff must pursue even unsure and undeveloped possibilities for relief); <i>Rockstead v. City of Crystal Lake,</i> 486 F.3d 963, 965-66 (7th Cir.2007) (plaintiff must challenge out-of-date state common law precedent denying validity of particular type of inverse condemnation claim); <i>Urban Developers LLC v. City of Jackson, Miss.,</i> 468 F.3d 281, 295 (5th Cir.2006); <i>Austin v. City &amp; Cnty. of Honolulu,</i> 840 F.2d 678, 680 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p>Other language in <i>Flores Galarza,</i> if read a certain way, would also conflict with Supreme Court precedent. The majority held that a plaintiff is excused from the state litigation requirement if the only remedy available under state law is a general state takings claim. <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 17-18. But the Supreme Court in <i>San Remo Hotel,</i> decided two years before <i>Flores Galarza,</i> abrogated a Second Circuit case holding \"that parties `who litigate <i>state-law</i> takings claims in state court <i>involuntarily</i>' pursuant to <i>Williamson County</i> cannot be precluded from having those claims resolved `by a federal court,'\" <i>San Remo Hotel,</i> 545 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 2491 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Santini v. Connecticut Hazardous Waste Mgmt. Serv.,</i> 342 F.3d 118, 130 (2d Cir.2003)). The Court thereby expressly recognized that to satisfy the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation requirement, plaintiffs must bring state taking claims in state court where they are available.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, other circuits to face the question have held that plaintiffs must pursue claims under the takings clause of a state constitution even when there is no judicial or legislative inverse condemnation procedure already definitively established. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Island Park,</i> 559 F.3d at 110 (Second Circuit); <i>Bickerstaff Clay Prods. Co., Inc. v. Harris Cnty., Ga.,</i> 89 F.3d 1481, 1491 (11th Cir.1996) (plaintiff must bring suit under eminent domain provision of Georgia Constitution to determine whether state law compensates temporary takings); <i>Bateman v. City of West Bountiful,</i> 89 F.3d 704, 708-09 (10th Cir.1996); <i>Austin,</i> 840 F.2d at 681 (Ninth Circuit); <i>cf. </i><i>Peters v. Vill. of Clifton,</i> 498 F.3d 727, 733-34 &amp; n. 6 (7th Cir.2007) (finding Illinois courts had developed adequate remedy, but adding that in other circuits where the issue was raised, courts have found adequate the \"self-executing [takings] provision of a state's constitution\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Downing's Other Attacks on Pascoag Also Fail</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Downing also argues that the holding in <i>Pascoag,</i> that Rhode Island has made available an adequate state-law remedy that plaintiffs must pursue before their federal takings claims will ripen, has no binding force in its case, even if <i>Pascoag</i> is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> binding precedent. However, the main thrust of even these arguments is that <i>Pascoag</i> insufficiently considered whether Rhode Island's inverse condemnation proceedings met the adequacy standards <i>set forth</i> in <i>Flores Galarza,</i> and so the arguments are disposed of under our rejection of a reading of <i>Flores Galarza</i> as narrowing the state litigation requirement.</p>\n<p>Downing also attempts to distinguish its case from <i>Pascoag</i> on the facts, arguing that <i>Pascoag</i> is inapposite because it involved a different type of alleged taking, arising from the state's acquisition of the plaintiff's land by adverse possession and prescriptive easement, rather than from the actions of state regulatory agencies as in Downing's case. The specific mechanism of the alleged taking had no bearing on our consideration of the <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness requirements in <i>Pascoag. See </i><i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 90. Because Downing bears the absolute burden of proving Rhode Island's inverse condemnation proceeding is unavailable or inadequate in its particular case, it is insufficient to argue only that the alleged taking in its case is different from the alleged taking in <i>Pascoag.</i></p>\n<p>Downing further argues that deficiencies in the remedies available to it in state court render those remedies inadequate under <i>Williamson County.</i> Rhode Island, Downing argues, has no statute comparable to federal statutes permitting recovery of attorneys' fees or pre-judgment statutory interest on awarded compensation. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (interest); 42 U.S.C. § 1988(a) (fees); <i>Andrade v. State,</i> 448 A.2d 1293, 1295 (R.I.1982) (holding Rhode Island did not waive sovereign immunity as to pre-judgment interest). Exact equivalence of damages is not required; just compensation is. <i>Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 514 (holding that potential differences between Puerto Rico and federal remedies did not render potential Puerto Rico inverse condemnation remedy inadequate, \"[s]o long as just compensation is provided\").</p>\n<p>Finally, Downing argues that because Rhode Island has not statutorily waived sovereign immunity for inverse condemnation claims as it has for statutory condemnation procedures, the remedy is uncertain. This allegation cannot satisfy Downing's burden to show absolute unavailability in light of the Rhode Island Supreme Court's decisions repeatedly reaching the merits in inverse condemnation cases. <i>See </i><i>Palazzolo,</i> 533 U.S. at 611, 616, 121 S.Ct. 2448 (reviewing, and partially reversing, Rhode Island Supreme Court's decision that CRMC's denial of a plaintiff's development permit did not constitute a regulatory taking); <i>Woodland Manor III Assocs. v. Keeney,</i> 713 A.2d 806, 811-12, 814 (R.I.1998) (remanding for trial on plaintiff's claim of temporary regulatory taking); <i>Annicelli,</i> 463 A.2d at 141 (remanding for determination of property's fair market value for purposes of compensation).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>Remaining Arguments</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because Downing must show it has fulfilled or is excused from both prongs of the <i>Williamson</i> ripeness requirements, and we have found that Downing has failed to make this showing as to the state litigation requirement, we need not address the other prong, the finality requirement.</p>\n<p>As to Downing's other federal claims, Downing argues strenuously in its reply brief that it has not waived its due process claims, because it has argued that the entire district court decision was erroneous. Downing's opening brief makes frequent passing reference to Downing's due process claims, but provides no argument explaining why those claims should survive in federal court even if its takings claims are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> found to be unripe, the issue of primary relevance as to these claims at this stage in the proceedings. Nor did Downing make any such argument in the district court. The argument is doubly waived. <i>Cortes-Rivera v. Dep't of Corr. &amp; Rehab.,</i> 626 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.2010) (\"We decline to address the issue both because it was neither preserved nor adequately presented in the district court and because it is not adequately presented on appeal.\"); <i>id.</i> at 26 (holding that an argument raised in a perfunctory manner is deemed waived).</p>\n<p>We decline to address the issues raised for the first time by amicus in its brief, which argues that <i>Williamson County</i>'s ripeness rules apply only to Takings Clause claims, leaving plaintiffs free to pursue in federal court Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause claims that arise from the same allegedly illegal state conduct. \"[A]mici may not make up for waiver by a party,\" <i>Family Winemakers of Cal. v. Jenkins,</i> 592 F.3d 1, 17 n. 23 (1st Cir.2010), and may not introduce a new argument into a case, <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon,</i> 249 F.3d 66, 74 n. 5 (1st Cir.1996). We note only that we have previously held that a plaintiff cannot, merely by recasting its takings claim \"in the raiment of a due process violation,\" evade the <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness requirements. <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 149.</p>\n<p>While the two agencies strenuously deny that they have been unresponsive or have unreasonably delayed their decisions on Downing's project, we express the hope that the parties will promptly attempt to resolve any remaining disagreements.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Complaint does not state whether the memorandum was addressed to the CRMC or to Downing.</p>\n<p>[2]  Downing also alleged under federal law that the agencies had conspired to violate Downing's civil rights. Under Rhode Island law, Downing also alleged that the agencies had intentionally interfered with its advantageous business relations.</p>\n<p>[3]  According to Downing's counsel, the CRMC subcommittee had conducted four or five hearings over several months. That stage of the process had concluded. The parties had still to submit closing written submissions, after which the subcommittee would make a recommendation to the full CRMC.</p>\n<p>[4]  In adopting this \"state litigation\" terminology we do not mean to suggest that the requirement would not encompass a non-judicial state procedure that was otherwise adequate and available under <i>Williamson County.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  As a practical matter, the Court emphasized, because the finality requirement was actually \"settled well before <i>Williamson County,</i>\" regulatory takings were already rarely litigated in federal court. <i>San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco,</i> 545 U.S. 323, 346-47, 125 S.Ct. 2491, 162 L.Ed.2d 315 (2005). This was not concerning: \"State courts are fully competent to adjudicate constitutional challenges to local land-use decisions\" and \"undoubtedly have more experience than federal courts do in resolving the complex factual, technical, and legal questions\" they raise. <i>Id.</i> at 347, 125 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n<p>[6]  Chief Justice Rehnquist explained that since joining the <i>Williamson County</i> majority, he had come to think that \"the justifications for [the] state-litigation requirement are suspect, while its impact on takings plaintiffs is dramatic\" in that they are often entirely precluded from a federal forum for their federal takings claims. <i>Id.</i> at 352, 125 S.Ct. 2491. He acknowledged that no party or court had addressed the requirement's validity in <i>San Remo Hotel,</i> but he invited the Court to reconsider in an appropriate case in the future. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[7]  <i>See also </i><i>Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Fla. Dept. of Envtl. Prot.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2592, 2618, 177 L.Ed.2d 184 (2010) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (recognizing that \"[u]ntil <i>Williamson County</i> is reconsidered, litigants will have to press most of their judicial takings claims before state courts, which are `presumptively competent . . . to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the United States'\" (quoting <i>Tafflin v. Levitt,</i> 493 U.S. 455, 458, 110 S.Ct. 792, 107 L.Ed.2d 887 (1990))).</p>\n<p>[8]  The majority did cite <i>Pascoag</i> for the proposition that the finality requirement does not apply to physical takings claims, but otherwise did not discuss <i>Pascoag. See </i><i>Asociación De Subscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Responsabilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[9]  As we explain below, Downing argues that Rhode Island's judicially created inverse condemnation cause of action is actually, under the framework of <i>Flores Galarza,</i> merely a \"generally available state procedure\" rather than one \"particularly aimed\" at addressing its specific type of claim. <i>See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 16-17.</p>\n<p>[10]  The plaintiffs in <i>Gilbert</i> petitioned for a writ of certiorari, asking the Supreme Court to reconsider the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation rule. <i>See</i> Opposition to Petition for Writ of Certiorari at <i>i, Gilbert v. City of Cambridge,</i> No. 91-209 (U.S. Aug. 30, 1991), 1991 WL 11178604. The Supreme Court denied the petition. <i>Gilbert v. City of Cambridge,</i> 502 U.S. 866, 112 S.Ct. 192, 116 L.Ed.2d 153 (1991).</p>\n<p>[11]  There is also reason to think that, despite its broad language, <i>Flores Galarza</i> did not intend to alter the rule in <i>Pascoag.</i> The <i>Flores Galarza</i> majority repeatedly referred to inverse condemnation proceedings, whether created by statute or judicial recognition, as being appropriate state procedures under <i>Williamson County.

Between 1992 and 2007 Downing built homes on twenty-six of the planned seventy-nine lots in the subdivision, installed community infrastructure such as roads and a sewer line, and began infrastructure improvements necessary to build on the remaining lots. While Downing failed to attach a copy of the Assent to its complaint, Downing alleged that none of the Assent's thirty-four stipulations and conditions required it to perform any archaeological or historical surveys on the tract of land.</p>\n<p>In 2007, a second state agency, the Rhode Island Historic Preservation and Heritage Commission (HPHC) \"became keenly interested in the site of the Salt Pond Residences project from a cultural and archaeological perspective.\" This was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> because many artifacts had been found in the course of the Salt Pond development project indicating that the land was likely a former Narragansett Indian settlement. These artifacts included digging and grinding tools, fragments of ceramic and stone vessels and a pipe, and projectile points. Downing alleges the HPHC then \"concluded that [the land] should be preserved for the benefit of the public at large and not developed at all,\" and encouraged the CRMC to withdraw the project's CRMC Assent. A July 11, 2007 letter from the HPHC Executive Director to the CRMC, Downing alleges, stated that HPHC \"was resolved `to acquire title to the [site] in order to assure its preservation'\" (alteration in Complaint).</p>\n<p>The CRMC sent Downing a letter dated August 22, 2007 stating that the Assent \"is still valid and remains valid pending a determination by the [CRMC] on the issues raised by the Historic Preservation And Heritage Commission\" (alteration in Complaint). In a June 2008 HPHC memorandum,<sup>[1]</sup> Downing alleges, the HPHC confirmed that it had recommended to the CRMC that either construction be prohibited or a \"complete archaeological data recovery\" project be required as a condition of further construction. Downing estimates that such a data recovery project would cost six million dollars.</p>\n<p>Downing alleges that a year after the initial CRMC letter, on August 21, 2008, following a series of informal discussions with the HPHC that did not resolve the dispute, it formally requested that the CRMC submit the matter for hearing. On December 17, 2008 it submitted to the CRMC a legal opinion memorandum and supporting materials from its lawyers arguing that the CRMC and HPHC were violating the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions' takings clauses.</p>\n<p>On February 23, 2009, Downing formally notified the HPHC that it would resume construction under its permits absent some response from the agencies. There is no evidence in the record as to whether further communications took place during the months after this February 23 notice.</p>\n<p>Downing alleges that neither agency ever responded to any of these communications. The defendants deny that they were nonresponsive, asserting to us as they did to the district court that during the two-year period at issue, informal negotiations were ongoing between the parties to try to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>On June 27, 2009, Downing resumed construction. The same day, the CRMC issued a cease-and-desist order. Downing did not place the order into the district court record, and has not described its contents except to claim that the order did not specify how Downing's conduct violated its permits. On July 15, 2009, Downing formally requested a hearing before the CRMC in order to contest the cease-and-desist order. Downing alleges that it had heard no response by the CRMC to this request by August 6, 2009. On this day, Downing says, it then sent a \"final notice\" to the CRMC warning that if the CRMC did not promptly respond, Downing would conclude that its pursuit of administrative remedies was futile and would \"proceed accordingly.\"</p>\n<p>Downing alleges that the CRMC did not respond to this final notice, though Downing did not wait long for it to do so. Less than three weeks later, on August 24, 2009, Downing filed its complaint in federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> court alleging, inter alia,<sup>[2]</sup> that the state, CRMC, and HPHC had taken its property for public purposes without just compensation, and denied it substantive and procedural due process and equal protection under the law. Downing sought damages and prospective injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>On December 30, 2009, the CRMC issued to Downing a notice of hearing on the issues surrounding Downing's Assent. The district court noted in its March 26, 2010 opinion that in February 2010 the parties had \"agreed that the matter would be referred to a CRMC subcommittee for an expedited hearing.\" <i>Downing/Salt Pond Partners, L.P. v.

At oral argument in this court, counsel for Downing explained that this hearing process was ongoing.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Motion to Dismiss in the District Court</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rhode Island moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that Downing had failed to meet either of the <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness requirements for federal Takings Clause claims, and that its other claims were coextensive with the takings claims and should be subject to the same requirements. Downing responded that it was excused from both requirements. As to the requirement that it seek compensation in state court, Downing argued that Rhode Island provided no \"reasonable, certain and adequate\" procedures \"for obtaining compensation.\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Downing argued this language overruled an earlier decision of this court, <i>Pascoag,</i> which affirmed a dismissal under <i>Williamson County</i> for failure to use Rhode Island's inverse condemnation procedure. <i>See </i><i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 92-93. Downing also argued that the finality requirement was inapplicable to \"direct or physical takings such as are alleged here,\" and in the alternative that further administrative proceedings would be futile. Downing did not respond to Rhode Island's argument that its non-takings claims should be dismissed along with its takings claims and did not assert that those claims were not also subject to the ripeness constraints.</p>\n<p>The district court, in a thoughtful and well-reasoned opinion, granted the motion to dismiss all of Downing's state and federal claims. <i>Downing/Salt Pond Partners, L.P. v.

The court found Downing's argument that it was excused from the state litigation requirement to be foreclosed by binding First Circuit precedent holding that Rhode Island's procedures were available and adequate under the <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness test. <i>Downing,</i> 698 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> F.Supp.2d at 284 (citing <i>Pascoag</i>). The court rejected Downing's argument that <i>Flores Galarza</i> implicitly overruled <i>Pascoag. Id.</i> As to Downing's remaining claims, including its federal due process claims, the court found that \"Downing has merely `[d]ress[ed] a takings claim' in several other costumes,\" and concluded that all of the claims failed on ripeness grounds under <i>Williamson County</i> as well. <i>Id.</i> at 290 (quoting <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 149) (alteration in original).

In <i>Pascoag,</i> the plaintiff owned a lake abutted by state-owned land. In 1964, the state built a public boat ramp jutting into the lake, which the public used as a point of access to the lake until at least 1997, when Pascoag put up a \"NO TRESPASSING\" sign. <i>Id.</i> at 90. Rhode Island won a judgment in the Rhode Island Supreme Court that it had \"acquired by adverse possession a small portion of the Lake bottom (occupied by the boat ramp) and had acquired, on the public's behalf, a prescriptive easement to use the boat ramp to access the entire Lake for recreational purposes.\" <i>Id.</i> Pascoag then brought an inverse condemnation action against Rhode Island in federal court. <i>Id.</i> at 89.</p>\n<p>Without deciding \"whether compensation is due when the state acquires land by adverse possession or prescription,\" <i>id.</i> at 90, this court held that Pascoag had failed to show that Rhode Island state remedies are \"unavailable\" or \"inadequate,\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 196-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3108</span></a></span>, the \"narrow\" exceptions to the state litigation requirement, <i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 92. Those exceptions, we held, encompass cases where state law \"did not recognize the taking that occurred, or did not permit the relief required to make the plaintiff whole,\" for instance, where state law did not permit an inverse condemnation cause of action for regulatory takings, or where such actions were limited to monetary damages and the plaintiff's damages were not quantifiable. <i>Id.</i> (citing cases). Our opinion in <i>Pascoag</i> concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>Pascoag cannot show that Rhode Island's remedies were inadequate or unavailable. The Rhode Island Constitution prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation and Rhode Island state courts have long allowed recovery through suits for inverse condemnation. Thus, Rhode Island has an adequate process available to address Pascoag's suit for just compensation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 93 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Downing's arguments to the contrary rely on its reading of <i>Flores Galarza,</i> which itself did not purport to overrule the holding in <i>Pascoag.</i><sup>[8]</sup> In <i>Flores Galarza,</i> a divided panel held under Puerto Rico law that an unusual type of takings claim was ripe because the plaintiffs were excused from fulfilling the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements. <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 13-20. The plaintiffs, a group of automobile insurers in Puerto Rico, sued the Puerto Rico Secretary of the Treasury for withholding from the insurers insurance premiums generated by Puerto Rico's new compulsory liability insurance program. <i>Id.</i> at 6. Under the statutory scheme, the Commonwealth was to transfer to the insurers insurance premiums paid when drivers renewed their licenses, but the Commonwealth temporarily stopped doing so as a result of its own cash-flow problems. <i>Id.</i> at 8-9. The insurers sought compensation for this temporary taking, including for the foregone interest on the premiums and the amounts they were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> forced to pay from their own funds for reimbursements to drivers that were intended to be paid from the amounts retained by the Commonwealth. <i>Id.</i> at 11. They also sought compensation for the permanent taking they alleged resulted from a change in the law that appropriated to the Commonwealth certain reserve funds accumulated under the insurance scheme. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The majority opinion reasoned that the withholding of funds amounted to a physical taking, not a regulatory one, <i>id.</i> at 15, and that because it involved \"the direct appropriation of funds,\" the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements were wholly inapplicable, <i>id.</i> at 19. The majority nonetheless discussed the nature of the state litigation requirement, in language that Downing reads as reframing the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation requirement:</p>\n<blockquote>The key component of this prong of <i>Williamson County</i> is the availability of a [state] process that is <i>particularly aimed</i> at providing compensation when government action effects a taking. In our view, such procedures do not include litigation of a state takings claim or any general remedial cause of action under state law. Rather, the Supreme Court must have had in mind only those procedures specifically designed by the state to avoid constitutional injury in the first instance by providing a means for a plaintiff to obtain compensation for the government's taking of property.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 16-17 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Downing relies on this language to argue that if this is the standard, then <i>Pascoag</i> must be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>Downing also relies on other language in the majority opinion that attempts to contrast inverse condemnation proceedings with \"any generally available state procedure that might provide a remedy for an uncompensated taking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17. The majority concluded that if only the latter was available, a plaintiff need not pursue it to satisfy <i>Williamson County.</i><sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 17. This purported distinction was driven in part by reliance on the concerns in Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurrence in <i>San Remo Hotel</i> and the panel majority's consideration that the full Supreme Court might respond to those concerns by narrowing or overruling the state litigation requirement in the near future. <i>See id.</i> at 17-18. As we have said, the Supreme Court has since refused to alter the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation requirement, and so that basis has disappeared.</p>\n<p>One judge concurred in the judgment, disagreeing strongly with the majority's conclusion and analysis on the state litigation rule. The concurring opinion argued, \"There is no support in Supreme Court precedent for the conclusion that claimants are relieved of the litigation requirement unless the state has adopted specific processes. . . through which such compensation may be recovered.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38 (Howard, J., concurring in the judgment). \"It is not enough to show only that the adequacy of state process remains unsure and undeveloped\"; it must be affirmatively shown to be unavailable or inadequate. <i>Id.</i> at 40.</p>\n<p>The majority's analysis was, as the district court in this case recognized, called into question by the en banc court. Three judges (a clear majority of the court's five active judges at the time, four of whom participated in the matter) wrote in a statement accompanying an order denying en banc review, \"It appears to us that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> panel majority decision likely conflicts directly with binding Supreme Court authority and prior decisions in this court, as well as the law in other circuits.\" <i>Id.</i> at 40 (statement accompanying denial of reh'g en banc) (footnotes omitted). The three judges emphasized, as had the concurrence, that plaintiffs must carry \"the burden of demonstrating the absolute lack of. . . a state proceeding\" in which compensation could be available, and that the court's precedent had previously determined that \"such a proceeding and a remedy may very well exist under the Puerto Rico Constitution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 41 (citing <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 146-47). Nonetheless, the court denied rehearing en banc because the case had arisen on interlocutory appeal and error correction would be available if necessary on appeal from final judgment. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, the statement concluded, to the extent the majority opinion had reached a result contrary to Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent, it was without authority to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 40. As we explain below, we too now reject application of the language and reasoning in the <i>Flores Galarza</i> majority opinion that purportedly reworked the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation test as contrary to Supreme Court and circuit precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Downing Is Not Excused from Meeting the State Litigation Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Downing acknowledges that it never initiated an inverse condemnation proceeding in Rhode Island state court, but went instead directly to federal court. Downing argues that it was excused from <i>Williamson County</i>'s state litigation requirement because Rhode Island's state law remedies are \"unavailable\" or \"inadequate.\" <i>See </i><i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 196-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But we concluded in <i>Pascoag</i> that the Rhode Island courts \"have long allowed recovery through suits for inverse condemnation. Thus, Rhode Island has an adequate process available\" to takings plaintiffs, and plaintiffs must resort to it before their federal takings claims will ripen. <i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 93. As the district court aptly stated, <i>Pascoag</i> \"looks like a trapdoor straight to state court for Downing.\" <i>Downing,</i> 698 F.Supp.2d at 282.</p>\n<p>Downing has two arguments in reply. First, it argues that <i>Flores Galarza</i> overruled <i>Pascoag</i> as to Rhode Island's inverse condemnation cause of action and set forth a higher standard for state remedies that Rhode Island's inverse condemnation cause of action does not meet. Second, it argues that all the <i>Pascoag</i> court held was that the plaintiff <i>in that case</i> had not proven the inadequacy or unavailability of the Rhode Island inverse condemnation procedure, and that the state procedure suffers from defects not considered in <i>Pascoag</i> that make it not a \"reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation.\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Downing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> argues that because in <i>Annicelli v. Town of South Kingstown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2372594\"><a href=\"/opinion/2372594/annicelli-v-town-of-south-kingstown/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span> (R.I. 1983), the case in which the Rhode Island Supreme Court recognized an inverse condemnation cause of action for regulatory takings, the state court \"did not develop any particularized procedure for obtaining compensation for a taking,\" as Downing puts it, the cause of action is insufficient under the rule in <i>Flores Galarza.</i> Downing argues that it would be bound to bring a state inverse condemnation claim only if the Rhode Island Supreme Court or legislature had crafted an inverse condemnation scheme as \"particularly aimed,\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 16, and as detailed as the statutory compensation schemes the state has legislatively created for wetland owners denied permission to alter their land, R.I. Gen. Laws § 2-1-21(b), and property owners whose land the state takes for public use through condemnation, <i>see, e.g.,</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-64-9 (land condemned by state Economic Development Corporation).</p>\n<p>Downing's argument depends on the proposition that <i>Flores Galarza</i> narrowed <i>Williamson County</i> generally by heightening the standard for adequate state procedures. If that proposition were correct, Downing might have an argument. But <i>Flores Galarza</i> could not overrule prior circuit law. <i>See </i><i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 93; <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 147; <i>Gilbert v.

The en banc statement of this court made that point, and we elaborate.</p>\n<p>To the extent that language in the <i>Flores Galarza</i> majority opinion can be read to say the plaintiffs do not bear the burden of proving the inadequacy or unavailability of state procedures for seeking compensation, that language cannot be squared with either Supreme Court or First Circuit precedent. The <i>Flores Galarza</i> majority expressly refused to \"requir[e] plaintiffs to invoke any generally available state procedure that <i>might</i> provide a remedy for an uncompensated taking.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 17 (emphasis added). But in <i>Williamson County</i> the Supreme Court clearly placed the burden of proving the inadequacy of state law remedies on the plaintiff. <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 197, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Even where \"the most that can be said is that it remains unclear whether the inverse condemnation remedy applies\" to the type of taking alleged by the plaintiff, the state litigation requirement is not excused. <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 147; <i>see also </i><i>Gilbert,</i> 932 F.2d at 65; <i>Culebras Enters.

To be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> excused, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the state law \"expressly precludes use of the inverse condemnation remedy\" in the plaintiff's case. <i>Deniz,</i> 285 F.3d at 147. We have relied on this allocation of the burden of proof since <i>Flores Galarza</i> as well. <i>See </i><i>García-Rubiera,</i> 570 F.3d at 451.</p>\n<p>Our sister circuits agree that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the absolute unavailability or inadequacy of potential state remedies in order to be excused from the state litigation requirement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Island Park, LLC v.

The majority held that a plaintiff is excused from the state litigation requirement if the only remedy available under state law is a general state takings claim. <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 17-18. But the Supreme Court in <i>San Remo Hotel,</i> decided two years before <i>Flores Galarza,</i> abrogated a Second Circuit case holding \"that parties `who litigate <i>state-law</i> takings claims in state court <i>involuntarily</i>' pursuant to <i>Williamson County</i> cannot be precluded from having those claims resolved `by a federal court,'\" <i>San Remo Hotel,</i> 545 U.S. at 342, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799978\"><a href=\"/opinion/799978/san-remo-hotel-lp-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court thereby expressly recognized that to satisfy the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation requirement, plaintiffs must bring state taking claims in state court where they are available.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, other circuits to face the question have held that plaintiffs must pursue claims under the takings clause of a state constitution even when there is no judicial or legislative inverse condemnation procedure already definitively established. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Island Park,</i> 559 F.3d at 110 (Second Circuit); <i>Bickerstaff Clay Prods.

However, the main thrust of even these arguments is that <i>Pascoag</i> insufficiently considered whether Rhode Island's inverse condemnation proceedings met the adequacy standards <i>set forth</i> in <i>Flores Galarza,</i> and so the arguments are disposed of under our rejection of a reading of <i>Flores Galarza</i> as narrowing the state litigation requirement.</p>\n<p>Downing also attempts to distinguish its case from <i>Pascoag</i> on the facts, arguing that <i>Pascoag</i> is inapposite because it involved a different type of alleged taking, arising from the state's acquisition of the plaintiff's land by adverse possession and prescriptive easement, rather than from the actions of state regulatory agencies as in Downing's case. The specific mechanism of the alleged taking had no bearing on our consideration of the <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness requirements in <i>Pascoag. See </i><i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 90. Because Downing bears the absolute burden of proving Rhode Island's inverse condemnation proceeding is unavailable or inadequate in its particular case, it is insufficient to argue only that the alleged taking in its case is different from the alleged taking in <i>Pascoag.</i></p>\n<p>Downing further argues that deficiencies in the remedies available to it in state court render those remedies inadequate under <i>Williamson County.</i> Rhode Island, Downing argues, has no statute comparable to federal statutes permitting recovery of attorneys' fees or pre-judgment statutory interest on awarded compensation. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (interest); 42 U.S.C. § 1988(a) (fees); <i>Andrade v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1962437\"><a href=\"/opinion/1962437/andrade-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1293</span></a></span>, 1295 (R.I.1982) (holding Rhode Island did not waive sovereign immunity as to pre-judgment interest). Exact equivalence of damages is not required; just compensation is. <i>Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 514 (holding that potential differences between Puerto Rico and federal remedies did not render potential Puerto Rico inverse condemnation remedy inadequate, \"[s]o long as just compensation is provided\").</p>\n<p>Finally, Downing argues that because Rhode Island has not statutorily waived sovereign immunity for inverse condemnation claims as it has for statutory condemnation procedures, the remedy is uncertain. This allegation cannot satisfy Downing's burden to show absolute unavailability in light of the Rhode Island Supreme Court's decisions repeatedly reaching the merits in inverse condemnation cases. <i>See </i><i>Palazzolo,</i> 533 U.S. at 611, 616, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118459\"><a href=\"/opinion/118459/palazzolo-v-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Downing's opening brief makes frequent passing reference to Downing's due process claims, but provides no argument explaining why those claims should survive in federal court even if its takings claims are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> found to be unripe, the issue of primary relevance as to these claims at this stage in the proceedings. Nor did Downing make any such argument in the district court. The argument is doubly waived. <i>Cortes-Rivera v.

See </i><i>Asociación De Subscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Responsabilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797520\"><a href=\"/opinion/797520/asociacion-de-subscripcion-conjunta-del-seguro-de-responsabilidad/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[9]  As we explain below, Downing argues that Rhode Island's judicially created inverse condemnation cause of action is actually, under the framework of <i>Flores Galarza,</i> merely a \"generally available state procedure\" rather than one \"particularly aimed\" at addressing its specific type of claim. <i>See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 16-17.</p>\n<p>[10]  The plaintiffs in <i>Gilbert</i> petitioned for a writ of certiorari, asking the Supreme Court to reconsider the <i>Williamson County</i> state litigation rule. <i>See</i> Opposition to Petition for Writ of Certiorari at <i>i, Gilbert v. City of Cambridge,</i> No. 91-209 (U.S. Aug. 30, 1991), 1991 WL 11178604. The Supreme Court denied the petition. <i>Gilbert v.

See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 16-18 &amp; n. 21.</p>\n\n</div>",
