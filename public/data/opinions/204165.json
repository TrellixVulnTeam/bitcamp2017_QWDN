Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SOUTER, Associate Justice. In late 1999, J. Krist Schell\n\nand    Thomas    W.    Kent    (the       appellant    here)     formed    a     Nevada\n\ncorporation, Bradley Reed Lumber, LLC, to import Russian lumber for\n\nsale in New England.          Schell originally had a one-third interest,\n\nKent the remainder, and the company soon borrowed a quarter of a\n\nmillion dollars from Edward M. Myslik.                 The two owners personally\n\nsigned the note and a separate guarantee, and Kent agreed to\n\nindemnify    Schell      (consistently        with    their    respective      stakes)\n\nagainst any sums he might pay out under the guarantee.\n\n            In its early years, the business did poorly, requiring\n\nadvances (some from Schell), and in 2001, disagreements between the\n\nprincipals prompted Kent to ask Schell to withdraw from operations,\n\nas Schell subsequently did.              At least from this point, the conduct\n\nof corporate affairs become lackadaisical and remained that way\n\nafter Myslik agreed with Kent to cancel the debt to him in return\n\nfor    equity.        Over   the    years,    Schell    spoke    with     Kent   about\n\nrecovering      his    capital     and    advances    to   the   corporation,        but\n\naccepted Kent’s representations that the company had no funds\n\navailable to pay him.\n\n            Schell remained in the dark about the corporate financial\n\ncondition until disclosures followed in the wake of two state law\n\nactions against him by Myslik to collect under the terms of the\n\nnote   (which     Myslik     then    claimed     to   be   outstanding)        and   the\n\nguarantee.       Each claim was either dismissed (for a reason having\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fnothing to do with Myslik’s agreement to cancel debt for equity) or\n\nsettled, but not before Schell had incurred legal expenses.                    1\n\n\n               Schell then sued in federal court on four claims, two\n\nagainst Kent directly for indemnification and breach of oral\n\ncontract, and two against the company for unjust enrichment and\n\nfraud (claiming to reach Kent as well by piercing the corporate\n\nveil).       The magistrate judge granted Schell’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on the indemnification counts, and a jury returned a\n\nverdict against Kent on the fraud count, having pierced the veil.                        2\n\n\n               Kent’s first issue in this appeal is aimed at the summary\n\njudgment, by attempting an end run around his own failure to\n\nrespond to Schell’s requests for admission under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil       Procedure   36,    that    “[t]he   costs,    attorney’s     fees,     and\n\nexpenses      incurred    by   J.     Krist   Schell”    prior   to   judgment     “in\n\ndefending against Edward Myslik’s claims in [the two state court\n\nlawsuits] are covered by the indemnification provisions of the\n\nIndemnification         Agreement,      dated    February    28,      2000.”       The\n\n\n     1\n       Myslik first sued Schell, Kent, and Bradley Reed Lumber in\nNew Hampshire state court, and then instituted a parallel action\nagainst Schell alone in Maine, seeking to attach Schell’s property\nthere. The Maine court dismissed the case on the basis of a forum\nselection clause in the guarantee.       The New Hampshire court\ndismissed the guarantee-based claim as barred by the statute of\nlimitations, but held that the note-based claim was allowable.\nSchell and Kent separately settled that claim with Myslik.\n        2\n       The magistrate judge also entered judgment for Kent on the\noral contract and unjust enrichment counts, finding them barred by\nthe relevant statutes of limitations. Those claims are not before\nus on appeal.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fmagistrate relied on Kent’s admissions by silence, see Fed. Rule\n\nCiv. Proc. 36(a)(3), in reaching the conclusion that there was no\n\ngenuine dispute as to material fact standing in the way of Schell’s\n\nclaim   to   be   indemnified     for   the   burden      of   defending    against\n\nMyslik’s actions on the guarantee.            On de novo review, Pineda v.\n\nToomey, 533 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2008), we see no error.\n\n             Kent argues that the proposition he admitted merely\n\ndescribes      the    subject     matter,      the        scope,     of    possible\n\nindemnification,      not   the    application       of    the     indemnification\n\nagreement to the particular facts of the actions in the state\n\ncourts.      He says, moreover, that any such application could be\n\ntriggered     only   by   entry   of    a   judgment      of   liability    on   the\n\nguarantee, which was actually found to be precluded by the statute\n\nof limitations.      But these are not sensible readings either of the\n\nrequests for admission or of the agreement to indemnify.\n\n             The requests are specific to the particular outlays\n\nclaimed to have been made in consequence of the New Hampshire and\n\nMaine suits: the expenses said to be covered are described as “the”\n\ncosts, fees and expenses “incurred” by Schell in defending against\n\n“Myslik’s claims in” specifically identified lawsuits.                    These are\n\nreferences to particular items, not to general delineations of\n\nscope, and admitting their coverage under the indemnification\n\nagreement can only be understood to mean that they are outlays Kent\n\nis obliged to pay for.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f                      Kent likewise misunderstands the terms of indemnification\n\nwhen he argues that a court’s judgment of liability is a necessary\n\ncondition of its application.                            The agreement covers not only\n\n“damages              .    .   .   required   to    be    paid”    in       accordance      with    an\n\n“underlying                judgement    [or]       settlement,”       but        also    “costs    and\n\nexpenses . . . sustained [or] incurred . . . in connection with\n\n.   .       .    liability          resulting      from   the     [g]uarantee.”             Kent   is\n\nresponsible for such items “whether or not [he] is a party to the\n\nunderlying judgement, settlement, or other cause” of the payment,\n\nwhich           may       include    “voluntarily        paying   .     .    .    sums    under    the\n\n[g]uarantee.”                  Kent’s position would read the voluntary payment\n\nclause right out of the indemnity agreement, and coverage for\n\nattendant costs and expenses right along with it, which is enough\n\nto say that his interpretation cannot be sound, even under the\n\nauthority he cites from Illinois,3 to the effect that indemnity\n\nagreements get narrow readings, see Karsner v. Lechters Ill., Inc.,\n\n771 N.E.2d 606, 608 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002), overruled on other\n\ngrounds, Buenz v. Frontline Transp. Co., 882 N.E.2d 525 (Ill.\n\n2008).          The magistrate was on firm ground to rest on the admission,\n\nand the text of the agreement is consistent with the terms of the\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n                      Kent’s next assignment of error goes to the district\n\ncourt’s denial of both his motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\n\n        3\n             Whose law was agreed to govern interpretation.\n\n                                                    -5-\n\fand his motion for new trial in response to the jury’s verdict of\n\nfraud.   Kent had to show, respectively, that no reasonable juror\n\ncould have so found, Valentín-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,\n\n447 F.3d 85, 95–96 (1st Cir. 2006), or that the verdict was against\n\nthe clear weight of the evidence, id. at 104; in reviewing the\n\ntrial court’s conclusions, respectively, de novo and for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, id. at 95, 103-04, we again see no mistake.   The claim\n\nof corporate fraud extended to Kent under a count of the complaint\n\nseeking to pierce the corporate veil, and here Kent does not except\n\nto going behind the corporate form.     His position is simply a\n\nchallenge to the underlying grounds for a fraud verdict consistent\n\nwith the three-year limitation period: he denies that the jury had\n\nan evidentiary basis to find that Kent told Schell that the\n\ncorporation had no money to repay capital and other contributions,\n\nand that (for a time extending into the period allowed for suit)\n\nSchell reasonably relied on these representations in refraining\n\nfrom action to compel repayment, whereas in fact Kent made payments\n\nto himself from corporate funds, both before and after the Myslik\n\ndebt was cancelled.4   Kent addresses this issue principally by\n\nrehashing conflicting evidence about the date of the supposedly\n\npivotal event of his agreement with Myslik to cancel the debt in\n\n\n     4\n       In the district court, one thrust of Kent’s attack on the\njury award was directed to Schell’s recovery for the amount paid to\nsettle Myslik’s claim of personal liability (under the Uniform\nCommercial Code) for the original corporate debt; here, Kent says\nnothing specific to that particular item for damages.\n\n                               -6-\n\freturn for granting Myslik an equity position. On this matter, the\n\nmagistrate judge simply disbelieved Kent’s version of the facts,\n\nand the jury had ample evidence (such as the stated date of\n\nagreement)   to   do   the   same.    The   short   answer    to   Kent   was\n\naccordingly well stated by Schell’s counsel: among conflicting\n\nitems of evidence on which Kent argues that the jury should have\n\nfound for him there was ample evidence on which the jury did, and\n\nwas entitled to, see things Schell’s way.\n\n            The magistrate judge catalogued this latter evidence at\n\nexhaustive length in response to Kent’s motions.           For example, in\n\n2001, Kent sold almost $98,000 in lumber and paid many expenses\n\n(including a “Cost of Goods Sold - Other” expense of more than\n\n$57,000 and sales commissions), yet paid nothing to Schell; in\n\n2002, Kent sold over $35,000 in inventory and paid himself more\n\nthan $15,000 (in addition to sales commissions also presumably paid\n\nto himself), but made no payments to Schell or Myslik; and in 2003,\n\nmany assets were sold and Kent received “loan payments” of $19,000\n\n(while Myslik got another $14,400), yet nothing was paid to Schell.\n\nWe could go on, but the question is not even close and no purpose\n\nwould be served by duplicating the magistrate judge’s exposition.\n\n            Kent’s argument that any fraud must have occurred outside\n\nthe limitations period has no merit, for the evidence sufficient\n\nfor   the    fraud     verdict   amply      supports   a     finding      that\n\nmisrepresentations made outside the limitation period were not\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\freasonably discoverable as false, and were not known to be, until\n\nafter Myslik filed suit in state court, a time within the period\n\nfor bringing action.     Nor do we see a point of traction for Kent’s\n\nargument that any evidence of fraud goes to the time after Schell\n\nrelinquished his equity position in the corporation and is thus\n\nirrelevant because Schell claims to have been defrauded as a member\n\nof   the   company;   there   is   no   such   metaphysical   limitation   in\n\nSchell’s complaint.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f",

The agreement covers not only\n\n“damages              .    .   .   required   to    be    paid”    in       accordance      with    an\n\n“underlying                judgement    [or]       settlement,”       but        also    “costs    and\n\nexpenses . . . sustained [or] incurred . . . in connection with\n\n.   .       .    liability          resulting      from   the     [g]uarantee.”             Kent   is\n\nresponsible for such items “whether or not [he] is a party to the\n\nunderlying judgement, settlement, or other cause” of the payment,\n\nwhich           may       include    “voluntarily        paying   .     .    .    sums    under    the\n\n[g]uarantee.”                  Kent’s position would read the voluntary payment\n\nclause right out of the indemnity agreement, and coverage for\n\nattendant costs and expenses right along with it, which is enough\n\nto say that his interpretation cannot be sound, even under the\n\nauthority he cites from Illinois,3 to the effect that indemnity\n\nagreements get narrow readings, see Karsner v.

The claim\n\nof corporate fraud extended to Kent under a count of the complaint\n\nseeking to pierce the corporate veil, and here Kent does not except\n\nto going behind the corporate form.     His position is simply a\n\nchallenge to the underlying grounds for a fraud verdict consistent\n\nwith the three-year limitation period: he denies that the jury had\n\nan evidentiary basis to find that Kent told Schell that the\n\ncorporation had no money to repay capital and other contributions,\n\nand that (for a time extending into the period allowed for suit)\n\nSchell reasonably relied on these representations in refraining\n\nfrom action to compel repayment, whereas in fact Kent made payments\n\nto himself from corporate funds, both before and after the Myslik\n\ndebt was cancelled.4   Kent addresses this issue principally by\n\nrehashing conflicting evidence about the date of the supposedly\n\npivotal event of his agreement with Myslik to cancel the debt in\n\n\n     4\n       In the district court, one thrust of Kent’s attack on the\njury award was directed to Schell’s recovery for the amount paid to\nsettle Myslik’s claim of personal liability (under the Uniform\nCommercial Code) for the original corporate debt; here, Kent says\nnothing specific to that particular item for damages.\n\n                               -6-\n\freturn for granting Myslik an equity position. On this matter, the\n\nmagistrate judge simply disbelieved Kent’s version of the facts,\n\nand the jury had ample evidence (such as the stated date of\n\nagreement)   to   do   the   same.    The   short   answer    to   Kent   was\n\naccordingly well stated by Schell’s counsel: among conflicting\n\nitems of evidence on which Kent argues that the jury should have\n\nfound for him there was ample evidence on which the jury did, and\n\nwas entitled to, see things Schell’s way.\n\n            The magistrate judge catalogued this latter evidence at\n\nexhaustive length in response to Kent’s motions.           For example, in\n\n2001, Kent sold almost $98,000 in lumber and paid many expenses\n\n(including a “Cost of Goods Sold - Other” expense of more than\n\n$57,000 and sales commissions), yet paid nothing to Schell; in\n\n2002, Kent sold over $35,000 in inventory and paid himself more\n\nthan $15,000 (in addition to sales commissions also presumably paid\n\nto himself), but made no payments to Schell or Myslik; and in 2003,\n\nmany assets were sold and Kent received “loan payments” of $19,000\n\n(while Myslik got another $14,400), yet nothing was paid to Schell.\n\nWe could go on, but the question is not even close and no purpose\n\nwould be served by duplicating the magistrate judge’s exposition.\n\n            Kent’s argument that any fraud must have occurred outside\n\nthe limitations period has no merit, for the evidence sufficient\n\nfor   the    fraud     verdict   amply      supports   a     finding      that\n\nmisrepresentations made outside the limitation period were not\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\freasonably discoverable as false, and were not known to be, until\n\nafter Myslik filed suit in state court, a time within the period\n\nfor bringing action.     Nor do we see a point of traction for Kent’s\n\nargument that any evidence of fraud goes to the time after Schell\n\nrelinquished his equity position in the corporation and is thus\n\nirrelevant because Schell claims to have been defrauded as a member\n\nof   the   company;   there   is   no   such   metaphysical   limitation   in\n\nSchell’s complaint.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f</pre>",
