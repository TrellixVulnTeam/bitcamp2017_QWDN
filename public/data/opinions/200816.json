This is an appeal by Eastern Food\n\nServices, Inc. (\"Eastern\") from the dismissal of its antitrust\n\nsuit.     The   defendants      in   the   district   court   were   Pontifical\n\nCatholic University of Puerto Rico Services Association, Inc.,\n\n(\"University Services\") and Coca Cola Puerto Rico Bottlers, Inc.\n\n(\"Coca Cola\"). Because dismissal was on the complaint, we take the\n\nfactual allegations of the complaint as true for purposes of this\n\nappeal.   Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 5-6\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Eastern is a company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico,\n\nengaged in distributing food and beverage products in Puerto Rico;\n\nthis includes sales through cafeteria operations and food and\n\nbeverage machines.       Pontificia Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico\n\nis a university based in Ponce, Puerto Rico; University Services is\n\na   related     entity   that    provides      ancillary   services    for   the\n\nuniversity and has control over its cafeteria and other food\n\ndistribution points.\n\n              In 1997, Eastern and University Services entered into a\n\nthree-year contract, extendable to five years, whereby Eastern\n\nagreed to operate the cafeteria at the university and was given,\n\nfor specified payments, the exclusive concession (with a few narrow\n\nexceptions) for other food and beverage distribution inside the\n\nuniversity.      Eastern alleges that in 1998, in order to secure a\n\ndonation from Coca Cola to the university, University Services\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fallowed Coca Cola to place its own food and beverage machines on\n\nthe campus and told Eastern to have the machines it was using\n\nremoved.\n\n            There were negotiations between the parties as to this\n\nand other matters.        Ultimately, University Services terminated the\n\ncontract, claiming that Eastern had breached its provisions in\n\nvarious respects; Eastern made similar claims against University\n\nServices.     Asserting that it made large investments in reliance\n\nupon the contract, Eastern brought the present suit in federal\n\ndistrict court in 1999 against both University Services and Coca\n\nCola.\n\n            Although the complaint asserts contract, tort, and other\n\nclaims     under    local     law     (and     University    Services       filed   a\n\ncounterclaim based on breach of contract), our concern is solely\n\nwith Eastern's claim based upon section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1 (2000).          This claim alleged a conspiracy by the two\n\ndefendants,      through     unfair     business       practices,    to    eliminate\n\ncompetition by Eastern in the supply of food and beverage service\n\nwithin the university.              This was, according to the complaint,\n\nunlawful per se and under the rule of reason.\n\n            The district court dismissed the antitrust claim on the\n\nmerits.     The ruling most important to this appeal was that the\n\ncomplaint failed to allege a valid geographic market; the district\n\njudge     said     that     Eastern's        alleged    geographic        market–-the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\funiversity–-was \"extremely narrow\" and not \"large enough so as to\n\nconstitute an economically significant area of commerce.\"                             The\n\nlocal   law    claims   were     dismissed     without     prejudice           to   their\n\nassertion in Puerto Rico's courts.             This appeal followed.\n\n              Our review of a dismissal for failure to state a claim is\n\nde novo.      Martin, 284 F. 3d at 5-6.            In addition to accepting as\n\ntrue the      facts   alleged    in   the    complaint,        we   draw    reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the non-moving party. Id. Nevertheless, we\n\nconclude that this is essentially a contract dispute with possible\n\nattendant tort claims; and it is not a plausible antitrust case,\n\nhowever tempting may be the lure of treble damages and attorney's\n\nfees.\n\n              In substance, Eastern alleges that it had from the\n\nuniversity, through its services auxiliary, something close to an\n\nexclusive contract to provide food services on the university\n\ncampus,    and   that   after     receiving        a   large    donation       for    the\n\nuniversity from Coca Cola, University Services broke the contract\n\nin order to transfer to Coca Cola exclusive rights to a part of\n\nEastern's domain, namely, the vending machine portion of the\n\nbusiness on the campus.           Indulging all inferences in favor of\n\nEastern, we will assume that Coca Cola was complicit in the breach.\n\n              The line is not always clear between antitrust violations\n\nand ordinary      business      wrongs,     such   as   breach      of     contract    or\n\ntortious      interference.       Indeed,     both      antitrust        and   ordinary\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcontract or tort claims may sometimes arise out of the same body of\n\nconduct, see Hayes v. Solomon, 597 F.2d 958, 973 (5th Cir. 1979),\n\ncert. denied, 444 U.S. 1078 (1980); IIIA Areeda & Hovenkamp,\n\nAntitrust Law, ¶ 782a (1996); imagine a near monopolist who burns\n\ndown the plant of his only competitor.           But antitrust claims are\n\nconcerned not with wrongs directed against the private interest of\n\nan individual business but with conduct that stifles competition.\n\nBrown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 344 (1962).\n\n          From the outset, Eastern's description of what happened\n\nraises warning flags for anyone familiar with antitrust law.           The\n\nuniversity, like most landlords, controls who may set up shop on\n\nits premises.    It could act as the sole on-campus supplier of food\n\nand beverages, allow multiple suppliers, or give exclusive access\n\nto one supplier.       Here, before the dispute, Eastern was virtually\n\nthe sole supplier of food and beverages; after, Coca Cola has\n\nexclusive control of the vending machine portion of the business.\n\n          In all events, antitrust doctrine does not operate by\n\npurely ad hoc judgments as to whether an action adds to or detracts\n\nfrom competition.        Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes unlawful\n\ncontracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade and\n\nthe   courts    have    developed   algorithms    for   implementing   this\n\ngeneralization.        The easiest way is for the plaintiff to show a\n\n\"per se\" violation, that is, that the challenged conduct falls\n\nwithin a small set of acts regarded by courts as sufficiently\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fdangerous, and so clearly without redeeming value, that they are\n\ncondemned out of hand–-that is without a showing of wrongful\n\npurpose, power or effect.   See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil\n\nCo., 310 U.S. 150 (1940).\n\n          Almost the only important categories of agreements that\n\nreliably deserve this label today are those among competitors that\n\namount to \"naked\" price fixing, output restriction, or division of\n\ncustomers or territories. Augusta News Co. v. Hudson News Co., 269\n\nF.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 2001).1   Agreements between a supplier and a\n\nbuyer as to a minimum resale price remain per se unlawful, id., but\n\nthat category is a narrow one.     In this case Eastern invokes a\n\ndifferent category of agreements sometimes labeled per se, namely,\n\nconcerted refusals to deal or group boycotts.        E.g., Fashion\n\nOriginators Guild of Am., Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 465-67 (1941).\n\n          As to this last category, the label is deceptive because\n\nlots of arrangements that might literally be described as agreements\n\nnot to deal are not per se unlawful.     A common arrangement that\n\ninvolves an agreement not to deal but is far from unlawful per se\n\nis the exclusive dealing contract (e.g., a sole supplier contract,\n\na exclusive territorial franchise for an outlet). Such arrangements\n\n\n\n     1\n      \"Naked\" means unconnected with any redeeming larger\nenterprise. See White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253,\n263 (1963).   Compare Northwest Wholesale Stationers v. Pacific\nStationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 295-98 (1985); Broadcast\nMusic, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 20-\n21 (1979).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fcan be attacked under the rule of reason--i.e., on their facts--but\n\nare not per se violations.        Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co.,\n\n365 U.S. 320, 327 (1961).\n\n               Those refusals to deal arrangements that are treated as\n\nper se violations are \"horizontal,\" that is, they are agreements\n\nbetween competitors.       See U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Healthsource,\n\nInc., 986 F.2d 589, 593-94 (1st Cir. 1993).           (Even then, not all\n\nsuch horizontal arrangements are subject to per se treatment or\n\nnecessarily violate the antitrust laws, e.g., Northwest Stationers,\n\n472 U.S. at 295-98.).      An entity that grants an exclusive franchise\n\nis ordinarily in a vertical, not a horizontal, relationship with the\n\ngrantee.       XI Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1800a (1998).\n\n               What is alleged here is nothing other than an exclusive\n\ndealing arrangement by which one supplier--Coca-Cola--is given the\n\nsole right by the university to supply and stock vending machines\n\non campus.2       Eastern was itself the beneficiary of just such a\n\ncontract--indeed, a broader one since it included other on-campus\n\nfood       distribution--until   it   was   terminated.   There   might   be\n\ncircumstances in which exclusivity was unlawful for Coca-Cola but\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      Eastern's concern with the fact that Coca Cola may have paid\nup-front a large sum for the contract in the form of a supposed\ndonation to the university is a red herring.          Whether the\nuniversity is compensated by up-front payments, rent, or royalties\n(or by construction work allegedly wrung out of Eastern) affects\nnot the competitive impact but merely the form and amount of\ncompensation for the exclusive contract.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fnot for Eastern; but in neither case does such a contract fall into\n\nthe category of a per se violation.\n\n           To   show    an    antitrust   violation   in   the   transfer   of\n\nexclusive rights from Eastern to Coca Cola, Eastern had to commit\n\nitself to show that the new arrangement would have anti-competitive\n\neffects outweighing the legitimate economic advantages that it might\n\nprovide.    U.S. Healthcare, 986 F.2d at 595; see Fraser v. Major\n\nLeague Soccer, 284 F.3d 47, 59 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537\n\nU.S. 885 (2002).       This is usually a demanding and fact-intensive\n\nprocess, cf. Tampa Elec. Co., 365 U.S. at 329, which is why\n\nplaintiffs almost always allege a per se violation where they can\n\ndo so.     But plaintiffs are free to urge per se and non-per se\n\ntheories at the same time.         U.S. Healthcare, 986 F.2d at 593.\n\n           Virtually always, anti-competitive effects under the rule\n\nof reason require that the arrangement or action in question create\n\nor enhance market power--meaning the power to control prices or\n\nexclude competition.         IIA Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 501\n\n(2d ed. 2002).      This is not necessarily enough to condemn the\n\nconduct--benefits may outweigh detriments, see Northwest Wholesale\n\nStationers, 472 U.S. at 295-98 (1985); Broadcast Music, Inc., 441\n\nU.S. at 20-21--but absent market power there is ordinarily no\n\ndetriment and no reason to engage in any weighing.          Oksanen v. Page\n\nMem'l Hosp., 945 F.2d 696, 709 (4th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502\n\nU.S. 1074 (1992).\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f             Thus, the identification of market power is ordinarily the\n\nfirst step in any rule of reason claim under section 1.             U.S. v.\n\nVisa, U.S.A., Inc., 344 F.3d 229, 238 (2d Cir. 2003); Valley\n\nLiquors, Inc. v. Renfield Importers, Ltd., 822 F.2d 656, 666 (7th\n\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 977 (1987).                 This in turn\n\nrequires the identification of some economic market in which power\n\ncan be measured and the consequences of the act or transaction\n\nassessed. Indeed, \"virtually all courts applying the rule of reason\n\nrequire the plaintiff to define the product and geographic market\n\nin which competition is allegedly restrained . . . .\"            VII Areeda,\n\nAntitrust Law ¶ 1503b, at 376 (1986).\n\n             So how is market power to be assessed?      As to power over\n\nprice, the conventional way is to determine whether the relevant\n\nactor   or   combination   has   a   sufficient   percentage    share   of   a\n\n\"relevant market\" to give it or them power to raise price over cost\n\nwithout losing so many customers as to defeat the effort.            Todd v.\n\nExxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 199 (2d Cir. 2001).           Where exclusion\n\nrather than exploitation is the concern, market share figures help\n\ngauge the potential impact of restrictive conduct on suppliers or\n\npurchasers.     See Tampa Elec. Co., 365 U.S. at 327.          A defendant's\n\nhigh share is only a presumptive basis for inferring market power\n\n(entry barriers to the market may be very low); but a low share is\n\nalmost always an indication that the defendant lacks market power.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            Here, perhaps University Services has power in an economic\n\nmarket:    after all, it can set the prices charged students for food\n\nsimply by making itself the sole distributor.     In fact, whether it\n\nhas power to raise price to a non-competitive level depends on how\n\neasy it is for students to find other nearby food suppliers. In any\n\nevent, if the university has power to charge high prices to those\n\non campus, it can be exploited          without regard to whether it\n\ncontracts with Coca Cola or Eastern or does the job itself.\n\n            By contrast, competition in the market to supply vending\n\nservices--note that this is a different market--could in theory be\n\naffected by a long-term exclusive franchise contract between the\n\nuniversity and Coca Cola: suppose Eastern were the only food\n\ndistributor in Puerto Rico beside Coca Cola and the latter's long-\n\nterm contracts with various outlets deprived Eastern of the minimum\n\nnumber necessary to its survival. U.S. Healthcare, 986 F.2d at 595.\n\nEven then, one would have to consider whether Eastern could feasibly\n\ncreate new outlets by itself.    Posner, Antitrust Law 251-52 (2d ed.\n\n2001).\n\n            In all events, so far as Eastern's competitive access to\n\ncustomers is concerned, the key question in market definition is\n\nwhat other customers Eastern and its competitors can supply and with\n\nwhat.     Here, Eastern described in its complaint the product as\n\nvending machine sales and the geographic area of competition as the\n\nuniversity campus.    The district court in dismissing the complaint\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthought that the former was not a meaningful product and the latter\n\nwas too small and narrowly defined to be a realistic geographic\n\nmarket.\n\n            We can confine ourselves here to the geographic market and\n\nassume arguendo that supplying food or beverages through vending\n\nmachines might be a legitimate product for purposes of market\n\nanalysis.    See Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Mid-Atlantic\n\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co., 690 F.2d 411, 412 n.1 (4th Cir. 1982).     We\n\nalso put aside any suggestion that vending sales in the university\n\nare too small in dollar terms to be of interest to the Sherman Act.\n\nPerhaps Section 1 includes a de minimis dollar requirement based on\n\nthe interstate commerce element of the offense, Hammes v. AAMCO\n\nTransmissions, Inc., 33 F.3d 774, 780-81 (7th Cir. 1994) (Posner,\n\nJ.); IA Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 266e, at 296-300 (2d\n\ned. 2000); but such a requirement, even if it exists, is low, Summit\n\nHealth, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322, 329 n.10, 329-33 (1991), and\n\nnothing before us suggests that the dollar volume of vending sales\n\non campus is trivial.\n\n            The more important question is the percentage of the\n\nmarket represented by the university.      Consider that if food and\n\nbeverage vending within the university is but a modest fraction of\n\nall food and beverage vending distribution in Ponce and Eastern can\n\nserve the Ponce area, then foreclosure of the campus segment of the\n\nmarket, even by giving Coca Cola the university franchise for a long\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fperiod, cannot prevent Eastern from distributing through other\n\nvending machine outlets.       This is just another way of saying that,\n\nexcept in special circumstances, a contract restricting a small\n\npercentage   of   a   larger   available    market   will   have   no    anti-\n\ncompetitive effect on that market.\n\n           Here, to put matters in a nutshell, the district court\n\nsaid that the university was obviously a small portion of the\n\ndistribution market, measured geographically. Eastern says that the\n\ndistrict court had no business making this determination on a motion\n\nto dismiss; there is, after all, nothing in the complaint that\n\nestablishes that Eastern and other vending machine suppliers operate\n\nin a larger market.      Eastern also says that even if the district\n\ncourt could reject the university as a valid economic market for\n\ndistribution, Eastern was still entitled to a fall-back opportunity\n\nto conduct discovery to identify some broader but more plausible\n\nmarket in which foreclosure might still be significant.\n\n           As to the first issue, the district court was entitled to\n\ntake notice that Ponce is a major city in Puerto Rico and, as a\n\nmatter of common experience, to recognize that food and beverage\n\nmachines are customarily accessible at a host of public and business\n\npoints   within   cities.      The   idea   that   one   university     campus\n\nrepresents even a majority of the vending machine sales in a large\n\ncity is so improbable that Eastern's own brief makes no such\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fsuggestion.3   Quite possibly (note Eastern's location in San Juan)\n\ndistribution is an island-wide business, but it is enough that it\n\nis at least municipal.\n\n          Eastern does say that for students and faculty the campus\n\nmay be a geographic market in which they purchase snacks and\n\nbeverages, and we would not rule out this possibility without more\n\ninformation about student habits and nearby locations. See Morales-\n\nVillalobos v. Garcia-Llorens, 316 F.3d 51, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nBut, as noted, this student-faculty market, even if real, is already\n\ncaptive to the university and a change in exclusive distributors\n\ndoes not further restrict it.      Eastern, by contrast, could be\n\naffected by being excluded from the campus, but it is a distributor\n\nwhich, if it can serve the university, is also capable of serving\n\nother outlets in Ponce.\n\n          At oral argument, Eastern's counsel said that his client\n\ndid not need to identify the geographic and product market in the\n\ncomplaint and could have merely alleged anti-competitive effects in\n\n\"a valid economic market.\"    Even if this were so--and different\n\nviews might be taken on this issue--it would be no excuse for\n\n\n\n     3\n      In fact, the students represent at most a few percentage\npoints in Ponce's population. According to its web cite, Ponce\n(Puerto Rico's second largest city) has about 194,000 people; and\na web site for colleges (xap.com) reports the student population of\nthe university as 7,150.    Conceivably, such precise information\namounts to adjudicative facts subject to Fed. R. Evid. 201; but in\nany event the data bear out the background inferences drawn in the\ntext.\n\n                                -13-\n\fsustaining a complaint that had shown itself to be inadequate based\n\non the drafter's candor. Jackson v. Marion County, 66 F.3d 151, 153\n\n(7th Cir. 1995) (Posner, J.).   The time of judges and lawyers is a\n\nscarce resource; the sooner a hopeless claim is sent on its way, the\n\nmore time is available for plausible cases.\n\n          This brings us to Eastern's fall-back position; as already\n\nnoted, Eastern argues that even if its initial claim was doomed, it\n\nwas entitled to add new allegations to the complaint, conduct\n\ndiscovery or both--aimed at developing other market definitions or\n\ntheories of antitrust violation.   Specifically, Eastern says that\n\nin opposing the motion to dismiss, it told the district court that\n\nit might eventually urge that the market was all of Ponce or even\n\nisland-wide, depending upon what discovery revealed.\n\n          This argument has several variations, and we start with\n\nthe easiest, namely, the possibility of amending the complaint.\n\nOnce the adversary has answered, amendment is no longer allowed as\n\nof right, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), but in general permission is\n\nliberally granted where there is no prejudice.     FDIC v. Consol.\n\nMortgage and Fin. Corp., 805 F.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1986).     It is\n\noften granted not only pretrial but after a dismissal for failure\n\nto state a claim where the court thinks that the case has some\n\npromise and there is some excuse for the delay.     See 6 Wright &\n\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1488, at 652-69 (2d ed.\n\n1990).\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f           Refusals to allow amendment are reviewed only for abuse\n\nof discretion, Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st\n\nCir. 1994), but district judges do not customarily aim to defeat\n\nvalid claims.      Here, little had occurred at the time of dismissal\n\nbeyond the filing of motion papers.             It is a fair guess that if\n\nEastern had moved to amend the complaint after the dismissal and had\n\noffered the court some hope of an amendment raising a plausible\n\nantitrust claim, amendment would have been allowed. But Eastern did\n\nnot move to amend and, even now, it neither has a plausible case nor\n\nunderstands what one would require.\n\n           Despite some initial confusion, today exclusive dealing\n\ncontracts are not disfavored by the antitrust laws.                   Compare\n\nStandard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 306-07,\n\n313-14 (1949), with Tampa Elec. Co., 365 U.S. at 334, and Jefferson\n\nParish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 45 (1984) (O'Connor,\n\nJ., concurring).      Rather, it is widely recognized that in many\n\ncircumstances they may be highly efficient--to assure supply, price\n\nstability, outlets, investment, best efforts or the like--and pose\n\nno   competitive    threat   at   all.     XI    Hovenkamp   ¶¶   1810-1814b.\n\nOrdinarily, such agreements pose a threat to competition only in\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fvery discrete circumstances,4 and much sweat and tears have gone\n\ninto identifying these criteria.    Id. at ¶¶ 1802-1807, 1821.\n\n          The best example of a possible threat to competition\n\nexists where a market is already heavily concentrated and long-term\n\nexclusive dealing contracts at either the supplier or distribution\n\nend foreclose so large a percentage of the available supply or\n\noutlets that entry into the concentrated market is unreasonably\n\nconstricted.   Even here there will normally be no serious effects\n\nin certain conditions (e.g., the contracts are for short terms, new\n\nentry at the supplier or outlet business allegedly restrained is\n\neasy), but, at a minimum, substantial foreclosure is essential and\n\nexisting concentration important.   See U.S. Healthcare, 986 F.2d at\n\n597; Barr Labs. v. Abbott Labs., 978 F.2d 98, 111 (3d Cir. 1992);\n\ncf. XI Hovenkamp ¶ 1821b-c, at 160-64.\n\n          There is no indication that Eastern has any hope of\n\nshowing substantial foreclosure in a properly defined market.    Yes,\n\nEastern might well show that supply of products through vending\n\nmachines is a geographic market that is municipal, regional or\n\nisland-wide: likely it is one of these.       But Eastern does not\n\n\n     4\n      See Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 45 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (\"Exclusive dealing is an unreasonable restraint on\ntrade only when a significant fraction of buyers or sellers are\nfrozen out of a market by the exclusive deal.\"); Roland Machinery\nCo. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 394 (7th Cir. 1984)\n(Posner, J.) (\"[A] plaintiff must prove . . . that an exclusive\ndealing arrangement is . . . . likely to keep at least one\ncompetitor of the defendant from doing business in a relevant\nmarket.\").\n\n                               -16-\n\fremotely suggest that so many potential outlets are foreclosed to\n\nit or other competitors by long-term exclusive dealing contracts\n\nor other tactics that survival or new entry is infeasible.                 Being\n\nin the distributor business, it ought to know enough to make such\n\nan allegation if it were true.\n\n                 This brings us to the separate and more difficult subject\n\nof allowing discovery without insisting upon an amendment.                   The\n\nfederal rules adopt so-called notice pleading--a \"short and plain\n\nstatement of the claim,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)--and the case books\n\nare full of generalizations seemingly helpful to Eastern: that\n\nevidence need not be pled; that discovery is available both to\n\nrefine claims and to support them; and that claims will be allowed\n\nto go forward upon a wrong theory or no theory at all so long as\n\nsome       set   of   facts   encompassed   by   the   complaint   would   allow\n\nrecovery.5\n\n                 Yet the cases also say that it is not enough merely to\n\nallege a violation in conclusory terms, that the complaint must make\n\nout the rudiments of a valid claim, and that discovery is not for\n\nfishing expeditions.6          Often, such sets of dueling over-statements\n\n\n       5\n      E.g., Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter, 339 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.\n2003); Kiley v. Ratheon Co., 105 F.3d 734, 735 (1st Cir. 1997); Am.\nNurses Ass'n v. State of Illinois, 783 F.2d 716, 727 (7th Cir.\n1986).\n       6\n      E.g., Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996);\nMcCoy v. Ma. Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991), cert.\ndenied, 504 U.S. 910 (1992); Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d\n513, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                                       -17-\n\fmean   that    the   pertinent     variables       are   too    numerous,     and   the\n\ncircumstances too various, to reduce the law to a formula; usually,\n\nthe outcome turns on matters of degree.                  In all events, discovery\n\nis an expensive and burdensome process, and at every stage is\n\nsubject to control as a matter of sound judicial judgment.\n\n              Nothing here suggests that discovery would be remotely\n\nproductive, apart from the random (and insufficient) possibility\n\nthat rummaging through Coca Cola's files would produce evidence of\n\nsome wholly unknown violation.             What Eastern mainly says it wants\n\nto discover is information about market definition, a matter on\n\nwhich it should already have a good grasp since it is in the\n\nbusiness.      The further circumstances that would be needed to make\n\nout a half-way decent exclusive dealing claim (e.g., widespread\n\nforeclosure and concentration) are ones whose existence is not even\n\nhinted at by Eastern.\n\n              In   this    case,   four    years    after      the   filing   of    the\n\ncomplaint, there continues to be no hint of a coherent and promising\n\nantitrust claim.          The case remains what it was from the start: a\n\ncontract and tort case concerned not about whether an economic\n\nmarket will become less competitive but about which of two companies\n\nwill have exclusive access to supply vending machine food and\n\nbeverages on a single campus.             Eastern may or may not have decent\n\nclaims under local law but it has no claim arising under the Sherman\n\nAct.\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -19-\n\f",

(\"Eastern\") from the dismissal of its antitrust suit. The defendants in the district court were Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico Services Association, Inc., (\"University Services\") and Coca Cola Puerto Rico Bottlers, Inc. (\"Coca Cola\"). Because dismissal was on the complaint, we take the factual allegations of the complaint as true for purposes of this appeal. <i>Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc.,</i> 284 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern is a company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, engaged in distributing food and beverage products in Puerto Rico; this includes sales through cafeteria operations and food and beverage machines. Pontificia Universidad Cat&#243;lica de Puerto Rico is a university based in Ponce, Puerto Rico; University Services is a related entity that provides ancillary services for the university and has control over its cafeteria and other food distribution points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, Eastern and University Services entered into a three-year contract, extendable to five years, whereby Eastern agreed to operate the cafeteria at the university and was given, for specified payments, the exclusive concession (with a few narrow exceptions) for other food and beverage distribution inside the university. Eastern alleges that in 1998, in order to secure a donation from Coca Cola to the university, University Services allowed Coca Cola to place its own food and beverage machines on the campus and told Eastern to have the machines it was using removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were negotiations between the parties as to this and other matters. Ultimately, University Services terminated the contract, claiming that Eastern had breached its provisions in various respects; Eastern made similar claims against University Services. Asserting that it made large investments in reliance upon the contract, Eastern brought the present suit in federal district court in 1999 against both University Services and Coca Cola.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the complaint asserts contract, tort, and other claims under local law (and University Services filed a counterclaim based on breach of contract), our concern is solely with Eastern's claim based upon section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1 (2000). This claim alleged a conspiracy by the two defendants, through unfair business practices, to eliminate competition by Eastern in the supply of food and beverage service within the university. This was, according to the complaint, unlawful per se and under the rule of reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the antitrust claim on the merits. The ruling most important to this appeal was that the complaint failed to allege a valid geographic market; the district judge said that Eastern's alleged geographic market &#8212; the university &#8212; was \"extremely narrow\" and not \"large enough so as to constitute an economically significant area of commerce.\" The local law claims were dismissed without prejudice to their assertion in Puerto Rico's courts. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a dismissal for failure to state a claim is de novo. <i>Martin,</i> 284 F.3d at 5-6. In addition to accepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint, we draw reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Id.</i> Nevertheless, we conclude that this is essentially a contract dispute with possible attendant tort claims; and it is not a plausible antitrust case, however tempting may be the lure of treble damages and attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, Eastern alleges that it had from the university, through its services auxiliary, something close to an exclusive contract to provide food services on the university campus, and that after receiving a large donation for the university from Coca Cola, University Services broke the contract in order to transfer to Coca Cola exclusive rights to a part of Eastern's domain, namely, the vending machine portion of the business on the campus. Indulging all inferences in favor of Eastern, we will assume that Coca Cola was complicit in the breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The line is not always clear between antitrust violations and ordinary business wrongs, such as breach of contract or tortious interference. Indeed, both antitrust and ordinary contract or tort claims may sometimes arise out of the same body of conduct, <i>see Hayes v. Solomon,</i> 597 F.2d 958, 973 (5th Cir.1979), <i>cert. denied,</i> 444 U.S. 1078, 100 S.Ct. 1028, 62 L.Ed.2d 761 (1980); IIIA Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law,</i> &#182; 782a (1996); imagine a near monopolist who burns down the plant of his only competitor. But antitrust claims are concerned not with wrongs directed against the private interest of an individual business but with conduct that stifles competition. <i>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States,</i> 370 U.S. 294, 344, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510 (1962).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the outset, Eastern's description of what happened raises warning flags for anyone familiar with antitrust law. The university, like most landlords, controls who may set up shop on its premises. It could act as the sole on-campus supplier of food and beverages, allow multiple suppliers, or give exclusive access to one supplier. Here, before the dispute, Eastern was virtually the sole supplier of food and beverages; after, Coca Cola has exclusive control of the vending machine portion of the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, antitrust doctrine does not operate by purely ad hoc judgments as to whether an action adds to or detracts from competition. Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes unlawful contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade and the courts have developed algorithms for implementing this generalization. The easiest way is for the plaintiff to show a \"per se\" violation, that is, that the challenged conduct falls within a small set of acts regarded by courts as sufficiently dangerous, and so clearly without redeeming value, that they are condemned out of hand &#8212; that is without a showing of wrongful purpose, power or effect. <i>See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.,</i> 310 U.S. 150, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost the only important categories of agreements that reliably deserve this label today are those among competitors that amount to \"naked\" price fixing, output restriction, or division of customers or territories. <i>Augusta News Co. v. Hudson News Co.,</i> 269 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Agreements between a supplier and a buyer as to a minimum resale price remain per se unlawful, <i>id.,</i> but that category is a narrow one. In this case Eastern invokes a different category of agreements sometimes labeled per se, namely, concerted refusals to deal or group boycotts. <i>E.g., Fashion Originators' Guild of Am., Inc. v. FTC,</i> 312 U.S. 457, 465-67, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to this last category, the label is deceptive because lots of arrangements that might literally be described as agreements not to deal are not per se unlawful. A common arrangement that involves an agreement not to deal but is far from unlawful per se is the exclusive dealing contract (<i>e.g.,</i> a sole supplier contract, a exclusive territorial franchise for an outlet). Such arrangements can be attacked under the rule of reason &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> on their facts &#8212; but are not per se violations. <i>Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co.,</i> 365 U.S. 320, 327, 81 S.Ct. 623, 5 L.Ed.2d 580 (1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those refusals to deal arrangements that are treated as per se violations are \"horizontal,\" that is, they are agreements <i>between competitors. See U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Healthsource, Inc.,</i> 986 F.2d 589, 593-94 (1st Cir.1993). (Even then, not all such horizontal arrangements are subject to per se treatment or necessarily violate the antitrust laws, <i>e.g., Northwest Stationers,</i> 472 U.S. at 295-98, 105 S.Ct. 2613.). An entity that grants an exclusive franchise is ordinarily in a vertical, not a horizontal, relationship with the grantee. XI Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law</i> &#182; 1800a (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is alleged here is nothing other than an exclusive dealing arrangement by which one supplier &#8212; Coca-Cola &#8212; is given the sole right by the university to supply and stock vending machines on campus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Eastern was itself the beneficiary of just such a contract &#8212; indeed, a broader one since it included other on-campus food distribution &#8212; until it was terminated. There might be circumstances in which exclusivity was unlawful for Coca-Cola but not for Eastern; but in neither case does such a contract fall into the category of a per se violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To show an antitrust violation in the transfer of exclusive rights from Eastern to Coca Cola, Eastern had to commit itself to show that the new arrangement would have anti-competitive effects outweighing the legitimate economic advantages that it might provide. <i>U.S. Healthcare,</i> 986 F.2d at 595; <i>see Fraser v. Major League Soccer,</i> 284 F.3d 47, 59 (1st Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 885, 123 S.Ct. 118, 154 L.Ed.2d 144 (2002). This is usually a demanding and fact-intensive process, <i>cf. Tampa Elec. Co.,</i> 365 U.S. at 329, 81 S.Ct. 623, which is why plaintiffs almost always allege a per se violation where they can do so. But plaintiffs are free to urge per se and non-per se theories at the same time. <i>U.S. Healthcare,</i> 986 F.2d at 593.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually always, anti-competitive effects under the rule of reason require that the arrangement or action in question create or enhance market power &#8212; meaning the power to control prices or exclude competition. IIA Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law,</i> &#182; 501 (2d ed.2002). This is not necessarily enough to condemn the conduct &#8212; benefits may outweigh detriments, <i>see Northwest Wholesale Stationers,</i> 472 U.S. at 295-98, 105 S.Ct. 2613, 86 L.Ed.2d 202 (1985); <i>Broadcast Music, Inc.,</i> 441 U.S. at 20-21, 99 S.Ct. 1551 &#8212; but absent market power there is ordinarily no detriment and no reason to engage in any weighing. <i>Oksanen v. Page Mem'l Hosp.,</i> 945 F.2d 696, 709 (4th Cir.1991), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 1074, 112 S.Ct. 973, 117 L.Ed.2d 137 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the identification of market power is ordinarily the first step in any rule of reason claim under section 1. <i>U.S. v. VISA, U.S.A., Inc.,</i> 344 F.3d 229, 238 (2d Cir.2003); <i>Valley Liquors, Inc. v. Renfield Importers, Ltd.,</i> 822 F.2d 656, 666 (7th Cir.1987), <i>cert. denied,</i> 484 U.S. 977, 108 S.Ct. 488, 98 L.Ed.2d 486 (1987). This in turn requires the identification of some economic market in which power can be measured and the consequences of the act or transaction assessed. Indeed, \"virtually all courts applying the rule of reason require the plaintiff to define the product and geographic market in which competition is allegedly restrained....\" VII Areeda, <i>Antitrust Law</i> &#182; 1503b, at 376 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So how is market power to be assessed? As to power over price, the conventional way is to determine whether the relevant actor or combination has a sufficient percentage share of a \"relevant market\" to give it or them power to raise price over cost without losing so many customers as to defeat the effort. <i>Todd v. Exxon Corp.,</i> 275 F.3d 191, 199 (2d Cir.2001). Where exclusion rather than exploitation is the concern, market share figures help gauge the potential impact of restrictive conduct on suppliers or purchasers. <i>See Tampa Elec. Co.,</i> 365 U.S. at 327, 81 S.Ct. 623. A defendant's high share is only a presumptive basis for inferring market power (entry barriers to the market may be very low); but a low share is almost always an indication that the defendant lacks market power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, perhaps University Services has power in an economic market: after all, it can set the prices charged students for food simply by making itself the sole distributor. In fact, whether it has power to raise price to a non-competitive level depends on how easy it is for students to find other nearby food suppliers. In any event, if the university has power to charge high prices to those on campus, it can be exploited without regard to whether it contracts with Coca Cola or Eastern or does the job itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, competition in the market to supply vending services &#8212; note that this is a <i>different</i> market &#8212; could in theory be affected by a long-term exclusive franchise contract between the university and Coca Cola: suppose Eastern were the only food distributor in Puerto Rico beside Coca Cola and the latter's long-term contracts with various outlets deprived Eastern of the minimum number necessary to its survival. <i>U.S. Healthcare,</i> 986 F.2d at 595. Even then, one would have to consider whether Eastern could feasibly create <i>new</i> outlets by itself. Posner, <i>Antitrust Law</i> 251-52 (2d ed.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, so far as Eastern's competitive access to customers is concerned, the key question in market definition is what other customers Eastern and its competitors can supply and with what. Here, Eastern described in its complaint the product as vending machine sales and the geographic area of competition as the university campus. The district court in dismissing the complaint thought that the former was not a meaningful product and the latter was too small and narrowly defined to be a realistic geographic market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can confine ourselves here to the geographic market and assume <i>arguendo</i> that supplying food or beverages through vending machines might be a legitimate product for purposes of market analysis. <i>See Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Co.,</i> 690 F.2d 411, 412 n. 1 (4th Cir.1982). We also put aside any suggestion that vending sales in the university are too small in dollar terms to be of interest to the Sherman Act. Perhaps Section 1 includes a <i>de minimis</i> dollar requirement based on the interstate commerce element of the offense, <i>Hammes v. AAMCO Transmissions, Inc.,</i> 33 F.3d 774, 780-81 (7th Cir.1994) (Posner, J.); IA Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law,</i> &#182; 266e, at 296-300 (2d ed.2000); but such a requirement, even if it exists, is low, <i>Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas,</i> 500 U.S. 322, 329 n. 10, 329-33, 111 S.Ct. 1842, 114 L.Ed.2d 366 (1991), and nothing before us suggests that the dollar volume of vending sales on campus is trivial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more important question is the <i>percentage</i> of the market represented by the university. Consider that if food and beverage vending within the university is but a modest fraction of all food and beverage vending distribution in Ponce and Eastern can serve the Ponce area, then foreclosure of the campus segment of the market, even by giving Coca Cola the university franchise for a long period, cannot prevent Eastern from distributing through other vending machine outlets. This is just another way of saying that, except in special circumstances, a contract restricting a small percentage of a larger available market will have no anti-competitive effect on that market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, to put matters in a nutshell, the district court said that the university was obviously a small portion of the distribution market, measured geographically. Eastern says that the district court had no business making this determination on a motion to dismiss; there is, after all, nothing in the complaint that establishes that Eastern and other vending machine suppliers operate in a larger market. Eastern also says that even if the district court could reject the university as a valid economic market for distribution, Eastern was still entitled to a fall-back opportunity to conduct discovery to identify some broader but more plausible market in which foreclosure might still be significant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first issue, the district court was entitled to take notice that Ponce is a major city in Puerto Rico and, as a matter of common experience, to recognize that food and beverage machines are customarily accessible at a host of public and business points within cities. The idea that one university campus represents even a majority of the vending machine sales in a large city is so improbable that Eastern's own brief makes no such suggestion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Quite possibly (note Eastern's location in San Juan) distribution is an island-wide business, but it is enough that it is at least municipal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern does say that <i>for students and faculty</i> the campus may be a geographic market in which they purchase snacks and beverages, and we would not rule out this possibility without more information about student habits and nearby locations. <i>See Morales-Villalobos v. Garcia-Llorens,</i> 316 F.3d 51, 54-55 (1st Cir.2003). But, as noted, <i>this</i> student-faculty market, even if real, is already captive to the university and a change in exclusive distributors does not further restrict it. Eastern, by contrast, could be affected by being excluded from the campus, but it is a distributor which, if it can serve the university, is also capable of serving other outlets in Ponce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Eastern's counsel said that his client did not need to identify the geographic and product market in the complaint and could have merely alleged anti-competitive effects in \"a valid economic market.\" Even if this were so &#8212; and different views might be taken on this issue &#8212; it would be no excuse for sustaining a complaint that had shown itself to be inadequate based on the drafter's candor. <i>Jackson v. Marion County,</i> 66 F.3d 151, 153 (7th Cir.1995) (Posner, J.). The time of judges and lawyers is a scarce resource; the sooner a hopeless claim is sent on its way, the more time is available for plausible cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Eastern's fall-back position; as already noted, Eastern argues that even if its initial claim was doomed, it was entitled to add new allegations to the complaint, conduct discovery or both &#8212; aimed at developing other market definitions or theories of antitrust violation. Specifically, Eastern says that in opposing the motion to dismiss, it told the district court that it might eventually urge that the market was all of Ponce or even island-wide, depending upon what discovery revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has several variations, and we start with the easiest, namely, the possibility of amending the complaint. Once the adversary has answered, amendment is no longer allowed as of right, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), but in general permission is liberally granted where there is no prejudice. <i>FDIC v. Consol. Mortgage and Fin. Corp.,</i> 805 F.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir.1986). It is often granted not only pretrial but <i>after</i> a dismissal for failure to state a claim where the court thinks that the case has some promise and there is some excuse for the delay. <i>See</i> 6 Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1488, at 652-69 (2d ed.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refusals to allow amendment are reviewed only for abuse of discretion, <i>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold,</i> 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir.1994), but district judges do not customarily aim to defeat valid claims. Here, little had occurred at the time of dismissal beyond the filing of motion papers. It is a fair guess that if Eastern had moved to amend the complaint after the dismissal <i>and</i> had offered the court some hope of an amendment raising a plausible antitrust claim, amendment would have been allowed. But Eastern did not move to amend and, even now, it neither has a plausible case nor understands what one would require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite some initial confusion, today exclusive dealing contracts are not disfavored by the antitrust laws. <i>Compare Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States,</i> 337 U.S. 293, 306-07, 313-14, 69 S.Ct. 1051, 93 L.Ed. 1371 (1949), <i>with Tampa Elec. Co.,</i> 365 U.S. at 334, 81 S.Ct. 623, and <i>Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde,</i> 466 U.S. 2, 45, 104 S.Ct. 1551, 80 L.Ed.2d 2 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Rather, it is widely recognized that in many circumstances they may be highly efficient &#8212; to assure supply, price stability, outlets, investment, best efforts or the like &#8212; and pose no competitive threat at all. XI Hovenkamp &#182;&#182; 1810-1814b. Ordinarily, such agreements pose a threat to competition only in very discrete circumstances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and much sweat and tears have gone into identifying these criteria. <i>Id.</i> at &#182;&#182; 1802-1807, 1821.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The best example of a possible threat to competition exists where a market is already heavily concentrated and long-term exclusive dealing contracts at either the supplier or distribution end foreclose so large a percentage of the available supply or outlets that entry into the concentrated market is unreasonably constricted. Even here there will normally be no serious effects in certain conditions (<i>e.g.,</i> the contracts are for short terms, new entry at the supplier or outlet business allegedly restrained is easy), but, at a minimum, substantial foreclosure is essential and existing concentration important. <i>See U.S.</i> <i>Healthcare,</i> 986 F.2d at 597; <i>Barr Labs. v. Abbott Labs.,</i> 978 F.2d 98, 111 (3d Cir. 1992); <i>cf.</i> XI Hovenkamp &#182; 1821b-c, at 160-64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no indication that Eastern has any hope of showing substantial foreclosure in a properly defined market. Yes, Eastern might well show that supply of products through vending machines is a geographic market that is municipal, regional or island-wide: likely it is <i>one</i> of these. But Eastern does not remotely suggest that so many potential outlets are foreclosed to it or other competitors by long-term exclusive dealing contracts or other tactics that survival or new entry is infeasible. Being in the distributor business, it ought to know enough to make such an allegation if it were true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the separate and more difficult subject of allowing discovery without insisting upon an amendment. The federal rules adopt so-called notice pleading &#8212; a \"short and plain statement of the claim,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) &#8212; and the case books are full of generalizations seemingly helpful to Eastern: that evidence need not be pled; that discovery is available both to refine claims and to support them; and that claims will be allowed to go forward upon a wrong theory or no theory at all so long as some set of facts encompassed by the complaint would allow recovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the cases also say that it is not enough merely to allege a violation in conclusory terms, that the complaint must make out the rudiments of a valid claim, and that discovery is not for fishing expeditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Often, such sets of dueling over-statements mean that the pertinent variables are too numerous, and the circumstances too various, to reduce the law to a formula; usually, the outcome turns on matters of degree. In all events, discovery is an expensive and burdensome process, and at every stage is subject to control as a matter of sound judicial judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing here suggests that discovery would be remotely productive, apart from the random (and insufficient) possibility that rummaging through Coca Cola's files would produce evidence of some wholly unknown violation. What Eastern mainly says it wants to discover is information about market definition, a matter on which it should already have a good grasp since it is in the business. The <i>further</i> circumstances that would be needed to make out a half-way decent exclusive dealing claim (<i>e.g.,</i> widespread foreclosure and concentration) are ones whose existence is not even hinted at by Eastern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, four years after the filing of the complaint, there continues to be no hint of a coherent and promising antitrust claim. The case remains what it was from the start: a contract and tort case concerned not about whether an economic market will become less competitive but about which of two companies will have exclusive access to supply vending machine food and beverages on a single campus. Eastern may or may not have decent claims under local law but it has no claim arising under the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Naked\" means unconnected with any redeeming larger enterprise<i>See White Motor Co. v.

Eastern alleges that in 1998, in order to secure a donation from Coca Cola to the university, University Services allowed Coca Cola to place its own food and beverage machines on the campus and told Eastern to have the machines it was using removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were negotiations between the parties as to this and other matters. Ultimately, University Services terminated the contract, claiming that Eastern had breached its provisions in various respects; Eastern made similar claims against University Services.

This claim alleged a conspiracy by the two defendants, through unfair business practices, to eliminate competition by Eastern in the supply of food and beverage service within the university.

The university, like most landlords, controls who may set up shop on its premises. It could act as the sole on-campus supplier of food and beverages, allow multiple suppliers, or give exclusive access to one supplier. Here, before the dispute, Eastern was virtually the sole supplier of food and beverages; after, Coca Cola has exclusive control of the vending machine portion of the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, antitrust doctrine does not operate by purely ad hoc judgments as to whether an action adds to or detracts from competition. Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes unlawful contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade and the courts have developed algorithms for implementing this generalization. The easiest way is for the plaintiff to show a \"per se\" violation, that is, that the challenged conduct falls within a small set of acts regarded by courts as sufficiently dangerous, and so clearly without redeeming value, that they are condemned out of hand &#8212; that is without a showing of wrongful purpose, power or effect. <i>See United States v.

This in turn requires the identification of some economic market in which power can be measured and the consequences of the act or transaction assessed.

Where exclusion rather than exploitation is the concern, market share figures help gauge the potential impact of restrictive conduct on suppliers or purchasers. <i>See Tampa Elec.

A defendant's high share is only a presumptive basis for inferring market power (entry barriers to the market may be very low); but a low share is almost always an indication that the defendant lacks market power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, perhaps University Services has power in an economic market: after all, it can set the prices charged students for food simply by making itself the sole distributor. In fact, whether it has power to raise price to a non-competitive level depends on how easy it is for students to find other nearby food suppliers. In any event, if the university has power to charge high prices to those on campus, it can be exploited without regard to whether it contracts with Coca Cola or Eastern or does the job itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, competition in the market to supply vending services &#8212; note that this is a <i>different</i> market &#8212; could in theory be affected by a long-term exclusive franchise contract between the university and Coca Cola: suppose Eastern were the only food distributor in Puerto Rico beside Coca Cola and the latter's long-term contracts with various outlets deprived Eastern of the minimum number necessary to its survival. <i>U.S. Healthcare,</i> 986 F.2d at 595. Even then, one would have to consider whether Eastern could feasibly create <i>new</i> outlets by itself.

Here, Eastern described in its complaint the product as vending machine sales and the geographic area of competition as the university campus. The district court in dismissing the complaint thought that the former was not a meaningful product and the latter was too small and narrowly defined to be a realistic geographic market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can confine ourselves here to the geographic market and assume <i>arguendo</i> that supplying food or beverages through vending machines might be a legitimate product for purposes of market analysis. <i>See Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v.

We also put aside any suggestion that vending sales in the university are too small in dollar terms to be of interest to the Sherman Act. Perhaps Section 1 includes a <i>de minimis</i> dollar requirement based on the interstate commerce element of the offense, <i>Hammes v.

Consider that if food and beverage vending within the university is but a modest fraction of all food and beverage vending distribution in Ponce and Eastern can serve the Ponce area, then foreclosure of the campus segment of the market, even by giving Coca Cola the university franchise for a long period, cannot prevent Eastern from distributing through other vending machine outlets. This is just another way of saying that, except in special circumstances, a contract restricting a small percentage of a larger available market will have no anti-competitive effect on that market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, to put matters in a nutshell, the district court said that the university was obviously a small portion of the distribution market, measured geographically. Eastern says that the district court had no business making this determination on a motion to dismiss; there is, after all, nothing in the complaint that establishes that Eastern and other vending machine suppliers operate in a larger market. Eastern also says that even if the district court could reject the university as a valid economic market for distribution, Eastern was still entitled to a fall-back opportunity to conduct discovery to identify some broader but more plausible market in which foreclosure might still be significant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first issue, the district court was entitled to take notice that Ponce is a major city in Puerto Rico and, as a matter of common experience, to recognize that food and beverage machines are customarily accessible at a host of public and business points within cities. The idea that one university campus represents even a majority of the vending machine sales in a large city is so improbable that Eastern's own brief makes no such suggestion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Quite possibly (note Eastern's location in San Juan) distribution is an island-wide business, but it is enough that it is at least municipal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern does say that <i>for students and faculty</i> the campus may be a geographic market in which they purchase snacks and beverages, and we would not rule out this possibility without more information about student habits and nearby locations. <i>See Morales-Villalobos v. Garcia-Llorens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200287\"><a href=\"/opinion/200287/morales-villalobos-v-garcia-llorens/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 54-55 (1st Cir.2003). But, as noted, <i>this</i> student-faculty market, even if real, is already captive to the university and a change in exclusive distributors does not further restrict it. Eastern, by contrast, could be affected by being excluded from the campus, but it is a distributor which, if it can serve the university, is also capable of serving other outlets in Ponce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Eastern's counsel said that his client did not need to identify the geographic and product market in the complaint and could have merely alleged anti-competitive effects in \"a valid economic market.\" Even if this were so &#8212; and different views might be taken on this issue &#8212; it would be no excuse for sustaining a complaint that had shown itself to be inadequate based on the drafter's candor. <i>Jackson v.

The time of judges and lawyers is a scarce resource; the sooner a hopeless claim is sent on its way, the more time is available for plausible cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Eastern's fall-back position; as already noted, Eastern argues that even if its initial claim was doomed, it was entitled to add new allegations to the complaint, conduct discovery or both &#8212; aimed at developing other market definitions or theories of antitrust violation. Specifically, Eastern says that in opposing the motion to dismiss, it told the district court that it might eventually urge that the market was all of Ponce or even island-wide, depending upon what discovery revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has several variations, and we start with the easiest, namely, the possibility of amending the complaint. Once the adversary has answered, amendment is no longer allowed as of right, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), but in general permission is liberally granted where there is no prejudice. <i>FDIC v. Consol. Mortgage and Fin.

It is often granted not only pretrial but <i>after</i> a dismissal for failure to state a claim where the court thinks that the case has some promise and there is some excuse for the delay. <i>See</i> 6 Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1488, at 652-69 (2d ed.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refusals to allow amendment are reviewed only for abuse of discretion, <i>Resolution Trust Corp. v.

Here, little had occurred at the time of dismissal beyond the filing of motion papers. It is a fair guess that if Eastern had moved to amend the complaint after the dismissal <i>and</i> had offered the court some hope of an amendment raising a plausible antitrust claim, amendment would have been allowed. But Eastern did not move to amend and, even now, it neither has a plausible case nor understands what one would require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite some initial confusion, today exclusive dealing contracts are not disfavored by the antitrust laws. <i>Compare Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v.

Rather, it is widely recognized that in many circumstances they may be highly efficient &#8212; to assure supply, price stability, outlets, investment, best efforts or the like &#8212; and pose no competitive threat at all. XI Hovenkamp &#182;&#182; 1810-1814b. Ordinarily, such agreements pose a threat to competition only in very discrete circumstances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and much sweat and tears have gone into identifying these criteria. <i>Id.</i> at &#182;&#182; 1802-1807, 1821.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The best example of a possible threat to competition exists where a market is already heavily concentrated and long-term exclusive dealing contracts at either the supplier or distribution end foreclose so large a percentage of the available supply or outlets that entry into the concentrated market is unreasonably constricted. Even here there will normally be no serious effects in certain conditions (<i>e.g.,</i> the contracts are for short terms, new entry at the supplier or outlet business allegedly restrained is easy), but, at a minimum, substantial foreclosure is essential and existing concentration important. <i>See U.S.</i> <i>Healthcare,</i> 986 F.2d at 597; <i>Barr Labs. v. Abbott Labs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593306\"><a href=\"/opinion/593306/barr-laboratories-inc-v-abbott-laboratories/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 111 (3d Cir. 1992); <i>cf.</i> XI Hovenkamp &#182; 1821b-c, at 160-64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no indication that Eastern has any hope of showing substantial foreclosure in a properly defined market. Yes, Eastern might well show that supply of products through vending machines is a geographic market that is municipal, regional or island-wide: likely it is <i>one</i> of these. But Eastern does not remotely suggest that so many potential outlets are foreclosed to it or other competitors by long-term exclusive dealing contracts or other tactics that survival or new entry is infeasible. Being in the distributor business, it ought to know enough to make such an allegation if it were true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the separate and more difficult subject of allowing discovery without insisting upon an amendment. The federal rules adopt so-called notice pleading &#8212; a \"short and plain statement of the claim,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) &#8212; and the case books are full of generalizations seemingly helpful to Eastern: that evidence need not be pled; that discovery is available both to refine claims and to support them; and that claims will be allowed to go forward upon a wrong theory or no theory at all so long as some set of facts encompassed by the complaint would allow recovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the cases also say that it is not enough merely to allege a violation in conclusory terms, that the complaint must make out the rudiments of a valid claim, and that discovery is not for fishing expeditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Often, such sets of dueling over-statements mean that the pertinent variables are too numerous, and the circumstances too various, to reduce the law to a formula; usually, the outcome turns on matters of degree. In all events, discovery is an expensive and burdensome process, and at every stage is subject to control as a matter of sound judicial judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing here suggests that discovery would be remotely productive, apart from the random (and insufficient) possibility that rummaging through Coca Cola's files would produce evidence of some wholly unknown violation. What Eastern mainly says it wants to discover is information about market definition, a matter on which it should already have a good grasp since it is in the business. The <i>further</i> circumstances that would be needed to make out a half-way decent exclusive dealing claim (<i>e.g.,</i> widespread foreclosure and concentration) are ones whose existence is not even hinted at by Eastern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, four years after the filing of the complaint, there continues to be no hint of a coherent and promising antitrust claim. The case remains what it was from the start: a contract and tort case concerned not about whether an economic market will become less competitive but about which of two companies will have exclusive access to supply vending machine food and beverages on a single campus. Eastern may or may not have decent claims under local law but it has no claim arising under the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Naked\" means unconnected with any redeeming larger enterprise<i>See White Motor Co. v.
