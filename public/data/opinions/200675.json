Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n               Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n\n              and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Sara Discepolo for appellant.\n     Ernest L. Sarason, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nEdward J. McDonough, Jr., Special Assistant Attorney General, and\n\fThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         October 6, 2003\n\n\n\n\n* Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.    This is an appeal from the district court's\n\ndenial of plaintiff Jesse Caisse's motion to vacate judgment\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).        The district court dismissed\n\nCaisse's action because he failed to serve the defendants with\n\nprocess even after receiving multiple extensions of time to do so.\n\nCaisse sought to vacate the judgment, claiming that he served the\n\ndefendants in a timely fashion. Because the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying Caisse's Rule 60(b) motion, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            In October 2000, Caisse, an inmate in the Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Corrections system, filed a civil rights suit based\n\non the allegedly intolerable conditions of his incarceration.\n\nCaisse    sued   several   state   officials   in   their   individual   and\n\nofficial capacities, including five employees of the Department of\n\nCorrections and the Sheriff of Hampden County, Michael Ashe (the\n\n\"county defendant\").1      In his complaint, Caisse raised six counts\n\nagainst all defendants.      Counts one through three alleged federal\n\n\n\n     1\n       From the Department of Corrections, Caisse named Larry\nDuBois, the former Commissioner of Corrections, Michael Maloney,\nthe Commissioner of Corrections at the time the suit was filed,\nJohn Noonan, the director of the Department of Corrections Health\nCare Services Division, Diane Silver, the director of the\nDepartment of Corrections Classification Division, and William\nCoalter, Department of Corrections Superintendent for MCI Concord\n(the \"Department of Corrections defendants\").\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\flaw violations:       (1) violation of the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. ยง 12101; (2) violation of the Eighth Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution; and (3) violation of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.             Counts four through\n\nsix alleged state-law tort claims: (4) intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress; (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress;\n\nand (6) negligence.         As a remedy for these alleged violations,\n\nCaisse     sought     compensatory      damages,    punitive    damages,   and\n\nattorney's fees.\n\n            After filing suit, Caisse did not attempt to serve the\n\ndefendants for over two years.              He received three extensions of\n\ntime from the district court to effect service, the last of which\n\nexpired on October 25, 2002.           Three days before the October 25th\n\ndeadline, Caisse finally attempted to serve the defendants.                 On\n\nOctober 22, 2002, Caisse sent summonses and copies of the complaint\n\nby   certified      mail   to   each   of   the   Department   of   Corrections\n\ndefendants care of the Boston office of the Massachusetts Attorney\n\nGeneral.     Also on October 22, 2002, Caisse sent a summons and a\n\ncopy of the complaint by certified mail to the county defendant at\n\nthe office of the Treasurer for Hampden County.                Caisse did not\n\nserve any of the defendants personally or at their homes on or\n\nbefore the October 25th deadline.2\n\n\n      2\n       Caisse attempted to serve various defendants after the\ndistrict court had already dismissed his suit. On November 29,\n2002, Caisse served defendants Michael Maloney and William Coalter\n\n                                        -4-\n\f            The October 25th deadline came and went without Caisse\n\nfiling proof of service with the district court.       As a result, on\n\nNovember 26, 2002, the district court dismissed the case.              On\n\nDecember 4, 2002, Caisse filed a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate the\n\ndismissal.3     The district court denied the motion, and Caisse\n\nappealed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Relief under Rule 60(b) is \"extraordinary in nature\" and\n\nis therefore \"granted sparingly.\"       Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288\n\nF.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2002).     To succeed on a Rule 60(b) motion,\n\nthe movant must show that (1) the motion is timely, (2) exceptional\n\ncircumstances    justify   granting   extraordinary   relief,   and   (3)\n\nvacating the judgment will not cause unfair prejudice to the\n\nopposing party.    See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers\n\nUnion, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 19-20\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).    In addition, the movant must show that granting\n\nthe motion will not be an \"empty exercise\" by demonstrating that\n\nthe underlying claim for relief is likely to succeed on the merits.\n\n\n\nby having a constable leave the summons and a copy of the complaint\nat their offices. On December 2, 2002, Caisse served the county\ndefendant by having a constable leave the summons and a copy of the\ncomplaint at the Hampden County Sheriff's Office.\n     3\n       While Caisse did not specify the provision of Rule 60(b)\nwhich he sought to invoke, we assume that his motion was pursuant\nto Rule 60(b)(1) because that provision seems most pertinent. It\npermits relief from judgment in cases of \"mistake, inadvertence,\nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).\n\n                                  -5-\n\fId. at 20.    We defer broadly to the district court's informed\n\ndiscretion in resolving Rule 60(b) motions.           Karak, 288 F.3d at\n\n19.4\n\n                                    III.\n\n           Caisse   claims   that    the   district   court   abused   its\n\ndiscretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion because he properly\n\nserved each of the defendants before the October 25th deadline. He\n\nalso argues that the district court abused its discretion in\n\ndenying his Rule 60(b) motion because \"all cases should be decided\n\non their merits.\"   These arguments fail.      Caisse did not serve the\n\ndefendants by the October 25th deadline, except for counts five and\n\nsix of the complaint, alleging state-law, negligence claims, which\n\nhe timely served only on the Department of Corrections defendants.\n\nHowever, his negligence claims are entirely without merit, making\n\nrelief from judgment unwarranted.\n\n           The parties begin their arguments from a shared but\n\nflawed premise concerning the Rule of Civil Procedure applicable to\n\nthis case.   They contend that, because a suit against a public\n\nemployee in his or her official capacity is essentially a suit\n\nagainst the government, see Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-\n\n\n\n       4\n       Citing In Re Lopez-Soto, 764 F.2d 23 (1st Cir 1985), Caisse\nargues that the abuse of discretion standard is not the proper\nstandard of review for a Rule 60(b) motion. In Re Lopez-Soto deals\nwith the ability of a party to intervene in a bankruptcy\nproceeding. It does not implicate the standard of review for a\nRule 60(b) motion in any way.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f66 (1985), service of Caisse's official capacity claims is governed\n\nby Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(2), which provides the method of service on\n\nstates and other non-federal, government entities.\n\n             In Echevarria-Gonzalez v. Gonzalez-Chapel, 849 F.2d 24,\n\n28-30 (1st Cir. 1988), we rejected this contention.                  We held that\n\nservice of process for public employees sued in their official\n\ncapacities     is   governed    by     the      rule    applicable    to       serving\n\nindividuals.    Id. at 30.      Although recognizing that the state has\n\na great interest in the outcome of an official-capacity suit, we\n\ndeemed it essential that the officer receive service of process as\n\nan individual because he or she is bound by a judgment and can be\n\nheld in contempt for disobeying a court order.                      Id. at 29-30.\n\nAccordingly, to serve the defendants in either an individual or\n\nofficial capacity, Caisse had to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 (e),\n\nproviding for service of process on individuals.                  See id. at 30.\n\n             Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e) specifies two ways\n\nin which Caisse could have served process.                 First, he could have\n\ndelivered    the    summons    and    a    copy    of    the   complaint       to   the\n\nindividuals    personally,     or     he   could   have    left   them     at    their\n\ndwelling houses or usual places of abode.                  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n4(e)(2).      Second,   he    could    have     served    process    in    a    manner\n\nsanctioned by Massachusetts law.                See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1).\n\nCaisse did not serve the defendants in accordance with Fed. R. Civ.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fP. 4(e)(2), so we train our focus on the service requirements under\n\nMassachusetts law.\n\n          The Massachusetts courts have not decided whether service\n\non public employees in their official capacities should be made in\n\ncompliance with the rules for serving individuals, see Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 4 (d)(1), or the rules for serving the state and government\n\norganizations, see Mass. R. Civ. P. 4 (d)(3).     We need not decide\n\nthis open question of Massachusetts law because Caisse failed to\n\nserve the defendants under either of the potentially applicable\n\nrules.\n\n          Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(1), governing\n\nservice on individuals, provides for essentially the same service\n\nprocedures as the cognate federal rule (i.e., personal service or\n\ndelivery to the last and usual place of abode).    As stated above,\n\nCaisse failed to satisfy these requirements and thus did not\n\nproperly serve the defendants in their official capacities under\n\nMass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1).5\n\n          Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(3) provides\n\nfor service on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and state agencies\n\nby sending the summons and the complaint to the Boston office of\n\n\n\n     5\n        While Massachusetts law regarding service of official\ncapacity suits is unsettled, it is clear that individual capacity\nsuits must be served pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). See She\nEnters., Inc. v. License Comm'n of Worcester, 412 N.E.2d 883, 889\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1980).     Caisse therefore failed to serve the\ndefendants in their individual capacities as well.\n\n                               -8-\n\fthe Massachusetts Attorney General and by sending the summons and\n\na copy of the complaint to the state agency involved in the\n\nunderlying    dispute.        Caisse      met   only   half    of     this   rule's\n\nrequirements.        With respect to the Department of Corrections\n\ndefendants, Caisse served the Attorney General but failed to serve\n\nthe Department of Corrections by the October 25th deadline.                     With\n\nrespect to the county defendant, Caisse served the Hampden County\n\nTreasurer's    office      within   the    deadline    but    never    served    the\n\nAttorney General.6         Thus, Caisse failed to comply with Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 4(d)(3) as well.\n\n             There   is,    however,      one   additional      wrinkle.        The\n\nMassachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure yield to specific statutes\n\nwhich establish special service requirements. See Mass. R. Civ. P.\n\n4(d)(1) (\"Service may be made . . . to an agent authorized . . . by\n\nstatute.\").     Caisse's state-law, negligence claims, set forth in\n\ncounts five and six of the complaint, are subject to the statutory\n\nservice requirements of the Massachusetts Torts Claims Act (the\n\n\"Tort Claims Act\"), see Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, ยง1 et seq., which\n\ndiffer from the service requirements of the Massachusetts Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure.7       Therefore, even though he did not comply with\n\n\n     6\n       Hampden County is treated as a state agency because the\nCommonwealth assumed its liabilities after its government was\nabolished in 1998. See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 34B, ยง 4.\n     7\n       Caisse's federal law claims and intentional infliction of\nemotional distress claim are not governed by the service procedures\nunder the Tort Claims Act because the Tort Claims Act covers only\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe   Massachusetts       Rules     of    Civil     Procedure,       Caisse      could\n\neffectively serve the negligence claims by complying with the\n\nrequirements               of       the           Tort         Claims            Act.\n\n           The     Tort    Claims        Act     authorizes     service     on     the\n\nCommonwealth, state agencies, and state employees by serving the\n\nAttorney General.         See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, ยง 6.                By mailing\n\nsummonses and copies of the complaint to the Attorney General on\n\nOctober    22,    2002,    Caisse    timely       served      the    Department    of\n\nCorrections defendants (in both their official and individual\n\ncapacities) with his negligence claims.8              Id.     Thus, Caisse timely\n\nserved only counts five and six (negligent infliction of emotional\n\ndistress    and    negligence)      on     the    Department        of   Corrections\n\ndefendants.9\n\n           Nonetheless, we will not reverse the denial of Caisse's\n\nRule 60(b) motion merely because Caisse served the negligence\n\n\nstate-law, negligence claims. See Mellinger v. West Springfield,\n515 N.E.2d 584, 588-89 (Mass. 1987).\n      8\n       Caisse never served the Attorney General with process for\nthe county defendant and therefore did not serve him with the\nnegligence claims under the Tort Claim Act.\n      9\n       In addition to arguing that he timely served the defendants,\nCaisse could have argued excusable neglect for his failure to\neffect service. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). He has not done so.\nSee Cintron-Lorenzo v. Departmento de Asuntos, 312 F.3d 522, 527\n(1st Cir. 2002) (\"At a bare minimum, a party who seeks relief from\njudgment on the basis of excusable neglect must offer a convincing\nexplanation as to why the neglect was excusable.\"). Caisse's\ncontention that regardless of his failure to serve the defendants\n\"all cases should be decided on the merits\" does not suffice to\nraise the excusable neglect issue.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fclaims on the Department of Corrections defendants in a timely\n\nfashion.    As discussed earlier, Caisse must also convince us that\n\nhe has a realistic chance of succeeding on merits of his negligence\n\nclaims against the Department of Corrections defendants.                 Karak,\n\n288 F.3d at 19.     This he cannot do.\n\n            Caisse's negligence claims against the Department of\n\nCorrections defendants in their individual capacities are barred\n\nbecause the Tort Claims Act shields public employees from personal\n\nliability for negligent conduct.          See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, ยง 2;\n\nsee also, McNamara v. Honeyman, 546 N.E.2d 139, 141-42 (Mass. 1989)\n\n(public employees are immune from negligence suits under the Tort\n\nClaims Act). Thus, Caisse's individual-capacity, negligence claims\n\nagainst the Department of Corrections defendants will fail on the\n\nmerits.\n\n            Prospects are no better for Caisse's official-capacity,\n\nnegligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants\n\nbecause these claims will not survive Eleventh Amendment scrutiny.\n\nSee U.S. Const. Amend. XI.      Caisse's complaint seeks money damages\n\nbut not injunctive relief.        Absent an explicit waiver from the\n\nstate,    the   Eleventh   Amendment   bars   \"official     capacity     suits\"\n\nagainst state     actors   in   federal    court   unless   the   suit    seeks\n\nprospective injunctive relief.         See Rosie D. v. Swift, 310 F.3d\n\n230, 234 (1st Cir. 2002).         By enacting the Massachusetts Tort\n\nClaims Act, the Commonwealth has not waived its Eleventh Amendment\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fimmunity to suit in federal court. See Rivera v. Massachusetts, 16\n\nF. Supp. 2d 84, 87-88 (D. Mass. 1998) (citing Irwin v. Comm'r of\n\nDep't of Youth Servs., 448 N.E.2d 721, (Mass. 1983)).       Thus,\n\nCaisse's official-capacity suits will also fail on the merits.\n\n                               IV.\n\n          The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying plaintiff Jesse Caisse's Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion\n\nbecause most of his claims were not properly served and those few\n\nclaims that were properly served are doomed to fail on the merits.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

Counts four through six alleged state-law tort claims: (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (6) negligence.

Three days before the October 25th deadline, Caisse finally attempted to serve the defendants. On October 22, 2002, Caisse sent summonses and copies of the complaint by certified mail to each of the Department of Corrections defendants care of the Boston office of the Massachusetts Attorney General. Also on October 22, 2002, Caisse sent a summons and a copy of the complaint by certified mail to the county defendant at the office of the Treasurer for Hampden County.

He also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion because \"all cases should be decided on their merits.\" These arguments fail. Caisse did not serve the defendants by the October 25th deadline, except for counts five and six of the complaint, alleging state-law, negligence claims, which he timely served only on the Department of Corrections defendants. However, his negligence claims are entirely without merit, making relief from judgment unwarranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties begin their arguments from a shared but flawed premise concerning the Rule of Civil Procedure applicable to this case. They contend that, because a suit against a public employee in his or her official capacity is essentially a suit against the government, <i>see Kentucky v. Graham,</i> 473 U.S. 159, 165-66, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985), service of Caisse's official capacity claims is governed by Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(j)(2), which provides the method of service on states and other non-federal, government entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Echevarria-Gonzalez v. Gonzalez-Chapel,</i> 849 F.2d 24, 28-30 (1st Cir. 1988), we rejected this contention. We held that service of process for public employees sued in their official capacities is governed by the rule applicable to serving individuals. <i>Id.</i> at 30. Although recognizing that the state has a great interest in the outcome of an official-capacity suit, we deemed it essential that the officer receive service of process as an individual because he or she is bound by a judgment and can be held in contempt for disobeying a court order. <i>Id.</i> at 29-30. Accordingly, to serve the defendants in either an individual <i>or</i> official capacity, Caisse had to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e), providing for service of process on individuals. <i>See id.</i> at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e) specifies two ways in which Caisse could have served process. First, he could have delivered the summons and a copy of the complaint to the individuals personally, or he could have left them at their dwelling houses or usual places of abode. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(e)(2). Second, he could have served process in a manner sanctioned by Massachusetts law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e)(1). Caisse did not serve the defendants in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e)(2), so we train our focus on the service requirements under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts courts have not decided whether service on public employees in their official capacities should be made in compliance with the rules for serving individuals, <i>see</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1), or the rules for serving the state and government organizations, <i>see</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3). We need not decide this open question of Massachusetts law because Caisse failed to serve the defendants under either of the potentially applicable rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(1), governing service on individuals, provides for essentially the same service procedures as the cognate federal rule (<i>i.e.,</i> personal service or delivery to the last and usual place of abode). As stated above, Caisse failed to satisfy these requirements and thus did not properly serve the defendants in their official capacities under Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(3) provides for service on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and state agencies by sending the summons and the complaint to the Boston office of the Massachusetts Attorney General <i>and</i> by sending the summons and a copy of the complaint to the state agency involved in the underlying dispute. Caisse met only half of this rule's requirements. With respect to the Department of Corrections defendants, Caisse served the Attorney General but failed to serve the Department of Corrections by the October 25th deadline. With respect to the county defendant, Caisse served the Hampden County Treasurer's office within the deadline but never served the Attorney General.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, Caisse failed to comply with Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3) as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, one additional wrinkle. The Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure yield to specific statutes which establish special service requirements. <i>See</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1) (\"Service may be made ... to an agent authorized ... by statute.\"). Caisse's state-law, negligence claims, set forth in counts five and six of the complaint, are subject to the statutory service requirements of the Massachusetts Torts Claims Act (the \"Tort Claims Act\"), <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, &#167; 1 <i>et seq.,</i> which differ from the service requirements of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Therefore, even though he did not comply with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Caisse could effectively serve the negligence claims by complying with the requirements of the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tort Claims Act authorizes service on the Commonwealth, state agencies, and state employees by serving the Attorney General. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, &#167; 6. By mailing summonses and copies of the complaint to the Attorney General on October 22, 2002, Caisse timely served the Department of Corrections defendants (in both their official and individual capacities) with his negligence claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> Thus, Caisse timely served only counts five and six (negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligence) on the Department of Corrections defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we will not reverse the denial of Caisse's Rule 60(b) motion merely because Caisse served the negligence claims on the Department of Corrections defendants in a timely fashion. As discussed earlier, Caisse must also convince us that he has a realistic chance of succeeding on the merits of his negligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants. <i>Karak,</i> 288 F.3d at 19. This he cannot do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caisse's negligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants in their individual capacities are barred because the Tort Claims Act shields public employees from personal liability for negligent conduct. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, &#167; 2; <i>see also, McNamara v. Honeyman,</i> 406 Mass. 43, 546 N.E.2d 139, 141-42 (1989) (public employees are immune from negligence suits under the Tort Claims Act). Thus, Caisse's individual-capacity, negligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants will fail on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prospects are no better for Caisse's official-capacity, negligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants because these claims will not survive Eleventh Amendment scrutiny. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. Amend. XI. Caisse's complaint seeks money damages but not injunctive relief. Absent an explicit waiver from the state, the Eleventh Amendment bars \"official capacity suits\" against state actors in federal court unless the suit seeks prospective injunctive relief. <i>See Rosie D. v. Swift,</i> 310 F.3d 230, 234 (1st Cir.2002). By enacting the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, the Commonwealth has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in federal court. <i>See Rivera v. Massachusetts,</i> 16 F.Supp.2d 84, 87-88 (D.Mass.1998) (citing <i>Irwin v. Comm'r of Dep't of Youth Servs.,</i> 388 Mass. 810, 448 N.E.2d 721, 727 (1983)).

We held that service of process for public employees sued in their official capacities is governed by the rule applicable to serving individuals. <i>Id.</i> at 30. Although recognizing that the state has a great interest in the outcome of an official-capacity suit, we deemed it essential that the officer receive service of process as an individual because he or she is bound by a judgment and can be held in contempt for disobeying a court order. <i>Id.</i> at 29-30. Accordingly, to serve the defendants in either an individual <i>or</i> official capacity, Caisse had to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e), providing for service of process on individuals. <i>See id.</i> at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e) specifies two ways in which Caisse could have served process. First, he could have delivered the summons and a copy of the complaint to the individuals personally, or he could have left them at their dwelling houses or usual places of abode. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(e)(2). Second, he could have served process in a manner sanctioned by Massachusetts law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e)(1). Caisse did not serve the defendants in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e)(2), so we train our focus on the service requirements under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts courts have not decided whether service on public employees in their official capacities should be made in compliance with the rules for serving individuals, <i>see</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1), or the rules for serving the state and government organizations, <i>see</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3). We need not decide this open question of Massachusetts law because Caisse failed to serve the defendants under either of the potentially applicable rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(1), governing service on individuals, provides for essentially the same service procedures as the cognate federal rule (<i>i.e.,</i> personal service or delivery to the last and usual place of abode). As stated above, Caisse failed to satisfy these requirements and thus did not properly serve the defendants in their official capacities under Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(3) provides for service on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and state agencies by sending the summons and the complaint to the Boston office of the Massachusetts Attorney General <i>and</i> by sending the summons and a copy of the complaint to the state agency involved in the underlying dispute. Caisse met only half of this rule's requirements. With respect to the Department of Corrections defendants, Caisse served the Attorney General but failed to serve the Department of Corrections by the October 25th deadline. With respect to the county defendant, Caisse served the Hampden County Treasurer's office within the deadline but never served the Attorney General.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, Caisse failed to comply with Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3) as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, one additional wrinkle. The Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure yield to specific statutes which establish special service requirements. <i>See</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1) (\"Service may be made ... to an agent authorized ... by statute.\"). Caisse's state-law, negligence claims, set forth in counts five and six of the complaint, are subject to the statutory service requirements of the Massachusetts Torts Claims Act (the \"Tort Claims Act\"), <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, &#167; 1 <i>et seq.,</i> which differ from the service requirements of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Therefore, even though he did not comply with the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Caisse could effectively serve the negligence claims by complying with the requirements of the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tort Claims Act authorizes service on the Commonwealth, state agencies, and state employees by serving the Attorney General. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, &#167; 6. By mailing summonses and copies of the complaint to the Attorney General on October 22, 2002, Caisse timely served the Department of Corrections defendants (in both their official and individual capacities) with his negligence claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> Thus, Caisse timely served only counts five and six (negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligence) on the Department of Corrections defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we will not reverse the denial of Caisse's Rule 60(b) motion merely because Caisse served the negligence claims on the Department of Corrections defendants in a timely fashion. As discussed earlier, Caisse must also convince us that he has a realistic chance of succeeding on the merits of his negligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants. <i>Karak,</i> 288 F.3d at 19. This he cannot do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caisse's negligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants in their individual capacities are barred because the Tort Claims Act shields public employees from personal liability for negligent conduct. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, &#167; 2; <i>see also, McNamara v. Honeyman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240083\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240083/mcnamara-v-honeyman/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240083\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240083/mcnamara-v-honeyman/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 141-42 (1989) (public employees are immune from negligence suits under the Tort Claims Act). Thus, Caisse's individual-capacity, negligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants will fail on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prospects are no better for Caisse's official-capacity, negligence claims against the Department of Corrections defendants because these claims will not survive Eleventh Amendment scrutiny. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. Amend. XI. Caisse's complaint seeks money damages but not injunctive relief. Absent an explicit waiver from the state, the Eleventh Amendment bars \"official capacity suits\" against state actors in federal court unless the suit seeks prospective injunctive relief. <i>See Rosie D. v. Swift,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200198\"><a href=\"/opinion/200198/rosie-d-v-swift/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 234 (1st Cir.2002). By enacting the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, the Commonwealth has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in federal court. <i>See Rivera v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460575\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460575/rivera-v-com-of-mass/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
