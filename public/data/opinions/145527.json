On the evening of July 21, 2007,\n\nMoise William's car was halted at a sobriety checkpoint on New\n\nHampshire    Route    28    manned   by   Auburn,   New   Hampshire,    police\n\nofficers.    The checkpoint had been authorized by a state judge on\n\npetition of the town's police department.             All vehicles     (except\n\ntractor    trailers   due    to   parking-space     problems)   were   stopped\n\nbriefly.    When William rolled down the driver's side window, the\n\nofficer who had approached smelled marijuana and noticed that\n\nWilliam's eyes were glassy and bloodshot.                 The officer asked\n\nWilliam to step out of the car.\n\n            In the ensuing search of the car, marijuana was found.\n\nDuring the search, a fireman standing nearby saw William throw a\n\npackage on the ground; later testing revealed it to contain crack\n\ncocaine.    A further search with a drug-sniffing dog revealed more\n\nmarijuana in the car.         William was arrested and indicted on two\n\ncounts of possessing a controlled substance, one for marijuana and\n\nthe other for \"cocaine base ('crack').\" 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) (2006).\n\nThe government also alleged that the crack cocaine weighed three or\n\nmore grams and filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851\n\nalleging that William had a prior conviction for possession of\n\ncrack cocaine.\n\n            William moved to suppress all of the drug evidence on the\n\nground that the drugs were the fruits of an illegal stop.                 The\n\ndistrict court held a hearing, heard testimony, and concluded that\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthe stop of William's car was lawful.      In response to a second\n\nmotion to suppress, the court also held that the car search was\n\nlawful, but that issue is not before us on this appeal.   Thereafter\n\nWilliam was tried on both counts.\n\n           Among the items seized when William was stopped was a\n\nwrapper containing eleven small bags. At trial a government expert\n\ntestified that these contained crack cocaine weighing approximately\n\n3.6 grams; but pursuant to laboratory policy, the expert had\n\nweighed only five of the eleven bags, determined the average weight\n\nper bag, and multiplied by eleven to estimate the total weight of\n\nall of the bags.   The five bags tested weighed 1.64 grams, making\n\nthe expert's estimate 3.6 grams for all eleven.1\n\n          Although the weight went only to penalty, the issue was\n\nsubmitted to the jury--as required by Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\n\nU.S. 466 (2000)--because a weight exceeding three grams would raise\n\nthe maximum possible penalty.   21 U.S.C. § 844(a).   The trial judge\n\nexpressed unease about the chemist's method, given that the margin\n\nwas small (3 grams versus 3.6) and the standard of proof was\n\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"      However, the trial court denied\n\nWilliam's motion seeking a judgment of acquittal based on the\n\nweight issue, Fed. R. Crim. P. 29, and the jury convicted William\n\n\n\n     1\n      The chemist also testified that he tested only five of the\neleven bags to determine whether the substance inside was cocaine\nbase in the form of crack cocaine, but that all of the bags\ncontained \"an off-white powdery chunky material.\"\n\n                                -3-\n\fon both counts and found by special verdict that the total amount\n\nof crack cocaine exceeded three grams.\n\n             In sentencing William on the crack cocaine conviction,\n\nthe trial court applied a statutory provision, 21 U.S.C. § 844(a),\n\nsetting a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for possession of\n\nmore than three grams of cocaine base when the defendant has a\n\n\"prior conviction. . . under this subsection.\" The court sentenced\n\nWilliam to the five-year prison term, to run concurrently with a\n\none-year sentence for possession of marijuana. William now appeals\n\nto challenge both his conviction and sentence on the crack cocaine\n\ncharge.\n\n           The challenge to the conviction rests solely on the\n\nlawfulness of the stop.        Although individualized suspicion is\n\nnormally required for a car stop and \"probable cause\" is required\n\nfor an arrest, the Fourth Amendment rubric is \"reasonableness.\"\n\nCity of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 37 (2000); United\n\nStates v. Almeida, 434 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2006).               Under this\n\nrubric, the Supreme Court has permitted vehicle checkpoints and\n\nvery brief inquiries of all drivers for certain purposes and with\n\ncertain   safeguards:   one   of   the    allowed   uses   is   for   sobriety\n\ncheckpoints, the principal authority being Michigan Department of\n\nState Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990).2\n\n\n     2\n      See also Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.S. 419, 423-28 (2004)\n(upholding checkpoint to locate witnesses to a hit-and-run); United\nStates v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 545 (1976) (upholding\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            The threshold requirement under Sitz and Edmond--that\n\nsobriety concerns be the primary purpose of the checkpoint--is met\n\nin this case.      See Edmond, 531 U.S. at 47-48; Sitz, 496 U.S. at\n\n451.      New   Hampshire   has   a   general   procedure   for    authorizing\n\nsobriety checkpoints; and in this case a plan was submitted and\n\napproved by a state judge, and the directions to the officers were\n\nconsistent with operating a sobriety checkpoint.            The police were\n\naware that other crimes might come to light; thus, a drug-sniffing\n\ndog was kept in reserve but brought forward to William's car only\n\nafter drugs had been initially found due to William's appearance\n\nand the odor of marijuana.\n\n            William's argument that the checkpoint's primary purpose\n\nwas something other than detecting impaired driving consists mostly\n\nof objections to the quality of the statistical data cited in the\n\npetition seeking approval for the checkpoint.           But such weaknesses\n\ngive no reason in this case to think that the district court\n\nclearly    erred   in   concluding    that   the   government     was   in   fact\n\nconducting a sobriety checkpoint. United States v. Green, 293 F.3d\n\n855, 859 (5th Cir. 2002) (reviewing district court findings on\n\nprimary purpose for clear error); United States v. Davis, 270 F.3d\n\n977, 980 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same).\n\n            William cites two decisions from the District of Columbia\n\nCircuit that have found traffic checkpoints doubtful in particular\n\n\ncheckpoint near border to detect illegal aliens).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcases, but in both cases, the evidence suggested that the stops\n\nwere not primarily vehicle registration checks, as the officers\n\nclaimed, but rather general anti-crime stops implemented as part of\n\nbroader crime-control task forces.      See United States v. Bowman,\n\n496 F.3d 685, 693-94 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (remanding for further fact-\n\nfinding on primary purpose); United States v. Davis, 270 F.3d 977,\n\n981-82 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same).    The reasons for allowing one kind\n\nof use and barring another can be debated; but the short answer is\n\nthat the Supreme Court has thus distinguished and that is the end\n\nof the matter.   Edmond, 531 U.S. at 47-48.\n\n           Other cases William cites likewise involved affirmative\n\nevidence that the checkpoint's stated purpose was pretextual.\n\nUnited States v. Huguenin, 154 F.3d 547, 555-56 (6th Cir. 1998)\n\n(checkpoint funded by drug interdiction sources was supervised by\n\nnarcotics officer); United States v. Ramirez-Gonzalez, 87 F.3d 712,\n\n715-16 (5th Cir. 1996) (remanding for an evidentiary hearing based\n\non similar evidence).   Unlike those cases, William does not show\n\nthat the Auburn checkpoint was part of some task force or program\n\naimed at some purpose other than sobriety.\n\n          Beyond assessing the legitimacy of the purpose, Sitz and\n\nother checkpoint cases have used Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 50-51\n\n(1979), as the source of a further balancing test for determining\n\nthe reasonableness of the checkpoint.      Several formulations have\n\nbeen used but a helpful summary is provided by a Fourth Circuit\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fdecision, United States v. Henson, No. 08-4221, 2009 WL 3792435, at\n\n*2 (4th Cir. Nov. 13, 2009) (citations omitted):\n\n             If the primary purpose was valid, the court\n             must     then     judge    the    checkpoint's\n             reasonableness on the basis of individual\n             circumstances. . . . This requires balancing\n             \"'the gravity of the public concerns served by\n             the seizure, the degree to which the seizure\n             advances the public interest, and the severity\n             of the interference with individual liberty.'\"\n             . . . Factors to weigh intrusiveness include\n             whether the checkpoint: (1) is clearly\n             visible; (2) is part of some systematic\n             procedure     that    strictly    limits    the\n             discretionary authority of police officers;\n             and (3) detains drivers no longer than is\n             reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose\n             of checking a license and registration, unless\n             other   facts   come    to  light  creating   a\n             reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n\n             In the present case, Sitz establishes the \"gravity of the\n\npublic concerns\" with the death and injury toll taken by drunken\n\ndrivers and the fact that sobriety checkpoints can \"advance the\n\npublic interest\" sufficiently to make such a checkpoint reasonable.\n\n496 U.S. at 451.     William argues, however, that the data offered to\n\nsupport the use of this checkpoint at this location was inadequate\n\nand   that    the   results   in   arrest   numbers   were   unimpressive.\n\nCertainly one can imagine a purported sobriety checkpoint whose\n\nlocation or timing was demonstrably unlikely to be of use.\n\n             But in Sitz, Chief Justice Rehnquist went out of his way\n\nto say that whether and where to establish a stop is primarily a\n\njudgment for state or local officials.          496 U.S. at 453-54.    In\n\naddition, using the number of drunk driving arrests resulting from\n\n                                     -7-\n\fa specific checkpoint has at least two problems: one is that the\n\nreasonableness    of    the   effort    is    primarily   a   forward-looking\n\nexercise (in fact, the percentage of arrests in Sitz was very low,\n\nid. at 455); and the other is that sobriety checkpoints likely have\n\na deterrent value apart from immediate detentions resulting from\n\nthe stops.\n\n          In     this   case,   the     police     petition   and    affidavit\n\nsupporting the court order showed that the checkpoint was on a\n\nregularly used highway and that the days and the hours selected\n\nwere nights in or around weekends when party-going would be most\n\nlikely to generate drunk driving.            Much of the data offered in the\n\npetition in this case as to drunk driving and the utility of checks\n\nrelated to New Hampshire rather than the location chosen; but in\n\nSitz most of the data was nationwide.             496 U.S. at 451.    This is\n\nfar from the case of a checkpoint on a dead-end road.\n\n          The other concerns in Brown v. Texas center around the\n\nintrusiveness of the search and its potential for abuse.                 This\n\nbegins with the distinction drawn by the courts between fixed\n\ncheckpoints and random \"roving\" stops that are highly stressful for\n\nthe innocent individual pulled over by flashing lights and siren.\n\nSitz, 496 U.S. at 452-53; Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 558.                An\n\norderly checkpoint usually reveals itself as a general stop of all\n\nvehicles and is deemed less alarming. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at\n\n559.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            William argues that the checkpoint in this case was not\n\nwell-marked, that it was operated in a sloppy fashion, and that the\n\nhandling of William's drug evidence was badly documented.             But the\n\ncheckpoint constrained officers' discretion in the areas most\n\nimportant to the constitutional analysis: the checkpoint occurred\n\nat   a   fixed   location,   the   officers   stopped   every   car   passing\n\nthrough, and further investigation occurred only if individualized\n\nsuspicion developed.     The concerns with roving stops and unlimited\n\nofficer discretion were absent. Sitz, 496 U.S. at 452-54; Delaware\n\nv. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 661 (1979).\n\n            In   his   opening     brief,   William   also   challenged   his\n\nsentence.    In sentencing William for the cocaine base conviction,\n\nthe trial court applied a provision of 42 U.S.C. § 844(a) fixing a\n\nfive-year mandatory minimum sentence for possession of more than\n\nthree grams of cocaine base where, as alleged here, the defendant\n\nhas a prior conviction under that subsection.            William argues to\n\nus, as he did to the trial judge, that the evidence of weight was\n\ninadequate and warranted a judgment of acquittal as to weight.\n\n            The main argument is that the weighing of five bags out\n\nof eleven was insufficient absent a basis for the jury to be sure\n\nthe bags were similar in weight, and the expert gave no specific\n\nreason to support the assumption.             The trial judge, as noted,\n\nshared the defendant's doubt but left the issue to the jury.\n\nWilliam points out that, given the sentencing jurisprudence, the\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fweight issue required a finding beyond a reasonable doubt to raise\n\nthe permissible maximum above the one-year default.            See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 844(a); United States v. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31, 36-37 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n               The problem is an ongoing one.         Reasonable estimation\n\ntechniques are permitted;3 it is perhaps implicit here that the\n\nexpert deemed the bags comparable in weight, and, in addition, the\n\nbags were available to the jury who could judge from appearance.4\n\nIndeed, the bags may well have been professionally prepared for\n\nsale,       which    would   support   the   inference;   William   had   three\n\ncellphones and lots of cash in his possession when arrested.\n\nStill, the margin (3.6 grams as against 3) was not large and only\n\na couple of light weight bags among those unweighed could have made\n\nthe difference.\n\n               We need not pursue the issue--one could say much more on\n\nboth sides--beyond agreeing with the trial judge that this was a\n\nclose case and therefore a warning to prosecutors in future cases:\n\nit would have been easy to shore up the estimate as the case headed\n\nfor trial.          However, both sides agree that on appeal a clear-cut\n\n\n\n        3\n      United States v. Correa-Alicea, 585 F.3d 484, 489-91 (1st\nCir. 2009); United States v. Rodriquez, 525 F.3d 85, 107-09 (1st\nCir. 2008).\n        4\n      Although defense counsel points out that the tested drugs\nfrom five of the bags were no longer in lump form, uniformity in\nsize of the lumps in the remaining six bags would still permit an\ninference that all of the bags were roughly uniform.\n\n                                       -10-\n\ferror in sentencing has now come to light that precludes the use of\n\nthe higher sentence even if weight exceeded three grams and that\n\nWilliam has already served what may well be the maximum sentence\n\nfor his offense.\n\n            The provision applied to William--a five-year minimum and\n\na twenty-year maximum--required not only more than three grams of\n\ncocaine but also a \"prior conviction . . . under this subsection.\"\n\n21 U.S.C. § 844(a).         William's prior conviction, both sides now\n\nagree,    was   for   a   state   drug   offense   and   does    not   meet   the\n\nrequirements of § 844(a) for a sentence above two years.\n\n            William's prior state law conviction did increase the\n\nstatutory range to more than the default maximum of one year: where\n\nthe defendant has \"a prior conviction for any drug, narcotic, or\n\nchemical offense chargeable under the law of any State,\" the\n\nminimum term is fifteen days and the maximum term is two years.\n\nId..     Weight is irrelevant to this provision and, although the\n\nissue was not raised in the district court, the government concedes\n\nplain error in a sentence exceeding two years.\n\n            When this concession was made, William had served more\n\nthan two years in jail and so might have been released on bail\n\npending review, but he rejected the proposal for reasons relating\n\nto exposure to possible deportation proceedings.                Accordingly, we\n\nnow affirm his conviction, vacate his sentence and remand the case\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fto the district court for re-sentencing.   The mandate will issue\n\nforthwith without prejudice to any petition for rehearing.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

Unlike those cases, William does not show that the Auburn checkpoint was part of some task force or program aimed at some purpose other than sobriety.</p>\n<p>Beyond assessing the legitimacy of the purpose, <i>Sitz</i> and other checkpoint cases have used <i>Brown v. Texas,</i> 443 U.S. 47, 50-51, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979), as the source of a further balancing test for determining the reasonableness of the checkpoint. Several formulations have been used but a helpful summary is provided by a Fourth Circuit decision, <i>United States v. Henson,</i> No. 08-4221, 2009 WL 3792435, at *2 (4th Cir. Nov. 13, 2009) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote>If the primary purpose was valid, the court must then judge the checkpoint's reasonableness on the basis of individual circumstances.... This requires balancing \"`the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty.'\" ... Factors to weigh intrusiveness include whether the checkpoint: (1) is clearly visible; (2) is part of some systematic procedure that strictly limits the discretionary authority of police officers; and (3) detains drivers no longer than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of checking a license and registration, unless other facts come to light creating a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p>In the present case, <i>Sitz</i> establishes the \"gravity of the public concerns\" with the death and injury toll taken by drunken drivers and the fact that sobriety checkpoints can \"advance the public interest\" sufficiently to make such a checkpoint reasonable. 496 U.S. at 451, 110 S.Ct. 2481. William argues, however, that the data offered to support the use of <i>this</i> checkpoint at <i>this</i> location was inadequate and that the results in arrest numbers were unimpressive. Certainly one can imagine a purported sobriety checkpoint whose location or timing was demonstrably unlikely to be of use.</p>\n<p>But in <i>Sitz,</i> Chief Justice Rehnquist went out of his way to say that whether and where to establish a stop is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> primarily a judgment for state or local officials. 496 U.S. at 453-54, 110 S.Ct. 2481. In addition, using the number of drunk driving arrests resulting from a specific checkpoint has at least two problems: one is that the reasonableness of the effort is primarily a forward-looking exercise (in fact, the percentage of arrests in <i>Sitz</i> was very low, <i>id.</i> at 455, 110 S.Ct. 2481); and the other is that sobriety checkpoints likely have a deterrent value apart from immediate detentions resulting from the stops.</p>\n<p>In this case, the police petition and affidavit supporting the court order showed that the checkpoint was on a regularly used highway and that the days and the hours selected were nights in or around weekends when party-going would be most likely to generate drunk driving. Much of the data offered in the petition in this case as to drunk driving and the utility of checks related to New Hampshire rather than the location chosen; but in <i>Sitz</i> most of the data was nationwide. 496 U.S. at 451, 110 S.Ct. 2481. This is far from the case of a checkpoint on a dead-end road.</p>\n<p>The other concerns in <i>Brown v. Texas</i> center around the intrusiveness of the search and its potential for abuse. This begins with the distinction drawn by the courts between fixed checkpoints and random \"roving\" stops that are highly stressful for the innocent individual pulled over by flashing lights and siren. <i>Sitz,</i> 496 U.S. at 452-53, 110 S.Ct. 2481; <i>Martinez-Fuerte,</i> 428 U.S. at 558, 96 S.Ct. 3074. An orderly checkpoint usually reveals itself as a general stop of all vehicles and is deemed less alarming. <i>Martinez-Fuerte,</i> 428 U.S. at 559, 96 S.Ct. 3074.</p>\n<p>William argues that the checkpoint in this case was not well-marked, that it was operated in a sloppy fashion, and that the handling of William's drug evidence was badly documented. But the checkpoint constrained officers' discretion in the areas most important to the constitutional analysis: the checkpoint occurred at a fixed location, the officers stopped every car passing through, and further investigation occurred only if individualized suspicion developed. The concerns with roving stops and unlimited officer discretion were absent. <i>Sitz,</i> 496 U.S. at 452-54, 110 S.Ct. 2481; <i>Delaware v. Prouse,</i> 440 U.S. 648, 661, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979).</p>\n<p>In his opening brief, William also challenged his sentence. In sentencing William for the cocaine base conviction, the trial court applied a provision of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) fixing a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for possession of more than three grams of cocaine base where, as alleged here, the defendant has a prior conviction under that subsection. William argues to us, as he did to the trial judge, that the evidence of weight was inadequate and warranted a judgment of acquittal as to weight.</p>\n<p>The main argument is that the weighing of five bags out of eleven was insufficient absent a basis for the jury to be sure the bags were similar in weight, and the expert gave no specific reason to support the assumption. The trial judge, as noted, shared the defendant's doubt but left the issue to the jury. William points out that, given the sentencing jurisprudence, the weight issue required a finding beyond a reasonable doubt to raise the permissible maximum above the one-year default. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 844(a); <i>United States v. Eirby,</i> 262 F.3d 31, 36-37 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The problem is an ongoing one. Reasonable estimation techniques are permitted;<sup>[3]</sup> it is perhaps implicit here that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> expert deemed the bags comparable in weight, and, in addition, the bags were available to the jury who could judge from appearance.<sup>[4]</sup> Indeed, the bags may well have been professionally prepared for sale, which would support the inference; William had three cellphones and lots of cash in his possession when arrested. Still, the margin (3.6 grams as against 3) was not large and only a couple of light weight bags among those unweighed could have made the difference.</p>\n<p>We need not pursue the issue  one could say much more on both sides  beyond agreeing with the trial judge that this was a close case and therefore a warning to prosecutors in future cases: it would have been easy to shore up the estimate as the case headed for trial. However, both sides agree that on appeal a clear-cut error in sentencing has now come to light that precludes the use of the higher sentence even if weight exceeded three grams and that William has already served what may well be the maximum sentence for his offense.</p>\n<p>The provision applied to William  a five-year minimum and a twenty-year maximum  required not only more than three grams of cocaine but also a \"prior conviction... under this subsection.\" 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). William's prior conviction, both sides now agree, was for a <i>state</i> drug offense and does not meet the requirements of § 844(a) for a sentence above two years.</p>\n<p>William's prior state law conviction did increase the statutory range to more than the default maximum of one year: where the defendant has \"a prior conviction for any drug, narcotic, or chemical offense chargeable under the law of any State,\" the minimum term is fifteen days and the maximum term is two years. <i>Id.</i> Weight is irrelevant to this provision and, although the issue was not raised in the district court, the government concedes plain error in a sentence exceeding two years.</p>\n<p>When this concession was made, William had served more than two years in jail and so might have been released on bail pending review, but he rejected the proposal for reasons relating to exposure to possible deportation proceedings. Accordingly, we now <i>affirm</i> his conviction, <i>vacate</i> his sentence and <i>remand</i> the case to the district court for re-sentencing. The mandate will issue forthwith without prejudice to any petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The chemist also testified that he tested only five of the eleven bags to determine whether the substance inside was cocaine base in the form of crack cocaine, but that all of the bags contained \"an off-white powdery chunky material.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See also </i><i>Illinois v.

The checkpoint had been authorized by a state judge on petition of the town's police department. All vehicles (except tractor trailers due to parking-space problems) were stopped briefly. When William rolled down the driver's side window, the officer who had approached smelled marijuana and noticed that William's eyes were glassy and bloodshot. The officer asked William to step out of the car.</p>\n<p>In the ensuing search of the car, marijuana was found. During the search, a fireman standing nearby saw William throw a package on the ground; later testing revealed it to contain crack cocaine. A further search with a drug-sniffing dog revealed more marijuana in the car. William was arrested and indicted on two counts of possessing a controlled substance, one for marijuana and the other for \"cocaine base ('crack').\" 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) (2006). The government also alleged that the crack cocaine weighed three or more grams and filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851 alleging that William had a prior conviction for possession of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p>William moved to suppress all of the drug evidence on the ground that the drugs were the fruits of an illegal stop. The district court held a hearing, heard testimony, and concluded that the stop of William's car was lawful. In response to a second motion to suppress, the court also held that the car search was lawful, but that issue is not before us on this appeal. Thereafter William was tried on both counts.</p>\n<p>Among the items seized when William was stopped was a wrapper containing eleven small bags. At trial a government expert testified that these contained crack cocaine weighing approximately 3.6 grams; but pursuant to laboratory policy, the expert had weighed only five of the eleven bags, determined the average weight per bag, and multiplied by eleven to estimate the total weight of all of the bags. The five bags tested weighed 1.64 grams, making <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> the expert's estimate 3.6 grams for all eleven.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the weight went only to penalty, the issue was submitted to the jury  as required by <i>Apprendi v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2481</span></a></span>. William argues, however, that the data offered to support the use of <i>this</i> checkpoint at <i>this</i> location was inadequate and that the results in arrest numbers were unimpressive. Certainly one can imagine a purported sobriety checkpoint whose location or timing was demonstrably unlikely to be of use.</p>\n<p>But in <i>Sitz,</i> Chief Justice Rehnquist went out of his way to say that whether and where to establish a stop is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> primarily a judgment for state or local officials. 496 U.S. at 453-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112459\"><a href=\"/opinion/112459/michigan-dept-of-state-police-v-sitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2481</span></a></span>. In addition, using the number of drunk driving arrests resulting from a specific checkpoint has at least two problems: one is that the reasonableness of the effort is primarily a forward-looking exercise (in fact, the percentage of arrests in <i>Sitz</i> was very low, <i>id.</i> at 455, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112459\"><a href=\"/opinion/112459/michigan-dept-of-state-police-v-sitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2481</span></a></span>); and the other is that sobriety checkpoints likely have a deterrent value apart from immediate detentions resulting from the stops.</p>\n<p>In this case, the police petition and affidavit supporting the court order showed that the checkpoint was on a regularly used highway and that the days and the hours selected were nights in or around weekends when party-going would be most likely to generate drunk driving. Much of the data offered in the petition in this case as to drunk driving and the utility of checks related to New Hampshire rather than the location chosen; but in <i>Sitz</i> most of the data was nationwide. 496 U.S. at 451, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112459\"><a href=\"/opinion/112459/michigan-dept-of-state-police-v-sitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2481</span></a></span>. This is far from the case of a checkpoint on a dead-end road.</p>\n<p>The other concerns in <i>Brown v. Texas</i> center around the intrusiveness of the search and its potential for abuse. This begins with the distinction drawn by the courts between fixed checkpoints and random \"roving\" stops that are highly stressful for the innocent individual pulled over by flashing lights and siren. <i>Sitz,</i> 496 U.S. at 452-53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112459\"><a href=\"/opinion/112459/michigan-dept-of-state-police-v-sitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3074</span></a></span>. An orderly checkpoint usually reveals itself as a general stop of all vehicles and is deemed less alarming. <i>Martinez-Fuerte,</i> 428 U.S. at 559, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109541\"><a href=\"/opinion/109541/united-states-v-martinez-fuerte/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But the checkpoint constrained officers' discretion in the areas most important to the constitutional analysis: the checkpoint occurred at a fixed location, the officers stopped every car passing through, and further investigation occurred only if individualized suspicion developed. The concerns with roving stops and unlimited officer discretion were absent. <i>Sitz,</i> 496 U.S. at 452-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112459\"><a href=\"/opinion/112459/michigan-dept-of-state-police-v-sitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span> (1979).</p>\n<p>In his opening brief, William also challenged his sentence. In sentencing William for the cocaine base conviction, the trial court applied a provision of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) fixing a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for possession of more than three grams of cocaine base where, as alleged here, the defendant has a prior conviction under that subsection. William argues to us, as he did to the trial judge, that the evidence of weight was inadequate and warranted a judgment of acquittal as to weight.</p>\n<p>The main argument is that the weighing of five bags out of eleven was insufficient absent a basis for the jury to be sure the bags were similar in weight, and the expert gave no specific reason to support the assumption. The trial judge, as noted, shared the defendant's doubt but left the issue to the jury. William points out that, given the sentencing jurisprudence, the weight issue required a finding beyond a reasonable doubt to raise the permissible maximum above the one-year default. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 844(a); <i>United States v. Eirby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199580\"><a href=\"/opinion/199580/united-states-v-eirby/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 36-37 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The problem is an ongoing one. Reasonable estimation techniques are permitted;<sup>[3]</sup> it is perhaps implicit here that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> expert deemed the bags comparable in weight, and, in addition, the bags were available to the jury who could judge from appearance.<sup>[4]</sup> Indeed, the bags may well have been professionally prepared for sale, which would support the inference; William had three cellphones and lots of cash in his possession when arrested. Still, the margin (3.6 grams as against 3) was not large and only a couple of light weight bags among those unweighed could have made the difference.</p>\n<p>We need not pursue the issue  one could say much more on both sides  beyond agreeing with the trial judge that this was a close case and therefore a warning to prosecutors in future cases: it would have been easy to shore up the estimate as the case headed for trial. However, both sides agree that on appeal a clear-cut error in sentencing has now come to light that precludes the use of the higher sentence even if weight exceeded three grams and that William has already served what may well be the maximum sentence for his offense.</p>\n<p>The provision applied to William  a five-year minimum and a twenty-year maximum  required not only more than three grams of cocaine but also a \"prior conviction... under this subsection.\" 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). William's prior conviction, both sides now agree, was for a <i>state</i> drug offense and does not meet the requirements of § 844(a) for a sentence above two years.</p>\n<p>William's prior state law conviction did increase the statutory range to more than the default maximum of one year: where the defendant has \"a prior conviction for any drug, narcotic, or chemical offense chargeable under the law of any State,\" the minimum term is fifteen days and the maximum term is two years. <i>Id.</i> Weight is irrelevant to this provision and, although the issue was not raised in the district court, the government concedes plain error in a sentence exceeding two years.</p>\n<p>When this concession was made, William had served more than two years in jail and so might have been released on bail pending review, but he rejected the proposal for reasons relating to exposure to possible deportation proceedings. Accordingly, we now <i>affirm</i> his conviction, <i>vacate</i> his sentence and <i>remand</i> the case to the district court for re-sentencing. The mandate will issue forthwith without prejudice to any petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The chemist also testified that he tested only five of the eleven bags to determine whether the substance inside was cocaine base in the form of crack cocaine, but that all of the bags contained \"an off-white powdery chunky material.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See also </i><i>Illinois v.
