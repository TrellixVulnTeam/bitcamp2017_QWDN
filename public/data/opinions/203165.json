This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) may, through rulemaking, deny\n\nplacement in a community corrections center (CCC)1 to all prisoners\n\nduring the first ninety percent of their sentences.    The question\n\nhas divided district court judges in this and other circuits,\n\nalthough the four circuit courts of appeal that have considered the\n\nissue have determined that the BOP lacks such authority.2    Each of\n\nthe circuit opinions has been accompanied by a dissent.     While we\n\nare loathe to create a circuit split, we respectfully side with the\n\ndissenters.   The BOP may make rules of general applicability to\n\nguide the individualized application of its discretion.   Of course\n\nthose rules must conform to the strictures of the Administrative\n\nProcedures Act, 5 U.S.C.    § 555 et seq. (APA).3     And, as here,\n\nwhere Congress has mandated that the BOP consider certain factors\n\n\n1\n CCCs are also referred to as Residential Re-entry Centers (RRCs)\nor, more familiarly, \"halfway houses.\" We consider these terms\nsynonyms for the purposes of this opinion.\n2\n Wedelstedt v. Wiley, 477 F.3d 1160 (10th Cir. 2007) (2-1\ndecision); Levine v. Apker, 455 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2006)(2-1\ndecision); Fults v. Sanders, 442 F.3d 1088 (8th Cir. 2006) (2-1\ndecision); Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 432 F.3d 235 (3d Cir.\n2005) (2-1 decision).\n3\n Amici curiae Families Against Mandatory Minimums Foundation, the\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the Criminal\nJustice Act Board for the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts provided a scholarly and substantial\nbrief arguing that the BOP violated the Administrative Procedures\nAct when it promulgated these regulations. We do not consider the\nissue. Because the issue was not joined below, we assume, without\ndeciding, that the regulations were adopted in accordance with the\nAPA.\n\n                               -3-\n\fin its determination, the rules the BOP makes must still leave room\n\nfor meaningful consideration of the factors.            Our analysis differs\n\nfrom the other circuits in two important respects.                First, our\n\nanalysis of the statute reveals that the decision whether to\n\ntransfer an inmate is not constrained by the factors Congress\n\nlists, although the decision where to transfer an inmate might be.\n\nAnd second, even in initial assignment decisions, the question\n\nwhether a CCC is appropriate is only a part of the overall decision\n\nwith which the BOP is charged by statute.          The remaining options\n\nprovide opportunity for meaningful individualized consideration, as\n\nthe statute implies.     Because the BOP is merely setting background\n\nrules for the operation of its discretion, the BOP can apply its\n\nregulation and still comply with the statute.\n\n           Petitioners Richard Muniz and Victor Gonzales sought\n\nwrits of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.            Each claimed\n\nthat BOP regulations delaying his transfer to a CCC were contrary\n\nto the BOP's statutory mandate and therefore invalid. The district\n\ncourt consolidated the cases, agreed with the petitioners, and\n\ngranted the petitions.        The district court also certified the two\n\ncases   under   28   U.S.C.    §   1292(b),   finding    that   there   was   a\n\n\"controlling question of law\" (the legality of the BOP regulations)\n\nas to which there was \"a substantial ground for difference of\n\nopinion\" (the split in the district courts).            The BOP appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f1.           The Statute\n\n             The authority to assign and transfer prisoners to places\n\nof confinement is conferred on the BOP by 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b).4\n\nThe     statute    affords   the   BOP    wide    discretion        to    choose   any\n\n\"appropriate and suitable\" facility, \"considering\" five factors.\n\nBroadly, those are the facility, the offense, the prisoner, any\n\nstatement     of   the   sentencing      court,   and   any    pertinent         policy\n\nstatement issued by the Sentencing Commission.5                Id.       In addition,\n\nthe BOP \"may at any time, having regard for the same matters,\n\ndirect the transfer of a prisoner from one penal or correctional\n\nfacility to another.\"        Id.\n\n2.           BOP Policy\n\n             The BOP had a longstanding practice of transferring\n\ninmates, with some exceptions, to CCCs to serve the last six months\n\nof a sentence.       See Goldings v. Winn, 383 F.3d 17, 19 & n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (describing policy before 2002); Iacaboni v. United\n\nStates,      251    F.    Supp.    2d     1015,    1017       (D.        Mass.   2003)\n\n(\"[R]ecommendations to community confinement have been made in\n\nthousands of cases by hundreds of judges continuously since at\n\nleast 1965, and in nearly all instances accepted by the BOP.\")                     For\n\nsome short sentences, this might mean that the entire sentence was\n\n\n\n4\n    We set out the statute in full in the Appendix.\n5\n See the Appendix for the precise factors. Throughout the opinion,\nwe refer to the factors in § 3621(b)(1)-(5) as the \"five factors.\"\n\n                                         -5-\n\fserved in community confinement, rather than in a prison or jail.\n\nIndeed, the BOP would sometimes place short-time convicts serving\n\nsentences    longer   than    six       months    in   CCCs   for   their    entire\n\nsentences. See, e.g., Iacaboni, 251 F. Supp. 2d at 1019 (ten-month\n\nsentence with recommendation for community confinement that was\n\ninitially   adopted   by     BOP    before      policy   change);   Id.     at   1020\n\n(sentence of one year and one day; prisoner assigned to CCC on\n\njudge's recommendation before BOP policy change). In doing so, the\n\nBOP often relied on the recommendation of the sentencing judge.\n\nId.; see also Monahan v. Winn, 276 F. Supp. 2d 196, 198 (D. Mass.\n\n2003) (noting \"long-established BOP policy and practice of adopting\n\njudicial    recommendations        to   place    nonviolent    inmates      in   such\n\nfacilities to serve short terms of imprisonment\").\n\n            In December 2002, the Department of Justice's Office of\n\nLegal Counsel issued a memorandum deeming the practice \"unlawful.\"\n\nSee Goldings, 383 F.3d at 20.             The BOP advised its officers that\n\nplacement in CCCs would thenceforth be available only to inmates\n\nduring the last ten percent of their sentences, however short,\n\nregardless of the sentencing judge's recommendation.                 Id.\n\n            The new policy (\"the 2002 policy\") was predicated on the\n\ninteraction of § 3621(b) and another statute, § 3624(c), which\n\nprovides:\n\n            The Bureau of Prisons shall, to the extent\n            practicable, assure that a prisoner serving a\n            term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part,\n            not to exceed six months, of the last 10 per\n\n                                         -6-\n\f           centum of the term to be served under\n           conditions that will afford the prisoner a\n           reasonable opportunity to adjust to and\n           prepare for the prisoner's re-entry into the\n           community.\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3624(c).         The 2002 policy was based on the argument\n\nthat § 3624(c) marked the limits of the BOP's discretion to use\n\nCCCs as places of imprisonment, or, in the alternative, that CCCs\n\nwere not penal or correctional facilities within the scope of §\n\n3621(b) at all.       See Goldings, 383 F.3d at 22-23.\n\n           The    new    policy     was    applied     to   prisoners   already\n\nsentenced, including both those who had already been placed in a\n\nCCC under the old policy, those who had been sentenced and assigned\n\nbut had not yet reported to begin serving their terms, and those\n\nwho had been sentenced but not yet assigned.                     This upset the\n\nconsidered expectations not only the prisoners themselves, but of\n\nthe judges who had sentenced them. Unsurprisingly, the 2002 policy\n\n\"generated a flood of lawsuits in the federal district courts.\"\n\nId. at 19.\n\n           We held in Goldings that the 2002 policy was contrary to\n\nthe plain meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b).             Id.; see also Elwood v.\n\nJeter,   386   F.3d    842   (8th   Cir.   2004)     (adopting    reasoning   and\n\nconclusion of Goldings).       We held the time limits in § 3624(c) did\n\nnot cabin the discretion afforded to § 3621(b), but merely marked\n\nthe limits of the time period for which the BOP had to \"assure\" \"to\n\nthe extent practicable\" that conditions would be conducive to re-\n\n                                      -7-\n\fentry.     We further held that CCCs were \"correctional facilit[ies]\"\n\nfor the purposes of § 3621(b), and therefore the BOP could place\n\nprisoners in them.          Goldings, 383 F.3d at 28.\n\n             In   2005   the      BOP   promulgated   regulations    (\"the   2005\n\nregulations\") providing its \"categorical exercise of discretion for\n\ndesignating       inmates    to   community     confinement.\"6      28   C.F.R.   §\n\n570.20(a). The BOP maintained that it would assign inmates to\n\ncommunity confinement \"only as part of pre-release custody and\n\nprogramming, during the last ten percent of the prison sentence\n\nbeing served, not to exceed six months.\"              28 C.F.R. § 570.21(a).7\n\nThus, the BOP has codified as a formal rule the substance of the\n\n2002 policy, reaching the same result by relying on the opposite\n\nrationale:        instead of arguing, as previously, that it lacks\n\ndiscretion to make CCC placements before the last ten percent of\n\na sentence, BOP now claims its discretion is broad enough to allow\n\nit to make a categorical rule preventing such placements.\n\n3.           Jurisdiction and Mootness\n\n             We regard this case as properly before us, but we pause\n\nto address two possible obstacles to our review:             jurisdiction and\n\nmootness.\n\n\n\n\n6\n The regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 570.20-21, are set out in the\nAppendix.\n7\n    Section 570.21(b) outlines some exceptions not relevant here.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f          First,   jurisdiction   is    appropriate   because    a   habeas\n\npetition seeking relief from the manner of execution of a sentence\n\nis properly brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.           Rogers v. United\n\nStates, 180 F.3d 349, 357 (1st Cir. 1999) (habeas petition under §\n\n2241 appropriate vehicle for challenging failure to designate state\n\nprison as place for confinement); see also Levine, 455 F.3d at 78\n\n(finding jurisdiction under § 2241 for habeas challenge to the same\n\nBOP regulations challenged here). But see Richmond v. Scibana, 387\n\nF.3d 602, 605-06 (7th Cir. 2004) (challenge to the 2002 policy must\n\nbe pursued as civil litigation under the APA, rather than in habeas\n\nunder § 2241).8\n\n          Second, the issue is not moot.      Petitioner Gonzalez has\n\na predicted release date of August 31, 2008.          According to the\n\ndistrict court, he would have been eligible for CCC transfer on\n\nFebruary 17, 2008 under the old policy, but has been informed that\n\nhe will not be transferred to a CCC until March 18.             Petitioner\n\n\n\n\n8\n Under the holding of Richmond, prisoners in the Seventh Circuit\nare challenging the 2005 regulations as violative of the APA. See,\ne.g., Martins v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5022\n(W.D. Wisc. Jan. 22, 2008); Belk v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 2008\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 5020 (W.D. Wisc. Jan. 22, 2008); Celozzi v. Fed.\nBureau of Prisons, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94227 (W.D. Wisc. Dec. 19,\n2007); Smith v. Davis, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77213 (S.D. Ill. Oct.\n23, 2006).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fMuniz's case is likely moot.9              But that in no way hinders our\n\nreview because Gonzalez's case is clearly not moot.10\n\n4.         Standard of Review\n\n           \"When we are asked to review an agency's construction of\n\na    statute    that     it    administers,          we   review      that   agency's\n\ninterpretation     de    novo,     subject      to   established      principles     of\n\ndeference.\" Perez-Olivo v. Chavez, 394 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing Goldings, 383 F.3d at 21).               We afford no deference to the\n\ndistrict court's grant or denial of habeas relief.                           Healy v.\n\nSpencer, 453 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct.\n\n1489 (2007).\n\n5.         Analysis\n\n           We must determine whether the 2005 regulations comport\n\nwith the authority and obligations conveyed by section 3621(b). To\n\ndo so, we must answer two questions.                 First:    Is the categorical\n\nexercise of discretion through rulemaking permissible in this\n\ncontext?       Second:        If   so,   does    the      substance    of    the   2005\n\nregulations comport with statute's intent?                    The first question\n\nrequires us to apply the Supreme Court's decision in Lopez v.\n\n\n9\n Petitioner Muniz had a projected release date of December 24,\n2007. The record shows he was considered for CCC placement under\nthe old policy as directed by the district court. If he has in\nfact been released, there is no meaningful relief to be granted to\nAppellant Carolyn Sabol, in her official capacity as warden.\n10\n If this case were moot, we might nevertheless decide the issue as\nan appropriate exercise of advisory mandamus. See In re United\nStates, 426 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                         -10-\n\fDavis, 531 U.S. 230 (2001), and decide whether a clear expression\n\nof congressional intent forecloses categorical rulemaking.         The\n\nsecond question invokes the Chevron doctrine of agency deference.\n\nThe two-step Chevron analysis begins with the statute itself.       If\n\nthe regulations conflict with the statute, the regulations are\n\ninvalid.   Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843\n\nn.9 (1984) (\"If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory\n\nconstruction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the\n\nprecise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be\n\ngiven effect.\").    If, however, we find the statute ambiguous, we\n\nafford significant deference to the agency's interpretation, and\n\nask only \"whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible\n\nconstruction of the statute.\"    Id. at 843.    Because the Lopez and\n\nChevron inquiries are interrelated, we examine the statute only\n\nonce, with both in mind.   We begin with the plain language of the\n\nstatute.\n\n           a.      The Statute\n\n           The plain language of the statute contains a grant of\n\ndiscretion and a command that the BOP consider the five factors\n\nwhen exercising that discretion.        The BOP \"shall designate the\n\nplace of the prisoner's imprisonment.\"      18 U.S.C. § 3621(b).   The\n\nBOP is provided the discretion to choose \"any available penal or\n\ncorrectional facility that meets minimum standards of health and\n\nhabitability . . . that the Bureau determines to be appropriate and\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fsuitable, considering\" the five factors.11        Id.   This is a broad\n\ngrant of discretion.   See Thye v. United States, 109 F.3d 127, 130\n\n(2d Cir. 1997) (\"Decisions to place a convicted defendant within a\n\nparticular treatment program or a particular facility are decisions\n\nwithin the sole discretion of the Bureau of Prisons.\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).    The statute allows that \"[t]he Bureau\n\nmay, at any time, having regard for the same matters, direct the\n\ntransfer\" to another facility.     Id.\n\n           The statute also contains a prohibition on \"favoritism\n\ngiven to prisoners of high social or economic status.\"                The\n\ninclusion of one forbidden factor implies that other factors, not\n\namong the five, might be considered.        If the five factors were\n\nexclusive, the prohibition on favoritism would be unnecessary. See\n\nLevine, 455 F.3d at 82 n.6; Cohen v. United States, 151 F.3d 1338,\n\n1343 (11th Cir. 1998) (\"[Section 3621(b) gives] the BOP ample room\n\nfor judgment by listing a non-exhaustive set of factors for the BOP\n\nto consider and leaving to the BOP what weight to assign to any\n\nparticular factor.\"); Thye, 109 F.3d at 130 (holding it \"well\n\nwithin   Bureau's   discretion\"   to   consider   alienage   in   placing\n\n\n\n11\n Three of the factors (\"the nature and circumstances of the\noffense; . . . the history and characteristics of the prisoner;\n[and] any statement by the court that imposed the sentence,\" 18\nU.S.C. §§ 3621(b)(2)-(4)) do seem to require individualized\nconsideration. In that much we agree with our sister circuits.\nSee Wedelstedt, 477 F.3d 1168; Levine, 455 F.3d at 85; Fults, 442\nF.3d at 1091; Woodall, 432 F.3d at 247.       The nature of that\nconsideration is the crux of the matter.\n\n                                  -12-\n\finmate).   The statute is silent on whether one of the five factors,\n\nor another factor not listed, may for some prisoners or for some\n\nfacilities predominate over all others in importance.\n\n           Applying   Lopez,   we    discern   no   clear   expression   of\n\ncongressional intent to foreclose rulemaking.               As an initial\n\nmatter, the transfer provision in § 3621(b) leaves more to the\n\nBOP's discretion than the assignment provision. But moreover, even\n\nthe assignment provision lacks a clear expression of congressional\n\nintent to forbid rulemaking that assists BOP in its individualized\n\ndeterminations.\n\n           The provision of § 3621(b) governing transfers, properly\n\nread, contains near-identical language to the provision the Supreme\n\nCourt considered in Lopez.     That case considered § 3621(e), which\n\nprovides that the period of custody for some prisoners \"may be\n\nreduced by the Bureau of Prisons.\"12 § 3621(e)(2)(B).          Lopez held\n\nthat this represented a grant of discretion to the BOP, and that\n\nthe BOP could prescribe additional requirements through notice-and-\n\ncomment rulemaking.    531 U.S. at 241. In other words, \"the Bureau\n\nthus has the authority, but not the duty\" to reduce the sentence.\n\nId.   The transfer provision at issue in this case contains the same\n\npermissive language: \"The Bureau may at any time, having regard for\n\nthe same matters, direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal\n\n\n12\n Specifically, those     prisoners who successfully complete             a\nresidential substance    abuse treatment program.  18 U.S.C.             §\n3621(e)(2).\n\n                                    -13-\n\for correctional facility to another.\"    § 3621(b).   We read this\n\nprovision differently than our sister circuits.   It appears to us\n\nthat the phrase \"having regard for the same matters\" (i.e. the five\n\nfactors) applies to any transfer that the Bureau may direct, but\n\nthat the statute leaves it to the BOP's discretion whether to\n\nundertake a transfer at all.13     See Woodall, 432 F.3d at 251\n\n(Fuentes, J. dissenting) (\"[T]he § 3621(b) factors need not be\n\nconsidered by the BOP until an inmate is actually considered for a\n\ntransfer, and . . . the BOP is not required to consider any inmate\n\nfor transfer to a CCC until the lesser of six months or ten percent\n\nof an inmate's sentence remains.\"); Yip v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons,\n\n363 F. Supp. 2d 548, 552 (E.D.N.Y. 2005).14 The matter does not end\n\n\n13\n Compare the language governing initial assignments: \"The [BOP]\nshall designate the place of . . . imprisonment. The [BOP] may\ndesignate any available penal or correctional facility . . . .\"\nBecause the mandatory \"shall\" requires that some place be\ndesignated, the permissive \"may\" in the second sentence only speaks\nto the range of possible choices and does not mean that the BOP\ncould refuse to designate a facility altogether. In contrast, the\nlanguage governing transfers simply states that the BOP \"may . . .\ndirect\" the transfers.\n14\n Fults explicitly comes to the opposite conclusion, but does not\ngive a reason. \"A BOP decision to not transfer an inmate--or, as\nin this case, a group of inmates--requires the same consideration\nof the § 3621(b) factors as does the decision to transfer an inmate\nto a CCC.\" 442 F.3d at 1092. With respect, we believe that the\nBOP's decision to transfer a prisoner to a specific facility is\ndivided by the statute into two steps:       First, the decision,\nentirely within the BOP's discretion, of whether to transfer the\nprisoner at all; second, once a transfer is under consideration,\nthe decision which facility is the appropriate one. That second\ndecision must be made \"having regard for\" the five factors. If\nthis were not the case, if declining to authorize a transfer were\ncovered by the mandatory \"shall\" in \"shall assign,\" then the BOP\n\n                               -14-\n\fthere, however.        According to our analysis, under Lopez even the\n\nassignment provision supports the rulemaking at issue here.\n\n             The plain language of the statute contains no explicit\n\nguidance on whether the BOP may facilitate assignments through\n\ncategorical exercises of discretion.          Other courts have viewed the\n\nconjunctive list of the five factors and the mandatory nature of\n\nthe language \"shall designate . . . , considering\" as foreclosing\n\nthe possibility of a categorical exercise of discretion.                   See\n\nWedelstedt, 477 F.3d at 1165-66; Levine, 455 F.3d at 80-82; Fults,\n\n442 F.3d at 1091-92; Woodall, 432 F.3d at 245-46.               We agree, to a\n\npoint.       Congress certainly intended that the five factors be\n\nconsidered in the placement decision.           But we do not believe that\n\nthis constitutes the clear expression of Congressional intent\n\nrequired by Lopez to foreclose all rulemaking whatsoever.                 Even\n\nwhere    a   statute    requires   individualized     determinations,     \"the\n\ndecisionmaker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve\n\ncertain areas of general applicability unless Congress clearly\n\nexpresses an intent to withhold that authority.\"            Lopez, 531 U.S.\n\nat 244 (internal quotation omitted).             The statute does require\n\nindividualized determinations, but if that were sufficient to\n\nprevent rulemaking altogether, the statement in Lopez would be a\n\nparadox,     because    it   implies   that   some   statutes    that   require\n\n\nwould never be free to decline a transfer request without\nconsidering the five factors. Congress surely did not intend such\na result.\n\n                                       -15-\n\findividualized    determinations    nonetheless     permit     rulemaking.\n\nSomething more must be required of Congress, and we see no more\n\nhere.\n\n           Because the plain language of the statute does not\n\naddress   \"the   precise   question[s]    at   issue,\"   we   turn   to    the\n\nstatute's legislative history to help resolve the ambiguity.                We\n\nprovide some context.        Section 3621, enacted as part of the\n\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, replaced previous statutory language\n\ncommitting prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General and\n\ngranting him discretion to choose the place of confinement.               Pub.\n\nL. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2007-08; see also 18 U.S.C. §§ 4082(a)&(b)\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f(1984)15, amended by Pub. L. 98-473, § 218(a)(3) (old statutory\n\nscheme).\n\n           The other circuits have found the plain language of the\n\nstatute dispositive.    Wedelstedt, 477 F.3d at 1166-67; Levine, 455\n\nF.3d at 82; Fults, 442 F.3d at 1090; Woodall, 432 F.3d at 248-49.\n\nConsequently,   they   did   not   need   to   pursue   other   avenues   of\n\nstatutory construction such as legislative history.               But each\n\nmajority opinion does go on to examine the legislative history, a\n\n\n\n15\n Prior to enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the\nstatute read:\n               (a) A person convicted of an offense\n          against the United States shall be committed,\n          for such term of imprisonment as the court may\n          direct, to the custody of the Attorney General\n          of the United States, who shall designate the\n          place of confinement where the sentence shall\n          be served.\n               (b) The Attorney General may designate as\n          a   place   of  confinement    any  available,\n          suitable, and appropriate institution or\n          facility, whether maintained by the Federal\n          Government or otherwise, and whether within or\n          without the judicial district in which the\n          person was convicted, and may at any time\n          transfer   a   person   from   one   place   of\n          confinement to another.\n18 U.S.C. § 4082 (a)&(b) (1984).     The structure of the earlier\nstatute lends strength to our conclusion above that the discretion\nto order a transfer at all is not cabined by consideration of the\nfactors. Viewing the old language, it is even more clear that the\ntransfer language is separate from the mandate \"shall designate\" in\nsubsection (a).     While the discretionary \"may designate\" in\nsubsection (b) is clearly constrained by the requirement \"shall\ndesignate\" in subsection (a), there is no reason to read the\ntransfer-or-no-transfer decision as anything but discretionary.\nNor is there any indication from the legislative history discussed\nbelow that Congress intended to change the scope of this discretion\nwhen it changed the statute.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fpractice this circuit often follows as well.                  See Succar v.\n\nAshcroft, 394 F.3d 8,       31 (1st Cir. 2005) (approving consideration\n\nof legislative history as a check on interpretation of statutory\n\nlanguage).    Each opinion cites the same snippet of the legislative\n\nhistory, either directly or by citing one of the other opinions:\n\na part of the Senate Judiciary Committee report that was included\n\nwith the bill when it was enacted.             See Levine, 455 F.3d at 82\n\n(quoting     and   citing   S.    Rep.   No    98-225,   reprinted     in    1984\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3324-25); Woodall, 432 F.3d at 245-46 (same);\n\nsee also Wedelstedt, 477 F.3d at 1166 n.7 (citing Levine and\n\nWoodall for the proposition that the legislative history supports\n\nthe invalidity of the 2005 regulations); Fults, 442 F.3d at 1092\n\n(finding its view of the plain language \"bolstered by the statute's\n\nlegislative history as discussed in Woodall.\").              We set out the\n\nrelevant portion of the report in full in the Appendix.\n\n             We find this passage to be ambiguous when viewed in the\n\nlight of our construction of the statute's plain language.                   The\n\npassage states that the bill \"follows existing law\" with regard to\n\nassignments and transfers.        S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 141-42 (1983),\n\nreprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3324-25.            The report does say\n\nthat   \"in   determining    the   availability      or   suitability    of    the\n\nfacility selected, the Bureau is specifically required to consider\n\nsuch factors\" as the five factors.            Id.   But even this command is\n\ntempered; the report goes on to say that \"by listing factors . . .\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f[the committee] does not intend to restrict or limit the Bureau in\n\nthe exercise of its existing discretion.\"\n\n               This legislative history just as easily supports our\n\nreading   of        the   statute.16          Nothing    in    this    passage        requires\n\nconsideration of the five factors for every facility or type of\n\nfacility that is ruled out.                   Nor is there a clear expression of\n\nintent    to    withhold        the    authority        to    make    rules      of   general\n\napplicability.            In any event, we find the legislative history\n\nsufficiently ambiguous that we proceed to Chevron's second step.\n\n               b.         Are   the   2005    Regulations                  a      Reasonable\n                          Interpretation of § 3621(b)?\n\n               Finding that Congress did not address whether the BOP\n\ncould make a categorical exclusion of one type of facility from its\n\nplacement decisions, we ask, under the second step of the Chevron\n\nanalysis,       whether         the    2005     regulations          are    a     reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the statute.                  467 U.S. at 844; see also id. at\n\n843 (\"[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the\n\nspecific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's\n\nanswer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\").\n\n               The 2005 regulations are a reasonable interpretation of\n\nthe mandate delivered to the BOP by Congress:                                   Congress has\n\ninstructed      the       BOP   to    place    each     prisoner      in   an    appropriate\n\n\n16\n We note that it is a symptom of the general weakness of\nlegislative history as a clue to legislative intent that even this\nsmall piece of a Senate report seems to shift meaning depending on\nthe light in which it is viewed.\n\n                                              -19-\n\ffacility, considering the five factors.        In carrying out that\n\nresponsibility, the BOP has made the reasonable determination that\n\nsome   facilities   are   simply   categorically   inappropriate   for\n\nprisoners during the first ninety percent of their sentences or for\n\nperiods of longer than six months.     Neither the substance of that\n\ndecision, nor the method the BOP used to codify the decision\n\nrepresents an unreasonable interpretation of § 3621(b).\n\n          The concurring opinion in Goldings predicted that \"[e]ven\n\nif the statutory criteria for making assignments and transfers\n\ncould be read to guarantee some sort of individualized treatment .\n\n. . BOP would still have the authority to make a categorical rule\n\nexcluding some or all CCC placements, except as required for end of\n\nsentence placements governed by § 3624(c).\"    Goldings, 383 F.3d at\n\n33 (Howard, J., concurring).       The concurrence relied on Lopez,\n\nquoting a passage we have already mentioned:\n\n          \"Even   if   a   statutory    scheme   requires\n          individualized determinations . . . the\n          decisionmaker has the authority to rely on\n          rulemaking to resolve certain issues of\n          general applicability unless Congress clearly\n          expresses   an   intent    to   withhold   that\n          authority.\" [Lopez, 531 U.S. at 243-44]\n          (quoting American Hosp. Ass'n v. NLRB, 499\n          U.S. 606, 612, 113 L. Ed. 2d 675, 111 S. Ct.\n          15395   (1991)).     BOP    \"is  not   required\n          continually to revisit 'issues that may be\n          established fairly and efficiently in a single\n          rulemaking proceeding.'\" Id.

The first\n\nquestion is whether this statement in Lopez applies.              It does.\n\n           On    the    one   hand,   Lopez   is   particularly   instructive\n\nbecause it treats the authority of the same agency, the BOP, to\n\npromulgate regulations under another part of the same statutory\n\nscheme, § 3621(e).        On the other hand, that part of the statute\n\nlists no factors for consideration.            The other circuits to have\n\nconsidered the question find Lopez inapplicable to § 3621(b); they\n\nreason that § 3621(b) is different because inclusion of the factors\n\nas a conjunctive list demonstrates clear congressional intent that\n\nall of the factors be considered. Wedelstedt, 477 F.3d 1160, 1167-\n\n68;   Levine, 455 F.3d at 85; Fults, 442 F.3d at 1091; Woodall, 432\n\nF.3d at 246-47.        As previously discussed, we do not think this is\n\nthe sort of clear expression of intent required.\n\n           The second question is whether the substance of the 2005\n\nregulations     is   an   acceptable    implementation    of   the   governing\n\nstatute.   It is.      Two facts compel us to that conclusion.\n\n           First, the decision with which the BOP is charged in the\n\nstatute is not the one being made by the 2005 regulations.                If §\n\n3621(b) were directed solely at the determination of whether a CCC\n\nor a traditional prison facility was the right type of facility, we\n\nmight come to a different result.             But § 3621 requires BOP to\n\nconsider the five factors in a much broader context: deciding what\n\nspecific facility is the right one to house each prisoner.                   The\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fquestion whether a CCC is an appropriate facility for any prisoner\n\nduring the first ninety percent of a term is a subset of that\n\nquestion, and deciding it on a categorical basis is not the same as\n\ndeciding the final issue of placement on a categorical basis.17\n\nThis, then, is nothing more than a background rule of general\n\napplicability,    promulgated       in    the   interest      of   efficiency    and\n\nuniformity, that serves to focus the individualized consideration\n\nCongress required.       This is precisely what Lopez envisioned.               \"The\n\nBureau is not required continually to revisit 'issues that may be\n\nestablished     fairly    and   efficiently       in    a     single     rulemaking\n\nproceeding.'\" Lopez, 531 U.S. at 244 (quoting Heckler, 461 U.S. at\n\n467).\n\n           Second,   the     2005   regulations        were      promulgated    with\n\nexplicit reference to some of the five factors.                     See Community\n\nConfinement, Proposed Rule, 69 Fed. Reg. at 51,214 (discussing\n\nfacility     resources    and   policy      statements      of     the   Sentencing\n\nCommission).      The proposed rule also expressly relied on the\n\nimportance of deterring future crime, which is one of the stated\n\ngoals of sentencing, as well as § 3621(b)'s prohibition on treating\n\ninmates differently based on wealth or social status.                       Id. at\n\n51,214-15.    Under the statute, other factors may be considered and\n\n\n\n17\n We emphasize that were the regulations to leave little or no room\nfor the operation of the individualized assessment implied by\nCongress, we would regard that as contrary to intent of the\nstatute.\n\n                                         -22-\n\fmay even be dispositive.     \"When experience or common sense shows\n\nthat the housing decision will be the same no matter what the\n\nevidence regarding a particular factor, the BOP need not go through\n\nthe motions of collecting the evidence and noting that the one\n\nfactor cannot outweigh the others in the particular circumstance.\"\n\nWedelstedt, 477 F.3d at 1171 (Hartz, J., dissenting); see also\n\nLevine, 455 F.3d 71 at 91 (Raggi, J., dissenting) (\"The BOP might\n\nreasonably conclude, as it implicitly did here, that, regardless of\n\nan     individual   prisoner's   offense,   history,   and   personal\n\ncharacteristics, or any statement made by a sentencing judge, other\n\nfactors . . . combine to warrant a categorical rule excluding CCC\n\nfacilities from consideration in general § 3621(b) designations.\")\n\nIf Congress had limited consideration to only these five factors,\n\nor had laid out how the factors ought to be balanced, we would face\n\na different question.       Pragmatically, we cannot imagine that\n\nCongress intended by its silence to make pointless work for the\n\nBOP.\n\n            We note also that the BOP has other policies that deny\n\nCCC placement in other circumstances.        See Federal Bureau of\n\nPrisons, Program Statement 7310.04, Community Corrections Center\n\n(CCC) Utilization and Transfer Procedure at 10 (Dec. 16, 1998),\n\navailable at http://bop.gov/DataSource/execute/dsPolicyLoc (last\n\nvisited Feb. 20, 2008).     Those policies restrict the transfer of\n\ninmates who are assigned a \"Sex Offender\" or \"Deportable Alien\"\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f\"Public   Safety       Factor\"   or   \"who    require   inpatient      medical,\n\npsychological, or psychiatric treatment,\" among others.18                      Id.\n\nThese policies are entitled to less deference under Chevron,\n\nbecause they are merely interpretive rules and were not promulgated\n\nunder the APA's notice-and-comment provisions.                    But they have\n\nnevertheless been upheld.        See Fox v. Lappin, 409 F. Supp. 2d 79,\n\n92 (D. Mass 2006) (upholding policy of denying transfer to CCC to\n\nthose with \"Sex Offender\" Public Safety Factor).              We believe this\n\nis in accordance with the BOP's ability to make rules of general\n\napplicability that guide its decisions.\n\n           Stepping back, we recognize that the dispute is in part\n\nover the BOP's substantive decision to restrict CCC availability.\n\nAssuming the decision itself is not contrary to the wishes of\n\nCongress, the BOP will one way or the other be able to carry it\n\nout.19    The   2005    regulations    at    least   have   the    advantage   of\n\ntransparency.      There is no dispute that, as long as the BOP\n\n\"considers\" the five factors, it has virtually unlimited discretion\n\nto place inmates wherever it deems appropriate.                   The BOP could\n\nsimply consider the five factors in each case but decide, in each\n\ncase, not to place each inmate in a CCC.             At the very least, the\n\n\n18\n These policies say that such prisoners are not \"ordinarily\"\neligible for CCC placement.      This might appear to provide\nexceptions that are ostensibly lacking in the 2005 regulations.\nBut this does not change our analysis.\n19\n Of course, if the decision to restrict CCC placements is\nunacceptable to Congress, it can easily rectify the discrepancy.\n\n                                      -24-\n\f2005 regulations have the advantage of being consistent, formal\n\nrules of general applicability that can be attacked under the APA\n\nfor the circumstances of their promulgation and can be discussed as\n\nmatters of public policy in the elected branches.              Similarly, even\n\ncourts striking down the 2005 regulations seem to acknowledge that\n\nthe BOP could close the CCCs entirely.         See Levine, 455 F.3d at 82.\n\nThat such a result would frustrate petitioners' desires is obvious.\n\n             Our holding is a narrow one of statutory interpretation.\n\nWe emphasize that we express no opinion about the validity of the\n\n2005 regulations under the APA.         Neither do we pass any judgment on\n\nthe wisdom of the decision to limit CCC placements.              We recognize\n\nthat sentencing discretion is crucial to district court judges, and\n\nurge   and    expect   the   BOP   to    be   sensitive   to    this   in   its\n\npolicymaking.\n\n             Because the individualized consideration of the five\n\nfactors mandated by 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b) is directed at the overall\n\nplacement decision, and because the question of the appropriateness\n\nof CCCs for inmates during the first ninety percent of their\n\nsentences is an issue of general applicability within the scope of\n\nLopez, the 2005 regulations are a reasonable exercise of the Bureau\n\nof Prisons' discretion in carrying out its duties under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3621(b).     The plain language and legislative history are silent\n\non whether such a policy would contradict the statute, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fBOP's construction of its duties here is reasonable.

The Bureau of Prisons shall designate\n\nthe place of the prisoner's imprisonment. The Bureau may designate\n\nany available penal or correctional facility that meets minimum\n\nstandards of health and habitability established by the Bureau,\n\nwhether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise and\n\nwhether within or without the judicial district in which the person\n\nwas convicted, that the Bureau determines to be appropriate and\n\nsuitable, considering--\n\n   (1) the resources of the facility contemplated;\n\n   (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense;\n\n   (3) the history and characteristics of the prisoner;\n\n   (4) any statement by the court that imposed the sentence--\n\n        (A) concerning the purposes for which the sentence to\n\nimprisonment was determined to be warranted; or\n\n     (B) recommending a type of penal or correctional facility as\n\nappropriate; and\n\n   (5) any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing\n\nCommission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title 28.\n\n\n\nIn designating the place of imprisonment or making transfers under\n\nthis subsection, there shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of\n\nhigh social or economic status.

The Bureau shall\n\nmake available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each\n\nprisoner   the   Bureau   determines    has   a   treatable   condition   of\n\nsubstance addiction or abuse.\n\n\n\n28 C.F.R. §§ 570.20-21\n\n § 570.20 What is the purpose of this subpart?\n\n           (a) This subpart provides the Bureau of Prisons' (Bureau)\n\ncategorical exercise of discretion for designating inmates to\n\ncommunity confinement.     The Bureau designates inmates to community\n\nconfinement only as part of pre-release custody and programming\n\nwhich will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust\n\nto and prepare for re-entry into the community.\n\n           (b) As discussed in this subpart, the term \"community\n\nconfinement\" includes Community Corrections Centers (CCC) (also\n\nknown as \"halfway houses\") and home confinement.\n\n\n\n§ 570.21 When will the Bureau designate inmates to community\n\nconfinement?\n\n           (a)   The   Bureau   will   designate    inmates   to   community\n\nconfinement only as part of pre-release custody and programming,\n\nduring the last ten percent of the prison sentence being served,\n\nnot to exceed six months.\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f          (b) We may exceed these time-frames only when specific\n\nBureau programs allow greater periods of community confinement, as\n\nprovided by separate statutory authority (for example, residential\n\nsubstance abuse treatment program (18 U.S.C. 3621(e)(2)(A)), or\n\nshock incarceration program (18 U.S.C. 4046(c)).\n\n\n\nS. Rep 98-225, at 141-21:\n\n\n\nSECTION 3621. IMPRISONMENT OF A CONVICTED PERSON\n\n          This section is derived from existing law.\n\n          Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3621(a) is derived from 18 U.S.C.\n\n4082(a) except that the new provision places custody of federal\n\nprisoners directly in the Bureau of Prisons rather than in the\n\nAttorney General.    This change is not intended to affect the\n\nauthority of the Bureau of Prisons with regard to such matters as\n\nplace of confinement of prisoners, transfers of prisoners, and\n\ncorrectional   programs,   but   is   designed   only   to   simplify   the\n\nadministration of the prison system.      Direct custody of prisoners\n\nwill be in the Bureau of Prisons, but the Director of the Bureau of\n\nPrisons will remain subject to appointment by the Attorney General\n\nand subject to his direction.     In addition, it is made clear that\n\nthe custody of the Bureau of Prisons continues until the expiration\n\nof the term of imprisonment, or until release at the expiration of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fthat   term     less   any   time   credited      toward    service       of   sentence\n\npursuant to section 3624(b).\n\n               Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3621 (b) follows existing law in\n\nproviding that the authority to designate the place of confinement\n\nfor    federal    prisoners      rests    in    the   Bureau    of    Prisons.       The\n\ndesignated penal or correctional facility need not be in the\n\njudicial district in which the prisoner was convicted and need not\n\nbe maintained by the federal government.                   Existing law provides\n\nthat the Bureau may designate a place of confinement that is\n\navailable, appropriate, and suitable.                 Section 3621(b) continues\n\nthat discretionary authority with a new requirement that the\n\nfacility       meet    minimum   standards       of   health        and   habitability\n\nestablished      by    the   Bureau      of    Prisons.        In    determining     the\n\navailability or suitability of the facility selected, the Bureau is\n\nspecifically required to consider such factors as the resources of\n\nthe facility considered, the nature and circumstances of the\n\noffense, the history and characteristics of the prisoner, the\n\nstatements made by the sentencing court concerning the purposes for\n\nimprisonment in a particular case, any recommendations as to type\n\nof facility made by the court, and any pertinent policy statements\n\nissued    by    the    Sentencing     Commission      pursuant       to   proposed    28\n\nU.S.C.994(a)(2).         After considering these factors, the Bureau of\n\nPrisons may designate the place of imprisonment in an appropriate\n\n\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\ftype   of   facility,     or   may   transfer   the    offender       to   another\n\nappropriate facility.\n\n            In the absence of unusual circumstances, federal courts\n\ncurrently    will   not    review    a   decision     as   to   the    place   of\n\nconfinement.    The committee, by listing factors for the Bureau to\n\nconsider in determining the appropriateness or suitability of any\n\navailable facility, does not intend to restrict or limit the Bureau\n\nin the exercise of its existing discretion so long as the facility\n\nmeets the minimum standards of health and habitability of the\n\nBureau, but intends simple to set forth the appropriate factors\n\nthat the Bureau should consider in making the designations.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\f",

This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) may, through rulemaking, deny\n\nplacement in a community corrections center (CCC)1 to all prisoners\n\nduring the first ninety percent of their sentences.    The question\n\nhas divided district court judges in this and other circuits,\n\nalthough the four circuit courts of appeal that have considered the\n\nissue have determined that the BOP lacks such authority.2    Each of\n\nthe circuit opinions has been accompanied by a dissent.     While we\n\nare loathe to create a circuit split, we respectfully side with the\n\ndissenters.   The BOP may make rules of general applicability to\n\nguide the individualized application of its discretion.   Of course\n\nthose rules must conform to the strictures of the Administrative\n\nProcedures Act, 5 U.S.C.    § 555 et seq. (APA).3     And, as here,\n\nwhere Congress has mandated that the BOP consider certain factors\n\n\n1\n CCCs are also referred to as Residential Re-entry Centers (RRCs)\nor, more familiarly, \"halfway houses.\" We consider these terms\nsynonyms for the purposes of this opinion.\n2\n Wedelstedt v.

We do not consider the\nissue. Because the issue was not joined below, we assume, without\ndeciding, that the regulations were adopted in accordance with the\nAPA.\n\n                               -3-\n\fin its determination, the rules the BOP makes must still leave room\n\nfor meaningful consideration of the factors.            Our analysis differs\n\nfrom the other circuits in two important respects.                First, our\n\nanalysis of the statute reveals that the decision whether to\n\ntransfer an inmate is not constrained by the factors Congress\n\nlists, although the decision where to transfer an inmate might be.\n\nAnd second, even in initial assignment decisions, the question\n\nwhether a CCC is appropriate is only a part of the overall decision\n\nwith which the BOP is charged by statute.          The remaining options\n\nprovide opportunity for meaningful individualized consideration, as\n\nthe statute implies.     Because the BOP is merely setting background\n\nrules for the operation of its discretion, the BOP can apply its\n\nregulation and still comply with the statute.\n\n           Petitioners Richard Muniz and Victor Gonzales sought\n\nwrits of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.            Each claimed\n\nthat BOP regulations delaying his transfer to a CCC were contrary\n\nto the BOP's statutory mandate and therefore invalid. The district\n\ncourt consolidated the cases, agreed with the petitioners, and\n\ngranted the petitions.        The district court also certified the two\n\ncases   under   28   U.S.C.    §   1292(b),   finding    that   there   was   a\n\n\"controlling question of law\" (the legality of the BOP regulations)\n\nas to which there was \"a substantial ground for difference of\n\nopinion\" (the split in the district courts).            The BOP appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f1.           The Statute\n\n             The authority to assign and transfer prisoners to places\n\nof confinement is conferred on the BOP by 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b).4\n\nThe     statute    affords   the   BOP    wide    discretion        to    choose   any\n\n\"appropriate and suitable\" facility, \"considering\" five factors.\n\nBroadly, those are the facility, the offense, the prisoner, any\n\nstatement     of   the   sentencing      court,   and   any    pertinent         policy\n\nstatement issued by the Sentencing Commission.5                Id.

BOP Policy\n\n             The BOP had a longstanding practice of transferring\n\ninmates, with some exceptions, to CCCs to serve the last six months\n\nof a sentence.       See Goldings v.

The BOP advised its officers that\n\nplacement in CCCs would thenceforth be available only to inmates\n\nduring the last ten percent of their sentences, however short,\n\nregardless of the sentencing judge's recommendation.                 Id.\n\n            The new policy (\"the 2002 policy\") was predicated on the\n\ninteraction of § 3621(b) and another statute, § 3624(c), which\n\nprovides:\n\n            The Bureau of Prisons shall, to the extent\n            practicable, assure that a prisoner serving a\n            term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part,\n            not to exceed six months, of the last 10 per\n\n                                         -6-\n\f           centum of the term to be served under\n           conditions that will afford the prisoner a\n           reasonable opportunity to adjust to and\n           prepare for the prisoner's re-entry into the\n           community.\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3624(c).         The 2002 policy was based on the argument\n\nthat § 3624(c) marked the limits of the BOP's discretion to use\n\nCCCs as places of imprisonment, or, in the alternative, that CCCs\n\nwere not penal or correctional facilities within the scope of §\n\n3621(b) at all.       See Goldings, 383 F.3d at 22-23.\n\n           The    new    policy     was    applied     to   prisoners   already\n\nsentenced, including both those who had already been placed in a\n\nCCC under the old policy, those who had been sentenced and assigned\n\nbut had not yet reported to begin serving their terms, and those\n\nwho had been sentenced but not yet assigned.                     This upset the\n\nconsidered expectations not only the prisoners themselves, but of\n\nthe judges who had sentenced them. Unsurprisingly, the 2002 policy\n\n\"generated a flood of lawsuits in the federal district courts.\"\n\nId. at 19.\n\n           We held in Goldings that the 2002 policy was contrary to\n\nthe plain meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b).

We held the time limits in § 3624(c) did\n\nnot cabin the discretion afforded to § 3621(b), but merely marked\n\nthe limits of the time period for which the BOP had to \"assure\" \"to\n\nthe extent practicable\" that conditions would be conducive to re-\n\n                                      -7-\n\fentry.     We further held that CCCs were \"correctional facilit[ies]\"\n\nfor the purposes of § 3621(b), and therefore the BOP could place\n\nprisoners in them.          Goldings, 383 F.3d at 28.\n\n             In   2005   the      BOP   promulgated   regulations    (\"the   2005\n\nregulations\") providing its \"categorical exercise of discretion for\n\ndesignating       inmates    to   community     confinement.\"6      28   C.F.R.   §\n\n570.20(a). The BOP maintained that it would assign inmates to\n\ncommunity confinement \"only as part of pre-release custody and\n\nprogramming, during the last ten percent of the prison sentence\n\nbeing served, not to exceed six months.\"              28 C.F.R. § 570.21(a).7\n\nThus, the BOP has codified as a formal rule the substance of the\n\n2002 policy, reaching the same result by relying on the opposite\n\nrationale:        instead of arguing, as previously, that it lacks\n\ndiscretion to make CCC placements before the last ten percent of\n\na sentence, BOP now claims its discretion is broad enough to allow\n\nit to make a categorical rule preventing such placements.\n\n3.

Analysis\n\n           We must determine whether the 2005 regulations comport\n\nwith the authority and obligations conveyed by section 3621(b). To\n\ndo so, we must answer two questions.                 First:    Is the categorical\n\nexercise of discretion through rulemaking permissible in this\n\ncontext?       Second:        If   so,   does    the      substance    of    the   2005\n\nregulations comport with statute's intent?                    The first question\n\nrequires us to apply the Supreme Court's decision in Lopez v.\n\n\n9\n Petitioner Muniz had a projected release date of December 24,\n2007. The record shows he was considered for CCC placement under\nthe old policy as directed by the district court. If he has in\nfact been released, there is no meaningful relief to be granted to\nAppellant Carolyn Sabol, in her official capacity as warden.\n10\n If this case were moot, we might nevertheless decide the issue as\nan appropriate exercise of advisory mandamus.

Because the Lopez and\n\nChevron inquiries are interrelated, we examine the statute only\n\nonce, with both in mind.   We begin with the plain language of the\n\nstatute.\n\n           a.      The Statute\n\n           The plain language of the statute contains a grant of\n\ndiscretion and a command that the BOP consider the five factors\n\nwhen exercising that discretion.        The BOP \"shall designate the\n\nplace of the prisoner's imprisonment.\"      18 U.S.C. § 3621(b).   The\n\nBOP is provided the discretion to choose \"any available penal or\n\ncorrectional facility that meets minimum standards of health and\n\nhabitability . . . that the Bureau determines to be appropriate and\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fsuitable, considering\" the five factors.11        Id.   This is a broad\n\ngrant of discretion.   See Thye v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130\n\n(2d Cir. 1997) (\"Decisions to place a convicted defendant within a\n\nparticular treatment program or a particular facility are decisions\n\nwithin the sole discretion of the Bureau of Prisons.\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).    The statute allows that \"[t]he Bureau\n\nmay, at any time, having regard for the same matters, direct the\n\ntransfer\" to another facility.     Id.\n\n           The statute also contains a prohibition on \"favoritism\n\ngiven to prisoners of high social or economic status.\"                The\n\ninclusion of one forbidden factor implies that other factors, not\n\namong the five, might be considered.        If the five factors were\n\nexclusive, the prohibition on favoritism would be unnecessary. See\n\nLevine, 455 F.3d at 82 n.6; Cohen v.

In that much we agree with our sister circuits.\nSee Wedelstedt, 477 F.3d 1168; Levine, 455 F.3d at 85; Fults, 442\nF.3d at 1091; Woodall, 432 F.3d at 247.       The nature of that\nconsideration is the crux of the matter.\n\n                                  -12-\n\finmate).   The statute is silent on whether one of the five factors,\n\nor another factor not listed, may for some prisoners or for some\n\nfacilities predominate over all others in importance.\n\n           Applying   Lopez,   we    discern   no   clear   expression   of\n\ncongressional intent to foreclose rulemaking.               As an initial\n\nmatter, the transfer provision in § 3621(b) leaves more to the\n\nBOP's discretion than the assignment provision. But moreover, even\n\nthe assignment provision lacks a clear expression of congressional\n\nintent to forbid rulemaking that assists BOP in its individualized\n\ndeterminations.\n\n           The provision of § 3621(b) governing transfers, properly\n\nread, contains near-identical language to the provision the Supreme\n\nCourt considered in Lopez.     That case considered § 3621(e), which\n\nprovides that the period of custody for some prisoners \"may be\n\nreduced by the Bureau of Prisons.\"12 § 3621(e)(2)(B).          Lopez held\n\nthat this represented a grant of discretion to the BOP, and that\n\nthe BOP could prescribe additional requirements through notice-and-\n\ncomment rulemaking.    531 U.S. at 241. In other words, \"the Bureau\n\nthus has the authority, but not the duty\" to reduce the sentence.\n\nId.   The transfer provision at issue in this case contains the same\n\npermissive language: \"The Bureau may at any time, having regard for\n\nthe same matters, direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal\n\n\n12\n Specifically, those     prisoners who successfully complete             a\nresidential substance    abuse treatment program.  18 U.S.C.             §\n3621(e)(2).\n\n                                    -13-\n\for correctional facility to another.\"    § 3621(b).   We read this\n\nprovision differently than our sister circuits.   It appears to us\n\nthat the phrase \"having regard for the same matters\" (i.e. the five\n\nfactors) applies to any transfer that the Bureau may direct, but\n\nthat the statute leaves it to the BOP's discretion whether to\n\nundertake a transfer at all.13     See Woodall, 432 F.3d at 251\n\n(Fuentes, J. dissenting) (\"[T]he § 3621(b) factors need not be\n\nconsidered by the BOP until an inmate is actually considered for a\n\ntransfer, and . . . the BOP is not required to consider any inmate\n\nfor transfer to a CCC until the lesser of six months or ten percent\n\nof an inmate's sentence remains.\"); Yip v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552 (E.D.N.Y. 2005).14 The matter does not end\n\n\n13\n Compare the language governing initial assignments: \"The [BOP]\nshall designate the place of . . . imprisonment. The [BOP] may\ndesignate any available penal or correctional facility . . . .\"\nBecause the mandatory \"shall\" requires that some place be\ndesignated, the permissive \"may\" in the second sentence only speaks\nto the range of possible choices and does not mean that the BOP\ncould refuse to designate a facility altogether. In contrast, the\nlanguage governing transfers simply states that the BOP \"may . . .\ndirect\" the transfers.\n14\n Fults explicitly comes to the opposite conclusion, but does not\ngive a reason. \"A BOP decision to not transfer an inmate--or, as\nin this case, a group of inmates--requires the same consideration\nof the § 3621(b) factors as does the decision to transfer an inmate\nto a CCC.\" 442 F.3d at 1092. With respect, we believe that the\nBOP's decision to transfer a prisoner to a specific facility is\ndivided by the statute into two steps:       First, the decision,\nentirely within the BOP's discretion, of whether to transfer the\nprisoner at all; second, once a transfer is under consideration,\nthe decision which facility is the appropriate one. That second\ndecision must be made \"having regard for\" the five factors. If\nthis were not the case, if declining to authorize a transfer were\ncovered by the mandatory \"shall\" in \"shall assign,\" then the BOP\n\n                               -14-\n\fthere, however.        According to our analysis, under Lopez even the\n\nassignment provision supports the rulemaking at issue here.\n\n             The plain language of the statute contains no explicit\n\nguidance on whether the BOP may facilitate assignments through\n\ncategorical exercises of discretion.          Other courts have viewed the\n\nconjunctive list of the five factors and the mandatory nature of\n\nthe language \"shall designate . . . , considering\" as foreclosing\n\nthe possibility of a categorical exercise of discretion.                   See\n\nWedelstedt, 477 F.3d at 1165-66; Levine, 455 F.3d at 80-82; Fults,\n\n442 F.3d at 1091-92; Woodall, 432 F.3d at 245-46.               We agree, to a\n\npoint.       Congress certainly intended that the five factors be\n\nconsidered in the placement decision.           But we do not believe that\n\nthis constitutes the clear expression of Congressional intent\n\nrequired by Lopez to foreclose all rulemaking whatsoever.                 Even\n\nwhere    a   statute    requires   individualized     determinations,     \"the\n\ndecisionmaker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve\n\ncertain areas of general applicability unless Congress clearly\n\nexpresses an intent to withhold that authority.\"            Lopez, 531 U.S.\n\nat 244 (internal quotation omitted).             The statute does require\n\nindividualized determinations, but if that were sufficient to\n\nprevent rulemaking altogether, the statement in Lopez would be a\n\nparadox,     because    it   implies   that   some   statutes    that   require\n\n\nwould never be free to decline a transfer request without\nconsidering the five factors. Congress surely did not intend such\na result.\n\n                                       -15-\n\findividualized    determinations    nonetheless     permit     rulemaking.\n\nSomething more must be required of Congress, and we see no more\n\nhere.\n\n           Because the plain language of the statute does not\n\naddress   \"the   precise   question[s]    at   issue,\"   we   turn   to    the\n\nstatute's legislative history to help resolve the ambiguity.                We\n\nprovide some context.        Section 3621, enacted as part of the\n\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, replaced previous statutory language\n\ncommitting prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General and\n\ngranting him discretion to choose the place of confinement.               Pub.\n\nL. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2007-08; see also 18 U.S.C. §§ 4082(a)&(b)\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f(1984)15, amended by Pub. L. 98-473, § 218(a)(3) (old statutory\n\nscheme).\n\n           The other circuits have found the plain language of the\n\nstatute dispositive.    Wedelstedt, 477 F.3d at 1166-67; Levine, 455\n\nF.3d at 82; Fults, 442 F.3d at 1090; Woodall, 432 F.3d at 248-49.\n\nConsequently,   they   did   not   need   to   pursue   other   avenues   of\n\nstatutory construction such as legislative history.               But each\n\nmajority opinion does go on to examine the legislative history, a\n\n\n\n15\n Prior to enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the\nstatute read:\n               (a) A person convicted of an offense\n          against the United States shall be committed,\n          for such term of imprisonment as the court may\n          direct, to the custody of the Attorney General\n          of the United States, who shall designate the\n          place of confinement where the sentence shall\n          be served.\n               (b) The Attorney General may designate as\n          a   place   of  confinement    any  available,\n          suitable, and appropriate institution or\n          facility, whether maintained by the Federal\n          Government or otherwise, and whether within or\n          without the judicial district in which the\n          person was convicted, and may at any time\n          transfer   a   person   from   one   place   of\n          confinement to another.\n18 U.S.C. § 4082 (a)&(b) (1984).     The structure of the earlier\nstatute lends strength to our conclusion above that the discretion\nto order a transfer at all is not cabined by consideration of the\nfactors. Viewing the old language, it is even more clear that the\ntransfer language is separate from the mandate \"shall designate\" in\nsubsection (a).     While the discretionary \"may designate\" in\nsubsection (b) is clearly constrained by the requirement \"shall\ndesignate\" in subsection (a), there is no reason to read the\ntransfer-or-no-transfer decision as anything but discretionary.\nNor is there any indication from the legislative history discussed\nbelow that Congress intended to change the scope of this discretion\nwhen it changed the statute.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fpractice this circuit often follows as well.

Are   the   2005    Regulations                  a      Reasonable\n                          Interpretation of § 3621(b)?\n\n               Finding that Congress did not address whether the BOP\n\ncould make a categorical exclusion of one type of facility from its\n\nplacement decisions, we ask, under the second step of the Chevron\n\nanalysis,       whether         the    2005     regulations          are    a     reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the statute.                  467 U.S. at 844; see also id. at\n\n843 (\"[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the\n\nspecific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's\n\nanswer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\").\n\n               The 2005 regulations are a reasonable interpretation of\n\nthe mandate delivered to the BOP by Congress:                                   Congress has\n\ninstructed      the       BOP   to    place    each     prisoner      in   an    appropriate\n\n\n16\n We note that it is a symptom of the general weakness of\nlegislative history as a clue to legislative intent that even this\nsmall piece of a Senate report seems to shift meaning depending on\nthe light in which it is viewed.\n\n                                              -19-\n\ffacility, considering the five factors.        In carrying out that\n\nresponsibility, the BOP has made the reasonable determination that\n\nsome   facilities   are   simply   categorically   inappropriate   for\n\nprisoners during the first ninety percent of their sentences or for\n\nperiods of longer than six months.     Neither the substance of that\n\ndecision, nor the method the BOP used to codify the decision\n\nrepresents an unreasonable interpretation of § 3621(b).\n\n          The concurring opinion in Goldings predicted that \"[e]ven\n\nif the statutory criteria for making assignments and transfers\n\ncould be read to guarantee some sort of individualized treatment .\n\n. . BOP would still have the authority to make a categorical rule\n\nexcluding some or all CCC placements, except as required for end of\n\nsentence placements governed by § 3624(c).\"    Goldings, 383 F.3d at\n\n33 (Howard, J., concurring).       The concurrence relied on Lopez,\n\nquoting a passage we have already mentioned:\n\n          \"Even   if   a   statutory    scheme   requires\n          individualized determinations . . . the\n          decisionmaker has the authority to rely on\n          rulemaking to resolve certain issues of\n          general applicability unless Congress clearly\n          expresses   an   intent    to   withhold   that\n          authority.\" [Lopez, 531 U.S. at 243-44]\n          (quoting American Hosp.

The first\n\nquestion is whether this statement in Lopez applies.              It does.\n\n           On    the    one   hand,   Lopez   is   particularly   instructive\n\nbecause it treats the authority of the same agency, the BOP, to\n\npromulgate regulations under another part of the same statutory\n\nscheme, § 3621(e).        On the other hand, that part of the statute\n\nlists no factors for consideration.            The other circuits to have\n\nconsidered the question find Lopez inapplicable to § 3621(b); they\n\nreason that § 3621(b) is different because inclusion of the factors\n\nas a conjunctive list demonstrates clear congressional intent that\n\nall of the factors be considered. Wedelstedt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796937\"><a href=\"/opinion/796937/edward-j-wedelstedt-v-ron-wiley-warden-federal-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1167-\n\n68;   Levine, 455 F.3d at 85; Fults, 442 F.3d at 1091; Woodall, 432\n\nF.3d at 246-47.        As previously discussed, we do not think this is\n\nthe sort of clear expression of intent required.\n\n           The second question is whether the substance of the 2005\n\nregulations     is   an   acceptable    implementation    of   the   governing\n\nstatute.   It is.      Two facts compel us to that conclusion.\n\n           First, the decision with which the BOP is charged in the\n\nstatute is not the one being made by the 2005 regulations.                If §\n\n3621(b) were directed solely at the determination of whether a CCC\n\nor a traditional prison facility was the right type of facility, we\n\nmight come to a different result.             But § 3621 requires BOP to\n\nconsider the five factors in a much broader context: deciding what\n\nspecific facility is the right one to house each prisoner.                   The\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fquestion whether a CCC is an appropriate facility for any prisoner\n\nduring the first ninety percent of a term is a subset of that\n\nquestion, and deciding it on a categorical basis is not the same as\n\ndeciding the final issue of placement on a categorical basis.17\n\nThis, then, is nothing more than a background rule of general\n\napplicability,    promulgated       in    the   interest      of   efficiency    and\n\nuniformity, that serves to focus the individualized consideration\n\nCongress required.       This is precisely what Lopez envisioned.               \"The\n\nBureau is not required continually to revisit 'issues that may be\n\nestablished     fairly    and   efficiently       in    a     single     rulemaking\n\nproceeding.'\" Lopez, 531 U.S. at 244 (quoting Heckler, 461 U.S. at\n\n467).\n\n           Second,   the     2005   regulations        were      promulgated    with\n\nexplicit reference to some of the five factors.                     See Community\n\nConfinement, Proposed Rule, 69 Fed. Reg. at 51,214 (discussing\n\nfacility     resources    and   policy      statements      of     the   Sentencing\n\nCommission).      The proposed rule also expressly relied on the\n\nimportance of deterring future crime, which is one of the stated\n\ngoals of sentencing, as well as § 3621(b)'s prohibition on treating\n\ninmates differently based on wealth or social status.                       Id. at\n\n51,214-15.    Under the statute, other factors may be considered and\n\n\n\n17\n We emphasize that were the regulations to leave little or no room\nfor the operation of the individualized assessment implied by\nCongress, we would regard that as contrary to intent of the\nstatute.\n\n                                         -22-\n\fmay even be dispositive.     \"When experience or common sense shows\n\nthat the housing decision will be the same no matter what the\n\nevidence regarding a particular factor, the BOP need not go through\n\nthe motions of collecting the evidence and noting that the one\n\nfactor cannot outweigh the others in the particular circumstance.\"\n\nWedelstedt, 477 F.3d at 1171 (Hartz, J., dissenting); see also\n\nLevine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795067\"><a href=\"/opinion/795067/elliott-levine-v-craig-apker/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 91 (Raggi, J., dissenting) (\"The BOP might\n\nreasonably conclude, as it implicitly did here, that, regardless of\n\nan     individual   prisoner's   offense,   history,   and   personal\n\ncharacteristics, or any statement made by a sentencing judge, other\n\nfactors . . . combine to warrant a categorical rule excluding CCC\n\nfacilities from consideration in general § 3621(b) designations.\")\n\nIf Congress had limited consideration to only these five factors,\n\nor had laid out how the factors ought to be balanced, we would face\n\na different question.       Pragmatically, we cannot imagine that\n\nCongress intended by its silence to make pointless work for the\n\nBOP.\n\n            We note also that the BOP has other policies that deny\n\nCCC placement in other circumstances.        See Federal Bureau of\n\nPrisons, Program Statement 7310.04, Community Corrections Center\n\n(CCC) Utilization and Transfer Procedure at 10 (Dec. 16, 1998),\n\navailable at http://bop.gov/DataSource/execute/dsPolicyLoc (last\n\nvisited Feb. 20, 2008).     Those policies restrict the transfer of\n\ninmates who are assigned a \"Sex Offender\" or \"Deportable Alien\"\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f\"Public   Safety       Factor\"   or   \"who    require   inpatient      medical,\n\npsychological, or psychiatric treatment,\" among others.18                      Id.\n\nThese policies are entitled to less deference under Chevron,\n\nbecause they are merely interpretive rules and were not promulgated\n\nunder the APA's notice-and-comment provisions.                    But they have\n\nnevertheless been upheld.        See Fox v. Lappin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2404709\"><a href=\"/opinion/2404709/fox-v-lappin/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mass 2006) (upholding policy of denying transfer to CCC to\n\nthose with \"Sex Offender\" Public Safety Factor).              We believe this\n\nis in accordance with the BOP's ability to make rules of general\n\napplicability that guide its decisions.\n\n           Stepping back, we recognize that the dispute is in part\n\nover the BOP's substantive decision to restrict CCC availability.\n\nAssuming the decision itself is not contrary to the wishes of\n\nCongress, the BOP will one way or the other be able to carry it\n\nout.19    The   2005    regulations    at    least   have   the    advantage   of\n\ntransparency.      There is no dispute that, as long as the BOP\n\n\"considers\" the five factors, it has virtually unlimited discretion\n\nto place inmates wherever it deems appropriate.                   The BOP could\n\nsimply consider the five factors in each case but decide, in each\n\ncase, not to place each inmate in a CCC.             At the very least, the\n\n\n18\n These policies say that such prisoners are not \"ordinarily\"\neligible for CCC placement.      This might appear to provide\nexceptions that are ostensibly lacking in the 2005 regulations.\nBut this does not change our analysis.\n19\n Of course, if the decision to restrict CCC placements is\nunacceptable to Congress, it can easily rectify the discrepancy.\n\n                                      -24-\n\f2005 regulations have the advantage of being consistent, formal\n\nrules of general applicability that can be attacked under the APA\n\nfor the circumstances of their promulgation and can be discussed as\n\nmatters of public policy in the elected branches.              Similarly, even\n\ncourts striking down the 2005 regulations seem to acknowledge that\n\nthe BOP could close the CCCs entirely.         See Levine, 455 F.3d at 82.\n\nThat such a result would frustrate petitioners' desires is obvious.\n\n             Our holding is a narrow one of statutory interpretation.\n\nWe emphasize that we express no opinion about the validity of the\n\n2005 regulations under the APA.         Neither do we pass any judgment on\n\nthe wisdom of the decision to limit CCC placements.              We recognize\n\nthat sentencing discretion is crucial to district court judges, and\n\nurge   and    expect   the   BOP   to    be   sensitive   to    this   in   its\n\npolicymaking.\n\n             Because the individualized consideration of the five\n\nfactors mandated by 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b) is directed at the overall\n\nplacement decision, and because the question of the appropriateness\n\nof CCCs for inmates during the first ninety percent of their\n\nsentences is an issue of general applicability within the scope of\n\nLopez, the 2005 regulations are a reasonable exercise of the Bureau\n\nof Prisons' discretion in carrying out its duties under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3621(b).     The plain language and legislative history are silent\n\non whether such a policy would contradict the statute, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fBOP's construction of its duties here is reasonable.

The Bureau of Prisons shall designate\n\nthe place of the prisoner's imprisonment. The Bureau may designate\n\nany available penal or correctional facility that meets minimum\n\nstandards of health and habitability established by the Bureau,\n\nwhether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise and\n\nwhether within or without the judicial district in which the person\n\nwas convicted, that the Bureau determines to be appropriate and\n\nsuitable, considering--\n\n   (1) the resources of the facility contemplated;\n\n   (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense;\n\n   (3) the history and characteristics of the prisoner;\n\n   (4) any statement by the court that imposed the sentence--\n\n        (A) concerning the purposes for which the sentence to\n\nimprisonment was determined to be warranted; or\n\n     (B) recommending a type of penal or correctional facility as\n\nappropriate; and\n\n   (5) any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing\n\nCommission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title 28.\n\n\n\nIn designating the place of imprisonment or making transfers under\n\nthis subsection, there shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of\n\nhigh social or economic status. The Bureau may at any time, having\n\n\n                               -27-\n\fregard for the same matters, direct the transfer of a prisoner from\n\none penal or correctional facility to another.

The Bureau designates inmates to community\n\nconfinement only as part of pre-release custody and programming\n\nwhich will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust\n\nto and prepare for re-entry into the community.\n\n           (b) As discussed in this subpart, the term \"community\n\nconfinement\" includes Community Corrections Centers (CCC) (also\n\nknown as \"halfway houses\") and home confinement.\n\n\n\n§ 570.21 When will the Bureau designate inmates to community\n\nconfinement?\n\n           (a)   The   Bureau   will   designate    inmates   to   community\n\nconfinement only as part of pre-release custody and programming,\n\nduring the last ten percent of the prison sentence being served,\n\nnot to exceed six months.\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f          (b) We may exceed these time-frames only when specific\n\nBureau programs allow greater periods of community confinement, as\n\nprovided by separate statutory authority (for example, residential\n\nsubstance abuse treatment program (18 U.S.C. 3621(e)(2)(A)), or\n\nshock incarceration program (18 U.S.C. 4046(c)).\n\n\n\nS. Rep 98-225, at 141-21:\n\n\n\nSECTION 3621. IMPRISONMENT OF A CONVICTED PERSON\n\n          This section is derived from existing law.\n\n          Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3621(a) is derived from 18 U.S.C.\n\n4082(a) except that the new provision places custody of federal\n\nprisoners directly in the Bureau of Prisons rather than in the\n\nAttorney General.    This change is not intended to affect the\n\nauthority of the Bureau of Prisons with regard to such matters as\n\nplace of confinement of prisoners, transfers of prisoners, and\n\ncorrectional   programs,   but   is   designed   only   to   simplify   the\n\nadministration of the prison system.      Direct custody of prisoners\n\nwill be in the Bureau of Prisons, but the Director of the Bureau of\n\nPrisons will remain subject to appointment by the Attorney General\n\nand subject to his direction.     In addition, it is made clear that\n\nthe custody of the Bureau of Prisons continues until the expiration\n\nof the term of imprisonment, or until release at the expiration of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fthat   term     less   any   time   credited      toward    service       of   sentence\n\npursuant to section 3624(b).\n\n               Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3621 (b) follows existing law in\n\nproviding that the authority to designate the place of confinement\n\nfor    federal    prisoners      rests    in    the   Bureau    of    Prisons.       The\n\ndesignated penal or correctional facility need not be in the\n\njudicial district in which the prisoner was convicted and need not\n\nbe maintained by the federal government.                   Existing law provides\n\nthat the Bureau may designate a place of confinement that is\n\navailable, appropriate, and suitable.                 Section 3621(b) continues\n\nthat discretionary authority with a new requirement that the\n\nfacility       meet    minimum   standards       of   health        and   habitability\n\nestablished      by    the   Bureau      of    Prisons.        In    determining     the\n\navailability or suitability of the facility selected, the Bureau is\n\nspecifically required to consider such factors as the resources of\n\nthe facility considered, the nature and circumstances of the\n\noffense, the history and characteristics of the prisoner, the\n\nstatements made by the sentencing court concerning the purposes for\n\nimprisonment in a particular case, any recommendations as to type\n\nof facility made by the court, and any pertinent policy statements\n\nissued    by    the    Sentencing     Commission      pursuant       to   proposed    28\n\nU.S.C.994(a)(2).         After considering these factors, the Bureau of\n\nPrisons may designate the place of imprisonment in an appropriate\n\n\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\ftype   of   facility,     or   may   transfer   the    offender       to   another\n\nappropriate facility.\n\n            In the absence of unusual circumstances, federal courts\n\ncurrently    will   not    review    a   decision     as   to   the    place   of\n\nconfinement.    The committee, by listing factors for the Bureau to\n\nconsider in determining the appropriateness or suitability of any\n\navailable facility, does not intend to restrict or limit the Bureau\n\nin the exercise of its existing discretion so long as the facility\n\nmeets the minimum standards of health and habitability of the\n\nBureau, but intends simple to set forth the appropriate factors\n\nthat the Bureau should consider in making the designations.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\f</pre>",
