Claimant Mary Lou Kalman appeals from the\n\njudgment of the district court upholding the denial of Social\n\nSecurity disability benefits. After carefully reviewing the briefs\n\nand   the   record,   we    affirm   the   district   court   judgment   for\n\nessentially the reasons stated in that court's order, dated April\n\n20, 2004. We add only that, in relation to claimant's difficulties\n\nwith maintaining concentration and attention, the administrative\n\nlaw judge presented this limitation to the vocational expert at the\n\nsupplemental hearing, and the vocational expert responded that such\n\ndifficulties would not preclude claimant from working at the\n\nunskilled level. Thus, the administrative law judge did not ignore\n\nclaimant's limitations in this regard.\n\n            Affirmed.      See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f",
