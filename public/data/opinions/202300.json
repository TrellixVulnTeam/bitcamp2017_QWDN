Mahone argues that the district court\n\nerred in admitting footwear impression expert testimony that was\n\nkey to the jury’s attempted robbery verdict, and that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in calculating his restitution by\n\nundervaluing the stolen vehicle that was recovered.\n\n     We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3742(a), and we affirm the district court.\n\nI.   STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     On November 10, 2003, a man attempted to rob the Gardiner\n\nFederal Credit Union in Maine.    He was armed with a knife and gun\n\nand dressed in black.    He wore gloves and a ski mask, with white\n\nmakeup around the eyes.        Black clothing that Mahone admitted\n\nwearing was found in a garbage bag near the credit union.      Mahone’s\n\nDNA was found on latex gloves, a ski mask, and shoes found near the\n\ncredit union.   Mahone’s fingerprints were found on makeup kits\n\ndiscarded in a nearby dumpster.    Mahone’s car was discovered near\n\nthe credit union.    Three weeks after the robbery, Mahone was found\n\nin New Hampshire with a stolen Ford Explorer in his possession.\n\n     Prior to Mahone’s trial, on June 25, 2004, the district court\n\nconducted a daylong hearing on Mahone’s motion in limine to exclude\n\nMaine State Police Crime Laboratory forensic scientist Cynthia\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fHomer’s testimony that footwear impressions taken inside the credit\n\nunion matched the shoe found with Mahone’s DNA. The district court\n\ndenied the motion in a comprehensive published order.                 United\n\nStates v. Mahone, 328 F. Supp. 2d 77 (D. Me. 2004).          The district\n\ncourt accepted Homer as an expert in footwear impression collection\n\nand   analysis,   found    her    methodology    for   analyzing    footwear\n\nimpression evidence reliable, and concluded that her proffered\n\ntestimony was admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 702 and Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).              Mahone,\n\n328 F. Supp. 2d at 89-92.\n\n      At trial, Mahone’s counsel raised no objections to allowing\n\nHomer’s expert testimony, “subject to prior rulings by the court.”\n\nHomer testified to her opinion that the shoe found with Mahone’s\n\nDNA had made the impressions found on a stairway and a teller\n\ncounter inside the credit union.\n\n      On October 4, 2004, the jury convicted Mahone of attempted\n\nbank robbery and interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2113 and 2312, respectively.             On March\n\n24, 2005, the district court sentenced Mahone.          Mahone’s sentence\n\nincluded    imprisonment    and    restitution    of   $5,477.75    for   the\n\nfinancial loss borne by the stolen vehicle’s insurer.              He timely\n\nappealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fII.   DISCUSSION\n\n      A.    Admission of footwear impression expert testimony\n\n      We review the trial judge’s decision to admit expert testimony\n\nfor abuse of discretion.         United States v. Mooney, 315 F. 3d 54, 62\n\n(1st Cir. 2002). Mahone objected to Homer’s testimony by motion in\n\nlimine, without subsequent, contemporaneous objection at trial.\n\nUnder earlier law in this circuit, this would have allowed review\n\nonly for plain error.         See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181,\n\n1190 (1st Cir. 1994).            However, under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n103(a) as amended in 2000, a party need not renew an objection once\n\nthe court makes a “definitive ruling”               on the record admitting\n\nevidence    before      trial.   In    Mahone’s   case,     the    district      court\n\ndefinitively determined that the expert testimony was “admissible\n\nunder the standards set forth both in Rule 702 and Daubert.”\n\nMahone, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 92.           Mahone’s objection was preserved.\n\nSee, e.g., Conwood Co. v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768, 792 (6th\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n      Before accepting expert testimony, a district court must\n\ndetermine that a witness is “qualified as an expert by knowledge,\n\nskill, experience, training, or education.”                 Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\nRegarding   this       threshold   inquiry,      Mahone   argues     that   Homer’s\n\nqualifications       are   insufficient,       simply     because    she    is    not\n\nqualified     as   a    footwear      examiner    through    the    International\n\nAssociation for Identification (IAI).             This argument has no merit.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fThe district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n      Homer is sufficiently qualified as an expert. She is a trained\n\nforensic professional with a specialty in impressions.              She has a\n\nmasters degree in forensic science.         At trial, she stated that she\n\nhad made more than 11,000 footwear comparisons.             She had worked as\n\na “latent impressions” specialist for more than two years and had\n\ntwice testified in court as an expert in footwear impressions. She\n\nhad also taken a 40-hour FBI course in footwear and tire impression\n\nevidence analysis. She is subject to annual proficiency testing by\n\nan outside agency.      Although Homer was an active member in the IAI,\n\nshe lacked the requisite three years’ professional experience to\n\nqualify for voluntary certification through IAI’s footwear analysis\n\nprogram.      It   is   not   required     that   experts     be   blue-ribbon\n\npractitioners with optional certifications.           See United States v.\n\nRose, 731 F.2d 1337, 1346 (8th Cir. 1984) (holding, pre-Daubert,\n\nthat “[a]n expert witness need not be an outstanding practitioner\n\nin the field nor have certificates of training in the particular\n\nsubject”).\n\n      At the in limine hearing and at trial, Homer thoroughly\n\ndescribed the “ACE-V” method (analysis, comparison, evaluation, and\n\nverification) for assessing footwear impressions, and described her\n\nuse of the method in Mahone’s case.         Mahone argues, however, that\n\nthe   ACE-V   method    “utterly   lacks    in    objective    identification\n\nstandards” because: 1) there is no set number of clues which\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fdictate a match between an impression and a particular shoe; 2)\n\nthere   is    no   objective   standard    for   determining   whether   a\n\ndiscrepancy between an impression and a shoe is major or minor; and\n\n3) the government provided “absolutely no scientific testing of the\n\npremises underlying ACE-V.”       At issue is Fed. R. Evid. 702(2)’s\n\nrequirement that an expert may testify if “the testimony is the\n\nproduct of reliable principles and methods.”          Mahone’s arguments\n\nlack merit.\n\n     From the outset, it is difficult to discern any abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the district court’s decision, because other federal\n\ncourts have favorably analyzed the ACE-V method under Daubert for\n\nfootwear and fingerprint impressions.        See United States v. Allen,\n\n207 F. Supp. 2d 856 (N.D. Ind. 2002) (footwear impressions), aff’d,\n\n390 F.3d 944 (7th Cir. 2004); United States v. Mitchell, 365 F.3d\n\n215, 246 (3d Cir. 2004) (favorably analyzing ACE-V method under\n\nDaubert in latent fingerprint identification case); Commonwealth v.\n\nPatterson, 840 N.E.2d 12, 32-33 (Mass. 2005) (holding ACE-V method\n\nreliable under Daubert for single latent fingerprint impressions).\n\n     Even by looking only to the record in the instant case, no\n\nabuse of discretion is evident.           The district court explicitly\n\nconsidered the four guiding factors laid out as guidance by the\n\nSupreme Court in Daubert: 1) whether the underlying method can be\n\nor has been tested; 2) whether the method has been subject to peer\n\nreview and publication; 3) the method’s known or potential error\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\frate; and 4) the level of the method’s acceptance within the\n\nrelevant discipline.           See Mahone, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 88-92.         Our\n\nreview     of    the    record    confirms      that    these   factors   support\n\nadmissibility of ACE-V.           The method has been tested in published\n\nstudies    and    has   been     the    subject   of   widespread   publication,\n\nincluding books devoted to footwear impressions, although it is not\n\nclear that there have been rigorous peer-reviewed articles.                 Homer\n\noffered a potential error rate of zero for the method, stating that\n\nany error is attributable to examiners.                Finally, ACE-V is clearly\n\nhighly accepted in the forensics field; the same method is used for\n\nlatent impression analysis of fingerprints.\n\n       Even if there were cause for concern with the ACE-V method,\n\nDaubert emphasized that “[v]igorous cross-examination, presentation\n\nof contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of\n\nproof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky\n\nbut admissible evidence.”              Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596.1     Under this\n\n\n1\n    The First Circuit has noted that:\n\n       Daubert does not require that a party who proffers expert\n       testimony carry the burden of proving to the judge that\n       the expert’s assessment of the situation is correct. As\n       long as an expert’s scientific testimony rests upon good\n       grounds, based on what is known, it should be tested by\n       the adversary process - competing expert testimony and\n       active cross-examination - rather than excluded from\n       jurors’ scrutiny for fear that they will not grasp its\n       complexities or satisfactorily weigh its inadequacies.\n       In short, Daubert . . . demands only that the proponent\n       of the evidence show that the expert’s conclusion has\n       been arrived at in a scientifically sound and\n       methodologically reliable fashion.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fanalysis, Mahone’s argument regarding the lack of a set number of\n\nclues required for an ACE-V match must fail.    We have rejected a\n\nsimilar argument that a handwriting analysis method impermissibly\n\nlacked a standard for the number of similarities required for a\n\nmatch.   See United States v. Mooney, 315 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).      Here, as in Mooney, such an argument “misunderstands\n\nDaubert to demand unassailable expert testimony.”    See id.\n\n     Not only did Mahone exercise his right to cross-examine Homer\n\nat trial regarding the alleged shortcomings in ACE-V, he had the\n\nbenefit of an earlier Daubert hearing to challenge Homer and ACE-V.\n\nMahone failed to offer his own expert or any other independent\n\nevidence revealing reliability concerns with ACE-V or Homer’s\n\nfindings.    The district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n     Mahone also raises an argument under Fed. R. Evid. 702(3),\n\nwhich requires that an expert witness have “applied the principles\n\nand methods reliably to the facts of the case.”    Specifically, he\n\nargues that there are problems with the verification step of the\n\nACE-V method as applied, because: 1) Homer stated that she had no\n\nidea whether the verifying examiner was “blinded” (had not reviewed\n\nher report before conducting his examination); and because 2) the\n\ngovernment failed to produce the verifying examiner at trial\n\n(instead, Homer testified regarding this examiner’s background and\n\n\n\nRuiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 161 F.3d 77, 85\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fexperience).\n\n     The district court did not abuse its discretion.                      Other\n\nfederal courts have found ACE-V to be reliable under Daubert, while\n\nnoting that verification in ACE-V may not be blinded.               See United\n\nStates v. Havvard, 117 F. Supp. 2d 848, 853, 855 (S.D. Ind. 2000)\n\n(“[T]he   second    expert    may   know    from   the   outset   that   another\n\nexaminer has already made the positive identification . . . .\n\n[L]atent print identification is the very archetype of reliable\n\nexpert testimony.”), aff’d, 260 F.3d 597 (7th Cir. 2001); Mitchell,\n\n365 F.3d at 239 (noting that although ACE-V verification may not be\n\nblinded, it still constitutes “peer review” that favors admission\n\nof the method).\n\n     At most, Mahone’s first verification argument goes only to\n\nweight, not admissibility, under Daubert and Ruiz-Troche. There is\n\nno evidence that ACE-V mandates blinded verification. Under cross-\n\nexamination by Mahone’s trial counsel, Homer acknowledged only “a\n\nlot of debate” over whether a verifying examiner should be blinded.\n\n     Mahone’s      argument   regarding      the   government’s    failure   to\n\nproduce the verifying expert at trial does not actually contest the\n\napplication of the ACE-V method; Mahone does not assert that there\n\nwas no verification of Homer’s findings.            Instead, Mahone objects\n\nto the government’s litigation approach of not presenting the\n\nverifying expert as a trial witness.           If Mahone intended a hearsay\n\nchallenge, however, he waived it by failing to make any such\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fargument in his opening brief.            See Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus\n\nGroup, Inc., 358 F.3d 110, 114 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nB.    The district court’s restitution calculation\n\n      We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and\n\nsubsidiary findings of fact for clear error.           See United States v.\n\nBurdi, 414 F.3d 216, 221 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n      As part of his sentence for interstate transportation of a\n\nstolen vehicle, Mahone was ordered to pay $5,477.75 in restitution\n\nto an insurance company. The insurer had compensated the vehicle’s\n\nowner $6,227.75, and later received $750 for selling the vehicle\n\nafter it was recovered by police.           The vehicle was missing for\n\nnearly a month before its recovery.\n\n      The district court’s calculation was made under a provision of\n\nthe   Mandatory     Victims    Restitution      Act    (MVRA),    18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 3663A(b)(1), which directs that restitution be equal to the\n\noriginal value of the property less “the value (as of the date the\n\nproperty   is    returned)    of   any   part   of   the   property    that   is\n\nreturned.”      The parties stipulated that $6,227.75 represented the\n\noriginal value of the vehicle, a 1996 Ford Explorer. Mahone argues\n\nthat the vehicle’s value as of the date it was returned is far\n\nhigher than $750.      He notes that the Kelley Blue Book “suggested\n\nretail value” for such a vehicle is $5,760.2               Mahone argues that\n\n\n2\n  Mahone also notes that the police incident report for the\nvehicle’s recovery lists its condition as good and its value as\n$5,000.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f$750 is “simply the amount for which the vehicle was sold,” and\n\nthat the government “produced absolutely no evidence that this\n\nfigure even approaches this vehicle’s value at the time of its\n\nrecovery.”\n\n       At sentencing, the district court acknowledged “the rather\n\nextreme variation” between $5,760 and $750, but stated, “[I]t’s\n\nmore   likely   than   not   that   the   value   was   actually   the   value\n\nreflected in the price that the insurance company paid and received\n\nas a consequence of its dealings with the automobile.”                    The\n\ndistrict court then explained:\n\n       I take it as a given that the insurance company is not in\n       the business of paying to its insureds more money than\n       the value of the vehicles it has insured. And I also\n       take it as a given that the insurer has every incentive\n       to receive full value for any vehicle that it receives\n       title to that has been damaged or stolen. In this case,\n       absent some information that . . . [the insurer’s] sale\n       of the vehicle was conducted under less than optimal\n       circumstances, the court really has to conclude that the\n       $750 for whatever reason is what [the insurer] could have\n       received on the date of sale since it is what it did in\n       fact receive.\n\n       Otherwise, the court is left to speculate on the\n       condition of the vehicle, the impact that its being\n       stolen may have on its value, the impact of its being\n       held in police custody for an extended period of\n       time . . . and absent some indication that the auction or\n       sale . . . was not fair market value and circumstances\n       that would indicate another value, I am going to accept\n       [the $750 figure].\n\n       As the district court noted, the government did produce\n\nevidence of the vehicle’s value – the price for which it was\n\nactually sold upon recovery.        The seller insurer had, moreover, a\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fcommon-sense    incentive   to   regain   as   much   as   possible   of   the\n\n$6,277.75 it had given to its insured for the original theft of the\n\nvehicle.\n\n     We recently held, moreover, that “absolute precision is not\n\nrequired” in calculating restitution under the MVRA.               Burdi, 414\n\nF.3d at 221.      In interpreting the MVRA, Burdi looked to our\n\nanalysis of the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA), 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3663,   a   separate    restitution   statute     with    an    identical\n\nrestitution calculation method and other close similarities to the\n\nMVRA.   United States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579 (1st Cir. 1997).3\n\nVaknin concluded that only “a modicum of reliable evidence” is\n\nrequired to establish a restitution award; “an award cannot be\n\nwoven solely from the gossamer strands of speculation and surmise.”\n\nId. at 587.     Vaknin added that “the legislative history [for the\n\nVWPA] clearly signals a congressional preference for rough remedial\n\njustice, emphasizing victims’ rights.”         Id.    Specifically, Vaknin\n\nheld that Congress intended to authorize expeditious and reasonable\n\n\n3\n  Because the VWPA and the MVRA have identical restitution\ncalculation language, Burdi reasoned, “it is appropriate for us to\nturn to Vaknin for guidance” in interpreting the MVRA. 414 F.3d at\n221 n.6 (internal quotation omitted).\n\n Several other circuits have noted the very strong similarities\nbetween the two statutes. As a result of this similarity, “courts\ninterpreting the MVRA may look to and rely on cases interpreting\nthe VWPA as precedent.” United States v. Gordon, 393 F.3d 1044,\n1048 (9th Cir. 2004).

STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 10, 2003, a man attempted to rob the Gardiner Federal Credit Union in Maine. He was armed with a knife and gun and dressed in black. He wore gloves and a ski mask, with white makeup around the eyes. Black clothing that Mahone admitted wearing was found in a garbage bag near the credit union. Mahone's DNA was found on latex gloves, a ski mask, and shoes found near the credit union. Mahone's fingerprints were found on makeup kits discarded in a nearby dumpster. Mahone's car was discovered near the credit union. Three weeks after the robbery, Mahone was found in New Hampshire with a stolen Ford Explorer in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to Mahone's trial, on June 25, 2004, the district court conducted a daylong hearing on Mahone's motion <i>in limine</i> to exclude Maine State Police Crime Laboratory forensic scientist Cynthia Homer's testimony that footwear impressions taken inside the credit union matched the shoe found with Mahone's DNA. The district court denied the motion in a comprehensive published order. <i>United States v. Mahone,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d 77 (D.Me.2004). The district court accepted Homer as an expert in footwear impression collection and analysis, found her methodology for analyzing footwear impression evidence reliable, and concluded that her proffered testimony was admissible under Fed. R.Evid. 702 and <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). <i>Mahone,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 89-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Mahone's counsel raised no objections to allowing Homer's expert testimony, \"subject to prior rulings by the court.\" Homer testified to her opinion that the shoe found with Mahone's DNA had made the impressions found on a stairway and a teller counter inside the credit union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 4, 2004, the jury convicted Mahone of attempted bank robbery and interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2113 and 2312, respectively. On March 24, 2005, the district court sentenced Mahone. Mahone's sentence included imprisonment and restitution of $5,477.75 for the financial loss borne by the stolen vehicle's insurer. He timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Admission of footwear impression expert testimony</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the trial judge's decision to admit expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.2002). Mahone objected to Homer's testimony by motion <i>in limine,</i> without subsequent, contemporaneous objection at trial. Under earlier law in this circuit, this would have allowed review only for plain error. <i>See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc.,</i> 21 F.3d 1181, 1190 (1st Cir.1994). However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a) as amended in 2000, a party need not renew an objection once the court makes a \"definitive ruling\" on the record admitting evidence before trial. In Mahone's case, the district court definitively determined that the expert testimony was \"admissible under the standards set forth both in Rule 702 and Daubert.\" <i>Mahone,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 92. Mahone's objection was preserved. <i>See, e.g., Conwood Co. v. U.S. Tobacco Co.,</i> 290 F.3d 768, 792 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before accepting expert testimony, a district court must determine that a witness is \"qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702. Regarding this threshold inquiry, Mahone argues that Homer's qualifications are insufficient, simply because she is not qualified as a footwear examiner through the International Association for Identification (IAI). This argument has no merit. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Homer is sufficiently qualified as an expert. She is a trained forensic professional with a specialty in impressions. She has a masters degree in forensic science. At trial, she stated that she had made more than 11,000 footwear comparisons. She had worked as a \"latent impressions\" specialist for more than two years and had twice testified in court as an expert in footwear impressions. She had also taken a 40-hour FBI course in footwear and tire impression evidence analysis. She is subject to annual proficiency testing by an outside agency. Although Homer was an active member in the IAI, she lacked the requisite three years' professional experience to qualify for voluntary certification through IAI's footwear analysis program. It is not required that experts be blue-ribbon practitioners with optional certifications. <i>See United States v. Rose,</i> 731 F.2d 1337, 1346 (8th Cir.1984) (holding, pre-<i>Daubert,</i> that \"[a]n expert witness need not be an outstanding practitioner in the field nor have certificates of training in the particular subject\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the <i>in limine</i> hearing and at trial, Homer thoroughly described the \"ACE-V\" method (analysis, comparison, evaluation, and verification) for assessing footwear impressions, and described her use of the method in Mahone's case. Mahone argues, however, that the ACE-V method \"utterly lacks in objective identification standards\" because: 1) there is no set number of clues which dictate a match between an impression and a particular shoe; 2) there is no objective standard for determining whether a discrepancy between an impression and a shoe is major or minor; and 3) the government provided \"absolutely no scientific testing of the premises underlying ACE-V.\" At issue is Fed.R.Evid. 702(2)'s requirement that an expert may testify if \"the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods.\" Mahone's arguments lack merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the outset, it is difficult to discern any abuse of discretion in the district court's decision, because other federal courts have favorably analyzed the ACE-V method under <i>Daubert</i> for footwear and fingerprint impressions. <i>See United States v. Allen,</i> 207 F.Supp.2d 856 (N.D.Ind.2002) (footwear impressions), <i>aff'd,</i> 390 F.3d 944 (7th Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 365 F.3d 215, 246 (3d Cir.2004) (favorably analyzing ACE-V method under <i>Daubert</i> in latent fingerprint identification case); <i>Commonwealth v. Patterson,</i> 445 Mass. 626, 840 N.E.2d 12, 32-33 (2005) (holding ACE-V method reliable under <i>Daubert</i> for single latent fingerprint impressions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even by looking only to the record in the instant case, no abuse of discretion is evident. The district court explicitly considered the four guiding factors laid out as guidance by the Supreme Court in <i>Daubert:</i> 1) whether the underlying method can be or has been tested; 2) whether the method has been subject to peer review and publication; 3) the method's known or potential error rate; and 4) the level of the method's acceptance within the relevant discipline. <i>See Mahone,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 88-92. Our review of the record confirms that these factors support admissibility of ACE-V. The method has been tested in published studies and has been the subject of widespread publication, including books devoted to footwear impressions, although it is not clear that there have been rigorous peer-reviewed articles. Homer offered a potential error rate of zero for the method, stating that any error is attributable to examiners. Finally, ACE-V is clearly highly accepted in the forensics field; the same method is used for latent impression analysis of fingerprints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there were cause for concern with the ACE-V method, <i>Daubert</i> emphasized that \"[v]igorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\" <i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 596, 113 S.Ct. 2786.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Under this analysis, Mahone's argument regarding the lack of a set number of clues required for an ACE-V match must fail. We have rejected a similar argument that a handwriting analysis method impermissibly lacked a standard for the number of similarities required for a match. <i>See United States v. Mooney,</i> 315 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir.2002). Here, as in <i>Mooney,</i> such an argument \"misunderstands <i>Daubert</i> to demand unassailable expert testimony.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did Mahone exercise his right to cross-examine Homer at trial regarding the alleged shortcomings in ACE-V, he had the benefit of an earlier <i>Daubert</i> hearing to challenge Homer and ACE-V. Mahone failed to offer his own expert or any other independent evidence revealing reliability concerns with ACE-V or Homer's findings. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mahone also raises an argument under Fed.R.Evid. 702(3), which requires that an expert witness have \"applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" Specifically, he argues that there are problems with the verification step of the ACE-V method as applied, because: 1) Homer stated that she had no idea whether the verifying examiner was \"blinded\" (had not reviewed her report before conducting his examination); and because 2) the government failed to produce the verifying examiner at trial (instead, Homer testified regarding this examiner's background and experience).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. Other federal courts have found ACE-V to be reliable under <i>Daubert,</i> while noting that verification in ACE-V may not be blinded. <i>See United States v. Havvard,</i> 117 F.Supp.2d 848, 853, 855 (S.D.Ind.2000) (\"[T]he second expert may know from the outset that another examiner has already made the positive identification.... [L]atent print identification is the very archetype of reliable expert testimony.\"), <i>aff'd,</i> 260 F.3d 597 (7th Cir.2001); <i>Mitchell,</i> 365 F.3d at 239 (noting that although ACE-V verification may not be blinded, it still constitutes \"peer review\" that favors admission of the method).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At most, Mahone's first verification argument goes only to weight, not admissibility, under <i>Daubert</i> and <i>Ruiz-Troche.</i> There is no evidence that ACE-V mandates blinded verification. Under cross-examination by Mahone's trial counsel, Homer acknowledged only \"a lot of debate\" over whether a verifying examiner should be blinded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mahone's argument regarding the government's failure to produce the verifying expert at trial does not actually contest the application of the ACE-V method; Mahone does not assert that there was no verification of Homer's findings. Instead, Mahone objects to the government's litigation approach of not presenting the verifying expert as a trial witness. If Mahone intended a hearsay challenge, however, he waived it by failing to make any such argument in his opening brief. <i>See Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc.,</i> 358 F.3d 110, 114 n. 1 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The district court's restitution calculation</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and subsidiary findings of fact for clear error. <i>See United States v. Burdi,</i> 414 F.3d 216, 221 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of his sentence for interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, Mahone was ordered to pay $5,477.75 in restitution to an insurance company. The insurer had compensated the vehicle's owner $6,227.75, and later received $750 for selling the vehicle after it was recovered by police. The vehicle was missing for nearly a month before its recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's calculation was made under a provision of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(b)(1), which directs that restitution be equal to the original value of the property less \"the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned.\" The parties stipulated that $6,227.75 represented the original value of the vehicle, a 1996 Ford Explorer. Mahone argues that the vehicle's value as of the date it was returned is far higher than $750. He notes that the Kelley Blue Book \"suggested retail value\" for such a vehicle is $5,760.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mahone argues that $750 is \"simply the amount for which the vehicle was sold,\" and that the government \"produced absolutely no evidence that this figure even approaches this vehicle's value at the time of its recovery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court acknowledged \"the rather extreme variation\" between $5,760 and $750, but stated, \"[I]t's more likely than not that the value was actually the value reflected in the price that the insurance company paid and received as a consequence of its dealings with the automobile.\" The district court then explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I take it as a given that the insurance company is not in the business of paying to its insureds more money than the value of the vehicles it has insured. And I also take it as a given that the insurer has every incentive to receive full value for any vehicle that it receives title to that has been damaged or stolen. In this case, absent some information that... [the insurer's] sale of the vehicle was conducted under less than optimal circumstances, the court really has to conclude that the $750 for whatever reason is what [the insurer] could have received on the date of sale since it is what it did in fact receive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Otherwise, the court is left to speculate on the condition of the vehicle, the impact that its being stolen may have on its value, the impact of its being held in police custody for an extended period of time ... and absent some indication that the auction or sale ... was not fair market value and circumstances that would indicate another value, I am going to accept [the $750 figure].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, the government <i>did</i> produce evidence of the vehicle's value-the price for which it was actually sold upon recovery. The seller insurer had, moreover, a common-sense incentive to regain as much as possible of the $6,277.75 it had given to its insured for the original theft of the vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently held, moreover, that \"absolute precision is not required\" in calculating restitution under the MVRA. <i>Burdi,</i> 414 F.3d at 221. In interpreting the MVRA, <i>Burdi</i> looked to our analysis of the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663, a separate restitution statute with an identical restitution calculation method and other close similarities to the MVRA. <i>United States v. Vaknin,</i> 112 F.3d 579 (1st Cir.1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Vaknin</i> concluded that only \"a modicum of reliable evidence\" is required to establish a restitution award; \"an award cannot be woven solely from the gossamer strands of speculation and surmise.\" <i>Id.</i> at 587. <i>Vaknin</i> added that \"the legislative history [for the VWPA] clearly signals a congressional preference for rough remedial justice, emphasizing victims' rights.\" <i>Id.</i> Specifically, <i>Vaknin</i> held that Congress intended to authorize expeditious and reasonable calculations of restitution \"by resolving uncertainties with a view towards achieving fairness to the victim,\" rather than by requiring that district courts exercise \"great precision in fixing the amount of restitution due.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>Vaknin's</i> interpretation of the VWPA, and applying it to the identically-worded restitution calculation language in the MVRA, we conclude that the district court made a proper determination of the restitution due by using the actual selling price of the vehicle and correctly emphasizing the victim insurer's rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the footwear impression expert testimony.

He was armed with a knife and gun and dressed in black. He wore gloves and a ski mask, with white makeup around the eyes. Black clothing that Mahone admitted wearing was found in a garbage bag near the credit union. Mahone's DNA was found on latex gloves, a ski mask, and shoes found near the credit union. Mahone's fingerprints were found on makeup kits discarded in a nearby dumpster. Mahone's car was discovered near the credit union.

Mahone objected to Homer's testimony by motion <i>in limine,</i> without subsequent, contemporaneous objection at trial. Under earlier law in this circuit, this would have allowed review only for plain error. <i>See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668217\"><a href=\"/opinion/668217/eric-clausen-v-sea-3-inc-storage-tank-development-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1190 (1st Cir.1994). However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a) as amended in 2000, a party need not renew an objection once the court makes a \"definitive ruling\" on the record admitting evidence before trial. In Mahone's case, the district court definitively determined that the expert testimony was \"admissible under the standards set forth both in Rule 702 and Daubert.\" <i>Mahone,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 92. Mahone's objection was preserved. <i>See, e.g., Conwood Co. v. U.S. Tobacco Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777689\"><a href=\"/opinion/777689/conwood-company-lp-conwood-sales-company-lp-v-united-states-tobacco/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span>, 792 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before accepting expert testimony, a district court must determine that a witness is \"qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702. Regarding this threshold inquiry, Mahone argues that Homer's qualifications are insufficient, simply because she is not qualified as a footwear examiner through the International Association for Identification (IAI). This argument has no merit. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Homer is sufficiently qualified as an expert. She is a trained forensic professional with a specialty in impressions. She has a masters degree in forensic science. At trial, she stated that she had made more than 11,000 footwear comparisons. She had worked as a \"latent impressions\" specialist for more than two years and had twice testified in court as an expert in footwear impressions. She had also taken a 40-hour FBI course in footwear and tire impression evidence analysis. She is subject to annual proficiency testing by an outside agency. Although Homer was an active member in the IAI, she lacked the requisite three years' professional experience to qualify for voluntary certification through IAI's footwear analysis program. It is not required that experts be blue-ribbon practitioners with optional certifications. <i>See United States v. Rose,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433834\"><a href=\"/opinion/433834/united-states-v-jack-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1337</span></a></span>, 1346 (8th Cir.1984) (holding, pre-<i>Daubert,</i> that \"[a]n expert witness need not be an outstanding practitioner in the field nor have certificates of training in the particular subject\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the <i>in limine</i> hearing and at trial, Homer thoroughly described the \"ACE-V\" method (analysis, comparison, evaluation, and verification) for assessing footwear impressions, and described her use of the method in Mahone's case. Mahone argues, however, that the ACE-V method \"utterly lacks in objective identification standards\" because: 1) there is no set number of clues which dictate a match between an impression and a particular shoe; 2) there is no objective standard for determining whether a discrepancy between an impression and a shoe is major or minor; and 3) the government provided \"absolutely no scientific testing of the premises underlying ACE-V.\" At issue is Fed.R.Evid. 702(2)'s requirement that an expert may testify if \"the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods.\" Mahone's arguments lack merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the outset, it is difficult to discern any abuse of discretion in the district court's decision, because other federal courts have favorably analyzed the ACE-V method under <i>Daubert</i> for footwear and fingerprint impressions. <i>See United States v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2345962\"><a href=\"/opinion/2345962/united-states-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court explicitly considered the four guiding factors laid out as guidance by the Supreme Court in <i>Daubert:</i> 1) whether the underlying method can be or has been tested; 2) whether the method has been subject to peer review and publication; 3) the method's known or potential error rate; and 4) the level of the method's acceptance within the relevant discipline. <i>See Mahone,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 88-92. Our review of the record confirms that these factors support admissibility of ACE-V. The method has been tested in published studies and has been the subject of widespread publication, including books devoted to footwear impressions, although it is not clear that there have been rigorous peer-reviewed articles. Homer offered a potential error rate of zero for the method, stating that any error is attributable to examiners. Finally, ACE-V is clearly highly accepted in the forensics field; the same method is used for latent impression analysis of fingerprints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there were cause for concern with the ACE-V method, <i>Daubert</i> emphasized that \"[v]igorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\" <i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 596, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2786</span></a></span>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Under this analysis, Mahone's argument regarding the lack of a set number of clues required for an ACE-V match must fail. We have rejected a similar argument that a handwriting analysis method impermissibly lacked a standard for the number of similarities required for a match. <i>See United States v. Mooney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200259\"><a href=\"/opinion/200259/united-states-v-mooney/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2002). Here, as in <i>Mooney,</i> such an argument \"misunderstands <i>Daubert</i> to demand unassailable expert testimony.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did Mahone exercise his right to cross-examine Homer at trial regarding the alleged shortcomings in ACE-V, he had the benefit of an earlier <i>Daubert</i> hearing to challenge Homer and ACE-V. Mahone failed to offer his own expert or any other independent evidence revealing reliability concerns with ACE-V or Homer's findings. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mahone also raises an argument under Fed.R.Evid. 702(3), which requires that an expert witness have \"applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" Specifically, he argues that there are problems with the verification step of the ACE-V method as applied, because: 1) Homer stated that she had no idea whether the verifying examiner was \"blinded\" (had not reviewed her report before conducting his examination); and because 2) the government failed to produce the verifying examiner at trial (instead, Homer testified regarding this examiner's background and experience).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. Other federal courts have found ACE-V to be reliable under <i>Daubert,</i> while noting that verification in ACE-V may not be blinded. <i>See United States v.

Under cross-examination by Mahone's trial counsel, Homer acknowledged only \"a lot of debate\" over whether a verifying examiner should be blinded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mahone's argument regarding the government's failure to produce the verifying expert at trial does not actually contest the application of the ACE-V method; Mahone does not assert that there was no verification of Homer's findings. Instead, Mahone objects to the government's litigation approach of not presenting the verifying expert as a trial witness. If Mahone intended a hearsay challenge, however, he waived it by failing to make any such argument in his opening brief. <i>See Sullivan v.

The insurer had compensated the vehicle's owner $6,227.75, and later received $750 for selling the vehicle after it was recovered by police. The vehicle was missing for nearly a month before its recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's calculation was made under a provision of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(b)(1), which directs that restitution be equal to the original value of the property less \"the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned.\" The parties stipulated that $6,227.75 represented the original value of the vehicle, a 1996 Ford Explorer. Mahone argues that the vehicle's value as of the date it was returned is far higher than $750. He notes that the Kelley Blue Book \"suggested retail value\" for such a vehicle is $5,760.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mahone argues that $750 is \"simply the amount for which the vehicle was sold,\" and that the government \"produced absolutely no evidence that this figure even approaches this vehicle's value at the time of its recovery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court acknowledged \"the rather extreme variation\" between $5,760 and $750, but stated, \"[I]t's more likely than not that the value was actually the value reflected in the price that the insurance company paid and received as a consequence of its dealings with the automobile.\" The district court then explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I take it as a given that the insurance company is not in the business of paying to its insureds more money than the value of the vehicles it has insured. And I also take it as a given that the insurer has every incentive to receive full value for any vehicle that it receives title to that has been damaged or stolen. In this case, absent some information that... [the insurer's] sale of the vehicle was conducted under less than optimal circumstances, the court really has to conclude that the $750 for whatever reason is what [the insurer] could have received on the date of sale since it is what it did in fact receive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Otherwise, the court is left to speculate on the condition of the vehicle, the impact that its being stolen may have on its value, the impact of its being held in police custody for an extended period of time ... and absent some indication that the auction or sale ... was not fair market value and circumstances that would indicate another value, I am going to accept [the $750 figure].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, the government <i>did</i> produce evidence of the vehicle's value-the price for which it was actually sold upon recovery.
