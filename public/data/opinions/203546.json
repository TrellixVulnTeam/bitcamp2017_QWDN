Fascett, Trial Attorney, Civil Division, Jeffrey S.\nBucholtz, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division and\nDavid V. Bernal, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           October 29, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.     Petitioner Edwardo Alexandro Mathew was\n\nordered removed, under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), on the\n\nground that he had been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and\n\nthus was an inadmissible alien.            After carefully reviewing the\n\nrecord and the parties’ briefs, we affirm the order of removal\n\nessentially for the reasons given by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA).     We add only the following comments:\n\n            1. Petitioner’s Criminal Records. As for the Apostille,\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1287.6 is not the exclusive method for authenticating a\n\ndocument.    See Yongo v. INS, 355 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nRather, authentication is a “flexible” doctrine and “requires\n\nnothing more than proof that a document or thing is what it\n\npurports to be.”      Id. at 30.   Here, since there is no question that\n\nthe documents certified by the Apostille are anything other than\n\ncopies of petitioner’s Aruban criminal record, it is plain that\n\nthis   record   was   admissible    for    the   purposes   of   establishing\n\npetitioner’s conviction.\n\n            Petitioner next claims that there were translation errors\n\nin this record.        However, in determining whether a particular\n\noffense qualifies as a crime of moral turpitude, “[t]he focus . .\n\n. is on the inherent nature of the crime of conviction, as opposed\n\nto the particular circumstances of the actual crime committed.”\n\nNguyen v. Reno, 211 F.3d 692, 695 (1st Cir. 2000) (emphasis added).\n\nThus, it is the definition contained in the applicable criminal\n\n                                     -2-\n\fstatute that is the controlling factor. Maghsoudi v. INS, 181 F.3d\n\n8, 14 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Here, it is plain that at least one of petitioner’s\n\nconvictions, the one under Art. 315, qualifies as a crime of moral\n\nturpitude.   That is, a conviction under this article requires both\n\nthat the defendant intended to cause, and actually did cause,\n\nserious physical harm.   See Nguyen, 211 F.3d at 695 (it is a crime\n\nof moral turpitude “to cause serious injury intentionally to\n\nanother person”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted;\n\nemphasis added).    Thus, petitioner was properly treated as an\n\narriving alien under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) and properly\n\nfound inadmissible under § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).\n\n          2.   The Second Charge.   Petitioner next argues that the\n\nBIA could not remove him on the basis of having been convicted of\n\na crime of moral turpitude without first having determined that he\n\nhad fraudulently concealed this conviction in order to obtain his\n\nadjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident.   The\n\nproblem for petitioner is that neither of the pertinent statutes,\n\n§ 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) and § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), contain any language\n\nto this effect, and the statute that petitioner cites in support of\n\nthis argument, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C), simply was not applied to\n\nhim in the instant proceedings.\n\n          3.   Due Process Violations.   Although petitioner claims\n\nthat the immigration proceedings were plagued by due process\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fviolations, he has not even attempted to show how such violations\n\nprejudiced him -- i.e., how, in the absence of the claimed errors,\n\nthe result of the removal proceeding would have been different.\n\nSee Ibe v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 142, 144 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding\n\nthat prejudice is “an essential requirement of a due process claim”\n\nin the immigration context). These claims therefore are meritless.\n\nFinally,   we   do   not   consider    petitioner’s   challenge   to   the\n\nconditions of his detention pending the completion of the removal\n\nproceedings because a petition for review, filed under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252, is not the proper vehicle for such a challenge.        See Ochieng\n\nv. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir. 2008) (holding that a\n\ncourt of appeals, in a proceeding under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, is not the\n\n“appropriate forum” in which to bring, the first instance, a\n\nchallenge to detention).\n\n           The petition for review therefore is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
