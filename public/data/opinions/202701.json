Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rodney S. Dowell and Berman & Dowell on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia\nRodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                            April 10, 2007\n\f            Per Curiam.     This is an appeal from resentencing after\n\nremand from this court on defendant's prior appeal.                See United\n\nStates v. Peña-Hernandez, No. 04-1489, 146 F. App'x 499 (1st Cir.\n\nAug. 26, 2005) (per curiam) (unpublished).            In his present appeal,\n\ndefendant's sole argument is that the government's refusal to give\n\nhim another opportunity for a safety-valve debriefing1 before his\n\nresentencing     requires   that   the    case   be   remanded    for   such    a\n\ndebriefing.\n\n            That argument is barred by the law of the case doctrine,\n\nunder which \"available claims of error not raised in an initial\n\nappeal may not be raised during subsequent appeals in the same\n\ncase.\"   United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(emphasis      omitted).     Although    that    doctrine    is   subject      to\n\nexceptions, see United States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 250-51 (1st\n\nCir. 1993), none of those exceptions applies here.                 Having not\n\nargued in the district court or in his first appeal that the\n\ngovernment had a duty to offer him a third debriefing opportunity\n\nbefore   his     original   sentencing--although       he   clearly     had    an\n\nincentive to do so at those times--the law of the case doctrine\n\nprecludes him from making this argument in the present appeal.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Before his original sentencing hearing, defendant was given\ntwo opportunities for a safety-valve debriefing, but, on both\noccasions, he refused to provide any information or to clarify the\nstatements made at his post-arrest interview. The government made\nclear at that time that it did not intend to offer defendant a\nthird such opportunity.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fMoran, 393 F.3d at 11; see also United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171\n\nF.3d 24, at 28-29 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             Even on resentencing, while defendant repeatedly stated\n\nhis willingness to undergo another debriefing, he never argued that\n\nthe government was obligated to accept his offer.                      Accordingly,\n\neven if that argument was not waived under the law of the case\n\ndoctrine, it was forfeited and is therefore reviewable only for\n\nplain error.         See generally United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n734 (1993).\n\n             It is hardly \"plain\" that the government has a duty to\n\ngive    a   defendant      multiple      opportunities       for   a   safety-valve\n\ndebriefing. To the contrary, \"the government has a right to expect\n\nthat a defendant who seeks the boon of the safety valve will make\n\na clean breast of things; it has no obligation to interview him\n\nrepeatedly      in    an   effort   to   pry    loose    additional        nuggets   of\n\ninformation.\" United States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 41-42 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).      Even assuming--without deciding--that a defendant may\n\nsatisfy his disclosure obligations after his original sentencing\n\nbut    before   his     resentencing,     but   cf.     18   U.S.C.    §   3553(f)(5)\n\n(requiring that such disclosures be made \"not later than the time\n\nof the sentencing hearing\" (emphasis added)), defendant certainly\n\nhad no right to a debriefing once the resentencing hearing had\n\nbegun, Matos, 328 F.3d at 39.                   Nor is this a case where a\n\ndefendant's entitlement to a further debriefing opportunity can be\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fderived from a plea agreement; there was no such agreement here.\n\nCf. id. at 42 (stating that this court would not allow the\n\ngovernment to \"play cat and mouse with defendants\" with respect to\n\nthe government's obligations under plea agreements).\n\n          Moreover, even if the district court had plainly erred in\n\nfailing to require the government to give defendant a further\n\ndebriefing opportunity and defendant was prejudiced thereby, its\n\nfailure to do so would not satisfy the remaining prong of plain\n\nerror review.   Under the circumstances of this case, the lack of\n\nsuch an opportunity did not constitute a miscarriage of justice.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 736.\n\n          Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed. See 1st Cir. Loc.\n\nR. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
