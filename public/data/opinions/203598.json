Bauzá, Assistant United States Attorney with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Vélez, United States Attorney and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 18, 2008\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.        After a six-day trial, a jury\n\nconvicted Angel Zamora Cruz-Díaz (Cruz) and José Alfredo Ayala-\n\nColón (Ayala) of conspiring to rob a federally insured bank, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 371 (Count 1), aiding and abetting a bank robbery by use\n\nof a dangerous weapon, 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), (d) (Count 2), and\n\naiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation to\n\na crime of violence, here, a bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)\n\n(Count 3).    The district court sentenced Cruz to 183 months'\n\nimprisonment and Ayala to 168 months' imprisonment.        Both Cruz and\n\nAyala appeal their convictions.\n\n           Cruz presents three claims.          First, he argues that\n\ninsufficient evidence supported his conviction for aiding and\n\nabetting the use of a firearm during a crime of violence.               He\n\ncontends that the government failed to adduce evidence sufficient\n\nto prove that he carried a \"real\" firearm as required by § 924(c).\n\nCruz's second and third claims allege prosecutorial misconduct and\n\nerroneous jury instructions.\n\n           Ayala presents only one claim, arguing that the court\n\nerred when it admitted his codefendant's out-of-court statement\n\ninto   evidence.   This   error,   he    contends,   violated   his   Sixth\n\nAmendment Confrontation Clause rights.          After review of these\n\nclaims, we affirm both convictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f                             I.    Facts\n\n          The facts stated here, which are relevant to Cruz's\n\nsufficiency claim, are presented in the light most favorable to the\n\njury's verdict.   United States v. Cruz-Rodríguez, 541 F.3d 19, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).      We add more facts where necessary to our\n\ndiscussion of the other appellate claims.\n\n          On February 17, 2006, two armed men entered a bank in\n\nPuerto Rico shouting, \"This is a robbery!\"       One of the men, later\n\nidentified as Cruz, proceeded to the bank's front counter and\n\ndemanded the tellers put money in a large, black plastic bag.      The\n\nother man, later identified as Ayala, shepherded bank employees to\n\nthe front of the bank.    Four bank employees testified that Cruz\n\ncarried a gun.    Collectively, these four employees described the\n\ngun as a \"silver,\" \"shiny,\" \"nickel plated\" \"pistol.\"         Two bank\n\nemployees testified that Ayala carried a gun as well, with one\n\ndescribing it as a \"nickel plated,\" \"short barreled\" \"pistol\" and\n\nthe other describing it as a \"silver handgun.\"\n\n          The tellers complied with Cruz's demand, placing money\n\ninside the bag.   After receiving the money, Cruz and Ayala exited\n\nthe bank, having been inside between one and two minutes.\n\n          The police received information that Cruz and Ayala were\n\ntraveling in a red Mazda.     Shortly thereafter, police officers\n\ndiscovered an abandoned car matching this description.        Near the\n\ncar, they found Cruz and Ayala.         A search of the area yielded a\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fblack plastic bag containing money from the bank.1      A   search of\n\nthe red Mazda produced a bullet casing on the passenger's seat.\n\nThe bullet casing corresponded with a nine-millimeter Luger brand\n\nbullet or cartridge.    No guns, however, were ever found.\n\n            At trial, in addition to introducing testimony from bank\n\nemployees and police officers, the government introduced a bank\n\nsurveillance video.    The video showed Cruz and Ayala entering the\n\nbank brandishing guns.       The jury found both defendants guilty on\n\nall three counts.    We first address the claims presented by Cruz.\n\n                             II.    Discussion\n\n                                   A.    Cruz\n\n                        1.    Sufficiency claim\n\n            Because Cruz failed to move for a judgment of acquittal\n\non Count 3 -- for aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during\n\na bank robbery -- we review his sufficiency claim for plain error\n\nonly.    See United States v. Díaz, 519 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir. 2008).2\n\nUnder the plain error standard, we will not reverse unless the\n\nallowing the conviction to stand would result in a \"clear and gross\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The bank's loss was estimated at $45,410.16.\n2\n  Cruz claims that he moved for a judgment of acquittal on Count 3\nand that, as a result, the de novo standard of review applies. The\nrecord, however, is clear that Cruz's Rule 29 motion was directed\nat Counts 1 and 2. In any event, as our analysis below indicates,\nCruz's sufficiency claim would fail even under the more searching\nde novo standard.\n\n                                        -5-\n\finjustice.\"   United States v. Pratt, 496 F.3d 124, 127 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (internal quotations omitted).3\n\n          Cruz's sufficiency claim focuses on the definition of\n\n\"firearm.\"    He starts with the premise that a conviction under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c), requires proof that the defendant used a \"real\"\n\nfirearm when committing the predicate offense.   See United States\n\nv. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that \"a toy or\n\na replica will not do\") (quotation omitted).     For purposes of §\n\n924(c), a firearm is defined as:\n\n          (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which\n          will or is designed to or may readily be\n          converted to expel a projectile by the action\n          of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of\n          any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or\n          firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Where preserved, we review a sufficiency claim de novo. Under\nthat standard, we examine the evidence, both direct and\ncircumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and\ndecide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences\ndrawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged\ncount or crime. See United States v. Fenton, 367 F.3d 14, 18 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                -6-\n\f            device.4 Such term does not include an antique\n            firearm.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3).\n\n            Armed   with   this   definition,   Cruz   argues   that   no\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that he used a \"real\" firearm in the\n\nrobbery.     He points to two pieces of evidence to support this\n\nargument. First, one of the bank employees who testified that Cruz\n\ncarried a gun later testified on cross-examination that he was not\n\na \"gun inspector\" and admitted that he could not tell whether the\n\ngun Cruz carried was real or a toy.       Second, Cruz notes that he\n\nconfessed to an FBI agent that BB guns had been used in the\n\nrobbery.\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Destructive device is further defined as:\n\n       (A) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas -- (i) bomb,\n       (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket having a propellant charge of\n       more than four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive\n       or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v)\n       mine, or (vi) device similar to any of the devices\n       described in the preceding clauses; (B) any type of\n       weapon (other than a shotgun or a shotgun shell which the\n       Attorney General finds is generally recognized as\n       particularly suitable for sporting purposes) by whatever\n       name known which will, or which may be readily converted\n       to, expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or\n       other propellant, and which has any barrel with a bore of\n       more than one-half inch in diameter; and (C) any\n       combination of parts either designed or intended for use\n       in converting any device into any destructive device\n       described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and from which a\n       destructive device may be readily assembled.\n\nId. § 921(a)(4).\n\n                                   -7-\n\f             When   analyzing    Cruz's     claim,      we    must     keep     certain\n\nprinciples in mind. \"Although § 924(c) requires proof that the gun\n\nis   real,   the    government's   proof       need   not     'reach      a    level    of\n\nscientific certainty.'\" United States v. Roberson, 459 F.3d 39, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).            Descriptive lay testimony can\n\nbe sufficient to prove that the defendant used a real gun.                             Id.\n\n(citing United States v. Kirvan, 997 F.2d 963, 966-67 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)); Taylor, 54 F.3d at 976 (concluding that the evidence was\n\nsufficient to prove the gun was real where three eyewitnesses to a\n\nbank robbery, who observed the object held by the defendant at\n\nclose range, testified that it was a gun).\n\n             We find no error at all here, much less plain error.                      The\n\nrecord     contains    evidence,     both      direct        and     circumstantial,\n\nsufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Cruz used a\n\nreal firearm during the robbery.          The direct evidence included the\n\ntestimony of four bank employees.           These employees testified that\n\nCruz held a gun, collectively describing the gun as a \"silver,\"\n\n\"shiny,\"     \"nickel   plated\"     \"pistol.\"          These        descriptions        are\n\nconsistent with a conclusion that Cruz and Ayala used real guns.\n\nIn fact, they are nearly identical to the descriptions provided by\n\nbank employees who testified in Kirvan.               In that case in which one\n\nof the witnesses described the item held by the defendant as a\n\n\"silver,\"     \"shiny,\"    \"handgun,\"      we     held    that       the       government\n\nintroduced sufficient evidence that the gun used in the robbery was\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\freal.   997 F.2d at 966-67.    Moreover, none of the witnesses in this\n\ncase, all of whom had ample time to view the gun, described it as\n\na BB or toy gun.   See Taylor, 54 F.3d at 976.    In addition to this\n\neyewitness testimony, the government also introduced a surveillance\n\nvideo showing Ayala and Cruz entering the bank and holding what\n\nappeared to be weapons.       Although the videotape did not give the\n\njury the superior vantage point that the bank tellers had, this\n\nadditional evidence did allow the jurors to see for themselves what\n\nthe witnesses had observed.\n\n           Finally, the jury also had circumstantial evidence to\n\ndraw upon in concluding that Cruz possessed a real firearm.       Two\n\npieces of evidence stand out.         First, the bank employees all\n\nresponded as if the guns held by both Cruz and Ayala were real,\n\ncomplying with the requests made by the robbers.       The jury could\n\nhave reasonably inferred, based on the reactions from the employees\n\nin combination with the eyewitness testimony, that Cruz and Ayala\n\ncarried real firearms.        Second, the police discovered a bullet\n\ncasing in the vehicle used by Cruz and Ayala that corresponded with\n\na real firearm.    In our view, this circumstantial evidence, taken\n\ntogether with the direct evidence recounted above, supported the\n\njury's verdict on Count 3.\n\n           Our conclusion that sufficient evidence underlies Count\n\n3 is not undermined by the evidence Cruz directs to our attention\n\n-- a witness's expressed uncertainty regarding whether the gun Cruz\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fheld was real and Cruz's alleged confession to an FBI agent that BB\n\nguns were used in the robbery.       The wavering testimony of the one\n\nbank teller must be placed in context.           Three other bank tellers\n\nexpressed no such uncertainty. As for Cruz's statement to the FBI,\n\nit does not merit overturning the verdict.           In addition to being\n\nself-serving, the statement was never admitted into evidence.\n\n                      2.    Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n            Cruz claims that the government committed prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct during its closing argument, warranting a new trial.\n\nSpecifically,    he   maintains    that    the   prosecutor   inaccurately\n\nrecounted the facts in the record and therefore prejudiced the\n\noutcome of the case.\n\n            Cruz focuses on the prosecutor's statement recapping the\n\ntestimony of various bank tellers.          The prosecutor, Cruz notes,\n\ntold the jury that the bank tellers testified that Cruz and Ayala\n\ncarried \"firearms.\"5       Cruz argues that this was inaccurate because\n\nthe tellers never used the term \"firearms\" in their testimony.\n\nRather, the tellers used the words \"pistol\" and \"handgun\" to\n\ndescribe the objects held by Cruz and Ayala.            The prosecutor's\n\n\n\n\n5\n    The prosecutor stated:\n\n       And the evidence clearly shows on the video both\n       individuals were possessing firearms and the bank tellers\n       who they approached, as well as another person who\n       testified here said that without a doubt that those\n       individuals had firearms.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fparaphrasing was prejudicial, Cruz contends, because \"[n]ot all\n\nhandguns are firearms.\"\n\n          Where an improper statement has been made, we typically\n\nask whether the statement \"so poisoned the well\" that a new trial\n\nis merited.   United States v. Carpenter, 494 F.3d 13, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).   But because Cruz did not object to the prosecutor's\n\nstatement at trial, our review is only for plain error.     United\n\nStates v. Vanvliet, 542 F.3d 259, 270 (1st Cir. 2008).6\n\n          We find no plain error.      To begin, the prosecutor's\n\nparaphrasing did not plainly result in a factual inaccuracy.\n\nAlthough Cruz claims that \"not all handguns are firearms,\" a\n\nhandgun, according to its dictionary definition, is \"a firearm (as\n\na revolver or pistol) designed to be held and fired with one hand.\"\n\nSee Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 525 (10th ed. 2001);\n\nsee also United States v. McKeeve, 131 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(\"[A] comment by counsel in the course of jury summation that\n\nmerely recounts properly admitted testimony, accurately and without\n\nembellishment or distortion, cannot constitute reversible error.\")\n\n(citation omitted)).\n\n          Moreover, the prosecutor's use of the word \"firearm\" did\n\nnot prejudice Cruz.    The district court gave two instructions to\n\n\n\n6\n As was the case with his sufficiency claim, Cruz contends that he\npreserved his claim of prosecutorial misconduct and that we should\nreview the prosecutor's statement de novo. After review of the\nrecord, we disagree.\n\n                                -11-\n\fthe jury that safeguarded against any potential prejudice.         First,\n\nthe court emphasized that the prosecutor's closing argument was not\n\nevidence.    United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(concluding that prosecutor's inaccurate recounting of evidence\n\nduring closing argument did not prejudice the defendant where \"the\n\ndistrict court explicitly cautioned the jury that it could not\n\nconsider    the   arguments   of   counsel   as   evidence   against   [the\n\ndefendant]\"); see also United States v. Brandao, 539 F.3d 44, 64\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).     And second, during jury instructions the court\n\nrelated the legal definition of the word \"firearm\" to the jury.\n\nSo, however the prosecutor paraphrased the testimony of the bank\n\ntellers, it was ultimately and clearly up to the jury to conclude\n\nwhether the guns used qualified as firearms.7\n\n                         3.   Jury instruction\n\n            Finally, Cruz claims that the court issued erroneous jury\n\ninstructions.     Specifically, Cruz asserts that the court's failure\n\nto define \"dangerous weapon\" when instructing the jury on Count 2\n\nled the jury to believe that it could convict Cruz on Count 3 if it\n\nfound that Cruz used a \"dangerous weapon\" during the robbery.           On\n\nthe contrary, he asserts, to convict him on Count 3 the jury had to\n\nfind that he used a \"firearm.\"      The difference between a \"firearm\"\n\n\n\n7\n  We note that Cruz does not argue that the \"without a doubt\"\nlanguage in the prosecutor's closing argument was problematic.\nAccordingly, this argument is waived. United States v. Zannino,\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                   -12-\n\fand    a    \"dangerous     weapon\"   is    important,   Cruz    argues,   because\n\nalthough a BB gun or even a toy gun may qualify as a \"dangerous\n\nweapon\" under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(d) (Count 2), neither would qualify\n\nas a \"firearm\" under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 3).               Compare Kirvan,\n\n997 F.2d at 966 (noting that, under § 924(c), \"a toy or replica\n\nwill not do\") (citation omitted) with United States v. Cannon, 903\n\nF.2d 849, 854-55 (1st Cir. 1990) (concluding that, under § 2113(d),\n\na toy gun may qualify as a dangerous weapon).\n\n               Because Cruz did not object to the court's instructions\n\nat trial, our review is again for plain error.                  United States v.\n\nGonzález-Vélez, 466 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2006) (observing that\n\nthis       standard   is   \"exceedingly     difficult   to     satisfy    in   jury\n\ninstruction      cases\")     (internal      quotation   marks    omitted).      In\n\nassessing whether jury instructions were erroneous in the first\n\nplace, we review them as a whole to determine if they \"adequately\n\nexplained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the\n\njury on the controlling issues.\"             Id.\n\n               We find no error in the court's instructions, much less\n\nplain error. The court appropriately instructed the jury regarding\n\nthe definition of firearm. The court instructed the jury that, for\n\npurposes of Count 3, the firearm count, it must find that Cruz used\n\na \"firearm\" during the robbery, and defined a firearm as \"any\n\nweapon which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to\n\nexpel a projectile by the actions of an explosive.\"                 In so doing,\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fthe court made plain to the jury that it could not convict Cruz on\n\nCount 3 if it found that he used a toy gun or BB gun during the\n\nrobbery.\n\n                                    B.    Ayala\n\n            We turn now to Ayala's sole claim. Ayala argues that the\n\ncourt erred when it allowed an FBI agent to testify regarding an\n\nout-of-court statement made to authorities by his codefendant,\n\nCruz.      The    court   allowed   the    agent      to   testify   about   Cruz's\n\nstatement after Ayala's counsel, via cross-examination, questioned\n\na Puerto Rico police officer about the failure of the police to\n\npursue various investigatory options after it detained the two\n\ndefendants.\n\n            The     agent,    who    was        the   \"case    agent\"    for   the\n\ninvestigation, explained that the FBI and Puerto Rico police failed\n\nto pursue certain investigatory options because they believed they\n\nhad captured the right suspects.            In doing so, the agent referred\n\nto Cruz's out-of-court statement while testifying that:\n\n            I became aware at the time of the detention of\n            the two defendants that [Cruz] had stated to\n            [the officer] who gained custody of him, that\n            . . . 'the money is over there in a black bag,\n            we already threw away the weapons,' and\n            something to the effect of, 'we're screwed,\n            less than five minutes and they caught us.'\n\n            In Ayala's view, the court's decision to admit Cruz's\n\nout-of-court statement into evidence violated his Confrontation\n\nClause rights as defined by the Supreme Court's decisions in\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fCrawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004) and Bruton v. United\n\nStates, 391 U.S. 123 (1968).     Ayala argues that the Court should\n\nhave avoided a Crawford or Bruton problem by either suppressing the\n\nstatement or severing his trial from Cruz's.     We review this claim\n\nde novo.   United States v. De La Cruz, 514 F.3d 121, 133 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n           \"The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal defendant\n\nthe right 'to be confronted with the witnesses against him.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Rodríguez-Duran, 507 F.3d 749, 768 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI).        Ayala says that his right of\n\nconfrontation has been infringed under both Crawford and Bruton.\n\nAs we explain more fully below, however, the admission of Cruz's\n\nout-of-court statement offended neither Crawford nor Bruton for two\n\nreasons.     First, the statement was not offered for its truth --\n\nthat is, to prove that the money was in the bag, that they were\n\n\"screwed\" or even that the defendants were the true culprits -- but\n\nrather to explain why the FBI and police did not pursue other\n\ninvestigatory options after apprehending the defendants.         And\n\nsecond, Ayala's trial strategy opened the door to the statement's\n\nadmission.\n\n                            1.   Crawford\n\n           We start with the Supreme Court's decision in Crawford,\n\nwhich held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of\n\ntestimonial hearsay into evidence against the defendant unless the\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fdeclarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had\n\na prior opportunity to cross-examine him.        United States v. Earle,\n\n488 F.3d 537, 542 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at\n\n68).   It follows, then, that even where a declarant's out-of-court\n\nstatement    is   testimonial,8    the   statement   may     nevertheless    be\n\nadmitted into evidence if one of the following three circumstances\n\nexists:     (1) the statement is not hearsay in that it is being\n\nadmitted for a purpose other than establishing the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted; (2) the declarant testifies at trial; or (3) the\n\ndefendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant\n\nand the declarant is unavailable. United States v. Maher, 454 F.3d\n\n13, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Crawford, 541 U.S. at 53-54, 59\n\nn.9.\n\n            In his Crawford-based confrontation clause argument,\n\nAyala presses two points: that the testimony was hearsay and, even\n\nif the government offered a non-hearsay basis for admitting the\n\nstatement, that basis was pretextual.\n\n            First, Ayala contends that the court violated Crawford\n\nbecause   none    of   the   circumstances   noted   above    existed.      The\n\ngovernment argues the contrary, contending that Cruz's statement\n\nwas not hearsay because it was not admitted to prove the truth of\n\nthe matter asserted.\n\n\n\n8\n  Both parties agree that Cruz's statement is \"testimonial\" in\nnature.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f            We agree that Cruz's confession was not hearsay.             As\n\nFederal    Rule   of   Evidence   801(c)   provides:   \"[h]earsay   is    a\n\nstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at\n\nthe trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).     Out-of-court statements\n\noffered not to prove the truth of the matter asserted but merely to\n\nshow context -- such as a statement offered for the limited purpose\n\nof showing what effect the statement had on the listener -- are not\n\nhearsay.    United States v. Bailey, 270 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(noting a statement \"offered to show the effect of the words spoken\n\non the listener (e.g., to supply a motive for the listener's\n\naction)\" is not hearsay) (citation omitted); see also United States\n\nv. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 981 (1st Cir. 1992); 4 Stephen A.\n\nSaltzburg et al., Federal Rules of Evidence Manual § 801.02[1][f]\n\n(9th ed. 2006) (\"If a statement is offered for its effect on the\n\nlistener, in order to explain the listener's conduct, it does not\n\nmatter whether the declarant is telling the truth.\").\n\n            Here, the government introduced Cruz's confession to\n\nexplain why the authorities cut short their investigation into the\n\nrobbery, specifically, why they did not take fingerprints or DNA\n\nevidence from the red Mazda.       The district court drove this point\n\nhome to the jury on two separate occasions.       Prior to admitting the\n\nstatement, the court told the jury:\n\n            [The FBI agent] is going to testify as to\n            actions he took in his investigation of this\n\n                                    -17-\n\f            case, based upon information he received. And\n            what I'm going to instruct you is that his\n            testimony concerning what he did, the actions\n            he took, because of information [he] had, is\n            not being presented to you to consider the\n            truthfulness of the defendant's statement in\n            any way whatsoever. You're instructed not to\n            consider the statement he's going to testify\n            about as evidence on any of the counts or\n            against the defendants of any of the counts\n            charged in the indictment.\n\n            Additionally, when issuing the final jury instructions,\n\nthe court emphasized that the jury was not to consider Cruz's\n\nstatement \"for the truth of the matter asserted therein and . . .\n\nmust only consider it for the limited purpose of providing a\n\ncontext for [the] decision not to send the fingerprint evidence to\n\nthe laboratory for processing.\"\n\n            We now turn to the second part of Ayala's Crawford\n\nargument.       He contends, citing Maher, 454 F.3d 13, that the\n\nCrawford    inquiry   does    not   end    merely   because   the   government\n\nadvances    a   non-hearsay    based      justification   for   offering   the\n\ndeclarant's statement.       Rather, we must satisfy ourselves that the\n\ngovernment's justification for offering the declarant's statement\n\nis not pretextual.     Pursuing this further, Ayala argues that the\n\nrecord indicates that the government's purported non-hearsay based\n\njustification for offering Cruz's confession masked an attempt to\n\ncircumvent Crawford.\n\n            In Maher, we acknowledged that if the government needs\n\nonly to identify a non-hearsay based reason for introducing the\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fstatement it could circumvent Crawford's constitutional rule as\n\nwell as the hearsay rule.            454 F.3d at 22; see also United States\n\nv. Silva, 380 F.3d 1018, 1020 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"Allowing agents to\n\nnarrate the course of their investigations, and thus spread before\n\njuries       damning    information     that       is    not   subject   to   cross-\n\nexamination, would go far toward abrogating the defendant's rights\n\nunder the sixth amendment and the hearsay rule.\").                   Therefore, as\n\nwas    the    case     in   Maher,    when    an    out-of-court     statement    is\n\npurportedly offered into evidence as non-hearsay -- for example, to\n\nprovide context for police action or inaction -- we are concerned\n\nabout whether the stated purpose for introducing the evidence masks\n\nan    attempt    to    evade   Crawford      and   the    normal   restrictions   on\n\nhearsay.       Maher, 454 F.3d at 22-23 (noting that \"[t]he dividing\n\nline often will not be clear between what is true background to\n\nexplain police conduct (and thus an exception to the hearsay rule\n\nand thus an exception to Crawford) and what is an attempt to evade\n\nCrawford and the normal restrictions on hearsay\" and warning\n\nprosecutors against \"back-door attempts\" to get statements by non-\n\ntestifying declarants before a jury).\n\n              In this case, after analyzing how Cruz's confession came\n\nto be admitted into evidence, we are satisfied that no pretext was\n\nafoot and that the government did not attempt an end-run around\n\nCrawford and the hearsay rules.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f           Cruz's   confession      was    the   subject    of    a    suppression\n\nhearing held in the midst of the trial.               During this hearing,\n\nAyala sought to suppress the admission of Cruz's confession,\n\narguing that it created a potential Bruton problem. The prosecutor\n\ninformed both the court and the defendant that he did not intend to\n\nintroduce Cruz's confession in the government's case-in-chief. The\n\ngovernment   did,    however,    reserve     the    right    to       present    the\n\nconfession for purposes of rebuttal.\n\n           At trial, Ayala's counsel opened the door to the FBI\n\nagent's testimony, pointedly cross-examining a police officer about\n\nthe decision not to pursue certain investigatory opportunities\n\nafter apprehending the defendants.           Counsel focused on potential\n\nfingerprint and DNA evidence the police could have gathered from\n\nthe red Mazda and sent for analysis.             In total, Ayala's counsel\n\nidentified \"eleven missed opportunities\" to tie Cruz to the red\n\nMazda.   Faced with this line of questioning, the government sought\n\nto introduce the FBI agent's testimony to explain why the FBI and\n\npolice did not lift forensic evidence from the car.\n\n           Ayala    argues   that    the    government's     true       motive    in\n\nadmitting the agent's testimony was to march out Cruz's confession,\n\nmaking Ayala guilty by association in the process.                In support of\n\nthis argument, Ayala relies heavily on the fact that the government\n\nintroduced the substance of the confession rather then constructing\n\na less-prejudicial narrative.         Specifically, he suggests that if\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fthe government merely wanted to explain why the FBI and police\n\nfailed to conduct a more thorough investigation it could have had\n\nthe agent testify in a manner that entirely avoided referencing\n\nCruz's confession.        As an example, Ayala argues that the agent\n\ncould have testified that the government chose to truncate the\n\ninvestigation \"because of information [the agent had].\"\n\n              We do not think the government's failure to present a\n\nmore sanitized narrative reveals a motive to undercut Crawford.\n\nGiven the tenor of Ayala's cross-examination about the authorities'\n\nfailure   to    investigate     further,     the    use   of   the     generalized\n\nnarrative Ayala suggests would have come at an unjustified cost to\n\nthe government.       During cross-examination, Ayala's counsel painted\n\na   picture    of    police   and   FBI   ineptitude,     observing      that    the\n\ngovernment missed eleven opportunities to tie Ayala to the car, and\n\nthus,   to     the   crime.     Generalized        testimony    limited    to    an\n\nexplanation      such    as   \"we    stopped     investigating       because      of\n\ninformation      received,\"    without     any     context,    would    not     have\n\nsufficiently rebutted Ayala's line of questioning. While there can\n\nbe circumstances under which Confrontation Clause concerns prevent\n\nthe admission of the substance of a declarant's out-of-court\n\nstatement where a less prejudicial narrative would suffice in its\n\nplace, this is not such a case.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f                                 2.    Bruton\n\n            A Bruton claim arises in a narrower set of circumstances\n\nthan does a Crawford claim, specifically, involving the admission\n\nof a non-testifying codefendant's out-of-court statement during a\n\njoint trial for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter\n\nasserted.    See Tennessee v. Street, 471 U.S. 409, 413 (1985).\n\n            It is well established that a codefendant's out-of-court\n\nstatement is admissible against that codefendant as a \"party\n\nadmission.\" Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2); United States v. Vega Molina,\n\n407 F.3d 511, 519 (1st Cir. 2005).               But that same statement is\n\ninadmissible hearsay and raises Confrontation Clause concerns with\n\nrespect to another defendant being prosecuted in a joint trial.\n\nId. (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51-52, 68).\n\n            A   trial   judge    may   attempt    to   avoid   any   hearsay   or\n\nConfrontation Clause problems by instructing the jury not to\n\nconsider the statements against any defendant other than the\n\ncodefendant-declarant.          Vega Molina, 407 F.3d at 510; see also\n\nRichardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987) (\"Ordinarily, a\n\nwitness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial is not\n\nconsidered to be a witness 'against' a defendant if the jury is\n\ninstructed to consider that testimony only against a codefendant.\n\nThis accords with the almost invariable assumption of the law that\n\njurors follow their instructions.\") (citation omitted).               As Bruton\n\nholds, however, such a limiting instruction will not effectively\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fremedy     hearsay    and    Confrontation        Clause   problems       if     the\n\ncodefendant's statement is \"so powerfully inculpating of the other\n\ndefendants that there would be substantial doubt as to whether the\n\njury could abide by a limiting instruction.\" Vega Molina, 407 F.3d\n\nat   519   (explaining      further    that   a   statement    is   \"powerfully\n\ninculpating\" where it is \"inculpatory on its face\") (citing Bruton,\n\n391 U.S. at 135-37).9\n\n            Importantly      though,   Bruton's     conditional     bar     on   the\n\nadmission    of   a   codefendant's     statement     during   a    joint      trial\n\noperates on a key premise -- that the statement is being offered to\n\nprove the truth of the matter asserted.             See Street, 471 U.S. at\n\n413.     Where the codefendant's statement is not being offered to\n\nprove the truth of the matter asserted, a court may, in certain\n\ncircumstances, admit the statement provided it gives a limiting\n\ninstruction explaining the limited purpose the statement serves.\n\nId. at 414; Furr v. Brady, 440 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            The Supreme Court's post-Bruton decision in Street is the\n\nexemplar.    In that case, the Court held that the district court's\n\nadmission of a non-testifying codefendant's out-of-court confession\n\ndid not raise a Confrontation Clause problem because of \"[t]he\n\nnonhearsay aspect of [the codefendant's] confession.\"               Street, 471\n\n\n9\n  Typically, courts allowing introduction of the co-defendant's\nout-of-court statement seek to mitigate its inculpatory impact by\nredacting from the statement \"the [defendant's] name and any\nreference, direct or indirect, to his or her existence.\" Molina,\n407 F.3d at 519 (citing Marsh, 481 U.S. at 211).\n\n                                       -23-\n\fU.S. at 414.        The Court noted that the government offered the\n\nconfession \"not to prove what happened at the murder scene but to\n\nprove     what    happened       when       [Street,       the        defendant,       later]\n\nconfessed.\").        Id.        The    Court      went    on     to    observe    that     the\n\ngovernment       introduced      the     codefendant's           confession       to     rebut\n\nStreet's    testimony      that       his   own    confession          was    coerced     and,\n\nimportantly,       that    no     alternative            short        of     admitting     the\n\ncodefendant's statement along with the limiting instruction would\n\nhave served the government's interest. Id. at 415 (noting that the\n\nconfession could not be \"edited to reduce the risk of jury misuse\n\nwithout     detracting     from       the    alleged       purpose         for   which    the\n\nconfession was introduced\") (quotation omitted).\n\n             This case fits comfortably within the rule of Street.\n\nHere, as explained above, the district court admitted Cruz's out-\n\nof-court statement not to prove the truth of the matter asserted\n\nbut to rebut Ayala's attempt to cast doubt on the integrity of the\n\ngovernment's investigatory efforts.                 The district court instructed\n\nthe jury as to the limited nature of the statement's admission.\n\nAnd the government's interest in introducing the substance of the\n\nconfession, rather than a more sanitized narrative, was both\n\nlegitimate and strong.\n\n                                  III.      Conclusion\n\n             For the reasons provided above, the convictions are\n\naffirmed.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n                                            -24-\n\f",

Bauzá, Assistant United States Attorney with whom Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Vélez, United States Attorney and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>After a six-day trial, a jury convicted Angel Zamora Cruz-Díaz (Cruz) and José Alfredo Ayala-Colón (Ayala) of conspiring to rob a federally insured bank, 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count 1), aiding and abetting a bank robbery by use of a dangerous weapon, 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), (d) (Count 2), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, here, a bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 3). The district court sentenced Cruz to 183 months' imprisonment and Ayala to 168 months' imprisonment. Both Cruz and Ayala appeal their convictions.</p>\n<p>Cruz presents three claims. First, he argues that insufficient evidence supported his conviction for aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during a crime of violence. He contends that the government failed to adduce evidence sufficient to prove that he carried a \"real\" firearm as required by § 924(c). Cruz's second and third claims allege prosecutorial misconduct and erroneous jury instructions.</p>\n<p>Ayala presents only one claim, arguing that the court erred when it admitted his codefendant's out-of-court statement into evidence. This error, he contends, violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. After review of these claims, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts</h2>\n<p>The facts stated here, which are relevant to Cruz's sufficiency claim, are presented in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodríguez,</i> 541 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.2008). We add more facts where necessary to our discussion of the other appellate claims.</p>\n<p>On February 17, 2006, two armed men entered a bank in Puerto Rico shouting, \"This is a robbery!\" One of the men, later identified as Cruz, proceeded to the bank's front counter and demanded the tellers put money in a large, black plastic bag. The other man, later identified as Ayala, shepherded bank employees to the front of the bank. Four bank employees testified that Cruz carried a gun. Collectively, these four employees described the gun as a \"silver,\" \"shiny,\" \"nickel plated\" \"pistol.\" Two bank employees testified that Ayala carried a gun as well, with one describing it as a \"nickel plated,\" \"short barreled\" \"pistol\" and the other describing it as a \"silver handgun.\"</p>\n<p>The tellers complied with Cruz's demand, placing money inside the bag. After receiving the money, Cruz and Ayala exited the bank, having been inside between one and two minutes.</p>\n<p>The police received information that Cruz and Ayala were traveling in a red Mazda. Shortly thereafter, police officers discovered an abandoned car matching this description. Near the car, they found Cruz and Ayala. A search of the area yielded a black plastic bag containing money from the bank.<sup>[1]</sup> A search of the red <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> Mazda produced a bullet casing on the passenger's seat. The bullet casing corresponded with a nine-millimeter Luger brand bullet or cartridge. No guns, however, were ever found.</p>\n<p>At trial, in addition to introducing testimony from bank employees and police officers, the government introduced a bank surveillance video. The video showed Cruz and Ayala entering the bank brandishing guns. The jury found both defendants guilty on all three counts. We first address the claims presented by Cruz.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Cruz</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Sufficiency claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because Cruz failed to move for a judgment of acquittal on Count 3for aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during a bank robberywe review his sufficiency claim for plain error only. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Díaz,</i> 519 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir.2008).<sup>[2]</sup> Under the plain error standard, we will not reverse unless the allowing the conviction to stand would result in a \"clear and gross injustice.\" <i>United States v. Pratt,</i> 496 F.3d 124, 127 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Cruz's sufficiency claim focuses on the definition of \"firearm.\" He starts with the premise that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), requires proof that the defendant used a \"real\" firearm when committing the predicate offense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that \"a toy or a replica will not do\") (quotation omitted). For purposes of § 924(c), a firearm is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device.<sup>[4]</sup> Such term does not include an antique firearm.\"</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Armed with this definition, Cruz argues that no reasonable jury could conclude that he used a \"real\" firearm in the robbery. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> He points to two pieces of evidence to support this argument. First, one of the bank employees who testified that Cruz carried a gun later testified on cross-examination that he was not a \"gun inspector\" and admitted that he could not tell whether the gun Cruz carried was real or a toy. Second, Cruz notes that he confessed to an FBI agent that BB guns had been used in the robbery.</p>\n<p>When analyzing Cruz's claim, we must keep certain principles in mind. \"Although § 924(c) requires proof that the gun is real, the government's proof need not `reach a level of scientific certainty.'\" <i>United States v. Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Descriptive lay testimony can be sufficient to prove that the defendant used a real gun. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Kirvan,</i> 997 F.2d 963, 966-67 (1st Cir.1993)); <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 976 (concluding that the evidence was sufficient to prove the gun was real where three eyewitnesses to a bank robbery, who observed the object held by the defendant at close range, testified that it was a gun).</p>\n<p>We find no error at all here, much less plain error. The record contains evidence, both direct and circumstantial, sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Cruz used a real firearm during the robbery. The direct evidence included the testimony of four bank employees. These employees testified that Cruz held a gun, collectively describing the gun as a \"silver,\" \"shiny,\" \"nickel plated\" \"pistol.\" These descriptions are consistent with a conclusion that Cruz and Ayala used real guns. In fact, they are nearly identical to the descriptions provided by bank employees who testified in <i>Kirvan.</i> In that case in which one of the witnesses described the item held by the defendant as a \"silver,\" \"shiny,\" \"handgun,\" we held that the government introduced sufficient evidence that the gun used in the robbery was real. 997 F.2d at 966-67. Moreover, none of the witnesses in this case, all of whom had ample time to view the gun, described it as a BB or toy gun. <i>See </i><i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 976. In addition to this eyewitness testimony, the government also introduced a surveillance video showing Ayala and Cruz entering the bank and holding what appeared to be weapons. Although the videotape did not give the jury the superior vantage point that the bank tellers had, this additional evidence did allow the jurors to see for themselves what the witnesses had observed.</p>\n<p>Finally, the jury also had circumstantial evidence to draw upon in concluding that Cruz possessed a real firearm. Two pieces of evidence stand out. First, the bank employees all responded as if the guns held by both Cruz and Ayala were real, complying with the requests made by the robbers. The jury could have reasonably inferred, based on the reactions from the employees in combination with the eyewitness testimony, that Cruz and Ayala carried real firearms. Second, the police discovered a bullet casing in the vehicle used by Cruz and Ayala that corresponded with a real firearm. In our view, this circumstantial evidence, taken together with the direct evidence recounted above, supported the jury's verdict on Count 3.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that sufficient evidence underlies Count 3 is not undermined by the evidence Cruz directs to our attention a witness's expressed uncertainty regarding whether the gun Cruz held was real and Cruz's alleged confession to an FBI agent that BB guns were used in the robbery. The wavering testimony of the one bank teller must be placed in context. Three other bank tellers expressed no such uncertainty. As for Cruz's statement to the FBI, it does not merit overturning the verdict. In addition to being self-serving, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> the statement was never admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Prosecutorial Misconduct</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Cruz claims that the government committed prosecutorial misconduct during its closing argument, warranting a new trial. Specifically, he maintains that the prosecutor inaccurately recounted the facts in the record and therefore prejudiced the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p>Cruz focuses on the prosecutor's statement recapping the testimony of various bank tellers. The prosecutor, Cruz notes, told the jury that the bank tellers testified that Cruz and Ayala carried \"firearms.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Cruz argues that this was inaccurate because the tellers never used the term \"firearms\" in their testimony. Rather, the tellers used the words \"pistol\" and \"handgun\" to describe the objects held by Cruz and Ayala. The prosecutor's paraphrasing was prejudicial, Cruz contends, because \"[n]ot all handguns are firearms.\"</p>\n<p>Where an improper statement has been made, we typically ask whether the statement \"so poisoned the well\" that a new trial is merited. <i>United States v. Carpenter,</i> 494 F.3d 13, 23 (1st Cir.2007). But because Cruz did not object to the prosecutor's statement at trial, our review is only for plain error. <i>United States v. Vanvliet,</i> 542 F.3d 259, 270 (1st Cir.2008).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>We find no plain error. To begin, the prosecutor's paraphrasing did not plainly result in a factual inaccuracy. Although Cruz claims that \"not all handguns are firearms,\" a handgun, according to its dictionary definition, is \"a firearm (as a revolver or pistol) designed to be held and fired with one hand.\" <i>See</i> Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 525 (10th ed.2001); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. McKeeve,</i> 131 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[A] comment by counsel in the course of jury summation that merely recounts properly admitted testimony, accurately and without embellishment or distortion, cannot constitute reversible error.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the prosecutor's use of the word \"firearm\" did not prejudice Cruz. The district court gave two instructions to the jury that safeguarded against any potential prejudice. First, the court emphasized that the prosecutor's closing argument was not evidence. <i>United States v. Bey,</i> 188 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1999) (concluding that prosecutor's inaccurate recounting of evidence during closing argument did not prejudice the defendant where \"the district court explicitly cautioned the jury that it could not consider the arguments of counsel as evidence against [the defendant]\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> 539 F.3d 44, 64 (1st Cir.2008). And second, during jury instructions the court related the legal definition of the word \"firearm\" to the jury. So, however the prosecutor paraphrased the testimony of the bank tellers, it was ultimately and clearly up to the jury to conclude whether the guns used qualified as firearms.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> 3. <i>Jury instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, Cruz claims that the court issued erroneous jury instructions. Specifically, Cruz asserts that the court's failure to define \"dangerous weapon\" when instructing the jury on Count 2 led the jury to believe that it could convict Cruz on Count 3 if it found that Cruz used a \"dangerous weapon\" during the robbery. On the contrary, he asserts, to convict him on Count 3 the jury had to find that he used a \"firearm.\" The difference between a \"firearm\" and a \"dangerous weapon\" is important, Cruz argues, because although a BB gun or even a toy gun may qualify as a \"dangerous weapon\" under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(d) (Count 2), neither would qualify as a \"firearm\" under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 3). <i>Compare </i><i>Kirvan,</i> 997 F.2d at 966 (noting that, under § 924(c), \"a toy or replica will not do\") (citation omitted) <i>with </i><i>United States v. Cannon,</i> 903 F.2d 849, 854-55 (1st Cir.1990) (concluding that, under § 2113(d), a toy gun may qualify as a dangerous weapon).</p>\n<p>Because Cruz did not object to the court's instructions at trial, our review is again for plain error. <i>United States v. González-Vélez,</i> 466 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2006) (observing that this standard is \"exceedingly difficult to satisfy in jury instruction cases\") (internal quotation marks omitted). In assessing whether jury instructions were erroneous in the first place, we review them as a whole to determine if they \"adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We find no error in the court's instructions, much less plain error. The court appropriately instructed the jury regarding the definition of firearm. The court instructed the jury that, for purposes of Count 3, the firearm count, it must find that Cruz used a \"firearm\" during the robbery, and defined a firearm as \"any weapon which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the actions of an explosive.\" In so doing, the court made plain to the jury that it could not convict Cruz on Count 3 if it found that he used a toy gun or BB gun during the robbery.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Ayala</h2>\n<p>We turn now to Ayala's sole claim. Ayala argues that the court erred when it allowed an FBI agent to testify regarding an out-of-court statement made to authorities by his codefendant, Cruz. The court allowed the agent to testify about Cruz's statement after Ayala's counsel, via cross-examination, questioned a Puerto Rico police officer about the failure of the police to pursue various investigatory options after it detained the two defendants.</p>\n<p>The agent, who was the \"case agent\" for the investigation, explained that the FBI and Puerto Rico police failed to pursue certain investigatory options because they believed they had captured the right suspects. In doing so, the agent referred to Cruz's out-of-court statement while testifying that:</p>\n<blockquote>I became aware at the time of the detention of the two defendants that [Cruz] had stated to [the officer] who gained custody of him, that ... \"the money is over there in a black bag, we already threw away the weapons,\" and something to the effect of, \"we're screwed, less than five minutes and they caught us.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In Ayala's view, the court's decision to admit Cruz's out-of-court statement into evidence violated his Confrontation Clause rights as defined by the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) and <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> (1968). Ayala argues that the Court should have avoided a <i>Crawford</i> or <i>Bruton</i> problem by either suppressing the statement or severing his trial from Cruz's. We review this claim de novo. <i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> 514 F.3d 121, 133 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>\"The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal defendant the right `to be confronted with the witnesses against him.'\" <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Duran,</i> 507 F.3d 749, 768 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI). Ayala says that his right of confrontation has been infringed under both <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Bruton.</i> As we explain more fully below, however, the admission of Cruz's out-of-court statement offended neither <i>Crawford</i> nor <i>Bruton</i> for two reasons. First, the statement was not offered for its truththat is, to prove that the money was in the bag, that they were \"screwed\" or even that the defendants were the true culpritsbut rather to explain why the FBI and police did not pursue other investigatory options after apprehending the defendants. And second, Ayala's trial strategy opened the door to the statement's admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Crawford</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We start with the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Crawford,</i> which held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of testimonial hearsay into evidence against the defendant unless the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. <i>United States v. Earle,</i> 488 F.3d 537, 542 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354). It follows, then, that even where a declarant's out-of-court statement <i>is</i> testimonial,<sup>[8]</sup> the statement may nevertheless be admitted into evidence if one of the following three circumstances exists: (1) the statement is <i>not</i> hearsay in that it is being admitted for a purpose other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted; (2) the declarant testifies at trial; or (3) the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant and the declarant is unavailable. <i>United States v. Maher,</i> 454 F.3d 13, 19-20 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 53-54, 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p>In his <i>Crawford</i>-based confrontation clause argument, Ayala presses two points: that the testimony was hearsay and, even if the government offered a non-hearsay basis for admitting the statement, that basis was pretextual.</p>\n<p>First, Ayala contends that the court violated <i>Crawford</i> because none of the circumstances noted above existed. The government argues the contrary, contending that Cruz's statement was not hearsay because it was not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n<p>We agree that Cruz's confession was not hearsay. As Federal Rule of Evidence 801(c) provides: \"[h]earsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed. R.Evid. 801(c). Out-of-court statements offered not to prove the truth of the matter asserted but merely to show context such as a statement offered for the limited purpose of showing what effect the statement had on the listenerare not hearsay. <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 270 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir.2001) (noting a statement \"offered to show the effect of the words spoken on the listener (e.g., to supply a motive for the listener's action)\" is not hearsay) (citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Castro-Lara,</i> 970 F.2d 976, 981 (1st Cir.1992); 4 Stephen A. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> Saltzburg et al., <i>Federal Rules of Evidence Manual</i> § 801.02[1][f] (9th ed. 2006) (\"If a statement is offered for its effect on the listener, in order to explain the listener's conduct, it does not matter whether the declarant is telling the truth.\").</p>\n<p>Here, the government introduced Cruz's confession to explain why the authorities cut short their investigation into the robbery, specifically, why they did not take fingerprints or DNA evidence from the red Mazda. The district court drove this point home to the jury on two separate occasions. Prior to admitting the statement, the court told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote>[The FBI agent] is going to testify as to actions he took in his investigation of this case, based upon information he received. And what I'm going to instruct you is that his testimony concerning what he did, the actions he took, because of information [he] had, is not being presented to you to consider the truthfulness of the defendant's statement in any way whatsoever. You're instructed not to consider the statement he's going to testify about as evidence on any of the counts or against the defendants of any of the counts charged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, when issuing the final jury instructions, the court emphasized that the jury was not to consider Cruz's statement \"for the truth of the matter asserted therein and ... must only consider it for the limited purpose of providing a context for [the] decision not to send the fingerprint evidence to the laboratory for processing.\"</p>\n<p>We now turn to the second part of Ayala's <i>Crawford</i> argument. He contends, citing <i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d 13, that the <i>Crawford</i> inquiry does not end merely because the government advances a non-hearsay based justification for offering the declarant's statement. Rather, we must satisfy ourselves that the government's justification for offering the declarant's statement is not pretextual. Pursuing this further, Ayala argues that the record indicates that the government's purported non-hearsay based justification for offering Cruz's confession masked an attempt to circumvent <i>Crawford.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Maher,</i> we acknowledged that if the government needs only to identify a non-hearsay based reason for introducing the statement it could circumvent <i>Crawford</i>'s constitutional rule as well as the hearsay rule. 454 F.3d at 22; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Silva,</i> 380 F.3d 1018, 1020 (7th Cir.2004) (\"Allowing agents to narrate the course of their investigations, and thus spread before juries damning information that is not subject to cross-examination, would go far toward abrogating the defendant's rights under the sixth amendment and the hearsay rule.\"). Therefore, as was the case in <i>Maher,</i> when an out-of-court statement is purportedly offered into evidence as non-hearsayfor example, to provide context for police action or inactionwe are concerned about whether the stated purpose for introducing the evidence masks an attempt to evade <i>Crawford</i> and the normal restrictions on hearsay. <i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 22-23 (noting that \"[t]he dividing line often will not be clear between what is true background to explain police conduct (and thus an exception to the hearsay rule and thus an exception to <i>Crawford</i>) and what is an attempt to evade <i>Crawford</i> and the normal restrictions on hearsay\" and warning prosecutors against \"back-door attempts\" to get statements by non-testifying declarants before a jury).</p>\n<p>In this case, after analyzing how Cruz's confession came to be admitted into evidence, we are satisfied that no pretext was afoot and that the government did not attempt an end-run around <i>Crawford</i> and the hearsay rules.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> Cruz's confession was the subject of a suppression hearing held in the midst of the trial. During this hearing, Ayala sought to suppress the admission of Cruz's confession, arguing that it created a potential <i>Bruton</i> problem. The prosecutor informed both the court and the defendant that he did not intend to introduce Cruz's confession in the government's case-in-chief. The government did, however, reserve the right to present the confession for purposes of rebuttal.</p>\n<p>At trial, Ayala's counsel opened the door to the FBI agent's testimony, pointedly cross-examining a police officer about the decision not to pursue certain investigatory opportunities after apprehending the defendants. Counsel focused on potential fingerprint and DNA evidence the police could have gathered from the red Mazda and sent for analysis. In total, Ayala's counsel identified \"eleven missed opportunities\" to tie Cruz to the red Mazda. Faced with this line of questioning, the government sought to introduce the FBI agent's testimony to explain why the FBI and police did not lift forensic evidence from the car.</p>\n<p>Ayala argues that the government's true motive in admitting the agent's testimony was to march out Cruz's confession, making Ayala guilty by association in the process. In support of this argument, Ayala relies heavily on the fact that the government introduced the substance of the confession rather then constructing a less-prejudicial narrative. Specifically, he suggests that if the government merely wanted to explain why the FBI and police failed to conduct a more thorough investigation it could have had the agent testify in a manner that entirely avoided referencing Cruz's confession. As an example, Ayala argues that the agent could have testified that the government chose to truncate the investigation \"because of information [the agent had].\"</p>\n<p>We do not think the government's failure to present a more sanitized narrative reveals a motive to undercut <i>Crawford.</i> Given the tenor of Ayala's cross-examination about the authorities' failure to investigate further, the use of the generalized narrative Ayala suggests would have come at an unjustified cost to the government. During cross-examination, Ayala's counsel painted a picture of police and FBI ineptitude, observing that the government missed eleven opportunities to tie Ayala to the car, and thus, to the crime. Generalized testimony limited to an explanation such as \"we stopped investigating because of information received,\" without any context, would not have sufficiently rebutted Ayala's line of questioning. While there can be circumstances under which Confrontation Clause concerns prevent the admission of the substance of a declarant's out-of-court statement where a less prejudicial narrative would suffice in its place, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Bruton</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A <i>Bruton</i> claim arises in a narrower set of circumstances than does a <i>Crawford</i> claim, specifically, involving the admission of a non-testifying <i>codefendant's</i> out-of-court statement during a joint trial for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted. <i>See </i><i>Tennessee v. Street,</i> 471 U.S. 409, 413, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985).</p>\n<p>It is well established that a codefendant's out-of-court statement is admissible against that codefendant as a \"party admission.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2); <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 519 (1st Cir.2005). But that same statement is inadmissible hearsay and raises Confrontation Clause concerns with respect to another defendant being prosecuted in a joint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> trial. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 51-52, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354).</p>\n<p>A trial judge may attempt to avoid any hearsay or Confrontation Clause problems by instructing the jury not to consider the statements against any defendant other than the codefendant-declarant. <i>Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 519; <i>see also </i><i>Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (\"Ordinarily, a witness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial is not considered to be a witness `against' a defendant if the jury is instructed to consider that testimony only against a codefendant. This accords with the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions.\") (citation omitted). As <i>Bruton</i> holds, however, such a limiting instruction will not effectively remedy hearsay and Confrontation Clause problems if the codefendant's statement is \"so powerfully inculpating of the other defendants that there would be substantial doubt as to whether the jury could abide by a limiting instruction.\" <i>Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 519 (explaining further that a statement is \"powerfully inculpating\" where it is \"inculpatory on its face\") (citing <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 135-37, 88 S.Ct. 1620).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Importantly though, <i>Bruton</i>'s conditional bar on the admission of a codefendant's statement during a joint trial operates on a key premisethat the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <i>See </i><i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 413, 105 S.Ct. 2078. Where the codefendant's statement is <i>not</i> being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, a court may, in certain circumstances, admit the statement provided it gives a limiting instruction explaining the limited purpose the statement serves. <i>Id.</i> at 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078; <i>Furr v. Brady,</i> 440 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's post-<i>Bruton</i> decision in <i>Street</i> is the exemplar. In that case, the Court held that the district court's admission of a non-testifying codefendant's out-of-court confession did not raise a Confrontation Clause problem because of \"[t]he nonhearsay aspect of [the codefendant's] confession.\" <i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078. The Court noted that the government offered the confession \"not to prove what happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when [Street, the defendant, later] confessed.\". <i>Id.</i> The Court went on to observe that the government introduced the codefendant's confession to rebut Street's testimony that his own confession was coerced and, importantly, that no alternative short of admitting the codefendant's statement along with the limiting instruction would have served the government's interest. <i>Id.</i> at 415, 105 S.Ct. 2078 (noting that the confession could not be \"edited to reduce the risk of jury misuse without detracting from the alleged purpose for which the confession was introduced\") (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>This case fits comfortably within the rule of <i>Street.</i> Here, as explained above, the district court admitted Cruz's out-of-court statement not to prove the truth of the matter asserted but to rebut Ayala's attempt to cast doubt on the integrity of the government's investigatory efforts. The district court instructed the jury as to the limited nature of the statement's admission. And the government's interest in introducing the substance of the confession, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> rather than a more sanitized narrative, was both legitimate and strong.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, the convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The bank's loss was estimated at $45,410.16.</p>\n<p>[2]  Cruz claims that he moved for a judgment of acquittal on Count 3 and that, as a result, the de novo standard of review applies. The record, however, is clear that Cruz's Rule 29 motion was directed at Counts 1 and 2. In any event, as our analysis below indicates, Cruz's sufficiency claim would fail even under the more searching de novo standard.</p>\n<p>[3]  Where preserved, we review a sufficiency claim de novo. Under that standard, we examine the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged count or crime. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Fenton,</i> 367 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[4]  Destructive device is further defined as:\n</p>\n<p>(A) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas(i) bomb, (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or (vi) device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses; (B) any type of weapon (other than a shotgun or a shotgun shell which the Attorney General finds is generally recognized as particularly suitable for sporting purposes) by whatever name known which will, or which may be readily converted to, expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or other propellant, and which has any barrel with a bore of more than one-half inch in diameter; and (C) any combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into any destructive device described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 921(a)(4).</p>\n<p>[5]  The prosecutor stated:\n</p>\n<p>And the evidence clearly shows on the video both individuals were possessing firearms and the bank tellers who they approached, as well as another person who testified here said that without a doubt that those individuals had firearms.</p>\n<p>[6]  As was the case with his sufficiency claim, Cruz contends that he preserved his claim of prosecutorial misconduct and that we should review the prosecutor's statement de novo. After review of the record, we disagree.</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that Cruz does not argue that the \"without a doubt\" language in the prosecutor's closing argument was problematic. Accordingly, this argument is waived. <i>United States v.

Bauzá, Assistant United States Attorney with whom Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Vélez, United States Attorney and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>After a six-day trial, a jury convicted Angel Zamora Cruz-Díaz (Cruz) and José Alfredo Ayala-Colón (Ayala) of conspiring to rob a federally insured bank, 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count 1), aiding and abetting a bank robbery by use of a dangerous weapon, 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), (d) (Count 2), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, here, a bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 3). The district court sentenced Cruz to 183 months' imprisonment and Ayala to 168 months' imprisonment. Both Cruz and Ayala appeal their convictions.</p>\n<p>Cruz presents three claims. First, he argues that insufficient evidence supported his conviction for aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during a crime of violence. He contends that the government failed to adduce evidence sufficient to prove that he carried a \"real\" firearm as required by § 924(c). Cruz's second and third claims allege prosecutorial misconduct and erroneous jury instructions.</p>\n<p>Ayala presents only one claim, arguing that the court erred when it admitted his codefendant's out-of-court statement into evidence. This error, he contends, violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. After review of these claims, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts</h2>\n<p>The facts stated here, which are relevant to Cruz's sufficiency claim, are presented in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203469\"><a href=\"/opinion/203469/united-states-v-cruz-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2008). We add more facts where necessary to our discussion of the other appellate claims.</p>\n<p>On February 17, 2006, two armed men entered a bank in Puerto Rico shouting, \"This is a robbery!\" One of the men, later identified as Cruz, proceeded to the bank's front counter and demanded the tellers put money in a large, black plastic bag. The other man, later identified as Ayala, shepherded bank employees to the front of the bank. Four bank employees testified that Cruz carried a gun. Collectively, these four employees described the gun as a \"silver,\" \"shiny,\" \"nickel plated\" \"pistol.\" Two bank employees testified that Ayala carried a gun as well, with one describing it as a \"nickel plated,\" \"short barreled\" \"pistol\" and the other describing it as a \"silver handgun.\"</p>\n<p>The tellers complied with Cruz's demand, placing money inside the bag. After receiving the money, Cruz and Ayala exited the bank, having been inside between one and two minutes.</p>\n<p>The police received information that Cruz and Ayala were traveling in a red Mazda. Shortly thereafter, police officers discovered an abandoned car matching this description. Near the car, they found Cruz and Ayala. A search of the area yielded a black plastic bag containing money from the bank.<sup>[1]</sup> A search of the red <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> Mazda produced a bullet casing on the passenger's seat. The bullet casing corresponded with a nine-millimeter Luger brand bullet or cartridge. No guns, however, were ever found.</p>\n<p>At trial, in addition to introducing testimony from bank employees and police officers, the government introduced a bank surveillance video. The video showed Cruz and Ayala entering the bank brandishing guns. The jury found both defendants guilty on all three counts. We first address the claims presented by Cruz.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Cruz</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Sufficiency claim</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because Cruz failed to move for a judgment of acquittal on Count 3for aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during a bank robberywe review his sufficiency claim for plain error only. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Díaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203172\"><a href=\"/opinion/203172/united-states-v-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2008).<sup>[2]</sup> Under the plain error standard, we will not reverse unless the allowing the conviction to stand would result in a \"clear and gross injustice.\" <i>United States v. Pratt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202884\"><a href=\"/opinion/202884/united-states-v-pratt/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 127 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Cruz's sufficiency claim focuses on the definition of \"firearm.\" He starts with the premise that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), requires proof that the defendant used a \"real\" firearm when committing the predicate offense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that \"a toy or a replica will not do\") (quotation omitted). For purposes of § 924(c), a firearm is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device.<sup>[4]</sup> Such term does not include an antique firearm.\"</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Armed with this definition, Cruz argues that no reasonable jury could conclude that he used a \"real\" firearm in the robbery. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> He points to two pieces of evidence to support this argument. First, one of the bank employees who testified that Cruz carried a gun later testified on cross-examination that he was not a \"gun inspector\" and admitted that he could not tell whether the gun Cruz carried was real or a toy. Second, Cruz notes that he confessed to an FBI agent that BB guns had been used in the robbery.</p>\n<p>When analyzing Cruz's claim, we must keep certain principles in mind. \"Although § 924(c) requires proof that the gun is real, the government's proof need not `reach a level of scientific certainty.'\" <i>United States v. Roberson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202345\"><a href=\"/opinion/202345/united-states-v-roberson/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Descriptive lay testimony can be sufficient to prove that the defendant used a real gun. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Kirvan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610801\"><a href=\"/opinion/610801/united-states-v-paul-j-kirvan-united-states-v-paul-j-kirvan/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span>, 966-67 (1st Cir.1993)); <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 976 (concluding that the evidence was sufficient to prove the gun was real where three eyewitnesses to a bank robbery, who observed the object held by the defendant at close range, testified that it was a gun).</p>\n<p>We find no error at all here, much less plain error. The record contains evidence, both direct and circumstantial, sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Cruz used a real firearm during the robbery. The direct evidence included the testimony of four bank employees. These employees testified that Cruz held a gun, collectively describing the gun as a \"silver,\" \"shiny,\" \"nickel plated\" \"pistol.\" These descriptions are consistent with a conclusion that Cruz and Ayala used real guns. In fact, they are nearly identical to the descriptions provided by bank employees who testified in <i>Kirvan.</i> In that case in which one of the witnesses described the item held by the defendant as a \"silver,\" \"shiny,\" \"handgun,\" we held that the government introduced sufficient evidence that the gun used in the robbery was real. 997 F.2d at 966-67. Moreover, none of the witnesses in this case, all of whom had ample time to view the gun, described it as a BB or toy gun. <i>See </i><i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 976. In addition to this eyewitness testimony, the government also introduced a surveillance video showing Ayala and Cruz entering the bank and holding what appeared to be weapons. Although the videotape did not give the jury the superior vantage point that the bank tellers had, this additional evidence did allow the jurors to see for themselves what the witnesses had observed.</p>\n<p>Finally, the jury also had circumstantial evidence to draw upon in concluding that Cruz possessed a real firearm. Two pieces of evidence stand out. First, the bank employees all responded as if the guns held by both Cruz and Ayala were real, complying with the requests made by the robbers. The jury could have reasonably inferred, based on the reactions from the employees in combination with the eyewitness testimony, that Cruz and Ayala carried real firearms. Second, the police discovered a bullet casing in the vehicle used by Cruz and Ayala that corresponded with a real firearm. In our view, this circumstantial evidence, taken together with the direct evidence recounted above, supported the jury's verdict on Count 3.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that sufficient evidence underlies Count 3 is not undermined by the evidence Cruz directs to our attention a witness's expressed uncertainty regarding whether the gun Cruz held was real and Cruz's alleged confession to an FBI agent that BB guns were used in the robbery. The wavering testimony of the one bank teller must be placed in context. Three other bank tellers expressed no such uncertainty. As for Cruz's statement to the FBI, it does not merit overturning the verdict. In addition to being self-serving, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> the statement was never admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Prosecutorial Misconduct</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Cruz claims that the government committed prosecutorial misconduct during its closing argument, warranting a new trial. Specifically, he maintains that the prosecutor inaccurately recounted the facts in the record and therefore prejudiced the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p>Cruz focuses on the prosecutor's statement recapping the testimony of various bank tellers. The prosecutor, Cruz notes, told the jury that the bank tellers testified that Cruz and Ayala carried \"firearms.\"<sup>[5]</sup> Cruz argues that this was inaccurate because the tellers never used the term \"firearms\" in their testimony. Rather, the tellers used the words \"pistol\" and \"handgun\" to describe the objects held by Cruz and Ayala. The prosecutor's paraphrasing was prejudicial, Cruz contends, because \"[n]ot all handguns are firearms.\"</p>\n<p>Where an improper statement has been made, we typically ask whether the statement \"so poisoned the well\" that a new trial is merited. <i>United States v. Carpenter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202849\"><a href=\"/opinion/202849/united-states-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2007). But because Cruz did not object to the prosecutor's statement at trial, our review is only for plain error. <i>United States v. Vanvliet,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203483\"><a href=\"/opinion/203483/united-states-v-vanvliet/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 270 (1st Cir.2008).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>We find no plain error. To begin, the prosecutor's paraphrasing did not plainly result in a factual inaccuracy. Although Cruz claims that \"not all handguns are firearms,\" a handgun, according to its dictionary definition, is \"a firearm (as a revolver or pistol) designed to be held and fired with one hand.\" <i>See</i> Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 525 (10th ed.2001); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. McKeeve,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197677\"><a href=\"/opinion/197677/united-states-v-mckeeve/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[A] comment by counsel in the course of jury summation that merely recounts properly admitted testimony, accurately and without embellishment or distortion, cannot constitute reversible error.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the prosecutor's use of the word \"firearm\" did not prejudice Cruz. The district court gave two instructions to the jury that safeguarded against any potential prejudice. First, the court emphasized that the prosecutor's closing argument was not evidence. <i>United States v. Bey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765731\"><a href=\"/opinion/765731/united-states-v-joseph-bey-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1999) (concluding that prosecutor's inaccurate recounting of evidence during closing argument did not prejudice the defendant where \"the district court explicitly cautioned the jury that it could not consider the arguments of counsel as evidence against [the defendant]\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427539\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427539/united-states-v-brandao/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2008). And second, during jury instructions the court related the legal definition of the word \"firearm\" to the jury. So, however the prosecutor paraphrased the testimony of the bank tellers, it was ultimately and clearly up to the jury to conclude whether the guns used qualified as firearms.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> 3. <i>Jury instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, Cruz claims that the court issued erroneous jury instructions. Specifically, Cruz asserts that the court's failure to define \"dangerous weapon\" when instructing the jury on Count 2 led the jury to believe that it could convict Cruz on Count 3 if it found that Cruz used a \"dangerous weapon\" during the robbery. On the contrary, he asserts, to convict him on Count 3 the jury had to find that he used a \"firearm.\" The difference between a \"firearm\" and a \"dangerous weapon\" is important, Cruz argues, because although a BB gun or even a toy gun may qualify as a \"dangerous weapon\" under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(d) (Count 2), neither would qualify as a \"firearm\" under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 3). <i>Compare </i><i>Kirvan,</i> 997 F.2d at 966 (noting that, under § 924(c), \"a toy or replica will not do\") (citation omitted) <i>with </i><i>United States v. Cannon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541944\"><a href=\"/opinion/541944/united-states-v-patrick-m-cannon/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 854-55 (1st Cir.1990) (concluding that, under § 2113(d), a toy gun may qualify as a dangerous weapon).</p>\n<p>Because Cruz did not object to the court's instructions at trial, our review is again for plain error. <i>United States v. González-Vélez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>, 35 (1st Cir. 2006) (observing that this standard is \"exceedingly difficult to satisfy in jury instruction cases\") (internal quotation marks omitted). In assessing whether jury instructions were erroneous in the first place, we review them as a whole to determine if they \"adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We find no error in the court's instructions, much less plain error. The court appropriately instructed the jury regarding the definition of firearm. The court instructed the jury that, for purposes of Count 3, the firearm count, it must find that Cruz used a \"firearm\" during the robbery, and defined a firearm as \"any weapon which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the actions of an explosive.\" In so doing, the court made plain to the jury that it could not convict Cruz on Count 3 if it found that he used a toy gun or BB gun during the robbery.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Ayala</h2>\n<p>We turn now to Ayala's sole claim. Ayala argues that the court erred when it allowed an FBI agent to testify regarding an out-of-court statement made to authorities by his codefendant, Cruz. The court allowed the agent to testify about Cruz's statement after Ayala's counsel, via cross-examination, questioned a Puerto Rico police officer about the failure of the police to pursue various investigatory options after it detained the two defendants.</p>\n<p>The agent, who was the \"case agent\" for the investigation, explained that the FBI and Puerto Rico police failed to pursue certain investigatory options because they believed they had captured the right suspects. In doing so, the agent referred to Cruz's out-of-court statement while testifying that:</p>\n<blockquote>I became aware at the time of the detention of the two defendants that [Cruz] had stated to [the officer] who gained custody of him, that ... \"the money is over there in a black bag, we already threw away the weapons,\" and something to the effect of, \"we're screwed, less than five minutes and they caught us.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In Ayala's view, the court's decision to admit Cruz's out-of-court statement into evidence violated his Confrontation Clause rights as defined by the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (2004) and <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> (1968). Ayala argues that the Court should have avoided a <i>Crawford</i> or <i>Bruton</i> problem by either suppressing the statement or severing his trial from Cruz's. We review this claim de novo. <i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203128\"><a href=\"/opinion/203128/united-states-v-de-la-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 133 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>\"The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal defendant the right `to be confronted with the witnesses against him.'\" <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Duran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203028\"><a href=\"/opinion/203028/united-states-v-rodriguez-duran/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 768 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI). Ayala says that his right of confrontation has been infringed under both <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Bruton.</i> As we explain more fully below, however, the admission of Cruz's out-of-court statement offended neither <i>Crawford</i> nor <i>Bruton</i> for two reasons. First, the statement was not offered for its truththat is, to prove that the money was in the bag, that they were \"screwed\" or even that the defendants were the true culpritsbut rather to explain why the FBI and police did not pursue other investigatory options after apprehending the defendants. And second, Ayala's trial strategy opened the door to the statement's admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Crawford</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We start with the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Crawford,</i> which held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of testimonial hearsay into evidence against the defendant unless the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. <i>United States v. Earle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202779\"><a href=\"/opinion/202779/united-states-v-earle/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 542 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></a></span>). It follows, then, that even where a declarant's out-of-court statement <i>is</i> testimonial,<sup>[8]</sup> the statement may nevertheless be admitted into evidence if one of the following three circumstances exists: (1) the statement is <i>not</i> hearsay in that it is being admitted for a purpose other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted; (2) the declarant testifies at trial; or (3) the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant and the declarant is unavailable. <i>United States v. Maher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202307\"><a href=\"/opinion/202307/united-states-v-maher/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 53-54, 59 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In his <i>Crawford</i>-based confrontation clause argument, Ayala presses two points: that the testimony was hearsay and, even if the government offered a non-hearsay basis for admitting the statement, that basis was pretextual.</p>\n<p>First, Ayala contends that the court violated <i>Crawford</i> because none of the circumstances noted above existed. The government argues the contrary, contending that Cruz's statement was not hearsay because it was not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n<p>We agree that Cruz's confession was not hearsay. As Federal Rule of Evidence 801(c) provides: \"[h]earsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed. R.Evid. 801(c). Out-of-court statements offered not to prove the truth of the matter asserted but merely to show context such as a statement offered for the limited purpose of showing what effect the statement had on the listenerare not hearsay. <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199664\"><a href=\"/opinion/199664/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2001) (noting a statement \"offered to show the effect of the words spoken on the listener (e.g., to supply a motive for the listener's action)\" is not hearsay) (citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Castro-Lara,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587572\"><a href=\"/opinion/587572/united-states-v-ramon-castro-lara-united-states-of-america-v-abraham/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span>, 981 (1st Cir.1992); 4 Stephen A. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> Saltzburg et al., <i>Federal Rules of Evidence Manual</i> § 801.02[1][f] (9th ed. 2006) (\"If a statement is offered for its effect on the listener, in order to explain the listener's conduct, it does not matter whether the declarant is telling the truth.\").</p>\n<p>Here, the government introduced Cruz's confession to explain why the authorities cut short their investigation into the robbery, specifically, why they did not take fingerprints or DNA evidence from the red Mazda. The district court drove this point home to the jury on two separate occasions. Prior to admitting the statement, the court told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote>[The FBI agent] is going to testify as to actions he took in his investigation of this case, based upon information he received. And what I'm going to instruct you is that his testimony concerning what he did, the actions he took, because of information [he] had, is not being presented to you to consider the truthfulness of the defendant's statement in any way whatsoever. You're instructed not to consider the statement he's going to testify about as evidence on any of the counts or against the defendants of any of the counts charged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, when issuing the final jury instructions, the court emphasized that the jury was not to consider Cruz's statement \"for the truth of the matter asserted therein and ... must only consider it for the limited purpose of providing a context for [the] decision not to send the fingerprint evidence to the laboratory for processing.\"</p>\n<p>We now turn to the second part of Ayala's <i>Crawford</i> argument. He contends, citing <i>Maher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202307\"><a href=\"/opinion/202307/united-states-v-maher/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, that the <i>Crawford</i> inquiry does not end merely because the government advances a non-hearsay based justification for offering the declarant's statement. Rather, we must satisfy ourselves that the government's justification for offering the declarant's statement is not pretextual. Pursuing this further, Ayala argues that the record indicates that the government's purported non-hearsay based justification for offering Cruz's confession masked an attempt to circumvent <i>Crawford.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Maher,</i> we acknowledged that if the government needs only to identify a non-hearsay based reason for introducing the statement it could circumvent <i>Crawford</i>'s constitutional rule as well as the hearsay rule. 454 F.3d at 22; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Silva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787463\"><a href=\"/opinion/787463/united-states-v-juan-jose-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>, 1020 (7th Cir.2004) (\"Allowing agents to narrate the course of their investigations, and thus spread before juries damning information that is not subject to cross-examination, would go far toward abrogating the defendant's rights under the sixth amendment and the hearsay rule.\"). Therefore, as was the case in <i>Maher,</i> when an out-of-court statement is purportedly offered into evidence as non-hearsayfor example, to provide context for police action or inactionwe are concerned about whether the stated purpose for introducing the evidence masks an attempt to evade <i>Crawford</i> and the normal restrictions on hearsay. <i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 22-23 (noting that \"[t]he dividing line often will not be clear between what is true background to explain police conduct (and thus an exception to the hearsay rule and thus an exception to <i>Crawford</i>) and what is an attempt to evade <i>Crawford</i> and the normal restrictions on hearsay\" and warning prosecutors against \"back-door attempts\" to get statements by non-testifying declarants before a jury).</p>\n<p>In this case, after analyzing how Cruz's confession came to be admitted into evidence, we are satisfied that no pretext was afoot and that the government did not attempt an end-run around <i>Crawford</i> and the hearsay rules.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> Cruz's confession was the subject of a suppression hearing held in the midst of the trial. During this hearing, Ayala sought to suppress the admission of Cruz's confession, arguing that it created a potential <i>Bruton</i> problem. The prosecutor informed both the court and the defendant that he did not intend to introduce Cruz's confession in the government's case-in-chief. The government did, however, reserve the right to present the confession for purposes of rebuttal.</p>\n<p>At trial, Ayala's counsel opened the door to the FBI agent's testimony, pointedly cross-examining a police officer about the decision not to pursue certain investigatory opportunities after apprehending the defendants. Counsel focused on potential fingerprint and DNA evidence the police could have gathered from the red Mazda and sent for analysis. In total, Ayala's counsel identified \"eleven missed opportunities\" to tie Cruz to the red Mazda. Faced with this line of questioning, the government sought to introduce the FBI agent's testimony to explain why the FBI and police did not lift forensic evidence from the car.</p>\n<p>Ayala argues that the government's true motive in admitting the agent's testimony was to march out Cruz's confession, making Ayala guilty by association in the process. In support of this argument, Ayala relies heavily on the fact that the government introduced the substance of the confession rather then constructing a less-prejudicial narrative. Specifically, he suggests that if the government merely wanted to explain why the FBI and police failed to conduct a more thorough investigation it could have had the agent testify in a manner that entirely avoided referencing Cruz's confession. As an example, Ayala argues that the agent could have testified that the government chose to truncate the investigation \"because of information [the agent had].\"</p>\n<p>We do not think the government's failure to present a more sanitized narrative reveals a motive to undercut <i>Crawford.</i> Given the tenor of Ayala's cross-examination about the authorities' failure to investigate further, the use of the generalized narrative Ayala suggests would have come at an unjustified cost to the government. During cross-examination, Ayala's counsel painted a picture of police and FBI ineptitude, observing that the government missed eleven opportunities to tie Ayala to the car, and thus, to the crime. Generalized testimony limited to an explanation such as \"we stopped investigating because of information received,\" without any context, would not have sufficiently rebutted Ayala's line of questioning. While there can be circumstances under which Confrontation Clause concerns prevent the admission of the substance of a declarant's out-of-court statement where a less prejudicial narrative would suffice in its place, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Bruton</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A <i>Bruton</i> claim arises in a narrower set of circumstances than does a <i>Crawford</i> claim, specifically, involving the admission of a non-testifying <i>codefendant's</i> out-of-court statement during a joint trial for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted. <i>See </i><i>Tennessee v.

But that same statement is inadmissible hearsay and raises Confrontation Clause concerns with respect to another defendant being prosecuted in a joint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> trial. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 51-52, 68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This accords with the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions.\") (citation omitted). As <i>Bruton</i> holds, however, such a limiting instruction will not effectively remedy hearsay and Confrontation Clause problems if the codefendant's statement is \"so powerfully inculpating of the other defendants that there would be substantial doubt as to whether the jury could abide by a limiting instruction.\" <i>Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 519 (explaining further that a statement is \"powerfully inculpating\" where it is \"inculpatory on its face\") (citing <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 135-37, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1620</span></a></span>).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Importantly though, <i>Bruton</i>'s conditional bar on the admission of a codefendant's statement during a joint trial operates on a key premisethat the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <i>See </i><i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 413, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2078</span></a></span>. Where the codefendant's statement is <i>not</i> being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, a court may, in certain circumstances, admit the statement provided it gives a limiting instruction explaining the limited purpose the statement serves. <i>Id.</i> at 414, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In that case, the Court held that the district court's admission of a non-testifying codefendant's out-of-court confession did not raise a Confrontation Clause problem because of \"[t]he nonhearsay aspect of [the codefendant's] confession.\" <i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 414, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2078</span></a></span>. The Court noted that the government offered the confession \"not to prove what happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when [Street, the defendant, later] confessed.\". <i>Id.</i> The Court went on to observe that the government introduced the codefendant's confession to rebut Street's testimony that his own confession was coerced and, importantly, that no alternative short of admitting the codefendant's statement along with the limiting instruction would have served the government's interest. <i>Id.</i> at 415, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2078</span></a></span> (noting that the confession could not be \"edited to reduce the risk of jury misuse without detracting from the alleged purpose for which the confession was introduced\") (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>This case fits comfortably within the rule of <i>Street.</i> Here, as explained above, the district court admitted Cruz's out-of-court statement not to prove the truth of the matter asserted but to rebut Ayala's attempt to cast doubt on the integrity of the government's investigatory efforts. The district court instructed the jury as to the limited nature of the statement's admission. And the government's interest in introducing the substance of the confession, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> rather than a more sanitized narrative, was both legitimate and strong.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, the convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The bank's loss was estimated at $45,410.16.</p>\n<p>[2]  Cruz claims that he moved for a judgment of acquittal on Count 3 and that, as a result, the de novo standard of review applies. The record, however, is clear that Cruz's Rule 29 motion was directed at Counts 1 and 2. In any event, as our analysis below indicates, Cruz's sufficiency claim would fail even under the more searching de novo standard.</p>\n<p>[3]  Where preserved, we review a sufficiency claim de novo. Under that standard, we examine the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged count or crime. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Fenton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200988\"><a href=\"/opinion/200988/united-states-v-fenton/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[4]  Destructive device is further defined as:\n</p>\n<p>(A) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas(i) bomb, (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or (vi) device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses; (B) any type of weapon (other than a shotgun or a shotgun shell which the Attorney General finds is generally recognized as particularly suitable for sporting purposes) by whatever name known which will, or which may be readily converted to, expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or other propellant, and which has any barrel with a bore of more than one-half inch in diameter; and (C) any combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into any destructive device described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 921(a)(4).</p>\n<p>[5]  The prosecutor stated:\n</p>\n<p>And the evidence clearly shows on the video both individuals were possessing firearms and the bank tellers who they approached, as well as another person who testified here said that without a doubt that those individuals had firearms.</p>\n<p>[6]  As was the case with his sufficiency claim, Cruz contends that he preserved his claim of prosecutorial misconduct and that we should review the prosecutor's statement de novo. After review of the record, we disagree.</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that Cruz does not argue that the \"without a doubt\" language in the prosecutor's closing argument was problematic. Accordingly, this argument is waived. <i>United States v.
