Wiberg and Desfosses Law Firm for appellant.\n     Joseph N. Laplante, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                             January 18, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern       District      of     California,      sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            SCHWARZER,        Senior    District     Judge.     Kevin    Boulais\n\n(“Boulais”) appeals his sentence of 100 months, imposed following\n\na guilty plea to one count of being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm,    18   U.S.C.   §   922(g)(1).      In   sentencing       Boulais,   the\n\ndistrict court departed downward from the Armed Career Criminal\n\nAct’s (“ACCA”) mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months. 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(e)(1).     Boulais argues that his case should be remanded for\n\nresentencing.       We    reject   Boulais’    arguments      and    affirm    his\n\nsentence.\n\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n            Boulais pleaded guilty to one count of being a felon in\n\npossession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).\n\nThe plea agreement stated that Boulais faced a maximum penalty of\n\nten years’ imprisonment, but indicated in a footnote that he could\n\nface a fifteen-year minimum penalty with the potential for life\n\nimprisonment if he was found to be an armed career criminal under\n\nthe ACCA, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).          After the plea agreement had been\n\nsigned, but before the plea colloquy, the government offered\n\nevidence indicating that Boulais qualified for sentencing as an\n\narmed career criminal.        At the waiver of indictment and change of\n\nplea hearing, Boulais was advised by the district court that he\n\ncould be sentenced as an armed career criminal.\n\n            At the sentencing hearing, Boulais raised a general\n\nconstitutional objection to the United States Sentencing Guidelines\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fand a Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause objection to the court’s\n\napplication of the ACCA.     Boulais did not admit or stipulate to the\n\nfact that he had prior convictions.              However, when questioned\n\ndirectly by the district court regarding his objection to the\n\nACCA’s application, Boulais stated that he had no factual basis for\n\nchallenging the prior convictions listed in the presentence report.\n\n            The   district      court     initially    calculated         Boulais’\n\nsentencing range under the Guidelines to be 168-210 months.                  Over\n\nBoulais’ objection, the court found the ACCA’s fifteen-year minimum\n\nsentence to apply, but departed downward on the government’s\n\nsubstantial   assistance     motion      to   arrive   at    the   100    months’\n\nsentence.\n\n            Following the Supreme Court’s decision in United States\n\nv. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), we invited supplemental briefing\n\nto address whether Boulais preserved a Booker claim and whether his\n\ncase should be remanded for resentencing.\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\n            We review a preserved claim of Booker error under the\n\nharmless error standard. United States v. Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d\n\n476, 488 (1st Cir. 2005); see Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 769.                    Here,\n\nBoulais preserved his Booker claim by challenging the Guidelines’\n\nconstitutionality    in   the    district     court.        We   review    alleged\n\nviolations of the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Rondeau, 430 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f           Boulais’ arguments for a remand for resentencing come\n\ndown to three propositions.    We find none to be meritorious.\n\n           First, Boulais claims Booker error because the district\n\ncourt conducted a Guidelines analysis of his potential sentence.\n\nSuch an error exists when a “defendant’s Guidelines sentence was\n\nimposed    under   a   mandatory    system.”    United   States   v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005). However, Boulais’\n\nsentence was imposed under the ACCA, not the Guidelines, and hence\n\nBooker does not apply.   See United States v. Ivery, 427 F.3d 69, 71\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (holding sentencing under the ACCA not to be a\n\nBooker error); United States v. Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d 65, 80\n\nn.8 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Second, Boulais objects on constitutional grounds to any\n\nuse of prior convictions not charged in the information or proved\n\nto a jury.   However, as we have made clear, following Booker, “it\n\nremains the law that previous criminal convictions are not ‘facts’\n\nthat must be found by a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\nUnited States v. Work, 409 F.3d 484, 491 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citation omitted); see also Ivery, 427 F.3d at 74 (holding that\n\n“nothing in Blakely or Booker alters the continuing validity of the\n\nAlmendarez-Torres exception to Apprendi”).     Here, the presentence\n\nreport and the district court’s colloquy with Boulais provided a\n\nconstitutionally sufficient basis for sentencing Boulais under the\n\nACCA.   Boulais admitted at sentencing that he did not “have a basis\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fto challenge [any of the predicate convictions in the presentence\n\nreport] on a factual basis as a matter of proof on the burden.”\n\nNor is there merit in Boulais’ arguments based on Blakely v.\n\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), since his sentence was well below\n\nthe statutory maximum of life imprisonment.    See United States v.\n\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Third, Boulais objects to the use of the criminal history\n\ncalculation in the Presentence Report on hearsay grounds.       The\n\nSixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, however, does not\n\napply to sentencing.   United States v. Luciano, 414 F.3d 174, 178-\n\n79 (1st Cir. 2005).    The district court’s use of the presentence\n\nreport raises no Confrontation Clause issue.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
