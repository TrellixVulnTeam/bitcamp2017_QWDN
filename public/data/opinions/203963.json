Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Ebel * and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David A.

Orr were on brief for\nappellant.\n     Aixa  Maldonado-Quinones,  Assistant   United  States\nAttorney, with whom Michael J. Gunnison, United States\nAttorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                          August 20, 2009\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f       EBEL, Circuit Judge. In this direct criminal appeal,\n\nDefendant-Appellant             Steve     Huard       challenges      his       three\n\nconvictions stemming from a bank robbery.                          Huard asserts\n\nonly    that       his   trial   attorney        provided        constitutionally\n\nineffective representation.               A criminal defendant, however,\n\ngenerally cannot bring an ineffective-assistance claim on\n\ndirect appeal absent extraordinary circumstances.                       And Huard\n\nhas failed to establish such circumstances here.                       Therefore,\n\nhaving jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we AFFIRM\n\nhis convictions, leaving Huard the opportunity to pursue his\n\nineffective-assistance            claims    in    a    collateral      proceeding\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n                                 I.     BACKGROUND\n\n       On   October       19,    2005,     two    masked     men     robbed       the\n\nBellwether Credit Union in Manchester, New Hampshire.                             The\n\nmen entered the credit union armed with guns, ordered the\n\ntellers to give them cash, and then drove away in a stolen\n\nCadillac.      The men got away with approximately $18,500.\n\n       Several months later, a grand jury indicted Huard on\n\nthree charges stemming from this robbery: 1) conspiracy to\n\ncommit      bank    robbery,     in     violation      of   18    U.S.C.    §    371;\n\n2) bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a); and\n\n3) using and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a crime\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 2 -\n\fof violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). 1\n\nFollowing a three-day trial, a jury convicted Huard of all\n\nthree charges.\n\n    A week later, Huard, acting pro se, filed an “Emergency\n\n\n    1\n     18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n“Whoever enters or attempts to enter any bank . . . with the\nintent to commit in such bank . . . any felony affecting\nsuch bank . . . and in violation of any statute of the\nUnited States, or any larceny—Shall be fined under this\ntitle or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.”\n\n    18 U.S.C. § 371, in relevant part, provides that,\n\n    [i]f two or more persons conspire either to commit\n    any offense against the United States, or to\n    defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in\n    any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of\n    such persons do any act to effect the object of the\n    conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or\n    imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nRegarding the weapons charge, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)\nstates:\n\n    Except to the extent that a greater minimum\n    sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection\n    or by any other provision of law, any person who,\n    during and in relation to any crime of violence or\n    drug trafficking crime (including a crime of\n    violence or drug trafficking crime that provides\n    for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use\n    of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for\n    which the person may be prosecuted in a court of\n    the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or\n    who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a\n    firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment for\n    such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime —\n\n             . . . .\n\n         (ii) if the firearm is brandished,     be\n         sentenced to a term of imprisonment    of\n         not less than 7 years.\n\n                           - 3 -\n\fMotion to Appoint New Counsel.”                In support of that motion,\n\nHuard    asserted,    among       other     things,       that    he     had   asked\n\ndefense counsel to investigate and file a motion to suppress\n\nthe gun that officers found when they arrested Huard, but\n\ncounsel failed to do so.                 Defense counsel, on the other\n\nhand, denied that Huard had ever made such a request.                            The\n\ndistrict court granted Huard’s motion for a new attorney.\n\n    Six months later, newly appointed counsel filed a motion\n\nfor a new trial, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 33, arguing Huard’s\n\ntrial    counsel     was    ineffective          for   failing      to    move    to\n\nsuppress    the    gun.       Huard       also    complained       about       trial\n\ncounsel’s failure to object to unduly prejudicial testimony\n\npresented during trial.             The district court denied Huard\n\nrelief    without    addressing          the     merits    of     these    claims,\n\nconcluding   instead       that    the    court    lacked       jurisdiction      to\n\nconsider the new trial motion because it was untimely.                            In\n\ndenying Huard relief, the district court noted that Huard’s\n\n“remedy,     if      any,     on      his        claims      of        ineffective\n\nassistance . . . lies on direct review, or collateral review\n\npursuant to a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.”\n\n(D. Ct. doc. 81 at 6 (footnote omitted).)                   The court further\n\nnoted, however, that “[i]t is almost a universal rule that\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claims cannot be raised\n\nfor the first time on direct review because, invariably, a\n\n\n                                     - 4 -\n\ffactual       record     must     be       fully    developed,”   but     that\n\n“[e]xceptions are made on occasion, . . . if the court of\n\nappeals concludes that the record on appeal is sufficiently\n\ndeveloped to warrant consideration of the issue.”                      (Id. at\n\n6 n.1.)\n\n      The district court then sentenced Huard to 360 months\n\nin prison.         Huard filed a timely notice of appeal from “the\n\njudgment of conviction and sentence.”                    (D. Ct. Doc. 99.)\n\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i).\n\n                                II.    DISCUSSION\n\n      On appeal, Huard argues only that his convictions are\n\nthe result of trial counsel’s constitutionally ineffective\n\nrepresentation. 2        Huard specifically complains that counsel\n\nfailed to move to suppress the gun, as well as evidence of\n\nHuard’s other bad acts seized at the time of Huard’s arrest,\n\nand       failed    to   object       to   the     introduction   of    unduly\n\nprejudicial testimony.\n\n      A defendant can assert ineffective-assistance claims for\n\nthe first time in a collateral motion made under 28 U.S.C.\n\n\n      2\n     The motion for new trial was untimely and the district\ncourt declined to consider it because it was untimely.\nThere is no error in that ruling. Nor does Huard on appeal\nargue that his motion for new trial was timely. His appeal\nis clearly directed at the merits of his conviction and\naccordingly we treat the appeal as one challenging his\nconviction and sentence, rather than as an appeal of the\ndistrict court’s denial of his untimely motion for new\ntrial.\n\n                                       - 5 -\n\f§ 2255 and, in fact, that is the preferred procedure.                                        See\n\nMassaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 509 (2003);\n\nsee also United States v. Wyatt, 561 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert denied, 129 S. Ct. 2818 (2009).                        One reason for this is\n\nto provide an opportunity for the parties to develop the\n\nfactual record necessary to resolve such claims.                                  See United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 457 F.3d 109, 117 (1st Cir. 2006); see\n\nalso Massaro, 538 U.S. at 504-06.                               Another reason is to\n\npermit            the         district            court          to         address          an\n\nineffective-assistance claim in the first instance, because\n\n“an        appellate       court       is        ill-equipped          to     handle         the\n\nfact-specific inquiry that such claims often require” and\n\n“the       insights      of    the   trier,       who    has     seen      and    heard      the\n\nwitnesses         at    first   hand    and       watched       the    dynamics         of   the\n\ntrial       unfold,      are    often       of    great     assistance.” 3              United\n\nStates       v.   Ofray-Campos,         534       F.3d     1,    34   (1st       Cir.    2008)\n\n(quotation         omitted),         cert.       denied,    129       S.    Ct.    588,      999\n\n(2009); see Massaro, 538 U.S. at 504-05.\n\n       Only in rare cases, where the trial record is already\n\nsufficient to resolve an ineffective-assistance claim, will\n\nwe consider that claim on direct appeal.                                   See Wyatt, 561\n\n\n       3\n     Huard points out that he did present most of these\nineffective-assistance claims to the district court in his\nnew trial motion.   But, because that motion was untimely,\nthe district court did not address the merits of these\nclaims.\n\n                                             - 6 -\n\fF.3d    at       52     (noting      exception     when     “trial      counsel’s\n\nineffectiveness is manifestly apparent from the record”);\n\nOfray-Campos,           534   F.3d    at   34    (noting     that,    “[i]n     the\n\nexceptional case, . . . where the record is sufficiently\n\ndeveloped,        and    critical     facts     are   not   in   dispute,     such\n\nclaims may be reviewed” on direct appeal).                        Huard argues\n\nthat his is such a case.              We disagree.\n\n       To prevail on a claim of ineffective representation,\n\nHuard must show both that his trial attorney’s performance\n\nwas deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced\n\nHuard’s defense.              See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n\n668, 887 (1984).          Part of the deficient-performance prong of\n\nthat    test      requires        consideration       of    whether     counsel’s\n\nchallenged actions were part of a reasonable strategy.                          See\n\nMassaro, 538 U.S. at 505; see also Yarborough v. Gentry, 540\n\nU.S.    1,   8    (2003)      (per   curiam);     Strickland,     466    U.S.    at\n\n690-91.\n\n       In support of his ineffective-assistance claims, Huard\n\nsubmits the affidavit of his trial attorney, who attests\n\nthat he simply missed the grounds that would have supported\n\na suppression motion because he misread the police report.\n\nBut in that same affidavit, trial counsel also asserts that,\n\n       [t]o the extent I considered a Fourth Amendment\n       challenge at all, I believed that it was possible\n       that federal authorities in Boston could bring\n       felon-in-possession charges against Mr. Huard, in\n\n                                        - 7 -\n\f       addition to the charges already pending against him\n       in New Hampshire. I felt that it would be better\n       to bring a motion to suppress in a Massachusetts\n       case, were one to be charged, because the chances\n       of prevailing on such a motion was [sic] greater in\n       Boston than in New Hampshire.\n\n(D.     Ct.     doc.     67,     attachment.)                  This         suggests,      in\n\ncontradiction of the first part of the affidavit, that trial\n\ncounsel may have had a strategic reason not to file a motion\n\nto suppress in Huard’s New Hampshire case.                             At any rate, we\n\ncannot say, based upon this affidavit alone, that it “is\n\nmanifestly apparent from the record” that defense counsel’s\n\nperformance was constitutionally deficient.                            Wyatt, 561 F.3d\n\nat 52.\n\n       Although perhaps a more minor point, the parties also\n\ndispute       whether    Huard       ever    asked       his        trial    attorney      to\n\ninvestigate and file a motion to suppress the gun.                                     Huard\n\nsays he did, but defense counsel denies it.                                  This dispute\n\nmay not be dispositive because, depending upon the obvious\n\nmerit    or     lack    of     merit    of    the    motion           to    suppress      and\n\ndepending upon the strategies involved, counsel may (or may\n\nnot)    have    had     an    independent        duty         to    file     a   motion    to\n\nsuppress on behalf of his client.\n\n       Moreover,       there    is     nothing      in    the       current      record    to\n\nsuggest       why   trial     counsel       failed       to    object       to   the   trial\n\ntestimony       that    Huard    now    alleges          was       unduly    prejudicial.\n\nThese    unresolved          factual     issues      further          counsel      against\n\n                                         - 8 -\n\fconsidering Huard’s ineffective-assistance claims now, on\n\ndirect appeal. 4          See Wyatt, 561 F.3d at 52; United States v.\n\nSanchez-Badillo,           540   F.3d   24,     33    (1st   Cir.   2008),     cert.\n\ndenied, 129 S. Ct. 953 (2009).\n\n      Even    if    Huard    were   able      to     establish    his   attorney’s\n\ndeficient performance on the record as it now exists, we\n\nwould still conclude that it would be best for the district\n\ncourt to consider, in the first instance, whether any of\n\ntrial counsel’s purported errors prejudiced Huard’s defense.\n\nSee Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d at 34 (noting that “it is the\n\ntrial court, rather than the appellate court, that is in the\n\nbest position to assess whether” counsel’s performance, “if\n\nit   was     in    fact    constitutionally           deficient,     resulted     in\n\nprejudice to [Huard’s] substantial rights, as required under\n\nStrickland”); see also United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401,\n\n410 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n      During oral argument and again in a later Fed. R. App.\n\nP.   28(j)    letter,       Huard   suggests         that,   in   light   of   these\n\n\n\n      4\n     Huard   argues  that   because  the   Government  never\nasserted, in defense of his new trial motion, that further\nfactual development was necessary, the Government has now\nwaived any such argument.    It is true that, in defending\nagainst Huard’s new trial motion, the Government focused\nonly on rebutting his Fourth Amendment arguments challenging\nthe legality of the discovery and seizure of the handgun.\nBut that does not change the fact that we do not have an\nadequate record on which to consider the merits of Huard’s\nineffective-assistance claims.\n\n                                        - 9 -\n\funresolved factual disputes, this court should remand this\n\ncase to the district court at this juncture.                    At one point\n\nin its brief, the Government seems to agree.                     Although an\n\nappellate       court   has    authority       to    do   so    “in    special\n\ncircumstances,” United States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d 511,\n\n531 (1st Cir. 2005), we decline to exercise that authority\n\nhere.\n\n                              III.   CONCLUSION\n\n    For     these   reasons,     then,    we   decline     to   address       the\n\nmerits of Huard’s ineffective-assistance claims on direct\n\nappeal    and   conclude,     instead,    that      “if   [Huard]     wants    to\n\nraise these claims, he must do so on collateral review.”\n\nUnited States v. Silva, 554 F.3d 13, 23 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nTherefore, we DISMISS Huard’s ineffective-assistance claims\n\nwithout prejudice to his reasserting them in a collateral\n\nproceeding under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, see Ofray-Campos, 534\n\nF.3d at 34, and AFFIRM Huard’s convictions on direct review,\n\nsee United States v. Hicks, 531 F.3d 49, 56 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 590 (2008).\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\f",

In this direct criminal appeal,\n\nDefendant-Appellant             Steve     Huard       challenges      his       three\n\nconvictions stemming from a bank robbery.                          Huard asserts\n\nonly    that       his   trial   attorney        provided        constitutionally\n\nineffective representation.               A criminal defendant, however,\n\ngenerally cannot bring an ineffective-assistance claim on\n\ndirect appeal absent extraordinary circumstances.                       And Huard\n\nhas failed to establish such circumstances here.                       Therefore,\n\nhaving jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we AFFIRM\n\nhis convictions, leaving Huard the opportunity to pursue his\n\nineffective-assistance            claims    in    a    collateral      proceeding\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n                                 I.     BACKGROUND\n\n       On   October       19,    2005,     two    masked     men     robbed       the\n\nBellwether Credit Union in Manchester, New Hampshire.                             The\n\nmen entered the credit union armed with guns, ordered the\n\ntellers to give them cash, and then drove away in a stolen\n\nCadillac.      The men got away with approximately $18,500.\n\n       Several months later, a grand jury indicted Huard on\n\nthree charges stemming from this robbery: 1) conspiracy to\n\ncommit      bank    robbery,     in     violation      of   18    U.S.C.    §    371;\n\n2) bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a); and\n\n3) using and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a crime\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 2 -\n\fof violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). 1\n\nFollowing a three-day trial, a jury convicted Huard of all\n\nthree charges.\n\n    A week later, Huard, acting pro se, filed an “Emergency\n\n\n    1\n     18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n“Whoever enters or attempts to enter any bank . . . with the\nintent to commit in such bank . . . any felony affecting\nsuch bank . . . and in violation of any statute of the\nUnited States, or any larceny—Shall be fined under this\ntitle or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.”\n\n    18 U.S.C. § 371, in relevant part, provides that,\n\n    [i]f two or more persons conspire either to commit\n    any offense against the United States, or to\n    defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in\n    any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of\n    such persons do any act to effect the object of the\n    conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or\n    imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nRegarding the weapons charge, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)\nstates:\n\n    Except to the extent that a greater minimum\n    sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection\n    or by any other provision of law, any person who,\n    during and in relation to any crime of violence or\n    drug trafficking crime (including a crime of\n    violence or drug trafficking crime that provides\n    for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use\n    of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for\n    which the person may be prosecuted in a court of\n    the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or\n    who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a\n    firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment for\n    such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime —\n\n             . . . .\n\n         (ii) if the firearm is brandished,     be\n         sentenced to a term of imprisonment    of\n         not less than 7 years.\n\n                           - 3 -\n\fMotion to Appoint New Counsel.”                In support of that motion,\n\nHuard    asserted,    among       other     things,       that    he     had   asked\n\ndefense counsel to investigate and file a motion to suppress\n\nthe gun that officers found when they arrested Huard, but\n\ncounsel failed to do so.                 Defense counsel, on the other\n\nhand, denied that Huard had ever made such a request.                            The\n\ndistrict court granted Huard’s motion for a new attorney.\n\n    Six months later, newly appointed counsel filed a motion\n\nfor a new trial, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 33, arguing Huard’s\n\ntrial    counsel     was    ineffective          for   failing      to    move    to\n\nsuppress    the    gun.       Huard       also    complained       about       trial\n\ncounsel’s failure to object to unduly prejudicial testimony\n\npresented during trial.             The district court denied Huard\n\nrelief    without    addressing          the     merits    of     these    claims,\n\nconcluding   instead       that    the    court    lacked       jurisdiction      to\n\nconsider the new trial motion because it was untimely.                            In\n\ndenying Huard relief, the district court noted that Huard’s\n\n“remedy,     if      any,     on      his        claims      of        ineffective\n\nassistance . . . lies on direct review, or collateral review\n\npursuant to a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.”\n\n(D. Ct. doc. 81 at 6 (footnote omitted).)                   The court further\n\nnoted, however, that “[i]t is almost a universal rule that\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claims cannot be raised\n\nfor the first time on direct review because, invariably, a\n\n\n                                     - 4 -\n\ffactual       record     must     be       fully    developed,”   but     that\n\n“[e]xceptions are made on occasion, . . . if the court of\n\nappeals concludes that the record on appeal is sufficiently\n\ndeveloped to warrant consideration of the issue.”                      (Id. at\n\n6 n.1.)\n\n      The district court then sentenced Huard to 360 months\n\nin prison.         Huard filed a timely notice of appeal from “the\n\njudgment of conviction and sentence.”                    (D. Ct. Doc. 99.)\n\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i).\n\n                                II.    DISCUSSION\n\n      On appeal, Huard argues only that his convictions are\n\nthe result of trial counsel’s constitutionally ineffective\n\nrepresentation. 2        Huard specifically complains that counsel\n\nfailed to move to suppress the gun, as well as evidence of\n\nHuard’s other bad acts seized at the time of Huard’s arrest,\n\nand       failed    to   object       to   the     introduction   of    unduly\n\nprejudicial testimony.\n\n      A defendant can assert ineffective-assistance claims for\n\nthe first time in a collateral motion made under 28 U.S.C.\n\n\n      2\n     The motion for new trial was untimely and the district\ncourt declined to consider it because it was untimely.\nThere is no error in that ruling. Nor does Huard on appeal\nargue that his motion for new trial was timely. His appeal\nis clearly directed at the merits of his conviction and\naccordingly we treat the appeal as one challenging his\nconviction and sentence, rather than as an appeal of the\ndistrict court’s denial of his untimely motion for new\ntrial.\n\n                                       - 5 -\n\f§ 2255 and, in fact, that is the preferred procedure.

See Wyatt, 561\n\n\n       3\n     Huard points out that he did present most of these\nineffective-assistance claims to the district court in his\nnew trial motion.   But, because that motion was untimely,\nthe district court did not address the merits of these\nclaims.\n\n                                             - 6 -\n\fF.3d    at       52     (noting      exception     when     “trial      counsel’s\n\nineffectiveness is manifestly apparent from the record”);\n\nOfray-Campos,           534   F.3d    at   34    (noting     that,    “[i]n     the\n\nexceptional case, . . . where the record is sufficiently\n\ndeveloped,        and    critical     facts     are   not   in   dispute,     such\n\nclaims may be reviewed” on direct appeal).                        Huard argues\n\nthat his is such a case.              We disagree.\n\n       To prevail on a claim of ineffective representation,\n\nHuard must show both that his trial attorney’s performance\n\nwas deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced\n\nHuard’s defense.              See Strickland v.

Part of the deficient-performance prong of\n\nthat    test      requires        consideration       of    whether     counsel’s\n\nchallenged actions were part of a reasonable strategy.

Gentry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131143\"><a href=\"/opinion/131143/yarborough-v-gentry/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>    <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   8    (2003)      (per   curiam);     Strickland,     466    U.S.    at\n\n690-91.\n\n       In support of his ineffective-assistance claims, Huard\n\nsubmits the affidavit of his trial attorney, who attests\n\nthat he simply missed the grounds that would have supported\n\na suppression motion because he misread the police report.\n\nBut in that same affidavit, trial counsel also asserts that,\n\n       [t]o the extent I considered a Fourth Amendment\n       challenge at all, I believed that it was possible\n       that federal authorities in Boston could bring\n       felon-in-possession charges against Mr. Huard, in\n\n                                        - 7 -\n\f       addition to the charges already pending against him\n       in New Hampshire. I felt that it would be better\n       to bring a motion to suppress in a Massachusetts\n       case, were one to be charged, because the chances\n       of prevailing on such a motion was [sic] greater in\n       Boston than in New Hampshire.\n\n(D.     Ct.     doc.     67,     attachment.)                  This         suggests,      in\n\ncontradiction of the first part of the affidavit, that trial\n\ncounsel may have had a strategic reason not to file a motion\n\nto suppress in Huard’s New Hampshire case.                             At any rate, we\n\ncannot say, based upon this affidavit alone, that it “is\n\nmanifestly apparent from the record” that defense counsel’s\n\nperformance was constitutionally deficient.                            Wyatt, 561 F.3d\n\nat 52.\n\n       Although perhaps a more minor point, the parties also\n\ndispute       whether    Huard       ever    asked       his        trial    attorney      to\n\ninvestigate and file a motion to suppress the gun.                                     Huard\n\nsays he did, but defense counsel denies it.                                  This dispute\n\nmay not be dispositive because, depending upon the obvious\n\nmerit    or     lack    of     merit    of    the    motion           to    suppress      and\n\ndepending upon the strategies involved, counsel may (or may\n\nnot)    have    had     an    independent        duty         to    file     a   motion    to\n\nsuppress on behalf of his client.\n\n       Moreover,       there    is     nothing      in    the       current      record    to\n\nsuggest       why   trial     counsel       failed       to    object       to   the   trial\n\ntestimony       that    Huard    now    alleges          was       unduly    prejudicial.\n\nThese    unresolved          factual     issues      further          counsel      against\n\n                                         - 8 -\n\fconsidering Huard’s ineffective-assistance claims now, on\n\ndirect appeal. 4          See Wyatt, 561 F.3d at 52; United States v.\n\nSanchez-Badillo,           </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203454\"><a href=\"/opinion/203454/united-states-v-sanchez-badillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,     33    (1st   Cir.   2008),     cert.\n\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
