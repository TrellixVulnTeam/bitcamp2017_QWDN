We    affirm      because          Diaz-Romero's        status   as    a\n\ncommissioned officer of the Public Health Service (\"PHS\") bars his\n\nsuit for service connected injuries.\n\n                                    I.    Facts\n\n          Because      the   complaint         was    resolved      on    a   motion    to\n\ndismiss, the facts are set forth as alleged in the complaint and\n\ninferences taken in the light most favorable to Diaz-Romero, the\n\nnon-moving party.     Rodriguez-Ortiz v. Margo Caribe, Inc., 490 F.3d\n\n92, 94 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          Wilfredo Diaz-Romero was a commissioned officer with the\n\nPHS, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nLike the armed service branches, the PHS is a \"uniformed service\"\n\nof the United States.        42 U.S.C. § 201(p).           While serving with the\n\nPHS, Diaz-Romero was assigned to the Federal Bureau of Prisons'\n\n(\"BOP\") Metropolitan Detention Center in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico as\n\n\"Clinical Director.\"\n\n          The   PHS    and    the   BOP    have       a   detailed       Memorandum     of\n\nUnderstanding   (\"MOU\")       in    place       that      governs        conditions     of\n\nemployment for PHS officers placed with the BOP.1                        In particular,\n\n\n1\n  The MOU was filed as an exhibit to the government's motion to\ndismiss. We are permitted to rely on this document in resolving\nthe jurisdictional question. See Gonzalez v. United States, 284\nF.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir. 2002); Aversa v. United States, 99 F.3d\n1200, 1210 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthe MOU establishes both a discipline and evaluation process for\n\ncommissioned officers of the PHS assigned to the BOP.               Diaz-\n\nRomero's role within the PHS and his salary were both outside the\n\nBOP's control.\n\n           During Diaz-Romero's stint with the BOP he was involved\n\nin two incidents.     First, another BOP employee filed a sexual\n\nharassment complaint against him, although an Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity   Commission   investigator     later   concluded   that   the\n\ncomplaint was unfounded. Second, he failed to report to management\n\nthat an inmate greeted him by placing her cheek next to his and\n\n\"throwing\" a kiss to the air.\n\n           Following the second incident Diaz-Romero suffered a\n\nseries of adverse employment actions.       A performance evaluation of\n\nhim was revised downward.    He was also suspended, with pay, from\n\nhis duties as Clinical Director and then demoted to the inferior\n\nposition of \"Medical Officer.\"          Ultimately, both Diaz-Romero's\n\nassignment with the BOP and his commission with the PHS were\n\nterminated.\n\n           These   unfavorable   employment    actions   prompted   Diaz-\n\nRomero, his spouse, and their conjugal partnership, to file this\n\naction.   The suit named the United States Attorney General and the\n\nwarden of the Metropolitan Detention Center in their official\n\ncapacities, as well as several other current and former BOP and PHS\n\nemployees in both their personal and official capacities.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f            Diaz-Romero asserted that he was punished for defending\n\nagainst the sexual harassment claim and not because of the incident\n\nwith the inmate.       He brought a bevy of claims, including claims\n\nunder    Bivens   v.   Six   Unknown   Named    Agents   of   Fed.   Bureau   of\n\nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) and the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671 et seq., alleging that the defendants\n\nengaged in a conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights and\n\ncreated a hostile work environment.              Specifically, Diaz-Romero\n\nclaimed the defendants violated the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\n\nFourteenth Amendments and committed torts under article 1802 of the\n\nPuerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5191.2             He sought\n\nboth       compensatory         and          punitive     damages.\n\n            In dismissing Diaz-Romero's claims for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction, the district court ruled that the FTCA and\n\nBivens claims were barred by the doctrine of Feres v. United\n\nStates, 340 U.S. 135 (1950), which limits suits for injuries\n\narising \"incident to military service.\"             The court noted that,\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 213(f)3, Diaz-Romero was, at all times\n\n\n2\n  Although Diaz-Romero also filed claims pursuant to Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), and 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, and 1986, he does not appeal the district\ncourt's resolution of those claims.\n3\n    This statute reads:\n\n            Active service of commissioned officers of the [Public\n            Health] Service shall be deemed to be active military\n            service in the Armed Forces of the United States for\n            purposes of all laws related to discrimination on the\n\n                                       -5-\n\frelevant to the complaint, deemed to be in active military service\n\nin the Armed Forces.     Because Diaz-Romero was in active service in\n\nthe Armed Forces at the time of his injuries, the court reasoned,\n\nthe injuries he suffered were \"incident to military service\" and\n\nthus triggered the Feres doctrine's bar.\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\n           Diaz-Romero appeals the district court's dismissal of his\n\nFTCA4 and Bivens claims, contending that the court erroneously\n\nrelied on the Feres doctrine.        We review a dismissal for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Feres doctrine de novo.\n\nSee Day v. Mass. Air Nat'l Guard, 167 F.3d 678, 681 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n                             A.    FTCA claims\n\n           The United States has consented, in the FTCA, to be sued\n\nfor   damages   for   personal    injury   caused   by   \"the   negligent   or\n\n\n           basis of race, color, sex, ethnicity, age, religion,\n           and disability.\n4\n  Diaz-Romero identifies three torts under Puerto Rico law that\nunderlie his FTCA claims: (1) abuse of process; (2) intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress; and (3) hostile workplace\nenvironment. Although the district court did not examine his\ntort claims in any detail, and instead dismissed the case on\njurisdictional grounds, we note that Diaz-Romero only alleges one\ntort claim that we conclude is clearly colorable under the FTCA\nand Puerto Rico law - intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress. The tort of abuse of process is specifically excepted\nfrom the FTCA. See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h). Moreover, although\nDiaz-Romero asserts that Puerto Rico law recognizes the tort of\nhostile workplace environment, he fails to provide any case law\nin support of his contention.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwrongful act or omission\" of a federal employee \"while acting\n\nwithin     the    scope    of    his   employment,\"     if     under   the   same\n\ncircumstances a private employer would be liable for the acts of\n\nhis employee under the local law.              28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2674,\n\n2675(a).    The Feres doctrine is a judicially crafted exception to\n\nthe FTCA.        See Feres, 340 U.S. at 135; Day 167 F.3d at 681.             It\n\nbars military service members from bringing FTCA suits against the\n\nUnited States for injuries that \"arise out of or are in the course\n\nof activity incident to service.\"              See Feres, 340 U.S. at 146.\n\nCourts have identified a number of justifications for the doctrine.\n\nOne of the most often cited justifications is that, absent the\n\nFeres doctrine, the judiciary would become ensnared in \"sensitive\n\nmilitary    affairs       at   the   expense   of   military    discipline   and\n\neffectiveness.\"       See United States v. Johnson, 481 U.S. 681, 690\n\n(1987)(quoting United States v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 59 (1985));\n\nsee also Day 167 F.3d at 682 (noting the Supreme Court's emphasis\n\non the doctrine's purpose of avoiding undue judicial interference\n\nin military discipline and \"grievance matters\").\n\n            Although we have not previously explicitly held that the\n\nFeres doctrine applies to commissioned officers in the PHS, Diaz-\n\nRomero does not contest the doctrine's general applicability to\n\nmembers of the PHS.            We conclude that Feres applies to the PHS.\n\nThe similarities and relation between the armed service branches\n\nand the PHS merit the Feres doctrine's extension to health service\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fofficers.     The PHS is, along with the armed service branches,\n\ndesignated as a uniformed service of the United States.       42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 201(p).    It is organized along military lines, each commissioned\n\nofficer grade having a statutorily stated military rank equivalent.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 207.        Commissioned officers of the PHS, or their\n\nsurviving beneficiaries, are entitled to many of the same statutory\n\nrights,     benefits,   privileges,     and   immunities   provided   to\n\ncommissioned officers of the United States Army or their surviving\n\nbeneficiaries, 42 U.S.C. § 213a(a), and PHS regulations specify\n\nthat failure to follow the orders of superior officers will result\n\nin disciplinary action.        Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual,\n\nChapter CC46, Subchapter CC46.4.      Importantly, in times of war or\n\nemergency the President may transform the PHS into a regular branch\n\nof the armed services, subject to the Uniform Code of Military\n\nJustice.    42 U.S.C. § 217.   It is not surprising then, that other\n\ncircuits considering this question have concluded that the Feres\n\ndoctrine applies to commissioned officers in the PHS. See Scheppan\n\nv. United States, 810 F.2d 461, 463 (4th Cir. 1987); Alexander v.\n\nUnited States, 500 F.2d 1, 4 (8th Cir. 1974); see also Levin v.\n\nUnited States, 403 F. Supp. 99, 103 (D. Mass. 1975)(\"There is no\n\nreasonable way, in law or logic, to distinguish the position of the\n\nPHS officer from that of the military man, for purposes of tort\n\nsuits.\").    We join the other circuits.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f           Even though the Feres doctrine applies to Diaz-Romero as\n\na health officer, there is an additional question that must be\n\nanswered in order to determine whether the doctrine bars his tort\n\nclaims.    That question is whether the injuries he suffered were\n\n\"incident to service.\"    As we have noted, determining whether an\n\ninjury was incident to service involves\n\n          asking whether it occurred on a military\n          facility, whether it arose out of military\n          activities or at least military life, whether\n          the alleged perpetrators were superiors or at\n          least acting in cooperation with the military,\n          and--often stressed as particularly important,\n          whether the injured party was himself in some\n          fashion on military service at the time of the\n          incident. No single element in the equation,\n          the Supreme Court has said, is decisive.\nDay, 167 F.3d at 682 (internal citation omitted).\n\n           Here, the incidents that are alleged to have caused Diaz-\n\nRomero's injuries occurred while Diaz-Romero was actively serving\n\nin his PHS assigned post with the BOP.        Specifically, Diaz-Romero\n\nclaims that supervisors injured him by applying BOP regulations\n\nagainst him.   See Chatman v. Hernandez, 805 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.\n\n1986) (concluding injury was incident to service because, among\n\nother things, \"[a]t the time of alleged wrongs in this case,\n\nappellant was in fact a serviceman on active duty.\"); see also\n\nLevin, 403 F. Supp. at 103 (noting plaintiff's injuries were\n\n\"clearly   'service   connected'\"    where   harassment   on   job   caused\n\nplaintiff, a commissioned officer in the PHS, to commit suicide).\n\nMoreover, the alleged perpetrators in this case, Diaz-Romero's\n\n                                    -9-\n\fsupervisors at the BOP, were acting in cooperation with the PHS, in\n\nthat the PHS placed Diaz-Romero with the BOP and that the BOP's\n\ncontrol over Diaz-Romero was subject to the MOU between the PHS and\n\nthe BOP.\n\n            Diaz-Romero argues that his injuries were not incident to\n\nservice because his service with the BOP was not like military\n\nservice.    He notes that the BOP is guided by civilian objectives\n\nand principles and that the defendants did not act pursuant to\n\nmilitary commands. Consequently, his thesis runs, one of the Feres\n\ndoctrine's primary purposes, preventing judicial involvement in\n\nsensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline\n\nand effectiveness, would not be served by barring his lawsuit.\n\n            This argument is more properly aimed at the invocation of\n\nFeres in the first place rather than the application of Feres's\n\n\"incident to service\" test to the injuries alleged, and we have\n\nalready determined that the Feres doctrine applies to commissioned\n\nofficers    of    the   PHS.    Put   simply,    the   largely   fact-specific\n\n\"incident    to    service\"    test   is   not   amenable   to   Diaz-Romero's\n\nargument.\n\n            Moreover, the specific point of his argument -- that\n\napplying the Feres doctrine to bar his lawsuit would not serve the\n\npurposes of the doctrine -- also misses the mark.                 As we noted\n\nearlier, one of the purposes of the Feres doctrine is to prevent\n\nthe judiciary from becoming embroiled in sensitive military affairs\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fat the expense of military discipline and effectiveness.                       Because\n\nof   the    similarities       between   the    PHS    and    other   armed    service\n\nbranches, courts have noted that barring tort suits by commissioned\n\nofficers of the PHS for service-related injuries serves this same\n\npurpose.      See Alexander, 500 F.2d at 4 (\"[The similarities] to\n\nmilitary     service     illustrate      how    the    concern   voiced    in    Feres\n\nregarding the effect of tort suits on discipline and internal\n\nstructure      appl[ies]       with   equal     force    to    the    Public    Health\n\nService.\"); see also Levin, 403 F. Supp. at 103 (rejecting as\n\n\"invalid\" plaintiff's assertion that disciplinary concerns were of\n\nminimal importance in the PHS).\n\n              It   is   not    difficult   to    see    how    the    discipline    and\n\neffectiveness purpose of the Feres doctrine is served by barring\n\nDiaz-Romero's action. Diaz-Romero claims that he suffered a number\n\nof injuries while serving with the BOP.                  These injuries include:\n\n(1) a demotion from Clinical Director to Medical Officer; (2)\n\neventual termination of his commission; and (3) injuries stemming\n\nfrom the BOP's evaluation process.              He claims that the defendants'\n\napplication of BOP regulations caused his injuries.\n\n              Forming an intrinsic part of these regulations is the MOU\n\nbetween the BOP and the PHS.               In the MOU, the PHS and the BOP\n\ncreated an internal structure to deal with disciplinary actions\n\ntaken      against   PHS      officers   and    the    BOP's   evaluation      of   PHS\n\nofficers.      For example:        (1) The PHS must exercise professional\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\foversight of PHS commissioned officers assigned to the BOP; (2) the\n\nBOP is tasked with advising the PHS of disciplinary actions taken\n\nagainst PHS commissioned officers; (3) the PHS is ultimately\n\nresponsible for actions taken against PHS commissioned officers\n\nwith respect to substandard performance or misconduct; and (4) all\n\nevaluations of PHS officers must be completed in accordance with\n\nPHS   procedures.       Unquestionably,      Diaz-Romero's   lawsuit      would\n\nrequire    judicial     inquiry   into      the   disciplinary   scheme       and\n\nevaluation procedures set forth in the MOU.           Such an inquiry would\n\nfrustrate the Feres doctrine's purpose of avoiding interference\n\nwith disciplinary schemes implemented by the uniformed services, in\n\nthis case those of the PHS.\n\n                             B. Bivens claims\n\n           In addition to his claims under the FTCA, Diaz-Romero\n\nsued his federal supervisors under Bivens in both their official\n\nand individual capacities.        These claims require only the briefest\n\ntreatment.    The Feres doctrine applies with equal force to bar\n\nBivens suits if the suits are based on injuries that \"arise out of\n\nor are in the course of activity incident to service.\"            See Wright\n\nv. Park, 5 F.3d 586, 590 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669 (1987) \"makes\n\npellucid   that   the    exception    to    Bivens   liability   .   .    .   is\n\ncoextensive with the exception to tort liability established by\n\nFeres and its progeny\"). We have already concluded that Feres bars\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fDiaz-Romero's FTCA claims; it necessarily follows that his Bivens\n\nclaims, based on the same events that gave rise to his FTCA claims,\n\nare barred as well.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

Margo Caribe, Inc.,</i> 490 F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Wilfredo Diaz-Romero was a commissioned officer with the PHS, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. Like the armed service branches, the PHS is a \"uniformed service\" of the United States. 42 U.S.C. § 201(p). While <span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> serving with the PHS, Diaz-Romero was assigned to the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (\"BOP\") Metropolitan Detention Center in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico as \"Clinical Director.\"</p>\n<p>The PHS and the BOP have a detailed Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") in place that governs conditions of employment for PHS officers placed with the BOP.<sup>[1]</sup> In particular, the MOU establishes both a discipline and evaluation process for commissioned officers of the PHS assigned to the BOP. Diaz-Romero's role within the PHS and his salary were both outside the BOP's control.</p>\n<p>During Diaz-Romero's stint with the BOP he was involved in two incidents. First, another BOP employee filed a sexual harassment complaint against him, although an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigator later concluded that the complaint was unfounded. Second, he failed to report to management that an inmate greeted him by placing her cheek next to his and \"throwing\" a kiss to the air.</p>\n<p>Following the second incident Diaz-Romero suffered a series of adverse employment actions. A performance evaluation of him was revised downward. He was also suspended, with pay, from his duties as Clinical Director and then demoted to the inferior position of \"Medical Officer.\" Ultimately, both Diaz-Romero's assignment with the BOP and his commission with the PHS were terminated.</p>\n<p>These unfavorable employment actions prompted Diaz-Romero, his spouse, and their conjugal partnership, to file this action. The suit named the United States Attorney General and the warden of the Metropolitan Detention Center in their official capacities, as well as several other current and former BOP and PHS employees in both their personal and official capacities.</p>\n<p>Diaz-Romero asserted that he was punished for defending against the sexual harassment claim and not because of the incident with the inmate. He brought a bevy of claims, including claims under <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) and the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671 <i>et seq.,</i> alleging that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights and created a hostile work environment. Specifically, Diaz-Romero claimed the defendants violated the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments and committed torts under article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5191.<sup>[2]</sup> He sought both compensatory and punitive, damages.</p>\n<p>In dismissing Diaz-Romero's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the district court ruled that the FTCA and <i>Biyens</i> claims were barred by the doctrine of <i>Feres v. United States,</i> 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), which limits suits for injuries arising \"incident to military service.\" The court noted that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 213(f)<sup>[3]</sup>, Diaz-Romero <span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> was, at all times relevant to the complaint, deemed to be in active military service in the Armed Forces. Because Diaz-Romero was in active service in the Armed Forces at the time of his injuries, the court reasoned, the injuries he suffered were \"incident to military service\" and thus triggered the <i>Feres</i> doctrine's bar.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II Discussion</h2>\n<p>Diaz-Romero appeals the district court's dismissal of his FTCA<sup>[4]</sup> and <i>Bivens</i> claims, contending that the court erroneously relied on the <i>Feres</i> doctrine. We review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <i>Feres</i> doctrine de novo. <i>See </i><i>Day v. Mass. Air Nat'l Guard,</i> 167 F.3d 678, 681 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. FTCA claims</h2>\n<p>The United States has consented, in the FTCA, to be sued for damages for personal injury caused by \"the negligent or wrongful act or omission\" of a federal employee \"while acting within the scope of his employment,\" if under the same circumstances a private employer would be liable for the acts of his employee under the local law. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2674, 2675(a). The <i>Feres</i> doctrine is a judicially crafted exception to the FTCA. <i>See </i><i>Feres,</i> 340 U.S. at 135, 71 S.Ct. 153; Day 167 F.3d at 681. It bars military service members from bringing FTCA suits against the United States for injuries that \"arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\" <i>See </i><i>Feres,</i> 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. 153. Courts have identified a number of justifications for the doctrine. One of the most often cited justifications is that, absent the <i>Feres</i> doctrine, the judiciary would become ensnared in \"sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 481 U.S. 681, 690, 107 S.Ct. 2063, 95 L.Ed.2d 648 (1987)(quoting <i>United States v. Shearer,</i> 473 U.S. 52, 59, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985)); <i>see also </i><i>Day</i> 167 F.3d at 682 (noting the Supreme Court's emphasis on the doctrine's purpose of avoiding undue judicial interference in military discipline and \"grievance matters\").</p>\n<p>Although we have not previously explicitly held that the <i>Feres</i> doctrine applies to commissioned officers in the PHS, Diaz-Romero does not contest the doctrine's general applicability to members of the PHS. We conclude that <i>Feres</i> applies to the PHS. The similarities and relation between the armed service branches and the PHS merit the <i>Feres</i> doctrine's extension to health service officers. The PHS is, along with the armed service branches, designated as a uniformed service of the United States. 42 U.S.C. § 201(p). It is organized along military lines, each commissioned officer grade having a statutorily stated military rank equivalent. 42 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> U.S.C. § 207. Commissioned officers of the PHS, or their surviving beneficiaries, are entitled to many of the same statutory rights, benefits, privileges, and immunities provided to commissioned officers of the United States Army or their surviving beneficiaries, 42 U.S.C. § 213a(a), and PHS regulations specify that failure to follow the orders of superior officers will result in disciplinary action. Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual, Chapter CC46, Subchapter CC46.4. Importantly, in times of war or, emergency the President may transform the PHS into a regular branch of the armed services, subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 42 U.S.C. § 217. It is not surprising then, that other circuits considering this question have concluded that the <i>Feres</i> doctrine applies to commissioned officers in the PHS. <i>See </i><i>Scheppan v. United States,</i> 810 F.2d 461, 463 (4th Cir.1987); <i>Alexander v. United States,</i> 500 F.2d 1, 4 (8th Cir.1974); <i>see also </i><i>Levin v. United States,</i> 403 F.Supp. 99, 103 (D.Mass.1975)(\"There is no reasonable way, in law or logic, to distinguish the position of the PHS officer frorthat of the military man, for purposes of tort suits.\"). We join the other circuits.</p>\n<p>Even though the <i>Feres</i> doctrine applies to Diaz-Romero as a health officer, there is an additional question that must be answered in order to determine whether the doctrine bars his tort claims. That question is whether the injuries he suffered were \"incident to service.\" As we have noted, determining whether an injury was incident to service involves</p>\n<blockquote>asking whether it occurred on a military facility, whether it arose out of military activities or at least military life, whether the alleged perpetrators were superiors or at least acting in cooperation with the military, andoften stressed as particularly important, whether the injured party was himself in some fashion on military service at the time of the incident. No single element in the equation, the Supreme Court has said, is decisive.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Day,</i> 167 F.3d at 682 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the incidents that are alleged to have caused Diaz-Romero's injuries occurred while Diaz-Romero was actively serving in his PHS assigned post with the BOP. Specifically, Diaz-Romero claims that supervisors injured him by applying BOP regulations against him. <i>See </i><i>Chatman v. Hernandez,</i> 805 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1986) (concluding injury was incident to service because, among other things, \"[a]t the time of alleged wrongs in this case, appellant was in fact a serviceman on active duty.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Levin,</i> 403 F.Supp. at 103 (noting plaintiffs injuries were \"clearly `service connected'\" where harassment on job caused plaintiff, a commissioned officer in the PHS, to commit suicide). Moreover, the alleged perpetrators in this case, Diaz-Romero's supervisors at the BOP, were acting in cooperation with the PHS, in that the PHS placed Diaz-Romero with the BOP and that the BOP's control over Diaz-Romero was subject to the MOU between the PHS and the BOP.</p>\n<p>Diaz-Romero argues that his injuries were not incident to service because his service with the BOP was not like military service. He notes that the BOP is guided by civilian objectives and principles and that the defendants did not act pursuant to military commands. Consequently, his thesis runs, one of the <i>Feres</i> doctrine's primary purposes, preventing judicial involvement in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness, would not be served by barring his lawsuit.</p>\n<p>This argument is more properly aimed at the invocation of <i>Feres</i> in the first place rather than the application of <i>Feres's</i> \"incident <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> to service\" test to the injuries alleged, and we have already determined that the <i>Feres</i> doctrine applies to commissioned officers of the PHS. Put simply, the largely fact-specific \"incident to service\" test is not amenable to Diaz-Romero's argument.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the specific point of his argumentthat applying the <i>Feres</i> doctrine to bar his lawsuit would not serve the purposes of the doctrinealso misses the mark. As we noted earlier, one of the purposes of the <i>Feres</i> doctrine is to prevent the judiciary from becoming embroiled in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness. Because of the similarities between the PHS and other armed service branches, courts have noted that barring tort suits by commissioned officers of the PHS for service-related injuries serves this same purpose. <i>See </i><i>Alexander</i> 500 F.2d at 4 (\"[The similarities] to military service illustrate how the concern voiced in <i>Feres</i> regarding the effect of tort suits on discipline and internal structure applies] with equal force to the Public Health Service.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Levin,</i> 403 F.Supp. at 103 (rejecting as \"invalid\" plaintiff's assertion that disciplinary concerns were of minimal importance in the PHS).</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to see how the discipline and effectiveness purpose of the <i>Feres</i> doctrine is served by barring Diaz-Romero's action. Diaz-Romero claims that he suffered a number of injuries while serving with the BOP. These injuries include: (1) a demotion from Clinical Director to Medical Officer; (2) eventual termination of his commission; and (3) injuries stemming from the BOP's evaluation process. He claims that the defendants' application of BOP regulations caused his injuries.</p>\n<p>Forming an intrinsic part of these regulations is the MOU between the BOP and the PHS. In the MOU, the PHS and the BOP created an internal structure to deal with disciplinary actions taken against PHS officers and the BOP's evaluation of PHS officers. For example: (1) The PHS must exercise professional oversight of PHS commissioned officers assigned to the BOP; (2) the BOP is tasked with advising the PHS of disciplinary actions taken against PHS commissioned officers; (3) the PHS is ultimately responsible for actions taken against PHS commissioned. officers with respect to substandard performance or misconduct; and (4) all evaluations of PHS officers must be completed in accordance with PHS procedures. Unquestionably, Diaz-Romero's lawsuit would require judicial inquiry into the disciplinary scheme and evaluation procedures set forth in the MOU. Such an inquiry would frustrate the <i>Feres</i> doctrine's purpose of avoiding interference with disciplinary schemes implemented by the uniformed services, in this case those of the PHS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Bivens claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In addition to his claims under the FTCA, Diaz-Romero sued his federal supervisors under <i>Bivens</i> in both their official and individual capacities. These claims require only the briefest treatment. The <i>Feres</i> doctrine applies with equal force to bar <i>Bivens</i> suits if the suits are based on injuries that \"arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\" <i>See </i><i>Wright v. Park,</i> 5 F.3d 586, 590 (1st Cir.1993) (noting Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Stanley,</i> 483 U.S. 669, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987) \"makes pellucid that the exception to <i>Bivens</i> liability . . . is coextensive with the exception to tort liability established by <i>Feres</i> and its progeny\"). We have already concluded that <i>Feres</i> bars Diaz-Romero's FTCA claims; it necessarily follows that his <i>Bivens</i> claims, based on the same <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> events that gave rise to his FTCA claims, are barred as well.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed.

United States,</i> 99 F.3d 1200, 1210 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>[2]  Although Diaz-Romero also filed claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, and 1986; he does not appeal the district court's resolution of those claims.</p>\n<p>[3]  This statute reads:\n</p>\n<p>Active service of commissioned officers of the [Public Health] Service shall be deemed to be active military service in the Armed Forces of the United States for purposes Of all laws related to discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, ethnicity, age, religion, and disability.</p>\n<p>[4]  Diaz-Romero identifies three torts under Puerto Rico law that underlie his FTCA claims: (1) abuse of process; (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (3) hostile workplace environment. Although the district court did not examine his tort claims in any detail, and instead dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, we note that Diaz-Romero only alleges one tort claim that we conclude is clearly colorable under the FTCA and Puerto Rico lawintentional infliction of emotional distress. The tort of abuse of process is specifically excepted from the FTCA. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h). Moreover, although Diaz-Romero asserts that Puerto Rico law recognizes the tort of hostile workplace environment, he fails to provide any case law in support of his contention.</p>\n\n</div>",

United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482498\"><a href=\"/opinion/482498/jeanette-scheppan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 463 (4th Cir.1987); <i>Alexander v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 103 (D.Mass.1975)(\"There is no reasonable way, in law or logic, to distinguish the position of the PHS officer frorthat of the military man, for purposes of tort suits.\"). We join the other circuits.</p>\n<p>Even though the <i>Feres</i> doctrine applies to Diaz-Romero as a health officer, there is an additional question that must be answered in order to determine whether the doctrine bars his tort claims. That question is whether the injuries he suffered were \"incident to service.\" As we have noted, determining whether an injury was incident to service involves</p>\n<blockquote>asking whether it occurred on a military facility, whether it arose out of military activities or at least military life, whether the alleged perpetrators were superiors or at least acting in cooperation with the military, andoften stressed as particularly important, whether the injured party was himself in some fashion on military service at the time of the incident. No single element in the equation, the Supreme Court has said, is decisive.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Day,</i> 167 F.3d at 682 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the incidents that are alleged to have caused Diaz-Romero's injuries occurred while Diaz-Romero was actively serving in his PHS assigned post with the BOP. Specifically, Diaz-Romero claims that supervisors injured him by applying BOP regulations against him. <i>See </i><i>Chatman v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479377\"><a href=\"/opinion/479377/philip-roberts-chatman-jr-v-commodore-de-hernandez-usn/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 457 (1st Cir.1986) (concluding injury was incident to service because, among other things, \"[a]t the time of alleged wrongs in this case, appellant was in fact a serviceman on active duty.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Levin,</i> 403 F.Supp. at 103 (noting plaintiffs injuries were \"clearly `service connected'\" where harassment on job caused plaintiff, a commissioned officer in the PHS, to commit suicide). Moreover, the alleged perpetrators in this case, Diaz-Romero's supervisors at the BOP, were acting in cooperation with the PHS, in that the PHS placed Diaz-Romero with the BOP and that the BOP's control over Diaz-Romero was subject to the MOU between the PHS and the BOP.</p>\n<p>Diaz-Romero argues that his injuries were not incident to service because his service with the BOP was not like military service. He notes that the BOP is guided by civilian objectives and principles and that the defendants did not act pursuant to military commands. Consequently, his thesis runs, one of the <i>Feres</i> doctrine's primary purposes, preventing judicial involvement in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness, would not be served by barring his lawsuit.</p>\n<p>This argument is more properly aimed at the invocation of <i>Feres</i> in the first place rather than the application of <i>Feres's</i> \"incident <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> to service\" test to the injuries alleged, and we have already determined that the <i>Feres</i> doctrine applies to commissioned officers of the PHS. Put simply, the largely fact-specific \"incident to service\" test is not amenable to Diaz-Romero's argument.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the specific point of his argumentthat applying the <i>Feres</i> doctrine to bar his lawsuit would not serve the purposes of the doctrinealso misses the mark. As we noted earlier, one of the purposes of the <i>Feres</i> doctrine is to prevent the judiciary from becoming embroiled in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness. Because of the similarities between the PHS and other armed service branches, courts have noted that barring tort suits by commissioned officers of the PHS for service-related injuries serves this same purpose. <i>See </i><i>Alexander</i> 500 F.2d at 4 (\"[The similarities] to military service illustrate how the concern voiced in <i>Feres</i> regarding the effect of tort suits on discipline and internal structure applies] with equal force to the Public Health Service.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Levin,</i> 403 F.Supp. at 103 (rejecting as \"invalid\" plaintiff's assertion that disciplinary concerns were of minimal importance in the PHS).</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to see how the discipline and effectiveness purpose of the <i>Feres</i> doctrine is served by barring Diaz-Romero's action. Diaz-Romero claims that he suffered a number of injuries while serving with the BOP. These injuries include: (1) a demotion from Clinical Director to Medical Officer; (2) eventual termination of his commission; and (3) injuries stemming from the BOP's evaluation process. He claims that the defendants' application of BOP regulations caused his injuries.</p>\n<p>Forming an intrinsic part of these regulations is the MOU between the BOP and the PHS. In the MOU, the PHS and the BOP created an internal structure to deal with disciplinary actions taken against PHS officers and the BOP's evaluation of PHS officers. For example: (1) The PHS must exercise professional oversight of PHS commissioned officers assigned to the BOP; (2) the BOP is tasked with advising the PHS of disciplinary actions taken against PHS commissioned officers; (3) the PHS is ultimately responsible for actions taken against PHS commissioned. officers with respect to substandard performance or misconduct; and (4) all evaluations of PHS officers must be completed in accordance with PHS procedures. Unquestionably, Diaz-Romero's lawsuit would require judicial inquiry into the disciplinary scheme and evaluation procedures set forth in the MOU. Such an inquiry would frustrate the <i>Feres</i> doctrine's purpose of avoiding interference with disciplinary schemes implemented by the uniformed services, in this case those of the PHS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Bivens claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In addition to his claims under the FTCA, Diaz-Romero sued his federal supervisors under <i>Bivens</i> in both their official and individual capacities. These claims require only the briefest treatment. The <i>Feres</i> doctrine applies with equal force to bar <i>Bivens</i> suits if the suits are based on injuries that \"arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\" <i>See </i><i>Wright v. Park,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194964\"><a href=\"/opinion/194964/wright-v-park/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 590 (1st Cir.1993) (noting Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v.

We have already concluded that <i>Feres</i> bars Diaz-Romero's FTCA claims; it necessarily follows that his <i>Bivens</i> claims, based on the same <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> events that gave rise to his FTCA claims, are barred as well.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed.

Although the district court did not examine his tort claims in any detail, and instead dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, we note that Diaz-Romero only alleges one tort claim that we conclude is clearly colorable under the FTCA and Puerto Rico lawintentional infliction of emotional distress. The tort of abuse of process is specifically excepted from the FTCA. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h). Moreover, although Diaz-Romero asserts that Puerto Rico law recognizes the tort of hostile workplace environment, he fails to provide any case law in support of his contention.</p>\n\n</div>",
