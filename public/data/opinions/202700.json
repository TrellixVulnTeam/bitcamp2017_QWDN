LaChance for appellant.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         April 10, 2007\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Defendant Robert C. Luisi, Jr., an\n\nadmitted member of the \"La Cosa Nostra\" (LCN) crime family, appeals\n\nhis    convictions        on   three     cocaine-related        charges.        These\n\nconvictions stemmed from an FBI investigation that employed a paid\n\ncooperating witness and LCN member, Ronald Previte.\n\n            At trial, Luisi testified and admitted his involvement in\n\nthe    cocaine   transactions.           His     defense    was   entrapment,     on\n\nintertwined theories.             He claimed that Previte, acting for the\n\ngovernment along with undercover FBI agent Michael McGowan, had\n\nimproperly tried to induce him to commit drug crimes.                    He further\n\nclaimed that when he resisted, Previte persuaded Philadelphia LCN\n\nboss Joseph Merlino to order Luisi to engage in the charged drug\n\ntransactions.     Merlino was Luisi's superior in the LCN, and the\n\ngovernment was aware of the serious consequences Luisi would face\n\nif he refused to follow Merlino's order.\n\n            The district court instructed the jury on the entrapment\n\ndefense.    However, the court's supplemental instructions -- given\n\nin    response   to   a    jury    question    --    foreclosed    the   jury    from\n\nconsidering Merlino's role in the asserted government entrapment of\n\nLuisi.    We conclude that those instructions were erroneous, and we\n\nvacate the convictions and remand the case.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            In   July      1999,     a   grand      jury   in   the   District     of\n\nMassachusetts indicted Luisi and three co-defendants on three\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcharges: one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, and two counts of\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute, see id. § 841(a).\n\nThe conspiracy was alleged to have run from February 1999 through\n\nJune 28, 1999. The two possession counts stemmed from transactions\n\non April 30, 1999, and June 3, 1999.\n\n             Pursuant to plea agreements with the government, two of\n\nLuisi's co-defendants pled guilty to the possession counts.                         The\n\nindictment      against    the   third      was       dismissed       following    that\n\ndefendant's death, leaving Luisi as the sole defendant at a trial\n\nthat commenced on September 9, 2002. We recount the key testimony.\n\n           In     the     late   1990s,         the    FBI        conducted   a   major\n\ninvestigation     into     the   operations           of    the    Philadelphia    LCN.\n\nPrevite, a captain or \"capo regime\" in the LCN, assisted the FBI\n\ninvestigation by working as a cooperating witness under a personal\n\nservices contract with the FBI.            He was paid a substantial sum of\n\nmoney in return.\n\n           The FBI came to learn that Luisi was working for the\n\nPhiladelphia LCN as a captain, and that he was supervising the\n\ncriminal activity that the organization undertook in Boston. Eager\n\nto get evidence against Luisi, the FBI had Previte introduce Luisi\n\nto   McGowan,    who    posed    as   a    source          of   illegal   money-making\n\nopportunities.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f          The introduction took place over January 11th and 12th,\n\n1999.   McGowan operated under the pseudonym \"Michael O'Sullivan\"\n\nand purported to be in the import/export business.    He told Luisi\n\nhe had previously worked with Capo Previte in Philadelphia, and\n\nsaid he had now relocated to Boston.    McGowan explained to Luisi\n\nthat as part of his business he was sometimes presented with\n\n\"opportunities\" and that sometimes he needed help taking advantage\n\nof these \"deals.\"   Luisi agreed that he would look at future deals\n\nwith McGowan.    Unbeknownst to Luisi, this conversation was being\n\nrecorded by the FBI -- as were the vast majority of the future\n\nconversations Luisi would have with McGowan.\n\n          The first \"opportunity\" occurred on February 10, 1999,\n\nwhen McGowan presented Luisi with several \"stolen\" furs. Luisi was\n\nnot sure if he would be able to sell them, but he stated he would\n\nlook into it.    He also inquired whether McGowan had other items;\n\nwhen McGowan mentioned the possibility of obtaining jewelry, Luisi\n\nexpressed more interest in that, and particularly in diamonds.\n\nThere was no mention of any drugs at this point.\n\n          Several days later, Luisi and Previte spoke to each other\n\nat a party in Philadelphia.   Merlino was also present at the party.\n\nLuisi testified that Previte proposed a \"swap\" of cocaine for\n\ndiamonds, and that Luisi's response was that he would \"try\" to get\n\nthe deal done.   He testified that he gave this response because \"at\n\nthe party [Merlino] . . . made it very clear to me that he wanted\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthese drugs,\" although Luisi later clarified that he did not at\n\nthat time understand Merlino to be giving an \"order\" to do the\n\ndeal, but merely \"permission.\"               That would change.        In any event,\n\nLuisi testified that at or shortly after the party he chose not to\n\ndo the deal.\n\n             On March 8, 1999, McGowan again met with Luisi, along\n\nwith two of Luisi's associates.1                McGowan referred to Previte's\n\nproposed     swap   and    stated     that    he   (McGowan)    knew    a   guy   with\n\ndiamonds, and that the guy was looking to exchange them for \"three\n\nbricks.\"2     Luisi's immediate response was: \"I want to get them, I\n\nwant to bring them to [a jeweler friend of mine], if he likes it,\n\nboom.       We'll do the deal and I'll do it that way, whatever\n\n[Previte] wants.\"         McGowan interpreted this to mean that Luisi\n\nwanted to see the diamonds, and that he would be willing to\n\nexchange cocaine for them.\n\n             Several minutes later, however, Luisi took McGowan aside\n\nprivately.      This      part   of   the     conversation     was   not    recorded.\n\nAccording to McGowan, Luisi told him that because Previte had\n\nreferred McGowan to him, Luisi would make \"every effort\" to get the\n\n\n        1\n       We use the term \"associate\" in its ordinary colloquial\nmeaning.   Luisi testified that the word \"associate\" conveys a\nparticular status within the LCN; we do not use the term in that\nsense.\n        2\n       McGowan testified that \"brick\" was code for \"cocaine.\"\nLuisi disputed that, testifying that his initial understanding was\nthat a \"brick\" referred to heroin, and that it took him a few\nminutes to realize that McGowan was referring to cocaine.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fcocaine, but it would be difficult and it would take time.             Luisi\n\ntestified that he did not actually agree to do a drugs-for-diamonds\n\nswap.\n\n            Also during the March 8th conversation, McGowan asked\n\nLuisi what items, other than the diamonds, he would be interested\n\nin.     Luisi responded that he would be interested in jewelry,\n\nwatches, and cigarettes, and some of his associates mentioned film\n\nand razor blades.\n\n            McGowan's next meeting with Luisi and his associates came\n\non March 11, 1999.      McGowan had some \"stolen\" Polaroid film, and\n\nthe participants discussed how it was to be sold.           Luisi reported\n\non his only partially successful attempts to sell fur coats, and\n\nthe participants also discussed diamonds and jewelry. Later during\n\nthe meeting, McGowan mentioned that Previte was coming up to Boston\n\nin a few days, and Luisi agreed to meet with both Previte and\n\nMcGowan then.      Luisi and his associates left with the film.\n\n            Previte came to Boston, and on March 16, 1999, he met\n\nwith    McGowan,   Luisi,   and   some    of   Luisi's   associates.     The\n\nparticipants had a cryptic conversation during which, according to\n\nMcGowan, Luisi confirmed that he would get the cocaine-for-diamonds\n\ndeal done.    The following day, McGowan talked to Luisi over the\n\nphone, and again inquired into the status of the cocaine deal with\n\nPrevite.     Luisi replied that he would work on it, but indicated\n\nthat the deal would not happen immediately.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            During this time, Luisi had also been trying to sell the\n\nfilm that McGowan had given him on March 11th.              He was unable to do\n\nso at a price that McGowan was willing to accept, and so on March\n\n19th Luisi returned the film.                After Luisi again expressed his\n\npreference for jewelry, and after McGowan again reaffirmed his\n\nability   to     get   jewelry,   the    conversation      turned   back   to   the\n\nproposed diamonds-for-cocaine deal.              Luisi made comments that, if\n\ntaken at face value, expressed a reluctance to go ahead with the\n\ndeal and indicated that Luisi had \"nothing to do with\" the cocaine\n\nbusiness.      Luisi also explained to McGowan that \"in the last . . .\n\nthree years I lost over a dozen and a half guys to that. . . . And\n\nI have to make a stern, a firm stand here. . . . I don't wanna have\n\nnothing to do with it.\"\n\n            Luisi then said that he would send a guy named Danny\n\nWhite, not affiliated with Luisi, to do the deal.                     Luisi told\n\nMcGowan that once White made contact with McGowan, McGowan would\n\nhave exactly seven days to complete the transaction.                   Luisi and\n\nMcGowan also discussed cash terms for the deal (even though the\n\ndeal had originally been conceived of as a barter for diamonds).\n\n            Luisi testified that Danny White actually is a fictitious\n\nperson    whom    Luisi   made    up    in   order   to   pretend   that   he   was\n\ncooperating with McGowan.3             McGowan testified that he never met\n\n\n     3\n       On the tapes, it is actually McGowan who first refers to\n\"Danny,\" and he states that he had heard about White from Previte.\nHowever, a jury could conclude that Previte had first heard about\n\n                                         -7-\n\fWhite at any point, that he never had any conversation with him,\n\nand that he did not know whether White was a fictitious person or\n\nnot.\n\n            Luisi and McGowan had no contact with each other for the\n\nnext three weeks.4     On April 19, 1999, McGowan initiated a phone\n\nconversation with Luisi. McGowan turned the discussion to dealings\n\nwith Previte, and Luisi responded that \"[e]verything's gonna be\n\nokay soon.\"     McGowan understood this to be a reference to the\n\ncocaine transaction.\n\n            McGowan initiated another phone conversation with Luisi\n\non April 23, 1999.     McGowan told him that Previte would be coming\n\nto Boston on April 28th, and he asked Luisi to be available then.\n\nLuisi said he would probably be available, and he also said \"I'm ah\n\ngonna be calling you ah with my other friend any day.\"      McGowan\n\ninterpreted the \"other friend\" to be a reference to Danny White.\n\nIn the same phone conversation, McGowan mentioned that he might\n\nsoon have more stolen property coming in.\n\n            On April 27, 1999, one day before Previte's planned trip\n\nto Boston, Previte had a conversation with Merlino, his superior in\n\nthe LCN.    Previte was wearing a wire, and the conversation was\n\nrecorded.    As revealed by the tape, Previte complained to Merlino\n\n\nDanny White from Luisi.\n       4\n       McGowan testified that this was due to the fact that Luisi\nwas out of town for one week, and that McGowan had informed Luisi\nhe would be out of town for the two weeks after that.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthat Luisi had not yet done the cocaine transaction, despite\n\nLuisi's representations.    Previte explained to Merlino that he had\n\n\"big money sittin[g] on the line,\" and that Merlino would also make\n\nmoney from the transaction. He directly asked Merlino if there was\n\n\"any way you could just tell [Luisi] to do what he gotta do.\"\n\nMerlino agreed to do so.   Previte and Merlino then agreed that when\n\nPrevite went to Boston the next day, Previte would put Luisi on the\n\nphone with Merlino, at which point Merlino would tell Luisi to do\n\nthe cocaine deal.     As Merlino put it on the tape: \"I'll say [to\n\nLuisi:] whatever [Previte] says to do[,] just do it.\"\n\n          Previte was still cooperating with the FBI at the time he\n\nhad the conversation with Merlino, and a jury could conclude that\n\nthe FBI had in fact directed Previte's request of Merlino. Previte\n\ndid not testify, nor did any of the Philadelphia FBI agents who had\n\nworked with him.    But McGowan was asked if the FBI had arranged the\n\nmeeting between Previte and Merlino, and his response was that\n\nwhile he did not know, he \"assume[d] so because Previte was\n\ncooperating.\"\n\n          Previte flew to Boston on the morning of April 28th, the\n\nday after his conversation with Merlino.        He went to McGowan's\n\noffice, and McGowan arranged for Previte to make a three-way call\n\nwith LCN boss Merlino and Capo Luisi, Merlino's underling.       The\n\ncall was recorded in its entirety.      It began with Previte calling\n\nLuisi.   Once Luisi was on the line, Previte brought Merlino into\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fthe conversation.          After an exchange of preliminaries, Merlino\n\n(somewhat cryptically) got down to business.5 Luisi testified that\n\nhe understood Merlino to be ordering him to get the cocaine deal\n\ndone, and that he agreed to do the deal as a result of this.\n\n              McGowan, who had been listening in to the conversation,\n\ntestified to having a similar understanding.                   As he put it,\n\n\"[a]fter this phone conversation, I expected to receive cocaine.\"\n\nHis hopes were soon realized.\n\n              Within an hour after Merlino spoke to Luisi, Luisi met\n\nwith       Previte   and   McGowan    to   confirm   details     of       the   drug\n\ntransaction.          Initially,     Previte   and   Luisi     had    a     private\n\nconversation to work out certain points, and Previte explained that\n\nMcGowan wanted to do multiple cocaine deals. Luisi agreed, and the\n\n\n\n       5\n       As recorded, the relevant portions of the conversation were\nas follows:\n\n              Merlino: Bob, can that guy, you know, do what\n              he's got to do over there for him?\n\n              Luisi: Oh, yeah.\n\n              Merlino: All right.\n\n              Luisi: Yeah, that's, that's gonna, ah, that's\n              gonna be.\n\n              Previte: Okay.\n\n              Merlino: All right.\n\n              Luisi: You know?\n\n              Merlino: You got it.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fprivate conversation ended shortly thereafter.         With Luisi looking\n\non, Previte then informed McGowan that the mysterious Danny White\n\nwould not be playing a role in the deal, and that his place would\n\nbe taken by Shawn Vetere, one of Luisi's associates.               Vetere\n\npromptly put McGowan in touch with Bobby Carrozza.6       McGowan worked\n\nout more details with Carrozza.      On April 30, 1999 -- two days\n\nafter the call with Merlino -- Carrozza sold two kilograms of\n\ncocaine to McGowan.    Carrozza told McGowan that the cocaine came\n\n\"right from [Luisi and Vetere].      I wouldn't be able to do it any\n\nother way.\"\n\n          Two weeks later, McGowan gave Luisi a $1,000 \"tribute\"\n\npayment for arranging the transaction.          McGowan and Luisi also\n\nengaged in preliminary discussions about a future cocaine deal, and\n\nLuisi told McGowan to work the rest out with Carrozza.        McGowan did\n\nso.\n\n          The   next    cocaine    delivery      was    not   immediately\n\nforthcoming, however.     On May 24, 1999, McGowan complained to\n\nLuisi, who told him to be patient.       On June 1, 1999, Luisi proposed\n\ncertain changes to the impending cocaine transaction; McGowan\n\nagreed to the revised cocaine deal the next day, and he paid Luisi\n\nthe $24,000 cash price.   On June 3, 1999, Carrozza and Tommy Wilson\n\n\n      6\n       Carrozza's exact relationship to Luisi is somewhat unclear,\nbut there was testimony suggesting that Carrozza was in some way\naffiliated with the LCN. There was also evidence that Carrozza\nworked directly with Luisi and Vetere.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f(another of Luisi's associates) came to McGowan's office to deliver\n\none kilogram of cocaine. McGowan later gave Luisi a $500 \"tribute\"\n\npayment for arranging the deal.7\n\n            Luisi was the sole witness to testify for the defense.\n\nHe testified to several additional pertinent points.              He admitted\n\nthat he had been a captain in the LCN since the fall of 1998, and\n\nhe agreed that the LCN was properly described as \"the Mafia\" and as\n\n\"the mob.\"       As a captain, one of his jobs had been to make\n\n\"tribute\" payments to Merlino, and these payments had come out of\n\nLuisi's earnings from the criminal enterprises conducted by his\n\n\"crew\" in Boston.        Luisi explained that the LCN was extremely\n\nhierarchical,     and he stated that when the head of the LCN ordered\n\nhim   to   do   the   cocaine   transaction,   he   felt   that   he   had   no\n\nalternative other than to fulfill the order.         He was also asked why\n\nhe had engaged in the second cocaine transaction; while he did not\n\nspecifically reference Merlino's order, he responded that he had\n\nnot wanted to do the drug deal, and he did so because he \"had to\n\nbring money to Philadelphia\" and so he \"was desperate.\"\n\n            Luisi admitted that at one point in his life he had been\n\ninvolved in drug distribution.          However, he testified that he\n\nstopped his involvement in that business when he joined the LCN in\n\n\n\n      7\n       A third cocaine transaction was also negotiated, but it was\nnever fully executed. On June 25, 1999, Luisi informed McGowan\nthat the supply of cocaine had tightened and that things would be\n\"dead\" for a while. Luisi was arrested three days later.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fmid-1998, and he gave several reasons for this.              At the time Luisi\n\njoined, Georgie Borghesi (another LCN captain) and Merlino both\n\ntold Luisi that he was not to deal drugs.                  Additionally, Luisi\n\ntestified that around that time he had a \"spiritual encounter,\" and\n\nhe realized that his \"whole lifestyle was wrong.\"               Because he was\n\nan   LCN   captain,   he    found   it    difficult   to    realize   fully   his\n\nspiritual aspirations, but he testified that he was at least\n\npartially able to implement them by ending his involvement with\n\ndrugs as of late 1998.8\n\n            Luisi also offered an explanation for why he had seemed\n\nreceptive to the cocaine deal, even before receiving the order from\n\nMerlino on April 28th.       He claimed he had been trying to \"pal off\"\n\nMcGowan    and   Previte;    that    is,    he   politely    pretended   to    be\n\ncooperating with them on the drug deal, while in fact he had no\n\nintention of ever delivering drugs to them.\n\n            Before the jury was instructed, Luisi's attorney asked\n\nthe district court to dismiss the case on the ground that the\n\ngovernment had engaged in allegedly outrageous conduct, thereby\n\nviolating Luisi's due process rights.             The court never ruled on\n\n\n      8\n       On cross-examination, the government attempted to impeach\nLuisi by suggesting that the spiritual encounter was not genuine.\nLuisi admitted that at least one member of his crew had been\n\"dabbling\" in cocaine even after Luisi claimed to have ceased his\ninvolvement with drugs. Luisi also admitted that he was aware of\nthis \"dabbling,\" and that he shared in the profits that resulted\nfrom it. Luisi did say that the drug quantities involved in this\n\"dabbling\" where much smaller than the quantities involved in the\ndeals with McGowan.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fthat motion; such a motion is an issue for the judge and not the\n\njury.       See United States v. Bradley, 820 F.2d 3, 7 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).       However, over the government's objection, the district\n\ncourt       did    agree   that   Luisi    was   entitled   to   an    entrapment\n\ninstruction.\n\n                  The district court's entrapment instructions correctly\n\ninformed the jury that the government had the burden to prove,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that Luisi had not been entrapped.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Walter, 434 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 2006).                      The\n\ndistrict court further explained that the government had to prove,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that at least one of two things was\n\ntrue: either (1) \"no government agent9 or person acting on behalf\n\n[of] or . . . under [the] auspices of the government persuaded or\n\ninduced the defendant to commit\" the charged crimes; or (2) \"the\n\ndefendant was ready and willing to commit the [charged] crime[s]\n\nwithout persuasion from the government.\"             This was also a correct\n\nstatement of the law.         See United States v. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (explaining that the two prongs of an entrapment\n\ndefense       are      improper   government      inducement     and    lack    of\n\npredisposition).\n\n                  Luisi specifically asked for an instruction indicating\n\nthat if the jury found that Previte had induced Merlino, that meant\n\n\n\n        9\n      The district court did not provide a definition for the term\n\"government agent.\"\n\n                                          -14-\n\fthat Merlino's order could be considered government action.                  The\n\ndistrict court refused, stating that the instruction was improper\n\nbecause there was a factual dispute over whether the government's\n\nresponsibility ended due to the presence of an intermediary.\n\n           Shortly after commencing deliberations, the jury sent the\n\ncourt a question that revealed it was considering Merlino's role\n\nand how it related to the entrapment defense.           The jury asked: \"Is\n\nMerlino's request of Luisi, if determined to be excessive pressure,\n\nconsidered to be government persuasion or inducement because the\n\ncontact between Merlino and Luisi resulted from the government\n\nagent Previte and Merlino?\"\n\n           The court and the parties researched the issue overnight,\n\nand returned in the morning to discuss the proper response.                 Luisi\n\ncontended that because Previte had spoken to Merlino about the\n\ncocaine    transaction,     and   because     Merlino's   order      had    been\n\nfacilitated by Previte and McGowan (the latter of whom had actually\n\nplaced the three-way call to Merlino), the actions of Merlino,\n\nPrevite,    and   McGowan    together      could   be   attributed     to    the\n\ngovernment.   The government disagreed, and based its argument on a\n\ncase from outside this circuit, United States v. Washington, 106\n\nF.3d 983 (D.C. Cir. 1997).          The government described Luisi's\n\nasserted defense as \"derivative entrapment,\" and it claimed that\n\nWashington was the only case it could find recognizing the defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fAs the government read Washington, Luisi's claim was foreclosed on\n\nthe facts presented.\n\n             The court took a different route, and it ultimately\n\nconcluded that a case from this circuit, United States v. Bradley,\n\nwas controlling.     In Bradley a prison inmate named Constanza, who\n\ncould have been deemed to have been acting as a government agent,\n\ndirectly threatened an intermediary named Brenner to do a drug deal\n\non pain of physical harm.      820 F.2d at 5-6.    The intermediary was\n\nunable to do the deal on his own, and he in turn pressured his\n\nfriend -- the defendant Bradley -- to assist him.          See id. at 7-8.\n\nWe   found    the   evidence   sufficient   to   support   an   entrapment\n\ninstruction for the intermediary Brenner, as the government agent\n\nhad directly threatened him.        Id.     But we held that Brenner's\n\nfriend, defendant Bradley, was not entitled to an entrapment\n\ninstruction: while Brenner could claim duress, Bradley had \"only an\n\nappeal to sympathy, which he was free to reject.\"           Id. at 7.   We\n\nstated that we \"would not extend the [entrapment] defense to a\n\nremote defendant without, at least, a showing that pressure had\n\nbeen put upon him by the intermediary at the instruction of the\n\ngovernment agent.\"     Id. at 8.\n\n             Thus in Bradley this court rejected defendant Bradley's\n\nargument that the government's improper inducement of Brenner could\n\nbe an indirect entrapment of Bradley, as the agent (Constanza) had\n\nneither ordered nor expected Brenner to entrap other persons.           See\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fid. at 7.    We said that a \"quite different case would be presented\n\nif Constanza had targeted a putative seller and had instructed\n\nBrenner to put the arm on him.\"         Id.   We then added a footnote to\n\n\"suggest that such a case, though argued to be a third-party case,\n\nis not really a third-party case at all.         The intermediary in such\n\ninstance is really acting under instructions, as a government\n\nsubagent -- a quite different situation.\"         Id. at 7 n.6.\n\n            The district court focused upon Bradley's use of the word\n\n\"instructions,\" and it read that case as concerned with whether the\n\ngovernment    agent   (Previte)   had    \"instructed\"   the   intermediary\n\n(Merlino) to pressure Luisi.        The court concluded that because\n\nPrevite ranked below Merlino in the LCN hierarchy, Previte was in\n\nno position to \"instruct\" Merlino to do anything.\n\n            Although Luisi argued for a broader reading of the word\n\n\"instruct,\" the district court rejected such a reading of Bradley.\n\nIn the alternative, Luisi asked that the jury be allowed to\n\ndetermine whether Merlino had been \"instructed,\" but the court\n\nrejected that option as well.\n\n            The district court then called the jury back into the\n\ncourtroom and answered the jury's question as follows:\n\n            [I]n your consideration of the entrapment\n            question, you should focus your attention on\n            the relationship -- the direct relationship\n            between Mr. Previte . . . and Mr. McGowan on\n            the one hand, and Mr. Luisi on the other hand.\n            You should consider evidence as [it] relates\n            to the direct contact between and among those\n            people.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fBecause the district court omitted Merlino from this statement,\n\nwhile simultaneously mentioning other individuals, the jury likely\n\nconcluded   that   it    could   not    consider     Merlino's    role   in   any\n\ninducement of Luisi.       This was particularly so since the jury's\n\nquestion specifically asked about Merlino, and the court told the\n\njury to focus on individuals other than Merlino.            As a result, and\n\nas the government has not disputed, the jury was precluded from\n\nfinding that Merlino's order to Luisi could be deemed improper\n\ngovernmental inducement.\n\n            Later that day, the jury convicted Luisi on all three\n\ncounts of the indictment.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Luisi's primary contention on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt's jury instructions, as supplemented by its answer to the\n\njury's question, were incorrect as a matter of law.              We review that\n\nissue de novo here.      See United States v. Buttrick, 432 F.3d 373,\n\n376 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            We   agree    with    Luisi       that   the   district      court's\n\ninstructions were erroneous. We begin by explaining the nature and\n\npolicies behind the entrapment defense generally.                   We address\n\nBradley, and conclude that it supports Luisi's claim of error.                 We\n\nalso reject the government's alternative argument, which we review\n\nde novo, that there was no reversible error on the facts presented\n\nbecause Luisi was not entitled to any entrapment instruction\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fwhatsoever. See United States v. Nishnianidze, 342 F.3d 6, 17 (1st\n\nCir.   2003)    (stating     that    a   defendant     is   entitled    to    a   jury\n\ninstruction so long as his legal theory is valid and there is\n\nevidence in the record to support it).\n\nA.         Understanding the Entrapment Defense\n\n           In federal criminal cases, the entrapment defense is\n\nneither a doctrine of constitutional dimension, nor a defense\n\nspecifically granted by statute. See United States v. Russell, 411\n\nU.S. 423, 432-33 (1973).        Rather, the defense has its origins in an\n\ninference about congressional intent.                Sherman v. United States,\n\n356 U.S. 369, 372 (1958); see also United States v. Gendron, 18\n\nF.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir. 1994).             The Supreme Court has explained\n\nthat the \"function of law enforcement is the prevention of crime\n\nand the apprehension of criminals.              Manifestly, that function does\n\nnot include the manufacturing of crime. . . . Congress could not\n\nhave intended that its statutes were to be enforced by tempting\n\ninnocent persons into violations.\"               Sherman, 356 U.S. at 372.           A\n\nsuccessful entrapment defense requires that there be a reasonable\n\ndoubt on both prongs of a two-pronged test.\n\n           The    first      prong   necessitates      a    showing    of    improper\n\ngovernment inducement.         See Gamache, 156 F.3d at 9.         This aspect of\n\nthe defense plainly seeks to deter improper government conduct.\n\nGendron,   18    F.3d   at    961.       Indeed,   a   defendant      cannot      claim\n\nentrapment when government conduct played no causal role in the\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fdefendant's     inducement.          See   Sherman,    356    U.S.      at    372.\n\nNevertheless,    the   entrapment       defense   only    deters     government\n\nmisbehavior in cases where the defendant would otherwise be law-\n\nabiding.   Gendron, 18 F.3d at 962.            That is because the second\n\nprong requires that the defendant have a lack of predisposition to\n\ncommit the charged offense.          See id.; see also Sorrells v. United\n\nStates, 287 U.S. 435, 448 (1932).\n\n           These two prongs, and the policy concerns behind them,\n\nplay important roles in delimiting the scope of the entrapment\n\ndefense.   But they are not the only considerations that matter.\n\nThis   court   and   the   Supreme    Court   have    taken   account    of   the\n\npractical problems facing law enforcement, particularly in the\n\nprosecution of \"victimless\" crimes where \"significant governmental\n\ninvolvement in illegal activities\" is often required. Bradley, 820\n\nF.2d at 6-8; see also Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 494-5\n\n& n.7 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in the judgment); Russell, 411\n\nU.S. at 432; Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.         We must be mindful that \"the\n\ndefense of entrapment . . . [does] not . . . give the federal\n\njudiciary a 'chancellor's foot' veto over law enforcement practices\n\nof which it [does] not approve.\"           Russell, 411 U.S. at 435.\n\n           These various considerations are sometimes in tension\n\nwith one another, and we have treated the resolution of questions\n\nabout the scope of the entrapment defense as essentially exercises\n\nin balancing.    Indeed, in Bradley we weighed the competing factors\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fand    realized    that   we     ultimately     faced   \"a   question   of   social\n\npolicy.\"    820 F.2d at 8.         Cf. United States v. Hollingsworth, 27\n\nF.3d    1196,     1198    (7th    Cir.   1994)    (en    banc)   (characterizing\n\nentrapment as a \"common law doctrine\").\n\n            We synthesize the key facts on which we must balance\n\ncompeting concerns in this case.                It is beyond dispute that an\n\nindividual like Previte, hired by the government as an informant,\n\nis a \"government agent\" for entrapment purposes.                 See Sherman, 356\n\nU.S. at 373-75.      Nor can there be any dispute that Merlino's order\n\nto Luisi, with its implied threat of physical harm or other serious\n\nretribution, could be found by a jury to be improper inducement if\n\nattributed to the government.                 See Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961;\n\nBradley, 820 F.2d at 7.\n\n            It is also clear that Luisi's case does not fit the\n\npattern of what has come to be known as \"vicarious entrapment.\"                 In\n\n\"vicarious entrapment\" an unknowing middleman merely tells the\n\ndefendant about an inducement that the government had used to\n\ntarget the middleman.            See United States v. Valencia, 645 F.2d\n\n1158, 1168-69 (2d Cir. 1980) (recognizing the vicarious entrapment\n\ndefense).    Here, the target was not the middleman Merlino, but the\n\ndefendant Luisi.          Further, a jury could find that Merlino had\n\nhimself threatened Luisi.             This was not a case where Merlino\n\nrepeated to Luisi a threat that Previte had made against Merlino.\n\nIndeed, Previte did not threaten Merlino at all.\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f                Instead, this case is much closer to what has been called\n\n\"derivative entrapment,\" a situation in which a government agent\n\n\"uses the unsuspecting middleman as a means of passing on an\n\ninducement\" to the defendant.            2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\n\nLaw, § 9.8(a), at 93 (2d ed. 2003).10                   Yet even within this\n\ncategory, further refinement is required.\n\n                We have before us a situation in which a jury could find\n\nthat     Previte       specifically   targeted    Luisi,   and    then   \"induced\"\n\nMerlino to give an order to Luisi when Merlino might not have\n\notherwise done so.          But Previte's inducement of Merlino does not\n\nappear to have itself been improper.              Previte simply helped set up\n\na drug transaction, explained to Merlino that Merlino would profit\n\nfrom the transaction's execution, and then encouraged Merlino to\n\norder        Luisi's    assistance.     Cf.    Gendron,    18    F.3d    at   961-62\n\n(explaining that improper inducement \"goes beyond providing an\n\nordinary 'opportunity to commit a crime,'\" and providing examples\n\n(quoting Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 550 (1992))).                    A\n\njury     would     presumably    find   that     Previte   merely   provided      an\n\n\n\n        10\n        Some circuits have used a different meaning of \"derivative\nentrapment.\" For example, the Seventh Circuit has used it to refer\nexclusively to situations in which the middleman is himself\nentrapped. See Hollingsworth, 27 F.3d at 1204. By contrast, the\nFourth Circuit has used it to refer to all third-party entrapment\ncases. See United States v. Squillacote, 221 F.3d 542, 573-74 &\nn.19 (4th Cir. 2000). The definition we use, which comes from a\nleading criminal law treatise, is a broad definition that is useful\nin   distinguishing   \"derivative   entrapment\"   from   \"vicarious\nentrapment.\"\n\n                                        -22-\n\f\"ordinary\" inducement to Merlino; it was Merlino's inducement of\n\nLuisi that a jury could find improper.\n\n           This is an unusual entrapment situation.                   Under the\n\noriginal, correct instructions given, it is evident that the jury\n\nwas considering the possibility that Merlino had put excessive\n\npressure   on    Luisi,    and   that    the     jurors   were   unsure   whether\n\nMerlino's order could be considered \"government persuasion or\n\ninducement because the contact between Merlino and Luisi resulted\n\nfrom the government agent Previte.\"                The effect of the court's\n\nresponse was the same as if it had instructed the jury, as a matter\n\nof law, that Merlino's order could not be considered government\n\ninducement or persuasion.         We must decide whether the issue was\n\ncorrectly removed from the jury's consideration.\n\nB.         Third-Party Entrapment After Bradley\n\n           In this circuit, Bradley is the leading case on third-\n\nparty entrapment.         Like the district court, the government now\n\nbelieves that Bradley controls this case.                 We examine Bradley's\n\nfacts and reasoning in greater detail.\n\n           The government agent in Bradley was a prison inmate named\n\nConstanza. In exchange for a reduced sentence, Constanza agreed to\n\nidentify drug dealers for the government to assist in undercover\n\noperations      and   prosecutions.        See    Bradley,   820   F.2d    at   5.\n\nConstanza told the government about an individual named Brenner,\n\nand then he threatened Brenner with physical harm if Brenner did\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fnot engage in a cocaine deal with an undercover agent.              Id. at 5.\n\nBrenner in turn appealed to his friend, defendant Bradley, for\n\nassistance in obtaining the cocaine.           Id. at 6.    Though Bradley\n\ninitially refused, Brenner explained that his physical safety was\n\nin jeopardy.        Id.   Upon hearing this, Bradley decided to assist\n\nBrenner.      Id.\n\n              It should now be clear that Bradley presented a narrow\n\nfact pattern: it was a case of vicarious entrapment.                That is,\n\nBrenner merely informed Bradley of a threat that had been made\n\nagainst Brenner, not one that had been made against Bradley.\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit's Valencia opinion had recognized that\n\nsuch a vicarious entrapment defense could be viable, we considered\n\nand rejected that position.          See id. at 8.      At the same time,\n\nhowever, we rejected the government's argument that a defendant can\n\nnever be entrapped by a third party.          See id. at 6-8.\n\n              Bradley reached these conclusions by weighing a variety\n\nof policy considerations as applied to the facts of the case.               On\n\nthe one hand was the fact that the crime would not have happened\n\nbut for the government's involvement.         See id. at 6.     On the other\n\nhand   were    several    factors.   First,    the   government's    role   in\n\nensnaring Bradley was \"attenuated\" because the agent's threat\n\nneither ordered Brenner to seek assistance nor expected it. Id. at\n\n7. Second, Bradley acknowledged the practical difficulties for the\n\nprosecution when it is forced to refute a defendant's claim of\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fentrapment in a scenario where the only two witnesses -- the\n\ndefendant and the intermediary -- are likely to be hostile to the\n\ngovernment.11      See id.    Third, Bradley observed that the defendant\n\ndid commit a crime, exhibiting socially inappropriate behavior.\n\nSee id. at 6.        Finally, Bradley noted the fact that undercover\n\ninvestigations are often needed to prosecute drug crimes.            See id.\n\n            The Bradley court ultimately held that it \"would not\n\nextend the [entrapment] defense to a remote defendant without, at\n\nleast, a showing that pressure had been put upon him by the\n\nintermediary at the instruction of the government agent.\"             Id. at\n\n8.    The government reads \"instruct\" to mean \"command,\" such that\n\nPrevite is not responsible for Merlino's threats against Luisi\n\nunless Previte had commanded Merlino to order Luisi into the\n\ncocaine    deal.     Luisi    reads   \"instruct\"   to   mean   \"convince\"    or\n\n\"inform.\"    But the dispute about the use of particular language in\n\nBradley is largely beside the point.          Bradley was a case in which\n\nthe   government      agent    neither   \"commanded,\"     \"convinced,\"      nor\n\n\"informed\" the middleman (Brenner) to target Bradley.             Indeed, it\n\nwas the lack of any government targeting of Bradley whatsoever on\n\nwhich Bradley relied.         See id. at 7.   Here, unlike in Bradley, the\n\n\n\n      11\n       The case at hand does not present that concern. There is\na tape recording of the conversation in which the middleman\npressured Luisi. Moreover, the government agent (Previte) in fact\nparticipated in that conversation, while another government agent\n(McGowan) listened in. Consequently, the government faced fewer\npractical difficulties in refuting Luisi's entrapment claim.\n\n                                      -25-\n\fgovernment's actions were specifically designed to pressure Luisi,\n\nand the government in fact expected that Luisi would be pressured.\n\nBradley thus had no occasion to consider the fact pattern at hand.12\n\n          In United States v. Rogers, 102 F.3d 641 (1st Cir. 1996),\n\nwe considered a fact pattern that was more on point.     In Rogers,\n\nthe defendant did not move quickly to complete a drug transaction\n\nthat an undercover agent had attempted to facilitate.   Id. at 645.\n\nIn an isolated statement, the government agent \"told\" the middleman\n\nto \"put some heat on [the defendant].\"     Id.   The agent had thus\n\nspecifically targeted the defendant to receive an inducement, and\n\nRogers relied on Bradley to conclude that the government would have\n\nbeen responsible if the agent had \"told\" the middleman \"to apply\n\nthe pressure or inducement later deemed improper.\"    Id. (emphasis\n\nadded) (italics removed).     However, Rogers factually did not\n\ninvolve an agent's suggestion that improper pressure be applied to\n\n\n\n     12\n       We also had no occasion to consider such a fact pattern in\nUnited States v. Murphy, 852 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case,\nafter we rejected the defendants' entrapment arguments, we relied\non Bradley to explain why one defendant's claim to an entrapment\ninstruction was \"foreclosed for an additional reason.\" Id. at 6.\nWe noted that to allow the claim \"we would have [had] to create the\nfiction that [the government agent] forced [the intermediary] into\ndealing with\" the defendant. Id. (emphasis added). To the extent\nthat our use of the word \"forced\" can be taken to imply a\nrequirement of coercion, such an implication was dicta, as the\ngovernment agent in the case never encouraged the middleman to\nbring anyone into the scheme, let alone the defendant. See id.\n     We similarly did not deal with a pertinent fact pattern in\nUnited States v. Hernandez, 995 F.2d 307, 313 (1st Cir. 1993).\nLike Bradley and Murphy, the case involved no government targeting\nof the individual defendant. See id.\n\n                               -26-\n\fthe defendant because \"putting on some heat\" was not improper.\n\nRogers distinguished the more sinister suggestion of putting \"the\n\narm\" on someone, a phrase that implied threatened force.    Id. at\n\n645-46.\n\n          Thus after Rogers, the law in this circuit permits an\n\nentrapment instruction involving a middleman when there is evidence\n\nthat (1) a government agent specifically targeted the defendant in\n\norder to induce him to commit illegal conduct; (2) the agent acted\n\nthrough the middleman after other government attempts at inducing\n\nthe defendant had failed; (3) the government agent requested,\n\nencouraged, or instructed the middleman to employ a specified\n\ninducement, which could be found improper, against the targeted\n\ndefendant; (4) the agent's actions led the middleman to do what the\n\ngovernment sought, even if the government did not use improper\n\nmeans to influence the middleman; and (5) as a result of the\n\nmiddleman's inducement, the targeted defendant in fact engaged in\n\nthe illegal conduct.13\n\n\n     13\n        Contrary to our precedent, several circuits categorically\ndeny the entrapment defense in all third-party situations where the\nmiddleman is unaware that he is helping the government.         See\nSquillacote, 221 F.3d at 574; United States v. Thickstun, 110 F.3d\n1394, 1398 (9th Cir. 1997); United States v. Martinez, 979 F.2d\n1424, 1432 (10th Cir. 1992).     The Third Circuit's law varies.\nCompare United States v. Klosterman, 248 F.2d 191, 195-96 (3d Cir.\n1957) (concluding that the third-party entrapment defense was\navailable in a case where the defendant was specifically targeted\nand the middleman was unwitting), with United States v. Beverly,\n723 F.2d 11, 12 (3d Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (failing to cite\nKlosterman and claiming that the third-party entrapment defense is\ncategorically unavailable when the middleman is unwitting). With\n\n                               -27-\n\f            The government reads Rogers differently.                It contends\n\nthat the word \"told\" in Rogers must mean an imperative equivalent\n\nto the government's interpretation of \"instruct\" in Bradley.                   It\n\nalso reads Rogers to state a requirement that the agent have\n\nimproperly induced the middleman.\n\n            We disagree.       First, we think that the government's\n\nargument is contrary to the plain meaning of \"told,\" and we see\n\nnothing in the context of Rogers that overrides this.                Indeed, in\n\nconcluding    that     the   agent   had   not    \"told\"   the   middleman     to\n\nimproperly induce the defendant, Rogers pointed out that \"nothing\n\nin the record show[ed] that [the agent] urged, suggested or was\n\neven aware of\" the middleman's improper inducement.                 See 102 F.3d\n\nat   645   (emphases    added).      Urging      and   suggesting    are   hardly\n\nequivalent to ordering, nor do they by themselves necessarily\n\nconstitute improper inducement. Second, if the Rogers court had in\n\nfact read Bradley the same way as the government does, we do not\n\nsee how the Rogers court could have considered it an open question\n\nwhether the government can be responsible for an agent's mere\n\nknowing tolerance of improper inducement by a middleman.14                 See id.\n\n\nthe possible exception of the Ninth Circuit's opinion in United\nStates v. Emmert, 829 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1987), we are unaware of\nany cases in which these circuits have rejected the third-party\ndefense when confronted with the kind of fact pattern we face here.\nAs for Emmert, we respectfully disagree with the Ninth Circuit's\nconclusions.\n      14\n       Mere knowing tolerance is not presented by the facts here,\nand we do not reach that issue.\n\n                                     -28-\n\f            Moreover,     the   policy    concerns    discussed    in   Bradley\n\nsupport our reading of Rogers.           Bradley thought it important that\n\nthe government's role was \"attenuated\" in that case because the\n\nagent had not attempted to ensnare the defendant.                 Bradley, 820\n\nF.2d at 7.    But in a case where the government agent specifically\n\ntargets the defendant, and then causes the middleman to take a\n\nspecifically    contemplated      action     (that    is    arguably    improper\n\npressure)    with   the    goal    of     ensnaring    the     defendant,   the\n\ngovernment's role is hardly attenuated.               Additionally, Bradley\n\nworried about the fact that the government had turned a potentially\n\ninnocent person into a criminal, see id. at 6, though it ultimately\n\ndecided that this concern was outweighed by other issues.                But in\n\nBradley the government had never attempted to induce defendant\n\nBradley directly. Bradley's concern for potential innocents weighs\n\nheavier when the government has tried -- and failed -- to induce\n\nthe defendant without the use of a middleman.\n\n            In light of our understanding of the law, we think a\n\nproperly instructed jury could conclude that the government was\n\nresponsible for Merlino's order to Luisi.                  Indeed, such a jury\n\ncould decide that: (1) Previte specifically requested that Merlino\n\norder Luisi to engage in the cocaine deal; (2) Previte's request\n\ncame after earlier government efforts to ensnare Luisi, without a\n\nmiddleman, had not been fruitful; (3) Previte, as an LCN captain,\n\nunderstood that the order he requested from Merlino would contain\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fan implied threat of death, physical harm, or serious retribution\n\nif Luisi failed to comply; (4) Merlino's order to Luisi was exactly\n\nwhat Previte had requested; and (5) Merlino would not have given\n\nthe order if Previte had not encouraged him to do so.15                       As a\n\nresult, we think that the district court incorrectly answered the\n\njury's question.\n\n              This result is supported by a Fifth Circuit case.                 In\n\nUnited States v. Anderton, 629 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir. 1980), the Fifth\n\nCircuit      allowed   the   entrapment   defense     in   a   case   where    law\n\nenforcement officers specifically targeted the defendant, and then\n\nput unspecified \"pressure\" on the unwitting middleman to bring the\n\ndefendant into a pre-designed criminal scheme.             Id. at 1045, 1047.\n\nWithout      discussing   whether   the   middleman    had     been   improperly\n\ninduced, the court found it important that the criminal design\n\noriginated from the government itself.          See id. at 1046-47.\n\n              Our conclusion is also supported by the D.C. Circuit's\n\nanalysis in Washington.         In Washington, an undercover FBI agent\n\nposed as a drug lord and recruited a corrupt police officer to help\n\nhim.        See 106 F.3d 990-91.     After paying the officer for his\n\n\n\n       15\n       Indeed, the jury's question was premised on the idea that\nthe government had caused Merlino to give the order. While the\ngovernment observes that there was no evidence introduced at trial\nas to Merlino's lack of predisposition, none was needed.       The\npremise of the jury's question was perfectly consistent with a\nfinding that Merlino was predisposed to be involved in a cocaine\ntransaction. See Gendron, 18 F.3d at 962 (distinguishing lack of\npredisposition from simple causation).\n\n                                     -30-\n\fservices, the agent \"asked [the officer] . . . to recruit as many\n\nnew officers as he could.\"            Id. at 991.        The corrupt officer\n\nagreed,     see   id.,   but   then   recruited    the   defendants   with   an\n\ninducement not contemplated by the undercover agent.                See id. at\n\n992,    994-95.      The   Washington    court    rejected   the    derivative\n\nentrapment instruction on the facts of the case.                   Id. at 995.\n\nImportantly, however, it held that the entrapment defense is\n\navailable    where   the   government     does    contemplate   the   improper\n\ninducement given to the defendant, and causes the middleman to give\n\nthat inducement as a result of a government agent's \"'instruction\n\nor direction.'\"      Id. at 993 (quoting United States v. Layeni, 90\n\nF.3d 514, 520 (D.C. Cir. 1996)); see also id. at 995.16\n\n             The government cites to other cases, but none presented\n\nthe fact pattern at issue here.         See, e.g., Hollingsworth, 27 F.3d\n\nat 1200-02, 1204-05; United States v. Hodges, 936 F.2d 371, 371-72\n\n(8th Cir. 1991); United States v. Pilarinos, 864 F.2d 253, 254-56\n\n\n       16\n       The government reads Washington differently, concluding that\nWashington requires the actual inducement applied to the\nintermediary to be the same kind of inducement applied to the\ndefendant. This reading seems premised on an assumption that the\nFBI agent in Washington had improperly induced the middleman. Yet\nthe court merely described the agent as \"asking\" for the\nmiddleman's assistance. Washington, 106 F.3d at 991. Washington\ncontains no explanation of how this inducement was improper, and\nthe court's logic suggests that any inquiry into the propriety of\nthe agent's request would be irrelevant.      Moreover, Washington\ncited an earlier D.C. Circuit case -- Layeni -- for its rule. See\nid. at 993-95.    Layeni had in turn implied that the derivative\nentrapment defense is available if a government agent merely\n\"suggests\" to an intermediary that he apply particular inducements\nto a defendant. See Layeni, 90 F.3d at 518.\n\n                                      -31-\n\f(2d Cir. 1988).17         The Seventh Circuit has even intimated that the\n\ndefense might be available when a government agent specifically\n\ntargets the defendant, and then encourages the middleman to induce\n\nthat defendant.          See Hollingsworth, 27 F.3d at 1204 (citing, inter\n\nalia, Bradley).\n\n             Thus    we    conclude     that       the   district    court      erred   in\n\nanswering the jury's question in a way that excluded Merlino's\n\norder from the jury's consideration.                We do not suggest that a jury\n\nwould necessarily have concluded that Luisi was entrapped through\n\nMerlino.     We hold only that the defendant was entitled to have a\n\nproperly instructed jury consider the issue.\n\nC.           Predisposition\n\n             As a fallback argument, the government contends that\n\nLuisi     failed    to    present     sufficient         evidence    of   his   lack    of\n\npredisposition,          and   thus   was    not    entitled    to    any    entrapment\n\ninstruction at all.            We readily dispose of this argument.\n\n             A judge may only instruct the jury on entrapment if the\n\ndefendant meets his entry-level burden of production.                             United\n\n\n     17\n       The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have, in somewhat limited\nfashion, also rejected unwitting intermediary claims on the facts\npresented. See, e.g., United States v. McLernon, 746 F.2d 1098,\n1109 (6th Cir. 1984); United States v. Mers, 701 F.2d 1321, 1340\n(11th Cir. 1983).    With one exception, we are not aware of any\ncases in which these circuits have faced facts similar to those in\nthis case. The one exception would be the Fifth Circuit's 1980\ndecision in Anderton -- which is binding precedent in the Eleventh\nCircuit, see Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th\nCir. 1981) (en banc) -- and Anderton supports our reasoning in this\ncase.\n\n                                            -32-\n\fStates v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir. 1994).      That is, a\n\ndefendant is entitled to an entrapment instruction only if there is\n\n\"some evidence,\" on both elements of the entrapment defense,\n\nsufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the defendant was\n\nmerely an unwary innocent.    See United States v. Joost, 92 F.3d 7,\n\n12 (1st Cir. 1996).    The defendant must show \"more than a scintilla\n\nof evidence, more than mere creation of an opportunity for criminal\n\nactivity.\"    Id.     Nonetheless, even a defendant's self-serving\n\ntestimony can suffice, especially when it has some circumstantial\n\ncorroboration.   See id.\n\n          Luisi made the requisite entry-level showing.      We have\n\nalready explained why a jury could find improper governmental\n\ninducement.   Additionally, Luisi introduced \"some evidence\" of his\n\nlack of predisposition.    He testified that sometime before he met\n\nMcGowan, he experienced a \"spiritual encounter,\" and that as a\n\nresult of this spiritual encounter he resolved to stop dealing\n\ndrugs.   This story was consistent with evidence that Luisi had\n\ndeliberately stalled the drug transaction for several months to\n\n\"pal off\" McGowan, thereby indefinitely delaying a drug deal to\n\nwhich Luisi was opposed.    Indeed, a jury could find that this two-\n\nmonth delay stood in stark contrast to the two-day lag between when\n\nMerlino gave Luisi the order, and when McGowan received drugs from\n\nLuisi's colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -33-\n\f          The    government   suggests   that    Luisi's    \"spiritual\n\nencounter\" was not credible, and that there was \"overwhelming\"\n\nevidence of Luisi's predisposition, including the fact that he\n\npreviously had been a cocaine dealer, and the fact that Luisi\n\ncontinued to receive profits from small drug deals undertaken by\n\none of his associates.\n\n          In this procedural posture, however, our job is not \"to\n\nweigh the evidence, make credibility determinations, or resolve\n\nconflicts in the proof.\"   Gamache, 156 F.3d at 9.     Accordingly, we\n\nfind that Luisi introduced sufficient evidence of his lack of\n\npredisposition to entitle him to an entrapment instruction.\n\n                                III.\n\n          Luisi further argues that the charges against him in fact\n\nshould have been dismissed because the government engaged in\n\noutrageous   conduct   that   violated   his    due   process   rights.\n\nOutrageous government conduct is an issue of law, and it is the\n\nprovince of the district court -- and not the jury -- to rule on a\n\ndefendant's motion to dismiss on that ground.         See Bradley, 820\n\nF.2d at 7 n.5.   When a district court rules on such a motion, its\n\nultimate conclusion is subject to de novo review, while its factual\n\nfindings are reviewed for clear error.          See United States v.\n\nGuzman, 282 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          In this case, the district court never ruled on Luisi's\n\nmotion, and thus we have no factual findings in the record to\n\n\n                                -34-\n\fassist us.18   Nonetheless, we think that the basic facts needed to\n\nrule on this matter are clear enough, and that we are able to reach\n\nthe necessary legal conclusions.   Luisi has asked us to find that\n\nthe government's conduct was outrageous, and the government has\n\nalso asked us to resolve the issue.\n\n          The outrageousness doctrine permits dismissal of criminal\n\ncharges only in those very rare instances when the government's\n\nmisconduct is so appalling and egregious as to violate due process\n\nby \"shocking . . . the universal sense of justice.\"   Russell, 411\n\nU.S. at 432 (quoting Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton,\n\n361 U.S. 234, 246 (1960))(internal quotation marks omitted); see\n\nalso United States v. Nunez, 146 F.3d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nWhile the doctrine is often invoked by criminal defendants, it has\n\nnever yet been successful in this circuit.    See United States v.\n\nSantana, 6 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting First Circuit\n\ncases rejecting the argument); United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d\n\n1267, 1272-73 (1st Cir. 1990) (collecting additional First Circuit\n\ncases rejecting the argument); see also, e.g., United States v.\n\nCapelton, 350 F.3d 231, 243 n.5 (1st Cir. 2003) (rejecting the\n\nargument on the facts presented); Nunez, 146 F.3d at 38-39 (same);\n\n\n\n\n     18\n       It is not clear to us whether the district court implicitly\ndenied the motion or not, but in any event we are left with no\nfindings of fact and no reasoning.\n\n                                -35-\n\fUnited States v. Matiz, 14 F.3d 79, 82-83 (1st Cir. 1994) (same).\n\nThis case is no exception.19\n\n                Luisi's argument for dismissal of the charges relies\n\nheavily on dicta in Bradley that \"outrageous conduct . . . might\n\nwell be found in a threat of serious physical harm.\"                  820 F.2d at\n\n7.        But    at    the    same     time,   Bradley     acknowledged    that   an\n\noutrageousness claim might be defeated if a defendant has been \"too\n\nactive himself.\"            Id.   Moreover, defendant Bradley himself had not\n\nbeen threatened, and we declined to consider the matter further.\n\nSee id.\n\n                Whatever fact situation Bradley had in mind, it was not\n\nthis one.        Here, even though the government's actions have risked\n\ngiving the defendant a viable entrapment claim, it is another thing\n\nentirely        to    say    that    the   conduct   was   \"outrageous.\"      After\n\nconsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, we\n\nthink the government's actions fell well short of shocking the\n\n\"universal sense of justice.\"\n\n\n\n\n     19\n        In United States v. Twigg, 588 F.2d 373 (3d Cir. 1978), the\nThird Circuit did find outrageous misconduct. As our court has\nrecognized, however, the Third Circuit has subsequently questioned\nits own holding in Twigg. See United States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1,\n9 n.4 (1st Cir. 1985) (citing Beverly, 723 F.2d at 12). In any\nevent, the factual background of Twigg makes it readily\ndistinguishable.\n\n                                            -36-\n\f                               IV.\n\n          The judgments of conviction are vacated and the case is\n\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.20\n\n\n\n\n     20\n       In light of our disposition, we have no need to address\nLuisi's claim that he was sentenced improperly in light of United\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).\n\n                              -37-\n\f",

Merlino was Luisi's superior in the LCN, and the government was aware of the serious consequences Luisi would face if he refused to follow Merlino's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury on the entrapment defense. However, the court's supplemental instructions &#8212; given in response to a jury question &#8212; foreclosed the jury from considering Merlino's role in the asserted government entrapment of Luisi. We conclude that those instructions were erroneous, and we vacate the convictions and remand the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1999, a grand jury in the District of Massachusetts indicted Luisi and three co-defendants on three charges: one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846, and two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 841(a). The conspiracy was alleged to have run from February 1999 through June 28, 1999. The two possession counts stemmed from transactions on April 30, 1999, and June 3, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to plea agreements with the government, two of Luisi's co-defendants pled guilty to the possession counts. The indictment against the third was dismissed following that defendant's death, leaving Luisi as the sole defendant at a trial that commenced on September 9, 2002. We recount the key testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1990s, the FBI conducted a major investigation into the operations of the Philadelphia LCN. Previte, a captain or \"capo regime\" in the LCN, assisted the FBI investigation by working as a cooperating witness under a personal services contract with the FBI. He was paid a substantial sum of money in return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FBI came to learn that Luisi was working for the Philadelphia LCN as a captain, and that he was supervising the criminal activity that the organization undertook in Boston. Eager to get evidence against Luisi, the FBI had Previte introduce Luisi to McGowan, who posed as a source of illegal money-making opportunities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The introduction took place over January 11th and 12th, 1999. McGowan operated under the pseudonym \"Michael O'Sullivan\" and purported to be in the import/export business. He told Luisi he had previously worked with Capo Previte in Philadelphia, and said he had now relocated to Boston. McGowan explained to Luisi that as part of his business he was sometimes presented with \"opportunities\" and that sometimes he needed help taking advantage of these \"deals.\" Luisi agreed that he would look at future deals with McGowan. Unbeknownst to Luisi, this conversation was being recorded by the FBI &#8212; as were the vast majority of the future conversations Luisi would have with McGowan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first \"opportunity\" occurred on February 10, 1999, when McGowan presented Luisi with several \"stolen\" furs. Luisi was not sure if he would be able to sell them, but he stated he would look into it. He also inquired whether McGowan had other items; when McGowan mentioned the possibility of obtaining jewelry, Luisi expressed more interest in that, and particularly in diamonds. There was no mention of any drugs at this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days later, Luisi and Previte spoke to each other at a party in Philadelphia. Merlino was also present at the party. Luisi testified that Previte proposed a \"swap\" of cocaine for diamonds, and that Luisi's response was that he would \"try\" to get the deal done. He testified that he gave this response because \"at the party [Merlino] . . . made it very clear to me that he wanted these drugs,\" although Luisi later clarified that he did not at that time understand Merlino to be giving an \"order\" to do the deal, but merely \"permission.\" That would change. In any event, Luisi testified that at or shortly after the party he chose not to do the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 8, 1999, McGowan again met with Luisi, along with two of Luisi's associates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> McGowan referred to Previte's proposed swap and stated that he (McGowan) knew a guy with diamonds, and that the guy was looking to exchange them for \"three bricks.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Luisi's immediate response was: \"I want to get them, I want to bring them to [a jeweler friend of mine], if he likes it, boom. We'll do the deal and I'll do it that way, whatever [Previte] wants.\" McGowan interpreted this to mean that Luisi wanted to see the diamonds, and that he would be willing to exchange cocaine for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several minutes later, however, Luisi took McGowan aside privately. This part of the conversation was not recorded. According to McGowan, Luisi told him that because Previte had referred McGowan to him, Luisi would make \"every effort\" to get the cocaine, but it would be difficult and it would take time. Luisi testified that he did not actually agree to do a drugs-for-diamonds swap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also during the March 8th conversation, McGowan asked Luisi what items, other than the diamonds, he would be interested in. Luisi responded that he would be interested in jewelry, watches, and cigarettes, and some of his associates mentioned film and razor blades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGowan's next meeting with Luisi and his associates came on March 11, 1999. McGowan had some \"stolen\" Polaroid film, and the participants discussed how it was to be sold. Luisi reported on his only partially successful attempts to sell fur coats, and the participants also discussed diamonds and jewelry. Later during the meeting, McGowan mentioned that Previte was coming up to Boston in a few days, and Luisi agreed to meet with both Previte and McGowan then. Luisi and his associates left with the film.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Previte came to Boston, and on March 16, 1999, he met with McGowan, Luisi, and some of Luisi's associates. The participants had a cryptic conversation during which, according to McGowan, Luisi confirmed that he would get the cocaine-for-diamonds deal done. The following day, McGowan talked to Luisi over the phone, and again inquired into the status of the cocaine deal with Previte. Luisi replied that he would work on it, but indicated that the deal would not happen immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this time, Luisi had also been trying to sell the film that McGowan had given him on March 11th. He was unable to do so at a price that McGowan was willing to accept, and so on March 19th Luisi returned the film. After Luisi again expressed his preference for jewelry, and after McGowan again reaffirmed his ability to get jewelry, the conversation turned back to the proposed diamonds-for-cocaine deal. Luisi made comments that, if taken at face value, expressed a reluctance to go ahead with the deal and indicated that Luisi had \"nothing to do with\" the cocaine business. Luisi also explained to McGowan that \"in the last . . . three years I lost over a dozen and a half guys to that. . . . And I have to make a stern, a firm stand here. . . . I don't wanna have nothing to do with it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi then said that he would send a guy named Danny White, not affiliated with Luisi, to do the deal. Luisi told McGowan that once White made contact with McGowan, McGowan would have exactly seven days to complete the transaction. Luisi and McGowan also discussed cash terms for the deal (even though the deal had originally been conceived of as a barter for diamonds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi testified that Danny White actually is a fictitious person whom Luisi made up in order to pretend that he was cooperating with McGowan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> McGowan testified that he never met White at any point, that he never had any conversation with him, and that he did not know whether White was a fictitious person or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi and McGowan had no contact with each other for the next three weeks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On April 19, 1999, McGowan initiated a phone conversation with Luisi. McGowan turned the discussion to dealings with Previte, and Luisi responded that \"[e]verything's gonna be okay soon.\" McGowan understood this to be a reference to the cocaine transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGowan initiated another phone conversation with Luisi on April 23, 1999. McGowan told him that Previte would be coming to Boston on April 28th, and he asked Luisi to be available then. Luisi said he would probably be available, and he also said \"I'm ah gonna be calling you ah with my other friend any day.\" McGowan interpreted the \"other friend\" to be a reference to Danny White. In the same phone conversation, McGowan mentioned that he might soon have more stolen property coming in.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 1999, one day before Previte's planned trip to Boston, Previte had a conversation with Merlino, his superior in the LCN. Previte was wearing a wire, and the conversation was recorded. As revealed by the tape, Previte complained to Merlino that Luisi had not yet done the cocaine transaction, despite Luisi's representations. Previte explained to Merlino that he had \"big money sittin[g] on the line,\" and that Merlino would also make money from the transaction. He directly asked Merlino if there was \"any way you could just tell [Luisi] to do what he gotta do.\" Merlino agreed to do so. Previte and Merlino then agreed that when Previte went to Boston the next day, Previte would put Luisi on the phone with Merlino, at which point Merlino would tell Luisi to do the cocaine deal. As Merlino put it on the tape: \"I'll say [to Luisi:] whatever [Previte] says to do[,] just do it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Previte was still cooperating with the FBI at the time he had the conversation with Merlino, and a jury could conclude that the FBI had in fact directed Previte's request of Merlino. Previte did not testify, nor did any of the Philadelphia FBI agents who had worked with him. But McGowan was asked if the FBI had arranged the meeting between Previte and Merlino, and his response was that while he did not know, he \"assume[d] so because Previte was cooperating.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Previte flew to Boston on the morning of April 28th, the day after his conversation with Merlino. He went to McGowan's office, and McGowan arranged for Previte to make a three-way call with LCN boss Merlino and Capo Luisi, Merlino's underling. The call was recorded in its entirety. It began with Previte calling Luisi. Once Luisi was on the line, Previte brought Merlino into the conversation. After an exchange of preliminaries, Merlino (somewhat cryptically) got down to business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Luisi testified that he understood Merlino to be ordering him to get the cocaine deal done, and that he agreed to do the deal as a result of this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGowan, who had been listening in to the conversation, testified to having a similar understanding. As he put it, \"[a]fter this phone conversation, I expected to receive cocaine.\" His hopes were soon realized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within an hour after Merlino spoke to Luisi, Luisi met with Previte and McGowan to confirm details of the drug transaction. Initially, Previte and Luisi had a private conversation to work out certain points, and Previte explained that McGowan wanted to do multiple cocaine deals. Luisi agreed, and the private conversation ended shortly thereafter. With Luisi looking on, Previte then informed McGowan that the mysterious Danny White would not be playing a role in the deal, and that his place would be taken by Shawn Vetere, one of Luisi's associates. Vetere promptly put McGowan in touch with Bobby Carrozza.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> McGowan worked out more details with Carrozza. On April 30, 1999 &#8212; two days after the call with Merlino &#8212; Carrozza sold two kilograms of cocaine to McGowan. Carrozza told McGowan that the cocaine came \"right from [Luisi and Vetere]. I wouldn't be able to do it any other way.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks later, McGowan gave Luisi a $1,000 \"tribute\" payment for arranging the transaction. McGowan and Luisi also engaged in preliminary discussions about a future cocaine deal, and Luisi told McGowan to work the rest out with Carrozza. McGowan did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next cocaine delivery was not immediately forthcoming, however. On May 24, 1999, McGowan complained to Luisi, who told him to be patient. On June 1, 1999, Luisi proposed certain changes to the impending cocaine transaction; McGowan agreed to the revised cocaine deal the next day, and he paid Luisi the $24,000 cash price. On June 3, 1999, Carrozza and Tommy Wilson (another of Luisi's associates) came to McGowan's office to deliver one kilogram of cocaine. McGowan later gave Luisi a $500 \"tribute\" payment for arranging the deal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi was the sole witness to testify for the defense. He testified to several additional pertinent points. He admitted that he had been a captain in the LCN since the fall of 1998, and he agreed that the LCN was properly described as \"the Mafia\" and as \"the mob.\" As a captain, one of his jobs had been to make \"tribute\" payments to Merlino, and these payments had come out of Luisi's earnings from the criminal enterprises conducted by his \"crew\" in Boston. Luisi explained that the LCN was extremely hierarchical, and he stated that when the head of the LCN ordered him to do the cocaine transaction, he felt that he had no alternative other than to fulfill the order. He was also asked why he had engaged in the second cocaine transaction; while he did not specifically reference Merlino's order, he responded that he had not wanted to do the drug deal, and he did so because he \"had to bring money to Philadelphia\" and so he \"was desperate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi admitted that at one point in his life he had been involved in drug distribution. However, he testified that he stopped his involvement in that business when he joined the LCN in mid-1998, and he gave several reasons for this. At the time Luisi joined, Georgie Borghesi (another LCN captain) and Merlino both told Luisi that he was not to deal drugs. Additionally, Luisi testified that around that time he had a \"spiritual encounter,\" and he realized that his \"whole lifestyle was wrong.\" Because he was an LCN captain, he found it difficult to realize fully his spiritual aspirations, but he testified that he was at least partially able to implement them by ending his involvement with drugs as of late 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi also offered an explanation for why he had seemed receptive to the cocaine deal, even before receiving the order from Merlino on April 28th. He claimed he had been trying to \"pal off\" McGowan and Previte; that is, he politely pretended to be cooperating with them on the drug deal, while in fact he had no intention of ever delivering drugs to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the jury was instructed, Luisi's attorney asked the district court to dismiss the case on the ground that the government had engaged in allegedly outrageous conduct, thereby violating Luisi's due process rights. The court never ruled on that motion; such a motion is an issue for the judge and not the jury. <i>See United States v. Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d 3, 7 n. 5 (1st Cir. 1987). However, over the government's objection, the district court did agree that Luisi was entitled to an entrapment instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's entrapment instructions correctly informed the jury that the government had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Luisi had not been entrapped. <i>See United States v. Walter,</i> 434 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.2006). The district court further explained that the government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at least one of two things was true: either (1) \"no government agent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> or person acting on behalf [of] or . . . under [the] auspices of the government persuaded or induced the defendant to commit\" the charged crimes; or (2) \"the defendant was ready and willing to commit the [charged] crime[s] without persuasion from the government.\" This was also a correct statement of the law. <i>See United States v. Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1998) (explaining that the two prongs of an entrapment defense are improper government inducement and lack of predisposition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi specifically asked for an instruction indicating that if the jury found that Previte had induced Merlino, that meant that Merlino's order could be considered government action. The district court refused, stating that the instruction was improper because there was a factual dispute over whether the government's responsibility ended due to the presence of an intermediary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after commencing deliberations, the jury sent the court a question that revealed it was considering Merlino's role and how it related to the entrapment defense. The jury asked: \"Is Merlino's request of Luisi, if determined to be excessive pressure, considered to be government persuasion or inducement because the contact between Merlino and Luisi resulted from the government agent Previte and Merlino?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court and the parties researched the issue overnight, and returned in the morning to discuss the proper response. Luisi contended that because Previte had spoken to Merlino about the cocaine transaction, and because Merlino's order had been facilitated by Previte and McGowan (the latter of whom had actually placed the three-way call to Merlino), the actions of Merlino, Previte, and McGowan together could be attributed to the government. The government disagreed, and based its argument on a case from outside this circuit, <i>United States v. Washington,</i> 106 F.3d 983 (D.C.Cir.1997). The government described Luisi's asserted defense as \"derivative entrapment,\" and it claimed that <i>Washington</i> was the only case it could find recognizing the defense. As the government read <i>Washington,</i> Luisi's claim was foreclosed on the facts presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court took a different route, and it ultimately concluded that a case from this circuit, <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> was controlling. In <i>Bradley</i> a prison inmate named Constanza, who could have been deemed to have been acting as a government agent, directly threatened an intermediary named Brenner to do a drug deal on pain of physical harm. 820 F.2d at 5-6. The intermediary was unable to do the deal on his own, and he in turn pressured his friend &#8212; the defendant Bradley &#8212; to assist him. <i>See id.</i> at 7-8. We found the evidence sufficient to support an entrapment instruction for the intermediary Brenner, as the government agent had directly threatened him. <i>Id.</i> But we held that Brenner's friend, defendant Bradley, was not entitled to an entrapment instruction: while Brenner could claim duress, Bradley had \"only an appeal to sympathy, which he was free to reject.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7. We stated that we \"would not extend the [entrapment] defense to a remote defendant without, at least, a showing that pressure had been put upon him by the intermediary at the instruction of the government agent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus in <i>Bradley</i> this court rejected defendant Bradley's argument that the government's improper inducement of Brenner could be an indirect entrapment of Bradley, as the agent (Constanza) had neither ordered nor expected Brenner to entrap other persons. <i>See id.</i> at 7. We said that a \"quite different case would be presented if Constanza had targeted a putative seller and had instructed Brenner to put the arm on him.\" <i>Id.</i> We then added a footnote to \"suggest that such a case, though argued to be a third-party case, is not really a third-party case at all. The intermediary in such instance is really acting under instructions, as a government subagent &#8212; a quite different situation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7 n. 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court focused upon <i>Bradley's</i> use of the word \"instructions,\" and it read that case as concerned with whether the government agent (Previte) had \"instructed\" the intermediary (Merlino) to pressure Luisi. The court concluded that because Previte ranked below Merlino in the LCN hierarchy, Previte was in no position to \"instruct\" Merlino to do anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Luisi argued for a broader reading of the word \"instruct,\" the district court rejected such a reading of <i>Bradley.</i> In the alternative, Luisi asked that the jury be allowed to determine whether Merlino had been \"instructed,\" but the court rejected that option as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then called the jury back into the courtroom and answered the jury's question as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n your consideration of the entrapment question, you should focus your attention on the relationship &#8212; the direct relationship between Mr. Previte . . . and Mr. McGowan on the one hand, and Mr. Luisi on the other hand. You should consider evidence as [it] relates to the direct contact between and among those people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court omitted Merlino from this statement, while simultaneously mentioning other individuals, the jury likely concluded that it could not consider Merlino's role in any inducement of Luisi. This was particularly so since the jury's question specifically asked about Merlino, and the court told the jury to focus on individuals other than Merlino. As a result, and as the government has not disputed, the jury was precluded from finding that Merlino's order to Luisi could be deemed improper governmental inducement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, the jury convicted Luisi on all three counts of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi's primary contention on appeal is that the district court's jury instructions, as supplemented by its answer to the jury's question, were incorrect as a matter of law. We review that issue de novo here. <i>See United States v. Buttrick,</i> 432 F.3d 373, 376 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Luisi that the district court's instructions were erroneous. We begin by explaining the nature and policies behind the entrapment defense generally. We address <i>Bradley,</i> and conclude that it supports Luisi's claim of error. We also reject the government's alternative argument, which we review de novo, that there was no reversible error on the facts presented because Luisi was not entitled to any entrapment instruction whatsoever. <i>See United States v. Nishnianidze,</i> 342 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction so long as his legal theory is valid and there is evidence in the record to support it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Understanding the Entrapment Defense</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal criminal cases, the entrapment defense is neither a doctrine of constitutional dimension, nor a defense specifically granted by statute. <i>See United States v. Russell,</i> 411 U.S. 423, 432-33, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973). Rather, the defense has its origins in an inference about congressional intent. <i>Sherman v. United States,</i> 356 U.S. 369, 372, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958); <i>see also United States v. Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir.1994). The Supreme Court has explained that the \"function of law enforcement is the prevention of crime and the apprehension of criminals. Manifestly, that function does not include the manufacturing of crime. . . . Congress could not have intended that its statutes were to be enforced by tempting innocent persons into violations.\" <i>Sherman,</i> 356 U.S. at 372, 78 S.Ct. 819. A successful entrapment defense requires that there be a reasonable doubt on both prongs of a two-pronged test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first prong necessitates a showing of improper government inducement. <i>See Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9. This aspect of the defense plainly seeks to deter improper government conduct. <i>Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 961. Indeed, a defendant cannot claim entrapment when government conduct played no causal role in the defendant's inducement. <i>See Sherman,</i> 356 U.S. at 372, 78 S.Ct. 819. Nevertheless, the entrapment defense only deters government misbehavior in cases where the defendant would otherwise be law-abiding. <i>Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 962. That is because the second prong requires that the defendant have a lack of predisposition to commit the charged offense. <i>See id.; see also Sorrells v. United States,</i> 287 U.S. 435, 448, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two prongs, and the policy concerns behind them, play important roles in delimiting the scope of the entrapment defense. But they are not the only considerations that matter. This court and the Supreme Court have taken account of the practical problems facing law enforcement, particularly in the prosecution of \"victimless\" crimes where \"significant governmental involvement in illegal activities\" is often required. <i>Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 6-8; <i>see also Hampton v. United States,</i> 425 U.S. 484, 494-95 &amp; n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in the judgment); <i>Russell,</i> 411 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. 1637; <i>Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 961. We must be mindful that \"the defense of entrapment . . . [does] not . . . give the federal judiciary a `chancellor's foot' veto over law enforcement practices of which it [does] not approve.\" <i>Russell,</i> 411 U.S. at 435, 93 S.Ct. 1637.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These various considerations are sometimes in tension with one another, and we have treated the resolution of questions about the scope of the entrapment defense as essentially exercises in balancing. Indeed, in <i>Bradley</i> we weighed the competing factors and realized that we ultimately faced \"a question of social policy.\" 820 F.2d at 8; <i>cf. United States v. Hollingsworth,</i> 27 F.3d 1196, 1198 (7th Cir.1994) (en banc) (characterizing entrapment as a \"common law doctrine\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We synthesize the key facts on which we must balance competing concerns in this case. It is beyond dispute that an individual like Previte, hired by the government as an informant, is a \"government agent\" for entrapment purposes. <i>See Sherman,</i> 356 U.S. at 373-75, 78 S.Ct. 819. Nor can there be any dispute that Merlino's order to Luisi, with its implied threat of physical harm or other serious retribution, could be found by a jury to be improper inducement <i>if attributed to the government. See Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 961; <i>Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also clear that Luisi's case does not fit the pattern of what has come to be known as \"vicarious entrapment.\" In \"vicarious entrapment\" an unknowing middleman merely tells the defendant about an inducement that the government had used to target the middleman. <i>See United States v. Valencia,</i> 645 F.2d 1158, 1168-69 (2d Cir.1980) (recognizing the vicarious entrapment defense). Here, the target was not the middleman Merlino, but the defendant Luisi. Further, a jury could find that Merlino had himself threatened Luisi. This was not a case where Merlino repeated to Luisi a threat that Previte had made against Merlino. Indeed, Previte did not threaten Merlino at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, this case is much closer to what has been called \"derivative entrapment,\" a situation in which a government agent \"uses the unsuspecting middleman as a means of passing on an inducement\" to the defendant. 2 W. LaFave, <i>Substantive Criminal Law,</i> &#167; 9.8(a), at 93 (2d ed.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Yet even within this category, further refinement is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have before us a situation in which a jury could find that Previte specifically targeted Luisi, and then \"induced\" Merlino to give an order to Luisi when Merlino might not have otherwise done so. But Previte's inducement of <i>Merlino</i> does not appear to have itself been improper. Previte simply helped set up a drug transaction, explained to Merlino that Merlino would profit from the transaction's execution, and then encouraged Merlino to order Luisi's assistance. <i>Cf. Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 961-62 (explaining that improper inducement \"goes beyond providing an ordinary `opportunity to commit a crime,'\" and providing examples (quoting <i>Jacobson v. United States,</i> 503 U.S. 540, 550, 112 S.Ct. 1535, 118 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992))). A jury would presumably find that Previte merely provided an \"ordinary\" inducement to Merlino; it was Merlino's inducement of Luisi that a jury could find improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an unusual entrapment situation. Under the original, correct instructions given, it is evident that the jury was considering the possibility that Merlino had put excessive pressure on Luisi, and that the jurors were unsure whether Merlino's order could be considered \"government persuasion or inducement because the contact between Merlino and Luisi resulted from the government agent Previte.\" The effect of the court's response was the same as if it had instructed the jury, as a matter of law, that Merlino's order could not be considered <i>government</i> inducement or persuasion. We must decide whether the issue was correctly removed from the jury's consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Third-Party Entrapment After Bradley</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit, <i>Bradley</i> is the leading case on third-party entrapment. Like the district court, the government now believes that <i>Bradley</i> controls this case. We examine <i>Bradley's</i> facts and reasoning in greater detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government agent in <i>Bradley</i> was a prison inmate named Constanza. In exchange for a reduced sentence, Constanza agreed to identify drug dealers for the government to assist in undercover operations and prosecutions. <i>See Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 5. Constanza told the government about an individual named Brenner, and then he threatened Brenner with physical harm if Brenner did not engage in a cocaine deal with an undercover agent. <i>Id.</i> at 5. Brenner in turn appealed to his friend, defendant Bradley, for assistance in obtaining the cocaine. <i>Id.</i> at 6. Though Bradley initially refused, Brenner explained that his physical safety was in jeopardy. <i>Id.</i> Upon hearing this, Bradley decided to assist Brenner. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It should now be clear that <i>Bradley</i> presented a narrow fact pattern: it was a case of vicarious entrapment. That is, Brenner merely informed Bradley of a threat that had been made against Brenner, not one that had been made against Bradley. Although the Second Circuit's <i>Valencia</i> opinion had recognized that such a vicarious entrapment defense could be viable, we considered and rejected that position. <i>See id.</i> at 8. At the same time, however, we rejected the government's argument that a defendant can never be entrapped by a third party. <i>See id.</i> at 6-8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bradley</i> reached these conclusions by weighing a variety of policy considerations as applied to the facts of the case. On the one hand was the fact that the crime would not have happened but for the government's involvement. <i>See id.</i> at 6. On the other hand were several factors. First, the government's role in ensnaring Bradley was \"attenuated\" because the agent's threat neither ordered Brenner to seek assistance <i>nor expected it. Id.</i> at 7. Second, <i>Bradley</i> acknowledged the practical difficulties for the prosecution when it is forced to refute a defendant's claim of entrapment in a scenario where the only two witnesses &#8212; the defendant and the intermediary &#8212; are likely to be hostile to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>See id.</i> Third, <i>Bradley</i> observed that the defendant did commit a crime, exhibiting socially inappropriate behavior. <i>See id.</i> at 6. Finally, <i>Bradley</i> noted the fact that undercover investigations are often needed to prosecute drug crimes. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Bradley</i> court ultimately held that it \"would not extend the [entrapment] defense to a remote defendant without, at least, a showing that pressure had been put upon him by the intermediary at the instruction of the government agent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8. The government reads \"instruct\" to mean \"command,\" such that Previte is not responsible for Merlino's threats against Luisi unless Previte had commanded Merlino to order Luisi into the cocaine deal. Luisi reads \"instruct\" to mean \"convince\" or \"inform.\" But the dispute about the use of particular language in <i>Bradley</i> is largely beside the point. <i>Bradley</i> was a case in which the government agent neither \"commanded,\" \"convinced,\" nor \"informed\" the middleman (Brenner) to target Bradley. Indeed, it was the lack of any government targeting of Bradley <i>whatsoever</i> on which <i>Bradley</i> relied. <i>See id.</i> at 7. Here, unlike in <i>Bradley,</i> the government's actions were specifically designed to pressure Luisi, and the government in fact expected that Luisi would be pressured. <i>Bradley</i> thus had no occasion to consider the fact pattern at hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Rogers,</i> 102 F.3d 641 (1st Cir.1996), we considered a fact pattern that was more on point. In <i>Rogers,</i> the defendant did not move quickly to complete a drug transaction that an undercover agent had attempted to facilitate. <i>Id.</i> at 645. In an isolated statement, the government agent \"told\" the middleman to \"put some heat on [the defendant].\" <i>Id.</i> The agent had thus specifically targeted the defendant to receive an inducement, and <i>Rogers</i> relied on <i>Bradley</i> to conclude that the government would have been responsible if the agent had \"told\" the middleman \"to apply the pressure or inducement <i>later deemed improper.\" Id.</i> (emphasis added) (italics removed). However, <i>Rogers</i> factually did not involve an agent's suggestion that <i>improper</i> pressure be applied to the defendant because \"putting on some heat\" was not improper. <i>Rogers</i> distinguished the more sinister suggestion of putting \"the arm\" on someone, a phrase that implied threatened force. <i>Id.</i> at 645-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus after <i>Rogers,</i> the law in this circuit permits an entrapment instruction involving a middleman when there is evidence that (1) a government agent specifically targeted the defendant in order to induce him to commit illegal conduct; (2) the agent acted through the middleman after other government attempts at inducing the defendant had failed; (3) the government agent requested, encouraged, or instructed the middleman to employ a specified inducement, which could be found improper, against the targeted defendant; (4) the agent's actions led the middleman to do what the government sought, even if the government did not use improper means to influence the middleman; and (5) as a result of the middleman's inducement, the targeted defendant in fact engaged in the illegal conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government reads <i>Rogers</i> differently. It contends that the word \"told\" in <i>Rogers</i> must mean an imperative equivalent to the government's interpretation of \"instruct\" in <i>Bradley.</i> It also reads <i>Rogers</i> to state a requirement that the agent have <i>improperly</i> induced the middleman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. First, we think that the government's argument is contrary to the plain meaning of \"told,\" and we see nothing in the context of <i>Rogers</i> that overrides this. Indeed, in concluding that the agent had not \"told\" the middleman to improperly induce the defendant, <i>Rogers</i> pointed out that \"nothing in the record show[ed] that [the agent] <i>urged, suggested</i> or was even aware of\" the middleman's improper inducement. <i>See</i> 102 F.3d at 645 (emphases added). Urging and suggesting are hardly equivalent to ordering, nor do they by themselves necessarily constitute improper inducement. Second, if the <i>Rogers</i> court had in fact read <i>Bradley</i> the same way as the government does, we do not see how the <i>Rogers</i> court could have considered it an open question whether the government can be responsible for an agent's mere knowing tolerance of improper inducement by a middleman.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the policy concerns discussed in <i>Bradley</i> support our reading of <i>Rogers. Bradley</i> thought it important that the government's role was \"attenuated\" in that case because the agent had not attempted to ensnare the defendant. <i>Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 7. But in a case where the government agent specifically targets the defendant, and then causes the middleman to take a specifically contemplated action (that is arguably improper pressure) with the goal of ensnaring the defendant, the government's role is hardly attenuated. Additionally, <i>Bradley</i> worried about the fact that the government had turned a potentially innocent person into a criminal, <i>see id.</i> at 6, though it ultimately decided that this concern was outweighed by other issues. But in <i>Bradley</i> the government had never attempted to induce defendant Bradley directly. <i>Bradley's</i> concern for potential innocents weighs heavier when the government has tried &#8212; and failed &#8212; to induce the defendant without the use of a middleman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of our understanding of the law, we think a properly instructed jury could conclude that the government was responsible for Merlino's order to Luisi. Indeed, such a jury could decide that: (1) Previte specifically requested that Merlino order Luisi to engage in the cocaine deal; (2) Previte's request came after earlier government efforts to ensnare Luisi, without a middleman, had not been fruitful; (3) Previte, as an LCN captain, understood that the order he requested from Merlino would contain an implied threat of death, physical harm, or serious retribution if Luisi failed to comply; (4) Merlino's order to Luisi was exactly what Previte had requested; and (5) Merlino would not have given the order if Previte had not encouraged him to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> As a result, we think that the district court incorrectly answered the jury's question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result is supported by a Fifth Circuit case. In <i>United States v. Anderton,</i> 629 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir.1980), the Fifth Circuit allowed the entrapment defense in a case where law enforcement officers specifically targeted the defendant, and then put unspecified \"pressure\" on the unwitting middleman to bring the defendant into a pre-designed criminal scheme. <i>Id.</i> at 1045, 1047. Without discussing whether the middleman had been improperly induced, the court found it important that the criminal design originated from the government itself. <i>See id.</i> at 1046-47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is also supported by the D.C. Circuit's analysis in <i>Washington.</i> In <i>Washington,</i> an undercover FBI agent posed as a drug lord and recruited a corrupt police officer to help him. <i>See</i> 106 F.3d at 990-91. After paying the officer for his services, the agent \"asked [the officer] . . . to recruit as many new officers as he could.\" <i>Id.</i> at 991. The corrupt officer agreed, <i>see id.,</i> but then recruited the defendants with an inducement not contemplated by the undercover agent. <i>See id.</i> at 992, 994-95. The <i>Washington</i> court rejected the derivative entrapment instruction on the facts of the case. <i>Id.</i> at 995. Importantly, however, it held that the entrapment defense is available where the government does contemplate the improper inducement given to the defendant, and causes the middleman to give that inducement as a result of a government agent's \"`instruction or direction.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 993 (quoting <i>United States v. Layeni,</i> 90 F.3d 514, 520 (D.C.Cir.1996)); <i>see also id.</i> at 995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites to other cases, but none presented the fact pattern at issue here. <i>See, e.g., Hollingsworth,</i> 27 F.3d at 1200-02, 1204-05; <i>United States v. Hodges,</i> 936 F.2d 371, 371-72 (8th Cir.1991); <i>United States v. Pilarinos,</i> 864 F.2d 253, 254-56 (2d Cir.1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The Seventh Circuit has even intimated that the defense might be available when a government agent specifically targets the defendant, and then encourages the middleman to induce that defendant. <i>See Hollingsworth,</i> 27 F.3d at 1204 (citing, inter alia, <i>Bradley</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus we conclude that the district court erred in answering the jury's question in a way that excluded Merlino's order from the jury's consideration. We do not suggest that a jury would necessarily have concluded that Luisi was entrapped through Merlino. We hold only that the defendant was entitled to have a properly instructed jury consider the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Predisposition</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback argument, the government contends that Luisi failed to present sufficient evidence of his lack of predisposition, and thus was not entitled to any entrapment instruction at all. We readily dispose of this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A judge may only instruct the jury on entrapment if the defendant meets his entry-level burden of production. <i>United States v. Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir.1994). That is, a defendant is entitled to an entrapment instruction only if there is \"some evidence,\" on both elements of the entrapment defense, sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the defendant was merely an unwary innocent. <i>See United States v. Joost,</i> 92 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1996). The defendant must show \"more than a scintilla of evidence, more than mere creation of an opportunity for criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i> Nonetheless, even a defendant's self-serving testimony can suffice, especially when it has some circumstantial corroboration. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi made the requisite entry-level showing. We have already explained why a jury could find improper governmental inducement. Additionally, Luisi introduced \"some evidence\" of his lack of predisposition. He testified that sometime before he met McGowan, he experienced a \"spiritual encounter,\" and that as a result of this spiritual encounter he resolved to stop dealing drugs. This story was consistent with evidence that Luisi had deliberately stalled the drug transaction for several months to \"pal off\" McGowan, thereby indefinitely delaying a drug deal to which Luisi was opposed. Indeed, a jury could find that this two-<i>month</i> delay stood in stark contrast to the two-<i>day</i> lag between when Merlino gave Luisi the order, and when McGowan received drugs from Luisi's colleagues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government suggests that Luisi's \"spiritual encounter\" was not credible, and that there was \"overwhelming\" evidence of Luisi's predisposition, including the fact that he previously had been a cocaine dealer, and the fact that Luisi continued to receive profits from small drug deals undertaken by one of his associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this procedural posture, however, our job is not \"to weigh the evidence, make credibility determinations, or resolve conflicts in the proof.\" <i>Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9. Accordingly, we find that Luisi introduced sufficient evidence of his lack of predisposition to entitle him to an entrapment instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi further argues that the charges against him in fact should have been dismissed because the government engaged in outrageous conduct that violated his due process rights. Outrageous government conduct is an issue of law, and it is the province of the district court &#8212; and not the jury &#8212; to rule on a defendant's motion to dismiss on that ground. <i>See Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 7 n. 5. When a district court rules on such a motion, its ultimate conclusion is subject to de novo review, while its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <i>See United States v. Guzman,</i> 282 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court never ruled on Luisi's motion, and thus we have no factual findings in the record to assist us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Nonetheless, we think that the basic facts needed to rule on this matter are clear enough, and that we are able to reach the necessary legal conclusions. Luisi has asked us to find that the government's conduct was outrageous, and the government has also asked us to resolve the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The outrageousness doctrine permits dismissal of criminal charges only in those very rare instances when the government's misconduct is so appalling and egregious as to violate due process by \"shocking . . . the universal sense of justice.\" <i>Russell,</i> 411 U.S. at 432, 93 S.Ct. 1637 (quoting <i>Kinsella v.

By contrast, the Fourth Circuit has used it to refer to <i>all</i> third-party entrapment cases. <i>See United States v. Squillacote,</i> 221 F.3d 542, 573-74 &amp; n. 19 (4th Cir.2000). The definition we use, which comes from a leading criminal law treatise, is a broad definition that is useful in distinguishing \"derivative entrapment\" from \"vicarious entrapment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The case at hand does not present that concern. There is a tape recording of the conversation in which the middleman pressured Luisi. Moreover, the government agent (Previte) in fact participated in that conversation, while another government agent (McGowan) listened in. Consequently, the government faced fewer practical difficulties in refuting Luisi's entrapment claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> We also had no occasion to consider such a fact pattern in<i>United States v. Murphy,</i> 852 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1988). In that case, after we rejected the defendants' entrapment arguments, we relied on <i>Bradley</i> to explain why one defendant's claim to an entrapment instruction was \"foreclosed for an additional reason.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6. We noted that to allow the claim \"we would have [had] to create the fiction that [the government agent] <i>forced</i> [the intermediary] into dealing with\" the defendant. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). To the extent that our use of the word \"forced\" can be taken to imply a requirement of coercion, such an implication was dicta, as the government agent in the case never encouraged the middleman to bring anyone into the scheme, let alone the defendant. <i>See id.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We similarly did not deal with a pertinent fact pattern in <i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> 995 F.2d 307, 313 (1st Cir.1993). Like <i>Bradley</i> and <i>Murphy,</i> the case involved no government targeting of the individual defendant. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Contrary to our precedent, several circuits categorically deny the entrapment defense in<i>all</i> third-party situations where the middleman is unaware that he is helping the government. <i>See Squillacote,</i> 221 F.3d at 574; <i>United States v. Thickstun,</i> 110 F.3d 1394, 1398 (9th Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Martinez,</i> 979 F.2d 1424, 1432 (10th Cir.1992). The Third Circuit's law varies. <i>Compare United States v. Klosterman,</i> 248 F.2d 191, 195-96 (3d Cir. 1957) (concluding that the third-party entrapment defense was available in a case where the defendant was specifically targeted and the middleman was unwitting), <i>with United States v. Beverly,</i> 723 F.2d 11, 12 (3d Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (failing to cite <i>Klosterman</i> and claiming that the third-party entrapment defense is categorically unavailable when the middleman is unwitting). With the possible exception of the Ninth Circuit's opinion in <i>United States v. Emmert,</i> 829 F.2d 805 (9th Cir.1987), we are unaware of any cases in which these circuits have rejected the third-party defense when confronted with the kind of fact pattern we face here. As for <i>Emmert,</i> we respectfully disagree with the Ninth Circuit's conclusions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Mere knowing tolerance is not presented by the facts here, and we do not reach that issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the jury's question was premised on the idea that the government had caused Merlino to give the order. While the government observes that there was no evidence introduced at trial as to Merlino's lack of predisposition, none was needed. The premise of the jury's question was perfectly consistent with a finding that Merlino was predisposed to be involved in a cocaine transaction<i>See Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 962 (distinguishing lack of predisposition from simple causation).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The government reads<i>Washington</i> differently, concluding that <i>Washington</i> requires the actual inducement applied to the intermediary to be the same kind of inducement applied to the defendant. This reading seems premised on an assumption that the FBI agent in <i>Washington</i> had improperly induced the middleman. Yet the court merely described the agent as \"asking\" for the middleman's assistance. <i>Washington,</i> 106 F.3d at 991. <i>Washington</i> contains no explanation of how this inducement was improper, and the court's logic suggests that any inquiry into the propriety of the agent's request would be irrelevant. Moreover, <i>Washington</i> cited an earlier D.C. Circuit case &#8212; <i>Layeni</i> &#8212; for its rule. <i>See id.</i> at 993-95. <i>Layeni</i> had in turn implied that the derivative entrapment defense is available if a government agent merely \"suggests\" to an intermediary that he apply particular inducements to a defendant. <i>See Layeni,</i> 90 F.3d at 518.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have, in somewhat limited fashion, also rejected unwitting intermediary claims on the facts presented<i>See, e.g., United States v.

His defense was entrapment, on intertwined theories. He claimed that Previte, acting for the government along with undercover FBI agent Michael McGowan, had improperly tried to induce him to commit drug crimes. He further claimed that when he resisted, Previte persuaded Philadelphia LCN boss Joseph Merlino to order Luisi to engage in the charged drug transactions. Merlino was Luisi's superior in the LCN, and the government was aware of the serious consequences Luisi would face if he refused to follow Merlino's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury on the entrapment defense. However, the court's supplemental instructions &#8212; given in response to a jury question &#8212; foreclosed the jury from considering Merlino's role in the asserted government entrapment of Luisi. We conclude that those instructions were erroneous, and we vacate the convictions and remand the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1999, a grand jury in the District of Massachusetts indicted Luisi and three co-defendants on three charges: one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846, and two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 841(a). The conspiracy was alleged to have run from February 1999 through June 28, 1999. The two possession counts stemmed from transactions on April 30, 1999, and June 3, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to plea agreements with the government, two of Luisi's co-defendants pled guilty to the possession counts. The indictment against the third was dismissed following that defendant's death, leaving Luisi as the sole defendant at a trial that commenced on September 9, 2002. We recount the key testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1990s, the FBI conducted a major investigation into the operations of the Philadelphia LCN. Previte, a captain or \"capo regime\" in the LCN, assisted the FBI investigation by working as a cooperating witness under a personal services contract with the FBI. He was paid a substantial sum of money in return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FBI came to learn that Luisi was working for the Philadelphia LCN as a captain, and that he was supervising the criminal activity that the organization undertook in Boston. Eager to get evidence against Luisi, the FBI had Previte introduce Luisi to McGowan, who posed as a source of illegal money-making opportunities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The introduction took place over January 11th and 12th, 1999. McGowan operated under the pseudonym \"Michael O'Sullivan\" and purported to be in the import/export business. He told Luisi he had previously worked with Capo Previte in Philadelphia, and said he had now relocated to Boston. McGowan explained to Luisi that as part of his business he was sometimes presented with \"opportunities\" and that sometimes he needed help taking advantage of these \"deals.\" Luisi agreed that he would look at future deals with McGowan. Unbeknownst to Luisi, this conversation was being recorded by the FBI &#8212; as were the vast majority of the future conversations Luisi would have with McGowan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first \"opportunity\" occurred on February 10, 1999, when McGowan presented Luisi with several \"stolen\" furs. Luisi was not sure if he would be able to sell them, but he stated he would look into it. He also inquired whether McGowan had other items; when McGowan mentioned the possibility of obtaining jewelry, Luisi expressed more interest in that, and particularly in diamonds. There was no mention of any drugs at this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days later, Luisi and Previte spoke to each other at a party in Philadelphia. Merlino was also present at the party. Luisi testified that Previte proposed a \"swap\" of cocaine for diamonds, and that Luisi's response was that he would \"try\" to get the deal done. He testified that he gave this response because \"at the party [Merlino] . . . made it very clear to me that he wanted these drugs,\" although Luisi later clarified that he did not at that time understand Merlino to be giving an \"order\" to do the deal, but merely \"permission.\" That would change. In any event, Luisi testified that at or shortly after the party he chose not to do the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 8, 1999, McGowan again met with Luisi, along with two of Luisi's associates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> McGowan referred to Previte's proposed swap and stated that he (McGowan) knew a guy with diamonds, and that the guy was looking to exchange them for \"three bricks.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Luisi's immediate response was: \"I want to get them, I want to bring them to [a jeweler friend of mine], if he likes it, boom. We'll do the deal and I'll do it that way, whatever [Previte] wants.\" McGowan interpreted this to mean that Luisi wanted to see the diamonds, and that he would be willing to exchange cocaine for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several minutes later, however, Luisi took McGowan aside privately. This part of the conversation was not recorded. According to McGowan, Luisi told him that because Previte had referred McGowan to him, Luisi would make \"every effort\" to get the cocaine, but it would be difficult and it would take time. Luisi testified that he did not actually agree to do a drugs-for-diamonds swap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also during the March 8th conversation, McGowan asked Luisi what items, other than the diamonds, he would be interested in. Luisi responded that he would be interested in jewelry, watches, and cigarettes, and some of his associates mentioned film and razor blades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGowan's next meeting with Luisi and his associates came on March 11, 1999. McGowan had some \"stolen\" Polaroid film, and the participants discussed how it was to be sold. Luisi reported on his only partially successful attempts to sell fur coats, and the participants also discussed diamonds and jewelry. Later during the meeting, McGowan mentioned that Previte was coming up to Boston in a few days, and Luisi agreed to meet with both Previte and McGowan then. Luisi and his associates left with the film.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Previte came to Boston, and on March 16, 1999, he met with McGowan, Luisi, and some of Luisi's associates. The participants had a cryptic conversation during which, according to McGowan, Luisi confirmed that he would get the cocaine-for-diamonds deal done. The following day, McGowan talked to Luisi over the phone, and again inquired into the status of the cocaine deal with Previte. Luisi replied that he would work on it, but indicated that the deal would not happen immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this time, Luisi had also been trying to sell the film that McGowan had given him on March 11th. He was unable to do so at a price that McGowan was willing to accept, and so on March 19th Luisi returned the film. After Luisi again expressed his preference for jewelry, and after McGowan again reaffirmed his ability to get jewelry, the conversation turned back to the proposed diamonds-for-cocaine deal. Luisi made comments that, if taken at face value, expressed a reluctance to go ahead with the deal and indicated that Luisi had \"nothing to do with\" the cocaine business. Luisi also explained to McGowan that \"in the last . . . three years I lost over a dozen and a half guys to that. . . . And I have to make a stern, a firm stand here. . . . I don't wanna have nothing to do with it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi then said that he would send a guy named Danny White, not affiliated with Luisi, to do the deal. Luisi told McGowan that once White made contact with McGowan, McGowan would have exactly seven days to complete the transaction. Luisi and McGowan also discussed cash terms for the deal (even though the deal had originally been conceived of as a barter for diamonds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi testified that Danny White actually is a fictitious person whom Luisi made up in order to pretend that he was cooperating with McGowan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> McGowan testified that he never met White at any point, that he never had any conversation with him, and that he did not know whether White was a fictitious person or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi and McGowan had no contact with each other for the next three weeks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On April 19, 1999, McGowan initiated a phone conversation with Luisi. McGowan turned the discussion to dealings with Previte, and Luisi responded that \"[e]verything's gonna be okay soon.\" McGowan understood this to be a reference to the cocaine transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGowan initiated another phone conversation with Luisi on April 23, 1999. McGowan told him that Previte would be coming to Boston on April 28th, and he asked Luisi to be available then. Luisi said he would probably be available, and he also said \"I'm ah gonna be calling you ah with my other friend any day.\" McGowan interpreted the \"other friend\" to be a reference to Danny White. In the same phone conversation, McGowan mentioned that he might soon have more stolen property coming in.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 1999, one day before Previte's planned trip to Boston, Previte had a conversation with Merlino, his superior in the LCN. Previte was wearing a wire, and the conversation was recorded. As revealed by the tape, Previte complained to Merlino that Luisi had not yet done the cocaine transaction, despite Luisi's representations. Previte explained to Merlino that he had \"big money sittin[g] on the line,\" and that Merlino would also make money from the transaction. He directly asked Merlino if there was \"any way you could just tell [Luisi] to do what he gotta do.\" Merlino agreed to do so. Previte and Merlino then agreed that when Previte went to Boston the next day, Previte would put Luisi on the phone with Merlino, at which point Merlino would tell Luisi to do the cocaine deal. As Merlino put it on the tape: \"I'll say [to Luisi:] whatever [Previte] says to do[,] just do it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Previte was still cooperating with the FBI at the time he had the conversation with Merlino, and a jury could conclude that the FBI had in fact directed Previte's request of Merlino. Previte did not testify, nor did any of the Philadelphia FBI agents who had worked with him. But McGowan was asked if the FBI had arranged the meeting between Previte and Merlino, and his response was that while he did not know, he \"assume[d] so because Previte was cooperating.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Previte flew to Boston on the morning of April 28th, the day after his conversation with Merlino. He went to McGowan's office, and McGowan arranged for Previte to make a three-way call with LCN boss Merlino and Capo Luisi, Merlino's underling. The call was recorded in its entirety. It began with Previte calling Luisi. Once Luisi was on the line, Previte brought Merlino into the conversation. After an exchange of preliminaries, Merlino (somewhat cryptically) got down to business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Luisi testified that he understood Merlino to be ordering him to get the cocaine deal done, and that he agreed to do the deal as a result of this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGowan, who had been listening in to the conversation, testified to having a similar understanding. As he put it, \"[a]fter this phone conversation, I expected to receive cocaine.\" His hopes were soon realized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within an hour after Merlino spoke to Luisi, Luisi met with Previte and McGowan to confirm details of the drug transaction. Initially, Previte and Luisi had a private conversation to work out certain points, and Previte explained that McGowan wanted to do multiple cocaine deals. Luisi agreed, and the private conversation ended shortly thereafter. With Luisi looking on, Previte then informed McGowan that the mysterious Danny White would not be playing a role in the deal, and that his place would be taken by Shawn Vetere, one of Luisi's associates. Vetere promptly put McGowan in touch with Bobby Carrozza.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> McGowan worked out more details with Carrozza. On April 30, 1999 &#8212; two days after the call with Merlino &#8212; Carrozza sold two kilograms of cocaine to McGowan. Carrozza told McGowan that the cocaine came \"right from [Luisi and Vetere]. I wouldn't be able to do it any other way.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks later, McGowan gave Luisi a $1,000 \"tribute\" payment for arranging the transaction. McGowan and Luisi also engaged in preliminary discussions about a future cocaine deal, and Luisi told McGowan to work the rest out with Carrozza. McGowan did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next cocaine delivery was not immediately forthcoming, however. On May 24, 1999, McGowan complained to Luisi, who told him to be patient. On June 1, 1999, Luisi proposed certain changes to the impending cocaine transaction; McGowan agreed to the revised cocaine deal the next day, and he paid Luisi the $24,000 cash price. On June 3, 1999, Carrozza and Tommy Wilson (another of Luisi's associates) came to McGowan's office to deliver one kilogram of cocaine. McGowan later gave Luisi a $500 \"tribute\" payment for arranging the deal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi was the sole witness to testify for the defense. He testified to several additional pertinent points. He admitted that he had been a captain in the LCN since the fall of 1998, and he agreed that the LCN was properly described as \"the Mafia\" and as \"the mob.\" As a captain, one of his jobs had been to make \"tribute\" payments to Merlino, and these payments had come out of Luisi's earnings from the criminal enterprises conducted by his \"crew\" in Boston. Luisi explained that the LCN was extremely hierarchical, and he stated that when the head of the LCN ordered him to do the cocaine transaction, he felt that he had no alternative other than to fulfill the order. He was also asked why he had engaged in the second cocaine transaction; while he did not specifically reference Merlino's order, he responded that he had not wanted to do the drug deal, and he did so because he \"had to bring money to Philadelphia\" and so he \"was desperate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi admitted that at one point in his life he had been involved in drug distribution. However, he testified that he stopped his involvement in that business when he joined the LCN in mid-1998, and he gave several reasons for this. At the time Luisi joined, Georgie Borghesi (another LCN captain) and Merlino both told Luisi that he was not to deal drugs. Additionally, Luisi testified that around that time he had a \"spiritual encounter,\" and he realized that his \"whole lifestyle was wrong.\" Because he was an LCN captain, he found it difficult to realize fully his spiritual aspirations, but he testified that he was at least partially able to implement them by ending his involvement with drugs as of late 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi also offered an explanation for why he had seemed receptive to the cocaine deal, even before receiving the order from Merlino on April 28th. He claimed he had been trying to \"pal off\" McGowan and Previte; that is, he politely pretended to be cooperating with them on the drug deal, while in fact he had no intention of ever delivering drugs to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the jury was instructed, Luisi's attorney asked the district court to dismiss the case on the ground that the government had engaged in allegedly outrageous conduct, thereby violating Luisi's due process rights. The court never ruled on that motion; such a motion is an issue for the judge and not the jury. <i>See United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489321\"><a href=\"/opinion/489321/united-states-v-john-c-bradley-united-states-of-america-v-howard-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 n. 5 (1st Cir. 1987). However, over the government's objection, the district court did agree that Luisi was entitled to an entrapment instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's entrapment instructions correctly informed the jury that the government had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Luisi had not been entrapped. <i>See United States v. Walter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202006\"><a href=\"/opinion/202006/united-states-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2006). The district court further explained that the government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at least one of two things was true: either (1) \"no government agent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> or person acting on behalf [of] or . . . under [the] auspices of the government persuaded or induced the defendant to commit\" the charged crimes; or (2) \"the defendant was ready and willing to commit the [charged] crime[s] without persuasion from the government.\" This was also a correct statement of the law. <i>See United States v. Gamache,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198087\"><a href=\"/opinion/198087/united-states-v-gamache/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1998) (explaining that the two prongs of an entrapment defense are improper government inducement and lack of predisposition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi specifically asked for an instruction indicating that if the jury found that Previte had induced Merlino, that meant that Merlino's order could be considered government action. The district court refused, stating that the instruction was improper because there was a factual dispute over whether the government's responsibility ended due to the presence of an intermediary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after commencing deliberations, the jury sent the court a question that revealed it was considering Merlino's role and how it related to the entrapment defense. The jury asked: \"Is Merlino's request of Luisi, if determined to be excessive pressure, considered to be government persuasion or inducement because the contact between Merlino and Luisi resulted from the government agent Previte and Merlino?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court and the parties researched the issue overnight, and returned in the morning to discuss the proper response. Luisi contended that because Previte had spoken to Merlino about the cocaine transaction, and because Merlino's order had been facilitated by Previte and McGowan (the latter of whom had actually placed the three-way call to Merlino), the actions of Merlino, Previte, and McGowan together could be attributed to the government. The government disagreed, and based its argument on a case from outside this circuit, <i>United States v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735397\"><a href=\"/opinion/735397/united-states-v-dwayne-a-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1997). The government described Luisi's asserted defense as \"derivative entrapment,\" and it claimed that <i>Washington</i> was the only case it could find recognizing the defense. As the government read <i>Washington,</i> Luisi's claim was foreclosed on the facts presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court took a different route, and it ultimately concluded that a case from this circuit, <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> was controlling. In <i>Bradley</i> a prison inmate named Constanza, who could have been deemed to have been acting as a government agent, directly threatened an intermediary named Brenner to do a drug deal on pain of physical harm. 820 F.2d at 5-6. The intermediary was unable to do the deal on his own, and he in turn pressured his friend &#8212; the defendant Bradley &#8212; to assist him. <i>See id.</i> at 7-8. We found the evidence sufficient to support an entrapment instruction for the intermediary Brenner, as the government agent had directly threatened him. <i>Id.</i> But we held that Brenner's friend, defendant Bradley, was not entitled to an entrapment instruction: while Brenner could claim duress, Bradley had \"only an appeal to sympathy, which he was free to reject.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7. We stated that we \"would not extend the [entrapment] defense to a remote defendant without, at least, a showing that pressure had been put upon him by the intermediary at the instruction of the government agent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus in <i>Bradley</i> this court rejected defendant Bradley's argument that the government's improper inducement of Brenner could be an indirect entrapment of Bradley, as the agent (Constanza) had neither ordered nor expected Brenner to entrap other persons. <i>See id.</i> at 7. We said that a \"quite different case would be presented if Constanza had targeted a putative seller and had instructed Brenner to put the arm on him.\" <i>Id.</i> We then added a footnote to \"suggest that such a case, though argued to be a third-party case, is not really a third-party case at all. The intermediary in such instance is really acting under instructions, as a government subagent &#8212; a quite different situation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7 n. 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court focused upon <i>Bradley's</i> use of the word \"instructions,\" and it read that case as concerned with whether the government agent (Previte) had \"instructed\" the intermediary (Merlino) to pressure Luisi. The court concluded that because Previte ranked below Merlino in the LCN hierarchy, Previte was in no position to \"instruct\" Merlino to do anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Luisi argued for a broader reading of the word \"instruct,\" the district court rejected such a reading of <i>Bradley.</i> In the alternative, Luisi asked that the jury be allowed to determine whether Merlino had been \"instructed,\" but the court rejected that option as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then called the jury back into the courtroom and answered the jury's question as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n your consideration of the entrapment question, you should focus your attention on the relationship &#8212; the direct relationship between Mr. Previte . . . and Mr. McGowan on the one hand, and Mr. Luisi on the other hand. You should consider evidence as [it] relates to the direct contact between and among those people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court omitted Merlino from this statement, while simultaneously mentioning other individuals, the jury likely concluded that it could not consider Merlino's role in any inducement of Luisi. This was particularly so since the jury's question specifically asked about Merlino, and the court told the jury to focus on individuals other than Merlino. As a result, and as the government has not disputed, the jury was precluded from finding that Merlino's order to Luisi could be deemed improper governmental inducement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, the jury convicted Luisi on all three counts of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi's primary contention on appeal is that the district court's jury instructions, as supplemented by its answer to the jury's question, were incorrect as a matter of law. We review that issue de novo here. <i>See United States v. Buttrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201935\"><a href=\"/opinion/201935/united-states-v-buttrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, 376 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Luisi that the district court's instructions were erroneous. We begin by explaining the nature and policies behind the entrapment defense generally. We address <i>Bradley,</i> and conclude that it supports Luisi's claim of error. We also reject the government's alternative argument, which we review de novo, that there was no reversible error on the facts presented because Luisi was not entitled to any entrapment instruction whatsoever. <i>See United States v. Nishnianidze,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200612\"><a href=\"/opinion/200612/united-states-v-nishniandze/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction so long as his legal theory is valid and there is evidence in the record to support it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Understanding the Entrapment Defense</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal criminal cases, the entrapment defense is neither a doctrine of constitutional dimension, nor a defense specifically granted by statute. <i>See United States v.

The Supreme Court has explained that the \"function of law enforcement is the prevention of crime and the apprehension of criminals.

Congress could not have intended that its statutes were to be enforced by tempting innocent persons into violations.\" <i>Sherman,</i> 356 U.S. at 372, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105681\"><a href=\"/opinion/105681/sherman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This aspect of the defense plainly seeks to deter improper government conduct. <i>Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 961. Indeed, a defendant cannot claim entrapment when government conduct played no causal role in the defendant's inducement. <i>See Sherman,</i> 356 U.S. at 372, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105681\"><a href=\"/opinion/105681/sherman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nevertheless, the entrapment defense only deters government misbehavior in cases where the defendant would otherwise be law-abiding. <i>Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 962. That is because the second prong requires that the defendant have a lack of predisposition to commit the charged offense. <i>See id.; see also Sorrells v.

But they are not the only considerations that matter. This court and the Supreme Court have taken account of the practical problems facing law enforcement, particularly in the prosecution of \"victimless\" crimes where \"significant governmental involvement in illegal activities\" is often required. <i>Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 6-8; <i>see also Hampton v.

It is beyond dispute that an individual like Previte, hired by the government as an informant, is a \"government agent\" for entrapment purposes. <i>See Sherman,</i> 356 U.S. at 373-75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105681\"><a href=\"/opinion/105681/sherman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nor can there be any dispute that Merlino's order to Luisi, with its implied threat of physical harm or other serious retribution, could be found by a jury to be improper inducement <i>if attributed to the government. See Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 961; <i>Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also clear that Luisi's case does not fit the pattern of what has come to be known as \"vicarious entrapment.\" In \"vicarious entrapment\" an unknowing middleman merely tells the defendant about an inducement that the government had used to target the middleman. <i>See United States v. Valencia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389250\"><a href=\"/opinion/389250/united-states-v-olga-valencia-and-william-suarez-valencia/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span>, 1168-69 (2d Cir.1980) (recognizing the vicarious entrapment defense). Here, the target was not the middleman Merlino, but the defendant Luisi. Further, a jury could find that Merlino had himself threatened Luisi. This was not a case where Merlino repeated to Luisi a threat that Previte had made against Merlino. Indeed, Previte did not threaten Merlino at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, this case is much closer to what has been called \"derivative entrapment,\" a situation in which a government agent \"uses the unsuspecting middleman as a means of passing on an inducement\" to the defendant. 2 W. LaFave, <i>Substantive Criminal Law,</i> &#167; 9.8(a), at 93 (2d ed.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Yet even within this category, further refinement is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have before us a situation in which a jury could find that Previte specifically targeted Luisi, and then \"induced\" Merlino to give an order to Luisi when Merlino might not have otherwise done so. But Previte's inducement of <i>Merlino</i> does not appear to have itself been improper. Previte simply helped set up a drug transaction, explained to Merlino that Merlino would profit from the transaction's execution, and then encouraged Merlino to order Luisi's assistance. <i>Cf. Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 961-62 (explaining that improper inducement \"goes beyond providing an ordinary `opportunity to commit a crime,'\" and providing examples (quoting <i>Jacobson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112720\"><a href=\"/opinion/112720/jacobson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 550, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112720\"><a href=\"/opinion/112720/jacobson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A jury would presumably find that Previte merely provided an \"ordinary\" inducement to Merlino; it was Merlino's inducement of Luisi that a jury could find improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an unusual entrapment situation. Under the original, correct instructions given, it is evident that the jury was considering the possibility that Merlino had put excessive pressure on Luisi, and that the jurors were unsure whether Merlino's order could be considered \"government persuasion or inducement because the contact between Merlino and Luisi resulted from the government agent Previte.\" The effect of the court's response was the same as if it had instructed the jury, as a matter of law, that Merlino's order could not be considered <i>government</i> inducement or persuasion. We must decide whether the issue was correctly removed from the jury's consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Third-Party Entrapment After Bradley</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit, <i>Bradley</i> is the leading case on third-party entrapment. Like the district court, the government now believes that <i>Bradley</i> controls this case. We examine <i>Bradley's</i> facts and reasoning in greater detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government agent in <i>Bradley</i> was a prison inmate named Constanza. In exchange for a reduced sentence, Constanza agreed to identify drug dealers for the government to assist in undercover operations and prosecutions. <i>See Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 5. Constanza told the government about an individual named Brenner, and then he threatened Brenner with physical harm if Brenner did not engage in a cocaine deal with an undercover agent. <i>Id.</i> at 5. Brenner in turn appealed to his friend, defendant Bradley, for assistance in obtaining the cocaine. <i>Id.</i> at 6. Though Bradley initially refused, Brenner explained that his physical safety was in jeopardy. <i>Id.</i> Upon hearing this, Bradley decided to assist Brenner. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It should now be clear that <i>Bradley</i> presented a narrow fact pattern: it was a case of vicarious entrapment. That is, Brenner merely informed Bradley of a threat that had been made against Brenner, not one that had been made against Bradley. Although the Second Circuit's <i>Valencia</i> opinion had recognized that such a vicarious entrapment defense could be viable, we considered and rejected that position. <i>See id.</i> at 8. At the same time, however, we rejected the government's argument that a defendant can never be entrapped by a third party. <i>See id.</i> at 6-8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bradley</i> reached these conclusions by weighing a variety of policy considerations as applied to the facts of the case. On the one hand was the fact that the crime would not have happened but for the government's involvement. <i>See id.</i> at 6. On the other hand were several factors. First, the government's role in ensnaring Bradley was \"attenuated\" because the agent's threat neither ordered Brenner to seek assistance <i>nor expected it. Id.</i> at 7. Second, <i>Bradley</i> acknowledged the practical difficulties for the prosecution when it is forced to refute a defendant's claim of entrapment in a scenario where the only two witnesses &#8212; the defendant and the intermediary &#8212; are likely to be hostile to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>See id.</i> Third, <i>Bradley</i> observed that the defendant did commit a crime, exhibiting socially inappropriate behavior. <i>See id.</i> at 6. Finally, <i>Bradley</i> noted the fact that undercover investigations are often needed to prosecute drug crimes. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Bradley</i> court ultimately held that it \"would not extend the [entrapment] defense to a remote defendant without, at least, a showing that pressure had been put upon him by the intermediary at the instruction of the government agent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8. The government reads \"instruct\" to mean \"command,\" such that Previte is not responsible for Merlino's threats against Luisi unless Previte had commanded Merlino to order Luisi into the cocaine deal. Luisi reads \"instruct\" to mean \"convince\" or \"inform.\" But the dispute about the use of particular language in <i>Bradley</i> is largely beside the point. <i>Bradley</i> was a case in which the government agent neither \"commanded,\" \"convinced,\" nor \"informed\" the middleman (Brenner) to target Bradley. Indeed, it was the lack of any government targeting of Bradley <i>whatsoever</i> on which <i>Bradley</i> relied. <i>See id.</i> at 7. Here, unlike in <i>Bradley,</i> the government's actions were specifically designed to pressure Luisi, and the government in fact expected that Luisi would be pressured. <i>Bradley</i> thus had no occasion to consider the fact pattern at hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Rogers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197136\"><a href=\"/opinion/197136/united-states-v-rogers/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), we considered a fact pattern that was more on point. In <i>Rogers,</i> the defendant did not move quickly to complete a drug transaction that an undercover agent had attempted to facilitate. <i>Id.</i> at 645. In an isolated statement, the government agent \"told\" the middleman to \"put some heat on [the defendant].\" <i>Id.</i> The agent had thus specifically targeted the defendant to receive an inducement, and <i>Rogers</i> relied on <i>Bradley</i> to conclude that the government would have been responsible if the agent had \"told\" the middleman \"to apply the pressure or inducement <i>later deemed improper.\" Id.</i> (emphasis added) (italics removed). However, <i>Rogers</i> factually did not involve an agent's suggestion that <i>improper</i> pressure be applied to the defendant because \"putting on some heat\" was not improper. <i>Rogers</i> distinguished the more sinister suggestion of putting \"the arm\" on someone, a phrase that implied threatened force. <i>Id.</i> at 645-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus after <i>Rogers,</i> the law in this circuit permits an entrapment instruction involving a middleman when there is evidence that (1) a government agent specifically targeted the defendant in order to induce him to commit illegal conduct; (2) the agent acted through the middleman after other government attempts at inducing the defendant had failed; (3) the government agent requested, encouraged, or instructed the middleman to employ a specified inducement, which could be found improper, against the targeted defendant; (4) the agent's actions led the middleman to do what the government sought, even if the government did not use improper means to influence the middleman; and (5) as a result of the middleman's inducement, the targeted defendant in fact engaged in the illegal conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government reads <i>Rogers</i> differently. It contends that the word \"told\" in <i>Rogers</i> must mean an imperative equivalent to the government's interpretation of \"instruct\" in <i>Bradley.</i> It also reads <i>Rogers</i> to state a requirement that the agent have <i>improperly</i> induced the middleman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. First, we think that the government's argument is contrary to the plain meaning of \"told,\" and we see nothing in the context of <i>Rogers</i> that overrides this. Indeed, in concluding that the agent had not \"told\" the middleman to improperly induce the defendant, <i>Rogers</i> pointed out that \"nothing in the record show[ed] that [the agent] <i>urged, suggested</i> or was even aware of\" the middleman's improper inducement. <i>See</i> 102 F.3d at 645 (emphases added). Urging and suggesting are hardly equivalent to ordering, nor do they by themselves necessarily constitute improper inducement. Second, if the <i>Rogers</i> court had in fact read <i>Bradley</i> the same way as the government does, we do not see how the <i>Rogers</i> court could have considered it an open question whether the government can be responsible for an agent's mere knowing tolerance of improper inducement by a middleman.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the policy concerns discussed in <i>Bradley</i> support our reading of <i>Rogers. Bradley</i> thought it important that the government's role was \"attenuated\" in that case because the agent had not attempted to ensnare the defendant. <i>Bradley,</i> 820 F.2d at 7. But in a case where the government agent specifically targets the defendant, and then causes the middleman to take a specifically contemplated action (that is arguably improper pressure) with the goal of ensnaring the defendant, the government's role is hardly attenuated. Additionally, <i>Bradley</i> worried about the fact that the government had turned a potentially innocent person into a criminal, <i>see id.</i> at 6, though it ultimately decided that this concern was outweighed by other issues. But in <i>Bradley</i> the government had never attempted to induce defendant Bradley directly. <i>Bradley's</i> concern for potential innocents weighs heavier when the government has tried &#8212; and failed &#8212; to induce the defendant without the use of a middleman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of our understanding of the law, we think a properly instructed jury could conclude that the government was responsible for Merlino's order to Luisi. Indeed, such a jury could decide that: (1) Previte specifically requested that Merlino order Luisi to engage in the cocaine deal; (2) Previte's request came after earlier government efforts to ensnare Luisi, without a middleman, had not been fruitful; (3) Previte, as an LCN captain, understood that the order he requested from Merlino would contain an implied threat of death, physical harm, or serious retribution if Luisi failed to comply; (4) Merlino's order to Luisi was exactly what Previte had requested; and (5) Merlino would not have given the order if Previte had not encouraged him to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> As a result, we think that the district court incorrectly answered the jury's question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result is supported by a Fifth Circuit case.

Anderton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381919\"><a href=\"/opinion/381919/united-states-v-david-post-anderton/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1044</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1980), the Fifth Circuit allowed the entrapment defense in a case where law enforcement officers specifically targeted the defendant, and then put unspecified \"pressure\" on the unwitting middleman to bring the defendant into a pre-designed criminal scheme. <i>Id.</i> at 1045, 1047. Without discussing whether the middleman had been improperly induced, the court found it important that the criminal design originated from the government itself. <i>See id.</i> at 1046-47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is also supported by the D.C. Circuit's analysis in <i>Washington.</i> In <i>Washington,</i> an undercover FBI agent posed as a drug lord and recruited a corrupt police officer to help him. <i>See</i> 106 F.3d at 990-91. After paying the officer for his services, the agent \"asked [the officer] . . . to recruit as many new officers as he could.\" <i>Id.</i> at 991. The corrupt officer agreed, <i>see id.,</i> but then recruited the defendants with an inducement not contemplated by the undercover agent. <i>See id.</i> at 992, 994-95. The <i>Washington</i> court rejected the derivative entrapment instruction on the facts of the case. <i>Id.</i> at 995. Importantly, however, it held that the entrapment defense is available where the government does contemplate the improper inducement given to the defendant, and causes the middleman to give that inducement as a result of a government agent's \"`instruction or direction.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 993 (quoting <i>United States v. Layeni,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722509\"><a href=\"/opinion/722509/united-states-v-olurotimi-olatunde-layeni/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 520 (D.C.Cir.1996)); <i>see also id.</i> at 995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites to other cases, but none presented the fact pattern at issue here. <i>See, e.g., Hollingsworth,</i> 27 F.3d at 1200-02, 1204-05; <i>United States v.

That is, a defendant is entitled to an entrapment instruction only if there is \"some evidence,\" on both elements of the entrapment defense, sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the defendant was merely an unwary innocent. <i>See United States v.

The defendant must show \"more than a scintilla of evidence, more than mere creation of an opportunity for criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i> Nonetheless, even a defendant's self-serving testimony can suffice, especially when it has some circumstantial corroboration. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luisi made the requisite entry-level showing. We have already explained why a jury could find improper governmental inducement. Additionally, Luisi introduced \"some evidence\" of his lack of predisposition. He testified that sometime before he met McGowan, he experienced a \"spiritual encounter,\" and that as a result of this spiritual encounter he resolved to stop dealing drugs. This story was consistent with evidence that Luisi had deliberately stalled the drug transaction for several months to \"pal off\" McGowan, thereby indefinitely delaying a drug deal to which Luisi was opposed. Indeed, a jury could find that this two-<i>month</i> delay stood in stark contrast to the two-<i>day</i> lag between when Merlino gave Luisi the order, and when McGowan received drugs from Luisi's colleagues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government suggests that Luisi's \"spiritual encounter\" was not credible, and that there was \"overwhelming\" evidence of Luisi's predisposition, including the fact that he previously had been a cocaine dealer, and the fact that Luisi continued to receive profits from small drug deals undertaken by one of his associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this procedural posture, however, our job is not \"to weigh the evidence, make credibility determinations, or resolve conflicts in the proof.\" <i>Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9.

By contrast, the Fourth Circuit has used it to refer to <i>all</i> third-party entrapment cases. <i>See United States v. Squillacote,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769763\"><a href=\"/opinion/769763/united-states-v-theresa-marie-squillacote-aka-tina-aka-mary-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 573-74 &amp; n. 19 (4th Cir.2000). The definition we use, which comes from a leading criminal law treatise, is a broad definition that is useful in distinguishing \"derivative entrapment\" from \"vicarious entrapment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The case at hand does not present that concern. There is a tape recording of the conversation in which the middleman pressured Luisi. Moreover, the government agent (Previte) in fact participated in that conversation, while another government agent (McGowan) listened in. Consequently, the government faced fewer practical difficulties in refuting Luisi's entrapment claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> We also had no occasion to consider such a fact pattern in<i>United States v.

In that case, after we rejected the defendants' entrapment arguments, we relied on <i>Bradley</i> to explain why one defendant's claim to an entrapment instruction was \"foreclosed for an additional reason.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6. We noted that to allow the claim \"we would have [had] to create the fiction that [the government agent] <i>forced</i> [the intermediary] into dealing with\" the defendant. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). To the extent that our use of the word \"forced\" can be taken to imply a requirement of coercion, such an implication was dicta, as the government agent in the case never encouraged the middleman to bring anyone into the scheme, let alone the defendant. <i>See id.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We similarly did not deal with a pertinent fact pattern in <i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608834\"><a href=\"/opinion/608834/united-states-v-jose-hernandez-united-states-of-america-v-aguilino-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir.1993). Like <i>Bradley</i> and <i>Murphy,</i> the case involved no government targeting of the individual defendant. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Contrary to our precedent, several circuits categorically deny the entrapment defense in<i>all</i> third-party situations where the middleman is unaware that he is helping the government. <i>See Squillacote,</i> 221 F.3d at 574; <i>United States v. Thickstun,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1394</span></span>, 1398 (9th Cir.1997); <i>United States v.

The Third Circuit's law varies. <i>Compare United States v.

With the possible exception of the Ninth Circuit's opinion in <i>United States v. Emmert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494684\"><a href=\"/opinion/494684/united-states-v-walter-douglas-emmert-united-states-of-america-v-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1987), we are unaware of any cases in which these circuits have rejected the third-party defense when confronted with the kind of fact pattern we face here. As for <i>Emmert,</i> we respectfully disagree with the Ninth Circuit's conclusions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Mere knowing tolerance is not presented by the facts here, and we do not reach that issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the jury's question was premised on the idea that the government had caused Merlino to give the order. While the government observes that there was no evidence introduced at trial as to Merlino's lack of predisposition, none was needed. The premise of the jury's question was perfectly consistent with a finding that Merlino was predisposed to be involved in a cocaine transaction<i>See Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 962 (distinguishing lack of predisposition from simple causation).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The government reads<i>Washington</i> differently, concluding that <i>Washington</i> requires the actual inducement applied to the intermediary to be the same kind of inducement applied to the defendant. This reading seems premised on an assumption that the FBI agent in <i>Washington</i> had improperly induced the middleman. Yet the court merely described the agent as \"asking\" for the middleman's assistance. <i>Washington,</i> 106 F.3d at 991. <i>Washington</i> contains no explanation of how this inducement was improper, and the court's logic suggests that any inquiry into the propriety of the agent's request would be irrelevant. Moreover, <i>Washington</i> cited an earlier D.C. Circuit case &#8212; <i>Layeni</i> &#8212; for its rule. <i>See id.</i> at 993-95. <i>Layeni</i> had in turn implied that the derivative entrapment defense is available if a government agent merely \"suggests\" to an intermediary that he apply particular inducements to a defendant. <i>See Layeni,</i> 90 F.3d at 518.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have, in somewhat limited fashion, also rejected unwitting intermediary claims on the facts presented<i>See, e.g., United States v. McLernon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443243\"><a href=\"/opinion/443243/united-states-v-richard-scott-mclernon-kido-yaqui-sherri-louise-farrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span>, 1109 (6th Cir.1984); <i>United States v.

With one exception, we are not aware of any cases in which these circuits have faced facts similar to those in this case.
