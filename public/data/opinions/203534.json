The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) affirmed an Immigration Judge's (IJ's) decision finding\n\nRadjamin Hasudungan Benito ineligible for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\nBenito now petitions this court for a review of the BIA's denial of\n\nhis claims.     We deny the petition for review.\n\n                              I. BACKGROUND\n\n            In May 2002, Benito, a native and citizen of Indonesia,\n\nentered   the    United   States    as   a    non-immigrant     visitor   with\n\nauthorization to remain in the country until June 18, 2002.               In a\n\nNotice to Appear dated April 11, 2003, the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity (DHS) began removal proceedings.          Conceding removability,\n\nBenito appeared before an IJ on November 29, 2005, and sought\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT.\n\n            The IJ found Benito credible, and thus, we relate the\n\nfacts of the case as he testified to them.\n\n            Benito was born in January 1972 to a Protestant Christian\n\nfamily.     During his childhood and adult life in Indonesia, a\n\nlargely   Muslim   nation,   he    was   an   active   member   of   Christian\n\nchurches.   Benito and his family experienced anti-Christian verbal\n\nthreats and abuse by neighbors and acquaintances, and he observed\n\ndiscrimination against Christians during high school and at the\n\nUniversity of Sumatera Utara.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           After graduating in 1996 with a degree in economic\n\nmanagement,    Benito    worked      for   five   years   at   a    Korean-owned\n\nmanufacturing company.        On several occasions, coworkers sent him\n\nemails with graphic images and news stories detailing murders of\n\nChristian citizens. Benito did not report the emails to his Korean\n\nsupervisors or the Indonesian police, believing such efforts would\n\nbe futile.     During this time, many Christian churches were burned\n\nand destroyed.    Benito also recalls hearing of additional bombings\n\nand murders of Christians.           In August 2001, Benito began working\n\nfor a foreign currency exchange, and while there, experienced no\n\nanti-Christian encounters.\n\n           Benito entered the United States on a tourist visa for 30\n\ndays in May 2002 to attend his brother's graduation from the\n\nRochester Institute of Technology in New York.                     Before Benito\n\ndeparted Indonesia, his brother, who was concerned for Benito's\n\nsafety as a Christian in Indonesia, suggested that Benito remain in\n\nthe United States.       While Benito's brother returned to Indonesia\n\nwithin weeks of his graduation, Benito remained in the United\n\nStates   and   spent    the   next   three   years   working       odd   jobs   and\n\nfollowing events in Indonesia. During this time, Benito's parents,\n\nbrother, and three sisters continued to live in Indonesia as\n\nChristians.     While Benito believed they faced \"intimidation,\" no\n\nfamily member experienced physical harm.              On October 26, 2005,\n\nbelieving that conditions in Indonesia had worsened, Benito filed\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fan application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n            After a hearing on November 29, 2005, the IJ determined\n\nthat Benito was removable as charged.              Specifically, the IJ found\n\nthat    Benito        did   not    establish     extraordinary     or   changed\n\ncircumstances to justify his failure to apply for asylum within one\n\nyear of his arrival to the United States, failed to show clear\n\nprobability      of    future     persecution   to    warrant   withholding   of\n\nremoval, and provided no evidence that he likely faced torture upon\n\nhis    return   to     Indonesia,    thus   failing    to   satisfy   the   CAT's\n\nrequirements.         On appeal, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision and\n\nrejected as evidence of changed circumstances warranting a remand\n\ntwo news articles Benito attached to his appellate brief.\n\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n            This court reviews the BIA's decision for substantial\n\nevidence and accepts the BIA's findings of fact if they are\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"              Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d\n\n335, 338 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                    We will\n\nreverse factual determinations contained in the decision below only\n\nif \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n\nthe contrary.\"        8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).       Where, as here, \"the BIA\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fadopts an IJ's decision, we review the relevant portion of the IJ's\n\nopinion as though it were the decision of the BIA.\"                 Guillaume v.\n\nGonzáles, 504 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing Stroni v.\n\nGonzáles, 454 F.3d 82, 86-87 (1st Cir. 2006)).\n\nB. Asylum\n\n             An application for asylum must be filed within one year\n\nof    the   alien's   arrival    in   the   United    States,   absent     changed\n\ncircumstances affecting eligibility for asylum or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances relating to the delay in filing.                      8 U.S.C. §§\n\n1158(a)(2)(B), 1158(a)(2)(D).           Here, it is undisputed that Benito\n\nresided in the United States more than three years before filing\n\nfor    asylum.    The    IJ   determined      no    extraordinary    or    changed\n\ncircumstances     existed       to    justify      waiving   the    time    limit.\n\nTherefore, we lack jurisdiction to review this determination.                  Id.\n\nat § 1158(a)(3); Sharari v. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (explaining we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's findings\n\nregarding compliance with the one-year time limit as well as\n\nwhether there are extraordinary or changed circumstances sufficient\n\nto merit an exception).\n\nC. Withholding of Removal\n\n             Benito next appeals the BIA's denial of withholding of\n\nremoval.     First, he asserts that the IJ committed reversible error\n\nin failing to make a specific finding regarding past persecution.\n\nThe Government counters that Benito never presented this argument\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fto the BIA, and therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review\n\nit.\n\n               \"When    a     claim    presented       to     us   on    appeal      has    not\n\npreviously been presented to the BIA, the petitioner has failed to\n\nexhaust      his     administrative         remedies,       eliminating       this      court's\n\njurisdiction to review the agency's actions.\"                           Berrio-Barrera v.\n\nGonzáles, 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft,       387    F.3d      75,   80    (1st   Cir.      2004)     and    8   U.S.C.     §\n\n1252(d)(1)).          In his BIA appeal, Benito argued the IJ erred in\n\nruling       there    was   no    past      persecution      and   no    fear      of    future\n\npersecution.           However,        Benito    did    not    take      issue     with     the\n\nspecificity of the IJ's holding on past persecution.                          The BIA thus\n\nlacked notice that Benito believed the IJ's failure to make an\n\nexplicit finding constituted reversible error.                        Because Benito did\n\nnot exhaust his administrative remedies by raising this argument\n\nbelow, we lack the jurisdiction to consider it now.\n\n               Although we lack the jurisdiction to consider a remand\n\nfor more specific reasoning, we can consider whether the BIA\n\nincorrectly denied Benito withholding of removal, an argument\n\nBenito raised below.             The \"standard for withholding deportation is\n\nmore stringent than that for asylum.\"                   Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d\n\n365, 372 (1st Cir. 2003).              While an applicant for asylum must show\n\nthat     a    reasonable         person     in   his    circumstances           would      fear\n\npersecution, withholding of removal requires proof of a clear\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\fprobability of persecution. Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzáles, 428 F.3d\n\n30, 37 (1st Cir. 2005).            \"To qualify as persecution, a person's\n\nexperience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even\n\nbasic suffering.\"          Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   See also Topalli v. Gonzáles, 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (differentiating \"systematic maltreatment that rose to the\n\nlevel of past persecution\" from \"isolated incidents\"); Bocova v.\n\nGonzáles,    412    F.3d    257,    263    (1st   Cir.     2005)    (\"mistreatment\n\nordinarily   must    entail       more    than   sporadic   abuse    in   order    to\n\nconstitute persecution\").           We agree with the BIA that Benito has\n\nnot met this high standard.\n\n            A withholding applicant who establishes past persecution\n\nenjoys a rebuttable presumption that \"[his] life or freedom would\n\nbe threatened in the future . . . on the basis of the original\n\nclaim.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i). Absent past persecution, the\n\napplicant must prove he faces a clear probability of persecution on\n\naccount of a protected ground.             Id. at § 1208.16(b)(2).\n\n            While the IJ explicitly stated that Benito had not\n\ndemonstrated a clear probability of future persecution, the IJ did\n\nnot make specific findings regarding Benito's evidence of past\n\npersecution.        We     have     previously     noted     this    failure      can\n\n\"unnecessarily complicate[] our review.\"              Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d\n\n5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001).              However, we also have observed that\n\n\"findings    regarding      past     persecution     are    easily     inferable.\"\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fPulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 2008); accord\n\nWiratama v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2008)(determining that\n\nIJ's   findings    on   future   persecution   subsumed   issue   of    past\n\npersecution where applicant offered no independent evidence of\n\nprobability of future persecution).\n\n           Here, the IJ considered whether Benito had shown that it\n\nwas more likely than not he would face persecution if he returned\n\nto Indonesia.      The IJ reasoned that Benito's evidence of verbal\n\nthreats and the graphic emails did not establish a probability of\n\nfuture persecution, noted that Benito had not suffered physical\n\nharm in Indonesia, and observed that Benito's family continued to\n\nreside in Indonesia without physical injury.              See Bonilla v.\n\nMukasey, 539 F.3d 72, 75-78 (1st Cir. 2008) (affirming denial of\n\nwithholding   of   removal   where   applicant   received    repeated    and\n\ntargeted phone and mail threats and was declared a military target\n\nbut his son continued to live in Colombia); Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating \"the fact that close\n\nrelatives continue to live peacefully in [petitioner's] homeland\n\nundercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return\").\n\n           Although the IJ did not respond expressly to Benito's\n\nclaim of past persecution, both the IJ and the BIA acknowledged the\n\nalleged acts of persecution, and we can infer from the denial of\n\nwithholding \"that those rather bland incidents failed to justify\n\nthe relief requested.\"     Pulisir, 524 F.3d at 308.      Indeed, like the\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fpetitioner in Wiratama, Benito provided no independent evidence\n\nregarding a probability of future persecution.     See 538 F.3d at 7.\n\nThe IJ's attention to the absence of physical harm to Benito and\n\nhis family thus reflected his conclusion that Benito had not\n\nsuffered past persecution.    Cf. Sinurat v. Mukasey, 537 F.3d 59,\n\n61-62 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding that harm suffered by Indonesian\n\nalien from single beating by Muslim students did not amount to past\n\npersecution); Pulisir, 524 F.3d at 308-09 (finding two instances of\n\nrock-throwing by Muslims at petitioner's Christian church and one\n\naltercation at prayer meeting during which petitioner lost a tooth\n\ndid not constitute past persecution).    We agree with the BIA that\n\nBenito has not demonstrated past persecution or a clear probability\n\nof future persecution such that the IJ would be compelled to\n\nconclude to the contrary.\n\nD. Protection under the CAT\n\n          Benito appeals the BIA's determination that he is not\n\neligible for protection under the CAT.        Benito did not make\n\narguments in either his petition or his brief to the BIA regarding\n\nrelief under the CAT.     Therefore, we lack the jurisdiction to\n\nconsider this argument.   8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).\n\nE. New Country Conditions Evidence\n\n          Finally, Benito claims we must reverse the BIA's ruling\n\nbecause the administrative tribunal refused to remand in light of\n\nnew country conditions evidence.      This court reviews the BIA's\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fdecision on a motion to remand for abuse of discretion.                   Zhang v.\n\nAshcroft, 348 F.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Nascimento v.\n\nINS, 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001)).             Abuse of discretion exists\n\nonly where the denial was made \"without a 'rational explanation,\n\ninexplicably departed from the established policies, or rested on\n\nan impermissible basis.'\"             Id. (quoting Nascimento, 274 F.3d at\n\n28).\n\n              Benito      has   not    provided     compelling   evidence       to\n\ndemonstrate the BIA abused its discretion in denying his remand.\n\nThe BIA considered Benito's evidence and concluded that it failed\n\nto demonstrate a substantial likelihood of a different result upon\n\nremand. We agree with the BIA that the two news articles submitted\n\nby   Benito    do   not    demonstrate    a    sufficient   change   in    country\n\nconditions to warrant a remand of his case and conclude the BIA did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in finding that Benito failed to present\n\nevidence that likely would change the outcome of his case.\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we deny Benito's petition for\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f",

In August 2001, Benito began working\n\nfor a foreign currency exchange, and while there, experienced no\n\nanti-Christian encounters.\n\n           Benito entered the United States on a tourist visa for 30\n\ndays in May 2002 to attend his brother's graduation from the\n\nRochester Institute of Technology in New York.                     Before Benito\n\ndeparted Indonesia, his brother, who was concerned for Benito's\n\nsafety as a Christian in Indonesia, suggested that Benito remain in\n\nthe United States.       While Benito's brother returned to Indonesia\n\nwithin weeks of his graduation, Benito remained in the United\n\nStates   and   spent    the   next   three   years   working       odd   jobs   and\n\nfollowing events in Indonesia. During this time, Benito's parents,\n\nbrother, and three sisters continued to live in Indonesia as\n\nChristians.     While Benito believed they faced \"intimidation,\" no\n\nfamily member experienced physical harm.              On October 26, 2005,\n\nbelieving that conditions in Indonesia had worsened, Benito filed\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fan application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n            After a hearing on November 29, 2005, the IJ determined\n\nthat Benito was removable as charged.              Specifically, the IJ found\n\nthat    Benito        did   not    establish     extraordinary     or   changed\n\ncircumstances to justify his failure to apply for asylum within one\n\nyear of his arrival to the United States, failed to show clear\n\nprobability      of    future     persecution   to    warrant   withholding   of\n\nremoval, and provided no evidence that he likely faced torture upon\n\nhis    return   to     Indonesia,    thus   failing    to   satisfy   the   CAT's\n\nrequirements.         On appeal, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision and\n\nrejected as evidence of changed circumstances warranting a remand\n\ntwo news articles Benito attached to his appellate brief.\n\n                                    II.

In his BIA appeal, Benito argued the IJ erred in\n\nruling       there    was   no    past      persecution      and   no    fear      of    future\n\npersecution.           However,        Benito    did    not    take      issue     with     the\n\nspecificity of the IJ's holding on past persecution.                          The BIA thus\n\nlacked notice that Benito believed the IJ's failure to make an\n\nexplicit finding constituted reversible error.                        Because Benito did\n\nnot exhaust his administrative remedies by raising this argument\n\nbelow, we lack the jurisdiction to consider it now.\n\n               Although we lack the jurisdiction to consider a remand\n\nfor more specific reasoning, we can consider whether the BIA\n\nincorrectly denied Benito withholding of removal, an argument\n\nBenito raised below.

The IJ reasoned that Benito's evidence of verbal\n\nthreats and the graphic emails did not establish a probability of\n\nfuture persecution, noted that Benito had not suffered physical\n\nharm in Indonesia, and observed that Benito's family continued to\n\nreside in Indonesia without physical injury.

Indeed, like the\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fpetitioner in Wiratama, Benito provided no independent evidence\n\nregarding a probability of future persecution.     See 538 F.3d at 7.\n\nThe IJ's attention to the absence of physical harm to Benito and\n\nhis family thus reflected his conclusion that Benito had not\n\nsuffered past persecution.    Cf. Sinurat v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203431\"><a href=\"/opinion/203431/sinurat-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n61-62 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding that harm suffered by Indonesian\n\nalien from single beating by Muslim students did not amount to past\n\npersecution); Pulisir, 524 F.3d at 308-09 (finding two instances of\n\nrock-throwing by Muslims at petitioner's Christian church and one\n\naltercation at prayer meeting during which petitioner lost a tooth\n\ndid not constitute past persecution).    We agree with the BIA that\n\nBenito has not demonstrated past persecution or a clear probability\n\nof future persecution such that the IJ would be compelled to\n\nconclude to the contrary.\n\nD. Protection under the CAT\n\n          Benito appeals the BIA's determination that he is not\n\neligible for protection under the CAT.        Benito did not make\n\narguments in either his petition or his brief to the BIA regarding\n\nrelief under the CAT.     Therefore, we lack the jurisdiction to\n\nconsider this argument.   8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).\n\nE.
