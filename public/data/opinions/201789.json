This   appeal     involves   a\n\ndisappointed bidder who, after apparently winning the procurement\n\nrace, lost the prize when the contracting agency deemed him (and\n\nhis company) \"nonresponsible.\"     After careful review, we conclude\n\nthat the plaintiffs' federal claims, to the extent they have been\n\npreserved, fail to state cognizable causes of action under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983.       Consequently, we affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal of the action.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Since the district court decided this case on a motion to\n\ndismiss, we derive the raw facts from the plaintiffs' amended\n\ncomplaint (supplemented, for the sake of completeness, by certain\n\nuncontested facts).\n\n           The tale began on December 4, 2001, when the Puerto Rico\n\nPublic Housing Authority (PRPHA) awarded plaintiff-appellant Celta\n\nConstruction Co. (Celta) a contract to restore the Lirios del Sur\n\nhousing project in Ponce, Puerto Rico.      The funds for that project\n\nhad been assigned to PRPHA as part of a drug elimination program\n\nsponsored by the United States Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment (HUD).\n\n           Plaintiff-appellant    Miguel    Redondo-Borges     is   Celta's\n\npresident.   In a letter dated May 21, 2002, PRPHA informed Celta\n\nthat it was annulling the bid award because it had determined that\n\nRedondo-Borges    (and,   therefore,    Celta)   was   a   \"nonresponsible\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fbidder.\"     The agency premised that determination on the past\n\nactions of Redondo Construction Company (RCC). According to PRPHA,\n\nRCC (a firm in which Redondo-Borges served as an officer) had\n\ndefaulted on a contract with the agency in 1998.            That contract\n\nrelated to the same Lirios de Sur housing project.1\n\n            The amended complaint claims, without an iota of detail,\n\nthat in addition to losing the 2001 bid award, Redondo-Borges and\n\nhis companies have been suspended from participating in public\n\ncontracts ever since RCC's alleged default.         The amended complaint\n\nalso claims that the plaintiffs have lost unspecified private\n\nbusiness because a local newspaper published an account of PRPHA's\n\n\"nonresponsibility\" determination.\n\nII.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n            Redondo-Borges, his wife, and their conjugal partnership\n\nbrought the underlying action in the federal district court on May\n\n19, 2003.    They later amended their complaint to add Celta as a\n\nplaintiff.    The amended complaint named two groups of defendants:\n\nHUD, the Secretary of HUD, and two lower-ranking HUD officials,\n\nThomas    Teresi   and   Michael   Colon   (collectively,     the   federal\n\ndefendants) comprise one group and PRPHA and three PRPHA officials,\n\nIleana     Echegoyen,    Jorge     Rivera,    and    Carlos     Laboy-Diaz\n\n\n      1\n      Although Redondo-Borges and RCC challenged the allegations of\ndefault, it is unclear what has become of that challenge.       The\nrecord reveals only that the challenge went to arbitration. There\nis no information about either the outcome or the status of the\narbitration proceeding.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f(collectively, the commonwealth defendants) comprise the other.\n\nThe plaintiffs advanced claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the\n\nPrivacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, to which they appended claims\n\nunder   local   law   for   breach   of    contract   and   the   like.   The\n\ndefendants variously moved to dismiss the amended complaint for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state an\n\nactionable claim.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (6).          The district\n\ncourt referred the motions to a magistrate judge, see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 72(b), who recommended dismissal.           The plaintiffs objected to\n\nthe magistrate judge's recommended disposition of the motions.\n\n           The district court reviewed the matter de novo.             See id.\n\nThe court ultimately issued a thoughtful opinion in which it (i)\n\ndismissed the claims against the federal defendants because the\n\nplaintiffs had failed to state any viable cause of action against\n\nthem; (ii) dismissed the claims for money damages against the\n\ncommonwealth defendants in their official capacities on the ground\n\nof Eleventh Amendment immunity; (iii) dismissed the claims for\n\nprospective injunctive relief against the commonwealth defendants\n\nin their official capacities because the plaintiffs had failed to\n\nstate any claim cognizable under section 1983; (iv) dismissed the\n\nclaims against the commonwealth defendants in their individual\n\ncapacities based on qualified immunity; (v) dismissed the Privacy\n\nAct claims against the commonwealth defendants because the Act\n\napplies only to federal agencies; and (vi) elected not to exercise\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsupplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims, which it\n\ndismissed without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).    See\n\nCelta Constr. v. HUD, 337 F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-403 (D.P.R. 2004).\n\nThis timely appeal followed.\n\nIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n           We subdivide our analysis of the issues presented into\n\nseveral segments.        We begin by elucidating some of the legal\n\nstandards applicable to motions to dismiss.\n\n                    A.   The Rule 12(b)(6) Framework.\n\n           The district court dismissed the plaintiff's action for\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.\n\nBecause there is no heightened pleading standard in civil rights\n\ncases, Educadores Puertorriqueños en Acción v. Hernández, 367 F.3d\n\n61, 66-67 (1st Cir. 2004), a district court considering a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion must view the plaintiff's complaint through the\n\nprism of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)'s notice pleading requirements.\n\nCentro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2005).       \"A complaint satisfies that standard if it\n\ncontains 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\n\npleader is entitled to relief,' and 'give[s] the defendant fair\n\nnotice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which\n\nit rests.'\"   Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n8(a)(2) and Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f              The court must \"assume the truth of all well-pleaded\n\nfacts     and   indulge       all   reasonable         inferences       that    fit     the\n\nplaintiff's stated theory of liability.\"                       In re Colonial Mortg.\n\nBankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).                    Those facts may be\n\nderived from the complaint, whatever documents are either annexed\n\nto it or fairly incorporated into it, and any relevant matters that\n\nare susceptible to judicial notice.                Centro Medico, 406 F.3d at 5.\n\nIn   that     process,       however,     the    court    need    not    credit       \"bald\n\nassertions,            unsupportable              conclusions,           periphrastic\n\ncircumlocutions, and the like.\"                 Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              We review the entry of an order of dismissal under Rule\n\n12(b)(6) de novo, applying the same criteria that bound the lower\n\ncourt.    Centro Medico, 406 F.3d at 5.               The threshold for affirmance\n\nis high:      \"[w]e will affirm a dismissal only if it is transparently\n\nclear that the complaint, in light of the facts alleged, engenders\n\nno viable theory of liability.\"                 Id. at 6.\n\n                                     B.    Waiver.\n\n              We begin our discussion of the plaintiffs' claims by\n\nexplaining      what    is    not   before      us.      Few    principles     are    more\n\nsacrosanct in this circuit than the principle that \"issues adverted\n\nto   in   a   perfunctory       manner,    unaccompanied         by    some    effort   at\n\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.\"                          United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).                    As a corollary to this\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fprinciple, \"a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments\n\nsquarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.\"                        Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              Even during appellate review\n\nof a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, which takes place under a set of\n\nplaintiff-friendly         guidelines,     the   reviewing      court   cannot   be\n\nexpected     to    \"do    counsel's    work,   create     the   ossature   for   the\n\nargument, and put flesh on its bones.\"              Id.\n\n             Application of these wise insights narrows the field of\n\nour endeavor.        In their brief, the plaintiffs completely ignore\n\nboth the district court's holding on their Privacy Act claim and\n\nits scuttling of their supplemental claims. We therefore deem them\n\nto have waived any appeal as to those rulings.                     The only claims\n\nthat remain for adjudication are those advanced under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.      We address those claims in the pages that follow.\n\n        C.   Constitutional Claims Against Federal Defendants.\n\n             The    plaintiffs    try    to    shoehorn    their    constitutional\n\nclaims against the federal defendants into the contours of section\n\n1983.     That endeavor has all the hallmarks of a futile gesture:\n\nafter all, a section 1983 claim normally does not lie against a\n\nfederal official. See Chatman v. Hernandez, 805 F.2d 453, 455 (1st\n\nCir. 1986) (per curiam) (\"Section 1983 applies to persons acting\n\n'under color of state law' and not to persons acting pursuant to\n\nfederal law.\").          The plaintiffs allege no facts that might permit\n\na detour around that rule.            Cf. Hampton v. Hanrahan, 600 F.2d 600,\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f623 (7th Cir. 1979) (explaining that a section 1983 claim may lie\n\nagainst federal officers \"when [they] are engaged in a conspiracy\n\nwith state officials to deprive constitutional rights\").\n\n            Federal    officials    sometimes     can   be    liable    for\n\nconstitutional torts committed under color of federal law on terms\n\nthat bear a family resemblance to those that govern section 1983\n\nactions. The doctoral framework was limned by the Supreme Court in\n\nBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of FBN, 403 U.S. 388, 397\n\n(1971).    Here, however, even if we give the plaintiffs the benefit\n\nof every doubt and recharacterize their claims against the federal\n\ndefendants as Bivens claims, they would still succumb.\n\n            The   amended   complaint's   only   allegation   against   the\n\nfederal defendants is that \"[HUD] was fully aware of [PRPHA's]\n\nabsolute disregard of award procedures, and did not correct nor\n\nadequately supervise the wrongdoing . . . that it was funding.\"\n\nThese bald assertions are fundamentally insufficient to support a\n\nBivens claim.      Most importantly, the plaintiffs have failed to\n\nconnect the federal defendants to the actions central to this case,\n\nthat is, the alleged debarment, PRPHA's \"nonresponsible bidder\"\n\ndetermination, and the 2002 rescission of the Lirios del Sur bid\n\naward.    Although the amended complaint indicates that HUD may have\n\nhad some general duty of oversight vis-à-vis PRPHA, it does not\n\nallege any legally enforceable connection between HUD and the\n\nsupposed deprivation of due process on which the plaintiffs' claims\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fdepend. Without such a connection, no colorable section 1983 claim\n\nexists.2\n\n           In all events, the language of the amended complaint\n\nindicates that, as to the federal defendants, the plaintiffs are\n\nattempting to raise a claim of negligent supervision.            Such a\n\nclaim, if stated, would constitute a tort action within the purview\n\nof the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-\n\n2680, not a Bivens action. See, e.g., Bolduc v. United States, 402\n\nF.3d 50, 59-62 (1st Cir. 2005).      Yet the plaintiffs have not sued\n\nthe United States in tort, nor have they alleged compliance with\n\nthe administrative prerequisites for an FTCA action.        See Cotto v.\n\nUnited States, 993 F.2d 274, 280 (1st Cir. 1993) (describing\n\nadministrative     scheme   and   explaining   that   \"[e]xhaustion    of\n\nplaintiffs'      administrative    remedies    is     a   jurisdictional\n\nprerequisite to the prosecution of their FTCA claims\").               This\n\nomission reinforces our conclusion that the allegations of the\n\namended complaint engender no viable theory of liability against\n\nthe federal defendants.\n\n\n\n     2\n      The plaintiffs made additional allegations against the\nfederal defendants in other submissions to the district court (such\nas their memorandum in opposition to the motions to dismiss).\nThese additional allegations are not properly before us.        See\nCentro Medico, 406 F.3d at 5; Colonial Mortg. Bankers, 324 F.3d at\n15-16.   We add, moreover, that even were we to take them into\naccount, the plaintiffs would still fail to state a valid\nconstitutional claim against the federal defendants. None of these\nallegations links the federal defendants to any alleged\nconstitutional violation.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f       D.   Section 1983 Claims Against Commonwealth Defendants.\n\n             In   the   district    court,   the    plaintiffs   effectively\n\nconceded that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars a federal court from\n\nawarding monetary damages against the commonwealth defendants in\n\ntheir official capacities.         Celta Constr., 337 F. Supp. 2d at 401.\n\nYet Eleventh Amendment immunity does not bar prospective injunctive\n\nrelief against official-capacity defendants.               See Rosie D. v.\n\nSwift, 310 F.3d 230, 234 (1st Cir. 2002); Fred v. Roque, 916 F.2d\n\n37, 39 (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam).          Nor does that doctrine bar\n\nrelief (whether in the form of money damages or an injunction)\n\nagainst the commonwealth defendants in their individual capacities.\n\nSee Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159 (1908); Rosie D., 310 F.3d at\n\n234.    We proceed to examine these asserted claims.\n\n             \"Section 1983 supplies a private right of action against\n\na person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights\n\nsecured by the Constitution or by federal law.\"             Evans v. Avery,\n\n100 F.3d 1033, 1036 (1st Cir. 1996).               The first condition of a\n\nviable section 1983 claim — that the act in question occur \"under\n\ncolor of state law\" — is satisfied here.           Puerto Rico is considered\n\na state for section 1983 purposes, see Deniz v. Municipality of\n\nGuaynabo, 285 F.3d 142, 146 (1st Cir. 2002), and the amended\n\ncomplaint challenges actions attributed to PRPHA (an agency of the\n\nPuerto Rican government) and its functionaries (the individual\n\ncommonwealth defendants).      Thus, we focus the lens of our inquiry\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fon the second condition of a viable section 1983 claim — whether\n\nthere has been a deprivation of rights secured to the plaintiffs\n\neither by the Constitution or by federal law.\n\n           In this instance, the plaintiffs claim that they have\n\nbeen deprived of their Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due\n\nprocess.   For that claim to succeed, the plaintiffs must identify\n\na protected property or liberty interest.   Centro Medico, 406 F.3d\n\nat 7 (citing Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972)).\n\nBecause the plaintiffs invoke no liberty interest, we confine our\n\ndiscussion to the existence vel non of a constitutionally protected\n\nproperty interest.3\n\n\n     3\n      These plaintiffs have not argued a claim premised on a\nliberty interest. Had they done so and had they alleged sufficient\nfacts to support it, this case might have taken a different turn.\nSee, e.g., Smith & Wesson v. United States, 782 F.2d 1074, 1081\n(1st Cir. 1986) (\"While the deprivation of the right to bid on\ngovernment contracts is not a property interest . . ., the bidder's\nliberty interest is affected when that denial is based on charges\nof fraud and dishonesty.\" (quoting Transco Security, Inc. v.\nFreeman, 639 F.2d 318, 321 (6th Cir. 1981))); Old Dominion Dairy\nProds. v. Sec'y of Def., 631 F.2d 953, 962-63 (D.C. Cir. 1980)\n(holding that the government deprived disappointed bidder of a\nconstitutionally   protected   liberty   interest   when   it  made\nstigmatizing charges that \"effectively foreclosed [the disappointed\nbidder's] freedom to take advantage of other Government employment\nopportunities, and barred [it] from all public employment\"). But\nsee Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 233-34 (1991) (holding that\nstatements that \"would undoubtedly damage the reputation of one in\n[plaintiff's] position, and impair his future employment prospects\"\nnevertheless did not amount to a deprivation of a constitutionally\nprotected liberty interest).\n     Here, however, even if the plaintiffs had advanced a liberty\ninterest argument in their brief, the outcome of our analysis would\nremain unchanged.    The cases that support the existence of a\nprotected liberty interest are relevant only to the plaintiffs'\neffective debarment claim, which, no matter the interest raised,\n\n                               -11-\n\f           To   establish   a   constitutionally    protected   property\n\ninterest, a plaintiff \"must have more than an abstract need or\n\ndesire for [a thing] . . . [and] more than a unilateral expectation\n\nof it.\"   Roth, 408 U.S. at 577.    A plaintiff instead must \"have a\n\nlegitimate claim of entitlement to it.\"    Id.     Here, however, we are\n\nunable to find any clear statement of the precise property interest\n\nthat the plaintiffs contend is at stake.\n\n           After combing the amended complaint and conducting the\n\nrobed equivalent of an archeological dig, we conclude that, in a\n\nbest-case scenario, the plaintiffs can be said to allege three\n\nproperty interests:   (i) a property interest associated with their\n\nseven-year effective debarment from PRPHA contracting; (ii) a\n\nproperty interest associated with PRPHA's \"nonresponsible bidder\"\n\ndetermination; and (iii) a property interest associated with the\n\nrescission of the Lirios del Sur bid award.4          We discuss these\n\nthree possibilities in sequence.\n\n           1.   Effective Debarment.     The plaintiffs allege that\n\nPRPHA has effectively debarred them from government contracting for\n\n\nhas been pleaded without the necessary factual underpinnings.\n     4\n      The plaintiffs seem to have adopted a semantic strategy in\nwhich they consistently refer to the Lirios del Sur bid award as\n\"the contract\" (as if the bid award were a full-fledged contract).\nThat word choice leads to some confusion. Insofar as we can tell,\nwhat PRPHA allegedly breached was not a full-fledged construction\ncontract (no such contract is alleged to have been entered into\nbetween Celta and PRPHA), but, rather, the antecedent bid award.\nThe contract rescission to which we refer, therefore, is the\nannulment of the bid award and nothing more.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fthe   last   seven   years   without   ever   promulgating   an   explicit\n\ndebarment order.5     It is unnecessary for us to reach the issue of\n\nwhether there is a constitutionally protected property interest\n\nassociated with effective debarment because the plaintiffs have not\n\nalleged sufficient facts to establish the underlying debarment. We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n             The amended complaint does little more than describe what\n\nthe plaintiffs call a suspension.        Although it does not embellish\n\nthis bare conclusory allegation, we assume, favorably to the\n\nplaintiffs, that by suspension they mean effective debarment or\n\neven blacklisting. See supra note 5. Still, the amended complaint\n\ndoes not anchor this pejorative term in any supporting facts.          In\n\nparticular, the plaintiffs have not averred that they have bid on\n\nany PRPHA contracts other than Lirios del Sur since 1998.         A single\n\nincident is insufficient to establish a pattern or practice of\n\nexclusion (and, thus, to establish even a de facto debarment). Cf.\n\nJensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 523 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting, in the\n\nTitle VII context, that \"[a] single instance of favoritism, even if\n\nproved, falls considerably short of showing an ongoing pattern and\n\npractice\").\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      The plaintiffs use the term \"effective debarment\" for the\nfirst time in their appellate brief.    At oral argument in this\ncourt, they substituted the term \"blacklisting.\" Neither of these\ndysphemisms appear in the amended complaint.\n\n                                  -13-\n\f           The   fact     that   notice    pleading    governs   at   the   Rule\n\n12(b)(6) stage does not save the plaintiffs' conclusory allegation.\n\n\"[I]n a civil rights action as in any other action subject to\n\nnotice pleading standards, the complaint should at least set forth\n\nminimal facts as to who did what to whom, when, where, and why . .\n\n. .\"   Educadores, 367 F.3d at 68.        Notice pleading requirements may\n\nbe minimal — but \"minimal requirements are not tantamount to\n\nnonexistent requirements.\"         Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d\n\n513, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).         Even within the generous confines of\n\nnotice pleading, courts must continue to \"eschew . . . reliance on\n\nbald assertions [and] unsupportable conclusions.\"              Chongris v. Bd.\n\nof Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           The plaintiffs' omissions are especially telling here.\n\nElsewhere in the record, the plaintiffs flatly contradict their\n\nconclusory   claim   of    effective      debarment.     For   example,     in   a\n\nmemorandum filed in the district court, they asserted that Redondo-\n\nBorges, through Celta, \"had bid in other PRPHA bids\" and added that\n\n\"it was never argued by the agency that [Redondo-Borges] was a non-\n\nresponsible contractor.\"         We thus reject the naked mention of an\n\nundocumented suspension as a possible source of a constitutionally\n\nprotected property interest.\n\n           2.    The \"Nonresponsible Bidder\" Determination.                  The\n\nplaintiffs allege that, as the rationale for its rescission of the\n\nLirios del Sur bid award, PRPHA determined that Redondo-Borges was\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fnonresponsible and imputed his failings to Celta.           To the extent\n\nthat the plaintiffs' due process claims revolve around a supposed\n\nproperty interest in their \"responsible bidder\" status, we are\n\nunable to perceive how such an interest amounts to anything greater\n\nthan a unilateral expectation.\n\n           A property interest does not vest simply because a\n\ngovernment agency has developed a responsibility-determination\n\nscheme to aid in bid award decisions.      See generally Smith & Wesson\n\nv. United States, 782 F.2d 1074, 1081 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Award\n\nprocedures are not designed to establish private entitlements to\n\npublic contracts but to produce the best possible contracts for the\n\ngovernment.\").     Thus, a would-be bidder cannot claim a property\n\ninterest in the responsibility-determination procedure alone.            Cf.\n\nNavas v. Gonzalez Vales, 752 F.2d 765, 768 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"[T]he\n\nmere fact that the [government] has promulgated procedural rules by\n\nwhich to make retention decisions does not by itself create a\n\nconstitutionally    cognizable      property     interest   in   continued\n\nemployment . . . .\").\n\n           By the same token, the plaintiffs' dashed hopes of\n\nreceiving future government work, without more, cannot yield a\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest. That is true even if\n\nthose dashed hopes stem from PRPHA's nonresponsibility declaration.\n\nSee Walentas v. Lipper, 862 F.2d 414, 419 (2d Cir. 1988) (finding\n\nno   property   interest   in   a   frustrated    expectation    of   future\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\femployment).     The short of it is that the plaintiffs do not have a\n\nstrong enough claim of entitlement to a \"responsible bidder\"\n\ndesignation      to   create   a    constitutionally   protected      property\n\ninterest.\n\n            3.   The Rescission of the Bid Award.      Last but not least,\n\nthe plaintiffs claim a property interest in the Lirios del Sur bid\n\naward — an award that PRPHA bestowed on them in 2001 and then\n\nrevoked in 2002.      A recurrent theme in this court's jurisprudence\n\nilluminates the path to our holding that the plaintiffs' interest\n\nin the bid award does not rise to the level of a constitutionally\n\nprotected property interest.\n\n            We have held with a regularity bordering on the echolalic\n\nthat   a    simple    breach   of    contract   does   not   amount    to   an\n\nunconstitutional deprivation of property.          See, e.g., Lee v. Life\n\nIns. Co. of N. Am., 23 F.3d 14, 20 n.11 (1st Cir. 1994); Boston\n\nEnvtl. Sanit. Inspectors Ass'n v. City of Boston, 794 F.2d 12, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam); Casey v. DePetrillo, 697 F.2d 22, 23\n\n(1st Cir. 1983) (per curiam); Jimenez v. Almodovar, 650 F.2d 363,\n\n370 (1st Cir. 1981).       Many of our sister circuits have adopted a\n\nsimilar stance.       See, e.g., S & D Maint. Co. v. Goldin, 844 F.2d\n\n962, 966 (2d Cir. 1988) (\"An interest in enforcement of an ordinary\n\ncommercial contract with a state is qualitatively different from\n\nthe interests the Supreme Court has thus far viewed as 'property'\n\nentitled to procedural due process protection.\"); San Bernardino\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fPhysicians' Servs. Med. Group v. County of San Bernardino, 825 F.2d\n\n1404, 1410 (9th Cir. 1987) (concluding that a contract that \"cannot\n\nsensibly be distinguished from construction contracts or even\n\npurely material supply contracts . . . presents no federal case\"\n\nunder section 1983).6\n\n           This view of the law makes eminently good sense. To hold\n\notherwise would run the risk of transmogrifying virtually every\n\ndispute involving an alleged breach of contract by a state or a\n\nstate agency into a constitutional case.         We eschew so rash a\n\ncourse and hold, consistent with our prior precedents, that the\n\nexistence of a state contract, simpliciter, does not confer upon\n\nthe   contracting   parties   a   constitutionally   protected   property\n\ninterest. See Boston Envtl., 794 F.2d at 13; see also Wehran-P.R.,\n\nInc. v. Municipality of Arecibo, 106 F. Supp. 2d 276, 287 (D.P.R.\n\n2000) (observing correctly that this court has been reluctant to\n\nequate mere breaches of contract with due process violations).\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      To be sure, one court of appeals appears to have adopted the\nopposite position. See Enertach Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning County\nComm'rs, 85 F.3d 257, 260 (6th Cir. 1996) (\"A constitutionally\nprotected property interest in a publicly bid contract can be\ndemonstrated . . . [when a bidder shows] that it actually was\nawarded the contract and then deprived of it . . . .\"). We not\nonly reject this minority view, but also acknowledge that we are\nbound to do so by the prior (contrary) decisions of this court.\nSee Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.\n2004) (explaining that \"newly constituted panels in a multi-panel\ncircuit [ordinarily] should consider themselves bound by prior\npanel decisions\").\n\n                                   -17-\n\fThus, an alleged breach of such a contract is not per se actionable\n\nunder section 1983.\n\n          There are no special circumstances in this case that\n\nmight justify a departure from this settled position.          See, e.g.,\n\nLinan-Faye Constr. Co. v. Hous. Auth., 49 F.3d 915, 932 (3d Cir.\n\n1995) (holding that two categories of state contracts can give rise\n\nto a constitutionally protected property interest:            those that\n\n\"confer[] a protected status\" and those that \"include[] a provision\n\nthat the state entity can terminate the contract only for cause\").\n\nIndeed, the only special circumstances that might be gleaned from\n\nthe   amended   complaint   are   the    suspension   and    the   related\n\n\"nonresponsible bidder\" determination, both of which already have\n\nbeen deemed insufficient to ground a constitutionally protected\n\nproperty interest.    See supra Part III(D)(1)-(2).         This is not a\n\nsituation in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\n\n          The amended complaint, stripped of rhetorical flourishes,\n\ntells a simple tale: PRPHA anointed Celta as the successful bidder\n\nfor a construction project and then, upon its discovery of new\n\ninformation, reversed direction and rescinded the earlier award.\n\nTaking the well-pleaded facts in the amended complaint in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiffs, this story may suffice to state\n\na breach of contract claim. When cast as a putative constitutional\n\nclaim, however, the story rings hollow.          Given the paucity of\n\nfacts, allowing a section 1983 claim in a case like this one would\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\flead us down a slippery slope to an untenable result:                   the\n\nconstitutionalization of all contract law in cases in which a state\n\nactor is a party.     We decline to take so precipitous a step.\n\n            That ends the matter. Because the plaintiffs identify no\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest, it is unnecessary to\n\ndelve any deeper into the section 1983 inquiry.          By the same token,\n\nwe need not reach either the issue of qualified immunity or the\n\nissue of whether the post-deprivation process available to Celta\n\nafter the revocation of the bid award satisfied any applicable due\n\nprocess requirement. Without a constitutionally protected interest\n\n— and there is none here — the plaintiffs have no hope of stating\n\na viable section 1983 claim.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.         If the plaintiffs have alleged\n\nany valid claim, it is a breach of contract claim.            The district\n\ncourt dismissed that claim without prejudice to a refiling in the\n\ncommonwealth courts — and the plaintiffs have not challenged the\n\npropriety    of    that   ruling.    None     of   the   plaintiffs'   other\n\n(preserved) claims states a cognizable basis on which relief can be\n\ngranted.     Accordingly, we uphold the district court's order of\n\ndismissal.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f",

Consequently, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the district court decided this case on a motion to dismiss, we derive the raw facts from the plaintiffs' amended complaint (supplemented, for the sake of completeness, by certain uncontested facts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tale began on December 4, 2001, when the Puerto Rico Public Housing Authority (PRPHA) awarded plaintiff-appellant Celta Construction Co. (Celta) a contract to restore the Lirios del Sur housing project in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The funds for that project had been assigned to PRPHA as part of a drug elimination program sponsored by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Miguel Redondo-Borges is Celta's president. In a letter dated May 21, 2002, PRPHA informed Celta that it was annulling the bid award because it had determined that Redondo-Borges (and, therefore, Celta) was a \"nonresponsible bidder.\" The agency premised that determination on the past actions of Redondo Construction Company (RCC). According to PRPHA, RCC (a firm in which Redondo-Borges served as an officer) had defaulted on a contract with the agency in 1998. That contract related to the same Lirios de Sur housing project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint claims, without an iota of detail, that in addition to losing the 2001 bid award, Redondo-Borges and his companies have been suspended from participating in public contracts ever since RCC's alleged default. The amended complaint also claims that the plaintiffs have lost unspecified private business because a local newspaper published an account of PRPHA's \"nonresponsibility\" determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Redondo-Borges, his wife, and their conjugal partnership brought the underlying action in the federal district court on May 19, 2003. They later amended their complaint to add Celta as a plaintiff. The amended complaint named two groups of defendants: HUD, the Secretary of HUD, and two lower-ranking HUD officials, Thomas Teresi and Michael Colon (collectively, the federal defendants) comprise one group and PRPHA and three PRPHA officials, Ileana Echegoyen, Jorge Rivera, and Carlos Laboy-Diaz (collectively, the commonwealth defendants) comprise the other. The plaintiffs advanced claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a, to which they appended claims under local law for breach of contract and the like. The defendants variously moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state an actionable claim. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (6). The district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), who recommended dismissal. The plaintiffs objected to the magistrate judge's recommended disposition of the motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reviewed the matter de novo. <i>See id.</i> The court ultimately issued a thoughtful opinion in which it (i) dismissed the claims against the federal defendants because the plaintiffs had failed to state any viable cause of action against them; (ii) dismissed the claims for money damages against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities on the ground of Eleventh Amendment immunity; (iii) dismissed the claims for prospective injunctive relief against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities because the plaintiffs had failed to state any claim cognizable under section 1983; (iv) dismissed the claims against the commonwealth defendants in their individual capacities based on qualified immunity; (v) dismissed the Privacy Act claims against the commonwealth defendants because the Act applies only to federal agencies; and (vi) elected not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims, which it dismissed without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c). <i>See Celta Constr. v. HUD,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d 396, 399-403 (D.P.R.2004). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We subdivide our analysis of the issues presented into several segments. We begin by elucidating some of the legal standards applicable to motions to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Rule 12(b)(6) Framework.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the plaintiff's action for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted. Because there is no heightened pleading standard in civil rights cases, <i>Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d 61, 66-67 (1st Cir.2004), a district court considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion must view the plaintiff's complaint through the prism of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)'s notice pleading requirements. <i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005). \"A complaint satisfies that standard if it contains `a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,' and `give[s] the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.'\" <i>Id.</i> (alteration in original) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) and <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court must \"assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability.\" <i>In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp.,</i> 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2003). Those facts may be derived from the complaint, whatever documents are either annexed to it or fairly incorporated into it, and any relevant matters that are susceptible to judicial notice. <i>Centro Medico,</i> 406 F.3d at 5. In that process, however, the court need not credit \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, periphrastic circumlocutions, and the like.\" <i>Aulson v. Blanchard,</i> 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the entry of an order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, applying the same criteria that bound the lower court. <i>Centro Medico,</i> 406 F.3d at 5. The threshold for affirmance is high: \"[w]e will affirm a dismissal only if it is transparently clear that the complaint, in light of the facts alleged, engenders no viable theory of liability.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Waiver.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our discussion of the plaintiffs' claims by explaining what is <i>not</i> before us. Few principles are more sacrosanct in this circuit than the principle that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). As a corollary to this principle, \"a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Even during appellate review of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, which takes place under a set of plaintiff-friendly guidelines, the reviewing court cannot be expected to \"do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application of these wise insights narrows the field of our endeavor. In their brief, the plaintiffs completely ignore both the district court's holding on their Privacy Act claim and its scuttling of their supplemental claims. We therefore deem them to have waived any appeal as to those rulings. The only claims that remain for adjudication are those advanced under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. We address those claims in the pages that follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Constitutional Claims Against Federal Defendants.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs try to shoehorn their constitutional claims against the federal defendants into the contours of section 1983. That endeavor has all the hallmarks of a futile gesture: after all, a section 1983 claim normally does not lie against a federal official. <i>See Chatman v. Hernandez,</i> 805 F.2d 453, 455 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam) (\"Section 1983 applies to persons acting `under color of state law' and not to persons acting pursuant to federal law.\"). The plaintiffs allege no facts that might permit a detour around that rule. <i>Cf. Hampton v. Hanrahan,</i> 600 F.2d 600, 623 (7th Cir.1979) (explaining that a section 1983 claim may lie against federal officers \"when [they] are engaged in a conspiracy with state officials to deprive constitutional rights\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal officials sometimes can be liable for constitutional torts committed under color of federal law on terms that bear a family resemblance to those that govern section 1983 actions. The doctoral framework was limned by the Supreme Court in <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of FBN,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Here, however, even if we give the plaintiffs the benefit of every doubt and recharacterize their claims against the federal defendants as <i>Bivens</i> claims, they would still succumb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint's only allegation against the federal defendants is that \"[HUD] was fully aware of [PRPHA's] absolute disregard of award procedures, and did not correct nor adequately supervise the wrongdoing . . . that it was funding.\" These bald assertions are fundamentally insufficient to support a <i>Bivens</i> claim. Most importantly, the plaintiffs have failed to connect the federal defendants to the actions central to this case, that is, the alleged debarment, PRPHA's \"nonresponsible bidder\" determination, and the 2002 rescission of the Lirios del Sur bid award. Although the amended complaint indicates that HUD may have had some general duty of oversight vis-&#224;-vis PRPHA, it does not allege any legally enforceable connection between HUD and the supposed deprivation of due process on which the plaintiffs' claims depend. Without such a connection, no colorable section 1983 claim exists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the language of the amended complaint indicates that, as to the federal defendants, the plaintiffs are attempting to raise a claim of negligent supervision. Such a claim, if stated, would constitute a tort action within the purview of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2671-2680, not a <i>Bivens</i> action. <i>See, e.g., Bolduc v. United States,</i> 402 F.3d 50, 59-62 (1st Cir.2005). Yet the plaintiffs have not sued the United States in tort, nor have they alleged compliance with the administrative prerequisites for an FTCA action. <i>See Cotto v. United States,</i> 993 F.2d 274, 280 (1st Cir.1993) (describing administrative scheme and explaining that \"[e]xhaustion of plaintiffs' administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the prosecution of their FTCA claims\"). This omission reinforces our conclusion that the allegations of the amended complaint engender no viable theory of liability against the federal defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Section 1983 Claims Against Commonwealth Defendants.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the plaintiffs effectively conceded that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars a federal court from awarding monetary damages against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities. <i>Celta Constr.,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d at 401. Yet Eleventh Amendment immunity does not bar prospective injunctive relief against official-capacity defendants. <i>See Rosie D. v. Swift,</i> 310 F.3d 230, 234 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Fred v. Roque,</i> 916 F.2d 37, 39 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam). Nor does that doctrine bar relief (whether in the form of money damages or an injunction) against the commonwealth defendants in their individual capacities. <i>See Ex Parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 159, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908); <i>Rosie D.,</i> 310 F.3d at 234. We proceed to examine these asserted claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Section 1983 supplies a private right of action against a person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.\" <i>Evans v. Avery,</i> 100 F.3d 1033, 1036 (1st Cir.1996). The first condition of a viable section 1983 claim &#8212; that the act in question occur \"under color of state law\" &#8212; is satisfied here. Puerto Rico is considered a state for section 1983 purposes, <i>see Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> 285 F.3d 142, 146 (1st Cir.2002), and the amended complaint challenges actions attributed to PRPHA (an agency of the Puerto Rican government) and its functionaries (the individual commonwealth defendants). Thus, we focus the lens of our inquiry on the second condition of a viable section 1983 claim-whether there has been a deprivation of rights secured to the plaintiffs either by the Constitution or by federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the plaintiffs claim that they have been deprived of their Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process. For that claim to succeed, the plaintiffs must identify a protected property or liberty interest. <i>Centro Medico,</i> 406 F.3d at 7 (citing <i>Board of Regents v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). Because the plaintiffs invoke no liberty interest, we confine our discussion to the existence vel non of a constitutionally protected property interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a constitutionally protected property interest, a plaintiff \"must have more than an abstract need or desire for [a thing] . . . [and] more than a unilateral expectation of it.\" <i>Roth,</i> 408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701. A plaintiff instead must \"have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, however, we are unable to find any clear statement of the precise property interest that the plaintiffs contend is at stake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After combing the amended complaint and conducting the robed equivalent of an archeological dig, we conclude that, in a best-case scenario, the plaintiffs can be said to allege three property interests: (i) a property interest associated with their seven-year effective debarment from PRPHA contracting; (ii) a property interest associated with PRPHA's \"nonresponsible bidder\" determination; and (iii) a property interest associated with the rescission of the Lirios del Sur bid award.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We discuss these three possibilities in sequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Effective Debarment.</i> The plaintiffs allege that PRPHA has effectively debarred them from government contracting for the last seven years without ever promulgating an explicit debarment order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> It is unnecessary for us to reach the issue of whether there is a constitutionally protected property interest associated with effective debarment because the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to establish the underlying debarment. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint does little more than describe what the plaintiffs call a suspension. Although it does not embellish this bare conclusory allegation, we assume, favorably to the plaintiffs, that by suspension they mean effective debarment or even blacklisting. <i>See supra</i> note 5. Still, the amended complaint does not anchor this pejorative term in any supporting facts. In particular, the plaintiffs have not averred that they have bid on <i>any</i> PRPHA contracts other than Lirios del Sur since 1998. A single incident is insufficient to establish a pattern or practice of exclusion (and, thus, to establish even a de facto debarment). <i>Cf. Jensen v. Frank,</i> 912 F.2d 517, 523 (1st Cir.1990) (noting, in the Title VII context, that \"[a] single instance of favoritism, even if proved, falls considerably short of showing an ongoing pattern and practice\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that notice pleading governs at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage does not save the plaintiffs' conclusory allegation. \"[I]n a civil rights action as in any other action subject to notice pleading standards, the complaint should at least set forth minimal facts as to who did what to whom, when, where, and why . . . .\" <i>Educadores,</i> 367 F.3d at 68. Notice pleading requirements may be minimal &#8212; but \"minimal requirements are not tantamount to nonexistent requirements.\" <i>Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir.1988). Even within the generous confines of notice pleading, courts must continue to \"eschew . . . reliance on bald assertions [and] unsupportable conclusions.\" <i>Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals,</i> 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' omissions are especially telling here. Elsewhere in the record, the plaintiffs flatly contradict their conclusory claim of effective debarment. For example, in a memorandum filed in the district court, they asserted that Redondo-Borges, through Celta, \"had bid in other PRPHA bids\" and added that \"it was never argued by the agency that [Redondo-Borges] was a non-responsible contractor.\" We thus reject the naked mention of an undocumented suspension as a possible source of a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The \"Nonresponsible Bidder\" Determination.</i> The plaintiffs allege that, as the rationale for its rescission of the Lirios del Sur bid award, PRPHA determined that Redondo-Borges was nonresponsible and imputed his failings to Celta. To the extent that the plaintiffs' due process claims revolve around a supposed property interest in their \"responsible bidder\" status, we are unable to perceive how such an interest amounts to anything greater than a unilateral expectation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A property interest does not vest simply because a government agency has developed a responsibility-determination scheme to aid in bid award decisions. <i>See generally Smith &amp; Wesson v. United States,</i> 782 F.2d 1074, 1081 (1st Cir.1986) (\"Award procedures are not designed to establish private entitlements to public contracts but to produce the best possible contracts for the government.\"). Thus, a would-be bidder cannot claim a property interest in the responsibility-determination procedure alone. <i>Cf. Navas v. Gonzalez Vales,</i> 752 F.2d 765, 768 (1st Cir.1985) (\"[T]he mere fact that the [government] has promulgated procedural rules by which to make retention decisions does not by itself create a constitutionally cognizable property interest in continued employment . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, the plaintiffs' dashed hopes of receiving future government work, without more, cannot yield a constitutionally protected property interest. That is true even if those dashed hopes stem from PRPHA's nonresponsibility declaration. <i>See Walentas v. Lipper,</i> 862 F.2d 414, 419 (2d Cir.1988) (finding no property interest in a frustrated expectation of future employment). The short of it is that the plaintiffs do not have a strong enough claim of entitlement to a \"responsible bidder\" designation to create a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Rescission of the Bid Award.</i> Last but not least, the plaintiffs claim a property interest in the Lirios del Sur bid award &#8212; an award that PRPHA bestowed on them in 2001 and then revoked in 2002. A recurrent theme in this court's jurisprudence illuminates the path to our holding that the plaintiffs' interest in the bid award does not rise to the level of a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held with a regularity bordering on the echolalic that a simple breach of contract does not amount to an unconstitutional deprivation of property. <i>See, e.g., Lee v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 23 F.3d 14, 20 n. 11 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Boston Envtl. Sanit. Inspectors Ass'n v. City of Boston,</i> 794 F.2d 12, 13 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam); <i>Casey v. Depetrillo,</i> 697 F.2d 22, 23 (1st Cir.1983) (per curiam); <i>Jimenez v. Almodovar,</i> 650 F.2d 363, 370 (1st Cir.1981). Many of our sister circuits have adopted a similar stance. <i>See, e.g., S&amp;D Maint. Co. v. Goldin,</i> 844 F.2d 962, 966 (2d Cir.1988) (\"An interest in enforcement of an ordinary commercial contract with a state is qualitatively different from the interests the Supreme Court has thus far viewed as `property' entitled to procedural due process protection.\"); <i>San Bernardino Physicians' Servs. Med. Group v. County of San Bernardino,</i> 825 F.2d 1404, 1410 (9th Cir.1987) (concluding that a contract that \"cannot sensibly be distinguished from construction contracts or even purely material supply contracts. . . presents no federal case\" under section 1983).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This view of the law makes eminently good sense. To hold otherwise would run the risk of transmogrifying virtually every dispute involving an alleged breach of contract by a state or a state agency into a constitutional case. We eschew so rash a course and hold, consistent with our prior precedents, that the existence of a state contract, simpliciter, does not confer upon the contracting parties a constitutionally protected property interest. <i>See Boston Envtl.,</i> 794 F.2d at 13; <i>see also Wehran-P.R., Inc. v. Municipality of Arecibo,</i> 106 F.Supp.2d 276, 287 (D.P.R.2000) (observing correctly that this court has been reluctant to equate mere breaches of contract with due process violations). Thus, an alleged breach of such a contract is not per se actionable under section 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no special circumstances in this case that might justify a departure from this settled position. <i>See, e.g., Linan-Faye Constr. Co. v. Hous. Auth.,</i> 49 F.3d 915, 932 (3d Cir.1995) (holding that two categories of state contracts can give rise to a constitutionally protected property interest: those that \"confer[] a protected status\" and those that \"include[] a provision that the state entity can terminate the contract only for cause\"). Indeed, the only special circumstances that might be gleaned from the amended complaint are the suspension and the related \"nonresponsible bidder\" determination, both of which already have been deemed insufficient to ground a constitutionally protected property interest. <i>See supra</i> Part III(D)(1)-(2). This is not a situation in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint, stripped of rhetorical flourishes, tells a simple tale: PRPHA anointed Celta as the successful bidder for a construction project and then, upon its discovery of new information, reversed direction and rescinded the earlier award. Taking the well-pleaded facts in the amended complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, this story may suffice to state a breach of contract claim. When cast as a putative constitutional claim, however, the story rings hollow. Given the paucity of facts, allowing a section 1983 claim in a case like this one would lead us down a slippery slope to an untenable result: the constitutionalization of all contract law in cases in which a state actor is a party. We decline to take so precipitous a step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Because the plaintiffs identify no constitutionally protected property interest, it is unnecessary to delve any deeper into the section 1983 inquiry. By the same token, we need not reach either the issue of qualified immunity or the issue of whether the post-deprivation process available to Celta after the revocation of the bid award satisfied any applicable due process requirement. Without a constitutionally protected interest &#8212; and there is none here &#8212; the plaintiffs have no hope of stating a viable section 1983 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. If the plaintiffs have alleged any valid claim, it is a breach of contract claim. The district court dismissed that claim without prejudice to a refiling in the commonwealth courts-and the plaintiffs have not challenged the propriety of that ruling. None of the plaintiffs' other (preserved) claims states a cognizable basis on which relief can be granted. Accordingly, we uphold the district court's order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Redondo-Borges and RCC challenged the allegations of default, it is unclear what has become of that challenge. The record reveals only that the challenge went to arbitration.

These additional allegations are not properly before us<i>See Centro Medico,</i> 406 F.3d at 5; <i>Colonial Mortg. Bankers,</i> 324 F.3d at 15-16. We add, moreover, that even were we to take them into account, the plaintiffs would still fail to state a valid constitutional claim against the federal defendants. None of these allegations links the federal defendants to any alleged constitutional violation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> These plaintiffs have not argued a claim premised on a liberty interest. Had they done so and had they alleged sufficient facts to support it, this case might have taken a different turn<i>See, Smith &amp; Wesson v. United States,</i> 782 F.2d 1074, 1081 (1st Cir.1986) (\"While the deprivation of the right to bid on government contracts is not a property interest . . ., the bidder's liberty interest is affected when that denial is based on charges of fraud and dishonesty.\" (quoting <i>Transco Security, Inc. v. Freeman,</i> 639 F.2d 318, 321 (6th Cir.1981))); <i>Old Dominion Dairy Prods. v. Sec'y of Def.,</i> 631 F.2d 953, 962-63 (D.C.Cir.1980) (holding that the government deprived disappointed bidder of a constitutionally protected liberty interest when it made stigmatizing charges that \"effectively foreclosed [the disappointed bidder's] freedom to take advantage of other Government employment opportunities, and barred [it] from all public employment\"). <i>But see Siegert v. Gilley,</i> 500 U.S. 226, 233-34, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (holding that statements that \"would undoubtedly damage the reputation of one in [plaintiff's] position, and impair his future employment prospects\" nevertheless did not amount to a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, even if the plaintiffs had advanced a liberty interest argument in their brief, the outcome of our analysis would remain unchanged. The cases that support the existence of a protected liberty interest are relevant only to the plaintiffs' effective debarment claim, which, no matter the interest raised, has been pleaded without the necessary factual underpinnings.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs seem to have adopted a semantic strategy in which they consistently refer to the Lirios del Sur bid award as \"the contract\" (as if the bid award were a full-fledged contract). That word choice leads to some confusion. Insofar as we can tell, what PRPHA allegedly breached was not a full-fledged construction contract (no such contract is alleged to have been entered into between Celta and PRPHA), but, rather, the antecedent bid award. The contract rescission to which we refer, therefore, is the annulment of the bid award and nothing more</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs use the term \"effective debarment\" for the first time in their appellate brief. At oral argument in this court, they substituted the term \"blacklisting.\" Neither of these dysphemisms appear in the amended complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To be sure, one court of appeals appears to have adopted the opposite position<i>See Enertech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning County Comm'rs,</i> 85 F.3d 257, 260 (6th Cir.1996) (\"A constitutionally protected property interest in a publicly bid contract can be demonstrated . . .

Consequently, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the district court decided this case on a motion to dismiss, we derive the raw facts from the plaintiffs' amended complaint (supplemented, for the sake of completeness, by certain uncontested facts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tale began on December 4, 2001, when the Puerto Rico Public Housing Authority (PRPHA) awarded plaintiff-appellant Celta Construction Co. (Celta) a contract to restore the Lirios del Sur housing project in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The funds for that project had been assigned to PRPHA as part of a drug elimination program sponsored by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Miguel Redondo-Borges is Celta's president. In a letter dated May 21, 2002, PRPHA informed Celta that it was annulling the bid award because it had determined that Redondo-Borges (and, therefore, Celta) was a \"nonresponsible bidder.\" The agency premised that determination on the past actions of Redondo Construction Company (RCC). According to PRPHA, RCC (a firm in which Redondo-Borges served as an officer) had defaulted on a contract with the agency in 1998. That contract related to the same Lirios de Sur housing project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint claims, without an iota of detail, that in addition to losing the 2001 bid award, Redondo-Borges and his companies have been suspended from participating in public contracts ever since RCC's alleged default. The amended complaint also claims that the plaintiffs have lost unspecified private business because a local newspaper published an account of PRPHA's \"nonresponsibility\" determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Redondo-Borges, his wife, and their conjugal partnership brought the underlying action in the federal district court on May 19, 2003. They later amended their complaint to add Celta as a plaintiff. The amended complaint named two groups of defendants: HUD, the Secretary of HUD, and two lower-ranking HUD officials, Thomas Teresi and Michael Colon (collectively, the federal defendants) comprise one group and PRPHA and three PRPHA officials, Ileana Echegoyen, Jorge Rivera, and Carlos Laboy-Diaz (collectively, the commonwealth defendants) comprise the other. The plaintiffs advanced claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a, to which they appended claims under local law for breach of contract and the like. The defendants variously moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state an actionable claim. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (6). The district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), who recommended dismissal. The plaintiffs objected to the magistrate judge's recommended disposition of the motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reviewed the matter de novo. <i>See id.</i> The court ultimately issued a thoughtful opinion in which it (i) dismissed the claims against the federal defendants because the plaintiffs had failed to state any viable cause of action against them; (ii) dismissed the claims for money damages against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities on the ground of Eleventh Amendment immunity; (iii) dismissed the claims for prospective injunctive relief against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities because the plaintiffs had failed to state any claim cognizable under section 1983; (iv) dismissed the claims against the commonwealth defendants in their individual capacities based on qualified immunity; (v) dismissed the Privacy Act claims against the commonwealth defendants because the Act applies only to federal agencies; and (vi) elected not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims, which it dismissed without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c). <i>See Celta Constr. v.

Few principles are more sacrosanct in this circuit than the principle that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). As a corollary to this principle, \"a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Even during appellate review of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, which takes place under a set of plaintiff-friendly guidelines, the reviewing court cannot be expected to \"do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application of these wise insights narrows the field of our endeavor. In their brief, the plaintiffs completely ignore both the district court's holding on their Privacy Act claim and its scuttling of their supplemental claims. We therefore deem them to have waived any appeal as to those rulings. The only claims that remain for adjudication are those advanced under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. We address those claims in the pages that follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Constitutional Claims Against Federal Defendants.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs try to shoehorn their constitutional claims against the federal defendants into the contours of section 1983. That endeavor has all the hallmarks of a futile gesture: after all, a section 1983 claim normally does not lie against a federal official. <i>See Chatman v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479377\"><a href=\"/opinion/479377/philip-roberts-chatman-jr-v-commodore-de-hernandez-usn/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 455 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam) (\"Section 1983 applies to persons acting `under color of state law' and not to persons acting pursuant to federal law.\"). The plaintiffs allege no facts that might permit a detour around that rule. <i>Cf. Hampton v. Hanrahan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367126\"><a href=\"/opinion/367126/iberia-hampton-v-edward-v-hanrahan-united-states-of-america-ex-rel/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 623 (7th Cir.1979) (explaining that a section 1983 claim may lie against federal officers \"when [they] are engaged in a conspiracy with state officials to deprive constitutional rights\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal officials sometimes can be liable for constitutional torts committed under color of federal law on terms that bear a family resemblance to those that govern section 1983 actions. The doctoral framework was limned by the Supreme Court in <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of FBN,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 397, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span> (1971). Here, however, even if we give the plaintiffs the benefit of every doubt and recharacterize their claims against the federal defendants as <i>Bivens</i> claims, they would still succumb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint's only allegation against the federal defendants is that \"[HUD] was fully aware of [PRPHA's] absolute disregard of award procedures, and did not correct nor adequately supervise the wrongdoing . . . that it was funding.\" These bald assertions are fundamentally insufficient to support a <i>Bivens</i> claim. Most importantly, the plaintiffs have failed to connect the federal defendants to the actions central to this case, that is, the alleged debarment, PRPHA's \"nonresponsible bidder\" determination, and the 2002 rescission of the Lirios del Sur bid award. Although the amended complaint indicates that HUD may have had some general duty of oversight vis-&#224;-vis PRPHA, it does not allege any legally enforceable connection between HUD and the supposed deprivation of due process on which the plaintiffs' claims depend. Without such a connection, no colorable section 1983 claim exists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the language of the amended complaint indicates that, as to the federal defendants, the plaintiffs are attempting to raise a claim of negligent supervision. Such a claim, if stated, would constitute a tort action within the purview of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2671-2680, not a <i>Bivens</i> action. <i>See, e.g., Bolduc v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201496\"><a href=\"/opinion/201496/bolduc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 59-62 (1st Cir.2005). Yet the plaintiffs have not sued the United States in tort, nor have they alleged compliance with the administrative prerequisites for an FTCA action. <i>See Cotto v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606662\"><a href=\"/opinion/606662/evelyn-cotto-and-edwin-torres-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 280 (1st Cir.1993) (describing administrative scheme and explaining that \"[e]xhaustion of plaintiffs' administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the prosecution of their FTCA claims\"). This omission reinforces our conclusion that the allegations of the amended complaint engender no viable theory of liability against the federal defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Section 1983 Claims Against Commonwealth Defendants.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the plaintiffs effectively conceded that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars a federal court from awarding monetary damages against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities. <i>Celta Constr.,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d at 401. Yet Eleventh Amendment immunity does not bar prospective injunctive relief against official-capacity defendants. <i>See Rosie D. v. Swift,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200198\"><a href=\"/opinion/200198/rosie-d-v-swift/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 234 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Fred v.

Nor does that doctrine bar relief (whether in the form of money damages or an injunction) against the commonwealth defendants in their individual capacities. <i>See Ex Parte Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 159, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We proceed to examine these asserted claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Section 1983 supplies a private right of action against a person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.\" <i>Evans v.

The first condition of a viable section 1983 claim &#8212; that the act in question occur \"under color of state law\" &#8212; is satisfied here. Puerto Rico is considered a state for section 1983 purposes, <i>see Deniz v.

Thus, we focus the lens of our inquiry on the second condition of a viable section 1983 claim-whether there has been a deprivation of rights secured to the plaintiffs either by the Constitution or by federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the plaintiffs claim that they have been deprived of their Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process.

Although it does not embellish this bare conclusory allegation, we assume, favorably to the plaintiffs, that by suspension they mean effective debarment or even blacklisting. <i>See supra</i> note 5. Still, the amended complaint does not anchor this pejorative term in any supporting facts. In particular, the plaintiffs have not averred that they have bid on <i>any</i> PRPHA contracts other than Lirios del Sur since 1998. A single incident is insufficient to establish a pattern or practice of exclusion (and, thus, to establish even a de facto debarment). <i>Cf. Jensen v.

Elsewhere in the record, the plaintiffs flatly contradict their conclusory claim of effective debarment.

Thus, a would-be bidder cannot claim a property interest in the responsibility-determination procedure alone. <i>Cf. Navas v. Gonzalez Vales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446766\"><a href=\"/opinion/446766/luis-s-navas-v-luis-gonzalez-vales/\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 768 (1st Cir.1985) (\"[T]he mere fact that the [government] has promulgated procedural rules by which to make retention decisions does not by itself create a constitutionally cognizable property interest in continued employment . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, the plaintiffs' dashed hopes of receiving future government work, without more, cannot yield a constitutionally protected property interest. That is true even if those dashed hopes stem from PRPHA's nonresponsibility declaration. <i>See Walentas v. Lipper,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></span>, 419 (2d Cir.1988) (finding no property interest in a frustrated expectation of future employment). The short of it is that the plaintiffs do not have a strong enough claim of entitlement to a \"responsible bidder\" designation to create a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Rescission of the Bid Award.</i> Last but not least, the plaintiffs claim a property interest in the Lirios del Sur bid award &#8212; an award that PRPHA bestowed on them in 2001 and then revoked in 2002. A recurrent theme in this court's jurisprudence illuminates the path to our holding that the plaintiffs' interest in the bid award does not rise to the level of a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held with a regularity bordering on the echolalic that a simple breach of contract does not amount to an unconstitutional deprivation of property. <i>See, e.g., Lee v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669100\"><a href=\"/opinion/669100/tony-lee-v-the-life-insurance-company-of-north-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 20 n. 11 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Boston Envtl.

Many of our sister circuits have adopted a similar stance. <i>See, e.g., S&amp;D Maint. Co. v. Goldin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504644\"><a href=\"/opinion/504644/s-d-maintenance-co-inc-v-harrison-j-goldin-ross-sandler-abraham/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span>, 966 (2d Cir.1988) (\"An interest in enforcement of an ordinary commercial contract with a state is qualitatively different from the interests the Supreme Court has thus far viewed as `property' entitled to procedural due process protection.\"); <i>San Bernardino Physicians' Servs. Med. Group v. County of San Bernardino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492482\"><a href=\"/opinion/492482/san-bernardino-physicians-services-medical-group-inc-v-county-of-san/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1404</span></a></span>, 1410 (9th Cir.1987) (concluding that a contract that \"cannot sensibly be distinguished from construction contracts or even purely material supply contracts. . . presents no federal case\" under section 1983).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This view of the law makes eminently good sense. To hold otherwise would run the risk of transmogrifying virtually every dispute involving an alleged breach of contract by a state or a state agency into a constitutional case. We eschew so rash a course and hold, consistent with our prior precedents, that the existence of a state contract, simpliciter, does not confer upon the contracting parties a constitutionally protected property interest. <i>See Boston Envtl.,</i> 794 F.2d at 13; <i>see also Wehran-P.R., Inc. v. Municipality of Arecibo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510697\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510697/wehran-puerto-rico-inc-v-municipality-of-arecibo/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span>, 287 (D.P.R.2000) (observing correctly that this court has been reluctant to equate mere breaches of contract with due process violations). Thus, an alleged breach of such a contract is not per se actionable under section 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no special circumstances in this case that might justify a departure from this settled position. <i>See, e.g., Linan-Faye Constr. Co. v. Hous. Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691321\"><a href=\"/opinion/691321/linan-faye-construction-co-inc-v-housing-authority-of-the-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 932 (3d Cir.1995) (holding that two categories of state contracts can give rise to a constitutionally protected property interest: those that \"confer[] a protected status\" and those that \"include[] a provision that the state entity can terminate the contract only for cause\"). Indeed, the only special circumstances that might be gleaned from the amended complaint are the suspension and the related \"nonresponsible bidder\" determination, both of which already have been deemed insufficient to ground a constitutionally protected property interest. <i>See supra</i> Part III(D)(1)-(2). This is not a situation in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended complaint, stripped of rhetorical flourishes, tells a simple tale: PRPHA anointed Celta as the successful bidder for a construction project and then, upon its discovery of new information, reversed direction and rescinded the earlier award. Taking the well-pleaded facts in the amended complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, this story may suffice to state a breach of contract claim. When cast as a putative constitutional claim, however, the story rings hollow. Given the paucity of facts, allowing a section 1983 claim in a case like this one would lead us down a slippery slope to an untenable result: the constitutionalization of all contract law in cases in which a state actor is a party. We decline to take so precipitous a step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Because the plaintiffs identify no constitutionally protected property interest, it is unnecessary to delve any deeper into the section 1983 inquiry. By the same token, we need not reach either the issue of qualified immunity or the issue of whether the post-deprivation process available to Celta after the revocation of the bid award satisfied any applicable due process requirement. Without a constitutionally protected interest &#8212; and there is none here &#8212; the plaintiffs have no hope of stating a viable section 1983 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. If the plaintiffs have alleged any valid claim, it is a breach of contract claim. The district court dismissed that claim without prejudice to a refiling in the commonwealth courts-and the plaintiffs have not challenged the propriety of that ruling. None of the plaintiffs' other (preserved) claims states a cognizable basis on which relief can be granted. Accordingly, we uphold the district court's order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Redondo-Borges and RCC challenged the allegations of default, it is unclear what has become of that challenge.

That word choice leads to some confusion. Insofar as we can tell, what PRPHA allegedly breached was not a full-fledged construction contract (no such contract is alleged to have been entered into between Celta and PRPHA), but, rather, the antecedent bid award.
