This case arises from the events\n\nsurrounding the arrest of plaintiff William Tower, Jr., and the\n\nsubsequent removal of the Tower children from their home.              The\n\nplaintiffs appeal the denial of their motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings as well as the granting of defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment on the plaintiffs' numerous civil rights claims.               We\n\naffirm.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n          We review the district court's decision de novo, viewing\n\nthe facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.               See\n\nMacone v. Town of Wakefield, 277 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nPlaintiffs William Tower, Jr. (\"Tower\"), and his wife Ann Tower are\n\nthe parents   of   five   children.     Tower   has   a   fifteen-year-old\n\ndaughter, Melissa; Ann Tower has two teenaged children, Abigail and\n\nMarc; and together the Towers have two young children, William III\n\n(\"Billy\"), three years old, and Patricia, aged eleven months.1         All\n\nfive children lived with the Towers prior to the date of Tower's\n\narrest.\n\n          On January 24, 2001, Abigail reported to her high school\n\nguidance counselor that she and Marc had been beaten by their\n\nstepfather, Tower.    She related three incidents: that Tower had\n\npushed her into a trough in the family's barn that contained sharp\n\n\n\n     1\n       The children's stated ages represent their ages at the time\nof the arrest and removal.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fobjects including nails and glass; that he had bent her backwards\n\nover a board and beaten her about the face; and that he had knocked\n\nMarc down and had hit and kicked him because he believed that Marc\n\nhad been spying on their stepsister, Melissa, through a hole in the\n\nbathroom wall.    The guidance counselor also spoke with Marc, who\n\nattended the same high school, and who confirmed that this third\n\nincident had occurred.        Marc further related that Tower had on\n\nanother occasion chased him around the living room and told him\n\nthat if he caught him, he would kill him.         Marc said that he was\n\nafraid to go home, and that he was tired of being hit.               The\n\ncounselor notified the high school principal about the children's\n\nreports   of   abuse,   and    the    principal   notified   the   school\n\nsuperintendent.   A school official then forwarded the information\n\nto defendant State Trooper Darryl Peary, either in person or by\n\nleaving a telephone message. No further action was taken that day.\n\n          The next day, Peary went to the high school to interview\n\nAbigail and Marc.    The children repeated their reports of abuse,\n\nand reported additional details about the assault on Marc in which\n\nhe was repeatedly kicked in the head.       They also told Peary about\n\nanother incident in which Tower hit his own daughter, Melissa.\n\nAfter these interviews, Peary returned to his office in Skowhegan,\n\nMaine, to draft a request for a warrant to arrest Tower for\n\nmisdemeanor assault.     He also contacted the Maine Department of\n\nHuman Services (\"DHS\").        Based on the information gathered by\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fPeary, DHS sent two child protective workers, including defendant\n\nJoan Leslie-Brown, to interview the children at school.           Marc and\n\nAbigail repeated their reports, and added that there was ongoing\n\nconflict in the house where all five children resided.                When\n\nMelissa was interviewed, she confirmed that her father had hit her,\n\nand that the blow had caused her tooth to go through her lip.          She\n\nalso stated that she was afraid to go home.              The children were\n\ninterviewed separately and by different caseworkers, and their\n\nstories were consistent.\n\n              As these interviews were taking place, Peary went to the\n\nMaine District Court in Skowhegan to submit his warrant request.\n\nHe presented the warrant application to a clerk, who took the\n\napplication from him, and then returned a while later to inform him\n\nthat the warrant was active.        Peary did not receive a copy of the\n\nwarrant.\n\n              Peary returned to the high school after having been told\n\nthe warrant was active, and met with the workers from DHS.             One\n\nworker stayed with the three teenaged children at the high school,\n\nwhile Peary and Leslie-Brown headed to the Tower residence.          Peary\n\nwent   with    the   purpose   of   arresting   Tower,   and   Leslie-Brown\n\naccompanied him because they expected Tower to be alone with the\n\ntwo younger children at that time of day, and she intended to\n\nsupervise the children after Tower was arrested and until Ann Tower\n\ncame home.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          At the Tower residence, Peary, Leslie-Brown, and a number\n\nof state troopers who had joined them gained entry to the Towers'\n\nhome, and shortly thereafter, the troopers handcuffed and arrested\n\nTower.   During the arrest, Peary took Tower's key ring from him,\n\nstating that he needed the key to the gun cabinet.\n\n          After the arrest, Peary and Leslie-Brown remained in the\n\nhouse with the two younger children until Ann Tower returned,\n\napproximately forty minutes later.     During that time, Leslie-Brown\n\ncalled the high school and told the other caseworker to bring the\n\nthree teenagers home.   Peary made a number of long-distance phone\n\ncalls to other state officers.    When Ann Tower arrived, she spoke\n\nwith Peary as well as Leslie-Brown and the other caseworker.     Her\n\nconversation with the DHS workers led them to doubt her ability to\n\nprotect the children, and the caseworkers decided to remove all\n\nfive children from the home.     The children have been out of the\n\nTowers' custody ever since.\n\n          After taking the children to the DHS office in Skowhegan,\n\nthe caseworkers drafted a preliminary child protection order to\n\ngrant DHS emergency custody over them.       See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 4034 (West 2002).     The caseworkers then went with a\n\nsupervisor to the home of a Maine Probate Court judge, who granted\n\nthe petition and issued a preliminary protection order to place the\n\nchildren in DHS custody.   A hearing on the order was held five days\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\flater, on January 30, 2001, at which point the Towers consented to\n\nthe order.\n\n           On March 12, 2001, Ann Tower consented to the entry of a\n\n\"jeopardy order,\" which represents a finding by the state court\n\nthat the children were in \"circumstances of jeopardy to [their]\n\nhealth or welfare\" in her care.     See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,\n\n§ 4035 (West 2002).        Tower contested the entry of a similar\n\njeopardy order against him, but after an adversarial hearing, the\n\norder was entered by the court.    See In re Melissa T., 791 A.2d 98,\n\n99 (Me. 2002).\n\n             On May 1, 2001, the Towers brought the underlying 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 action against the Maine State Police, DHS, the\n\nchildren's guardian ad litem, and Trooper Peary and Caseworker\n\nLeslie-Brown in their individual and official capacities.           On\n\nOctober 9, 2001, the district court dismissed all claims except\n\nthose   against    Peary   and   Leslie-Brown   in   their   individual\n\ncapacities. See Tower v. Leslie-Brown, 167 F. Supp. 2d 399, 402-04\n\n(D. Me. 2001) (dismissing claims against Maine State Police, Maine\n\nDHS, and     Peary and Leslie-Brown in their official capacities on\n\nthe basis that, as state agencies and officials, they are not\n\nsubject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; dismissing claims against\n\nthe children's guardian ad litem for failure to state any factual\n\nallegations against her). The plaintiffs chose not to appeal those\n\ndismissals, and filed an amended complaint on January 15, 2002,\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fseeking relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and alleging that\n\nPeary and Leslie-Brown violated their First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth,\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights, and violated Title IV-E of the\n\nSocial Security Act.\n\n          On February 21, 2002, the Maine Law Court affirmed the\n\njeopardy orders against both Tower and Ann Tower.                   See In re\n\nMelissa T., 791 A.2d at 99.          On February 27, 2002, the state\n\nprosecutor dismissed the criminal charges against Tower.              On June\n\n19, 2002, the district court entered a sealed order and memorandum\n\ngranting the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all claims,\n\nand denying the plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n\nOn June 20, 2002, the district court entered final judgment for the\n\ndefendants.     This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.    ANALYSIS\n\n          The    Towers   claim    that   the    district   court    erred   in\n\ngranting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, arguing that\n\nthe defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity as to their\n\nFourth Amendment claims, and that valid constitutional violations\n\nwere stated as to their Fifth, Fourteenth, and First Amendment\n\nclaims.   We disagree.\n\nA.         Fourth Amendment\n\n           The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people\n\nto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures.\"            U.S. Const. amend. IV.       The\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fTowers contend that this security was violated when defendants\n\nentered their     home    without   a    warrant,     and   then   proceeded   to\n\nunreasonably seize and search the premises.                 They further argue\n\nthat the district court erred in its conclusion that Peary and\n\nLeslie-Brown were entitled to qualified immunity with regard to\n\nthese alleged violations.\n\n          1.       Entry to Arrest\n\n          The    Towers     claim   that      Peary   violated     their   Fourth\n\nAmendment rights by entering their home to arrest Tower without a\n\nvalid warrant. It is well established that \"a non-consensual, non-\n\nexigent, warrantless entry into a home to effectuate an arrest\n\ntransgresse[s] the Fourth Amendment, notwithstanding that probable\n\ncause sufficient to justify the same arrest in a more public arena\n\nmay have existed.\"        Buenrostro v. Collazo, 973 F.2d 39, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (citing Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 590 (1980)).\n\nIn this case, some doubt exists as to whether a valid arrest\n\nwarrant was issued.\n\n          Although the defendants insist that Peary obtained a\n\nproper warrant for Tower's arrest, no copy of the arrest warrant\n\nhas been produced.       Instead, the defendants produced a copy of the\n\ndocket sheet in Tower's criminal case, which stated that a warrant\n\nhad issued.     Unable to determine from the record whether a valid\n\nwarrant existed, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs\n\nhad raised, albeit by a slim margin, a genuine issue of fact as to\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fwhether the arrest warrant had been validly issued.                     Accordingly,\n\nthe district court assumed for the purposes of evaluating the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment that the Towers had stated\n\na Fourth Amendment violation.          The defendants do not dispute this\n\nconclusion, and there is no suggestion that exigent circumstances\n\nexisted to alleviate the need for the warrant.\n\n            Once we have determined that a viable constitutional\n\nclaim has been stated, we may move on to the qualified immunity\n\ninquiry.       \"[G]overnment      officials         performing         discretionary\n\nfunctions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages\n\ninsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\n\nwould have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).\n\nCertainly,    the    unlawfulness      of     entering     a    person's       home    to\n\neffectuate    a     warrantless   arrest       in   the    absence       of    exigent\n\ncircumstances was clearly established at the time of Tower's arrest\n\nin January 2001.       See Payton, 445 U.S. at 590.             But the qualified\n\nimmunity inquiry demands that we ask a second, more specific\n\nquestion:    would    a   reasonable    officer     have       known    that    it    was\n\nunlawful to enter the home under the specific circumstances faced?\n\nSee Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 637 (1987).\n\n            Maine law largely answers this question.                   By statute, an\n\narresting officer \"need not have the warrant in [his] possession at\n\nthe time of the arrest.\"            Me. R. Crim. P. 4(c)(3).                     It is\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\funcontested that Peary was told by a court employee that a valid\n\nwarrant had issued.    The district court concluded, as do we, that\n\nit was reasonable for defendants to rely on the representation of\n\na district court official, and that a reasonable actor would have\n\nbelieved that the warrant had issued.\n\n           The Towers argue that the district court improperly\n\nfailed to engage in an analysis of the defendants' subjective\n\nintent and absence of \"good faith.\"           In evaluating the officer's\n\nconduct, \"we do not focus on the official's subjective state of\n\nmind, such as bad faith or malicious intention . . . we [must\n\ninstead] make an objective analysis of the reasonableness of\n\nconduct in light of the facts actually known to the officer and not\n\nconsider the individual officer's subjective assessment of those\n\nfacts.    Nor are actual motives for conduct to be considered in\n\nevaluating a qualified immunity defense.\"             Sheehy v. Town of\n\nPlymouth, 191 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal quotations\n\nomitted) (quoting Floyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 4-6 (1st Cir.\n\n1985)); see also Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818.            Because objectively\n\nreasonable officers would not have known they were violating the\n\nTowers'   Fourth   Amendment   rights    by    entering   their   home,   the\n\ndefendants enjoy qualified immunity.\n\n           2.      Seizure of Residence\n\n           The Towers also assert that the defendants unreasonably\n\nseized their property by remaining in their home after Tower had\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fbeen removed.    \"A 'seizure' of property occurs when there is some\n\nmeaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests\n\nin that property.\"    United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113\n\n(1984).   However, even if defendants' presence in the home did\n\nconstitute a seizure, it was not an unreasonable one.           See U.S.\n\nConst. amend. IV; Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56, 61-62 (1992).\n\nIn circumstances such as this, \"we balance the privacy-related and\n\nlaw enforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion was\n\nreasonable.\"    Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 331 (2001).       The\n\ndefendants remained in the Towers' home to preserve the safety of\n\nits remaining occupants:      the Towers' eleven-month-old and three-\n\nyear-old children, Billy and Patricia.     Because the government has\n\na compelling interest in the welfare of children, see Watterson v.\n\nPage, 987 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1993), we find that no Fourth\n\nAmendment violation occurred.\n\n          The    plaintiffs    say,   however,   that   Tower   was   not\n\nvoluntarily absent from the home.        Certainly Tower's arrest and\n\ndetainment were not of his choosing.      Nevertheless, the fact that\n\nhe would have preferred to remain at home with his children rather\n\nthan in police custody did not render his absence from the home any\n\nless real.     The defendants remained in the home to care for the\n\nTowers' younger children.      The fact that Tower was involuntarily\n\nremoved from the home on charges of assaulting his older children\n\ndoes not strengthen his argument.\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f           3.      Search of Residence\n\n           The Towers' final Fourth Amendment claim is that the\n\ndefendants    improperly   searched   the   residence   after   Tower   was\n\nremoved.     But a \"protective sweep\" is permitted.      See Maryland v.\n\nBuie, 494 U.S. 325, 334-36 (1990) (permitting arresting officers\n\n\"to take reasonable steps to ensure their safety after, and while\n\nmaking [an] arrest\").\n\n           The plaintiffs say that an overly extensive search took\n\nplace, and cite the appearance of debris from the yard on an\n\nupstairs rug and under the stairs, the disappearance of a pair of\n\nnight vision goggles from Tower's gun cabinet, and an improperly\n\nclosed night stand drawer.     The defendants deny that there was any\n\nsearch other than Peary's sweep to determine that only the Tower\n\nfamily members were present in the home.         It is undisputed that\n\nPeary took the keys to the gun cabinet from Tower, but it is also\n\nundisputed that the missing goggles had not been seen for two\n\nmonths prior to the arrest.    The Towers thus have presented no more\n\nthan a mere scintilla of evidence, which is \"insufficient to defeat\n\na properly supported motion for summary judgment.\"        Torres v. E.I.\n\nDupont de Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nB.         Fifth Amendment\n\n           After Tower's arrest, Peary placed a number of long\n\ndistance phone calls from the Towers' phone while waiting for Ann\n\nTower to return home. The plaintiffs claim that these phone calls,\n\n                                  -13-\n\ffor which they were billed a total of $1.60, violated their Fifth\n\nAmendment rights under the Takings Clause.            We reiterate that this\n\nprovision \"does not proscribe the taking of property; it proscribes\n\ntaking      without   just    compensation.\"       Williamson     County   Reg'l\n\nPlanning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172, 194 (1985); see\n\nalso U.S. Const. amend. V (\"...nor shall private property be taken\n\nfor public use, without just compensation\"); Ochoa Realty Corp. v.\n\nFaria, 815 F.2d 812, 816-17 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing Williamson, 473\n\nU.S.   at    195).     If    state   law   makes   \"reasonable,    certain   and\n\nadequate\" provision for relief, a \"property owner cannot claim a\n\nviolation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the\n\nprocedure and been denied just compensation.\" Williamson, 473 U.S.\n\nat 194-95.       Further, if no such procedure exists, it is the\n\nplaintiffs' burden to prove that a state remedy is unavailable.\n\nDeniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo, 285 F.3d 142, 147 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).      Because the Towers have not sought reimbursement for the\n\nphone calls or established the futility of such a request, this\n\nclaim fails.\n\nC.            Fourteenth Amendment\n\n              The plaintiffs claim the denial of their substantive and\n\nprocedural due process rights, contesting both the removal of their\n\nchildren from their custody and the lack of notice and hearing\n\nprior to such removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f            The liberties protected by the Due Process Clause include\n\n\"the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the\n\ncare,    custody,    and    control   of    their    children.\"          Troxel   v.\n\nGranville, 530 U.S. 57, 65-66 (2000); see also Suboh v. District\n\nAttorney's Office of Suffolk, 298 F.3d 81, 91 (1st Cir. 2002).                    As\n\na general matter, this fundamental right is inviolate, and the\n\ndeprivation    of    such    right    would    constitute       a     violation   of\n\nsubstantive due process.           Hatch v. Dep’t for Children, Youth &\n\nTheir    Families,   274    F.3d   12,   22   (1st   Cir.      2001).     However,\n\n\"[b]ecause the welfare of the child is paramount, an objectively\n\nreasonable suspicion of abuse justifies protective measures.\"                     Id.\n\nat 21.\n\n            The defendants removed the Towers' five children from\n\ntheir care and custody, but no substantive due process violation is\n\nstated if there existed a reasonable suspicion that abuse had\n\noccurred or that a threat of abuse was imminent at the time of\n\nremoval.    Hatch, 274 F.3d at 22.          The defendants had been told by\n\nthe three older children that Tower struck them.                    See id. at 21\n\n(\"[E]vidence of even a single instance of abuse may . . . warrant\n\nimmediate state action on a child's behalf.\").                 Conversations with\n\nAnn Tower led the defendants to believe that she was either\n\nunwilling or unable to prevent further abuse.                       An objectively\n\nreasonable    suspicion     of   abuse     existed   as   to    the    three   older\n\nchildren, as well as an imminent threat of abuse as to all five.\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f           We now turn to the Towers' procedural due process claims.\n\n\"Once the state takes temporary custody of a child, it must follow\n\nprocedures adequate to justify that detention.\" Hatch, 274 F.3d at\n\n21 n.3. Unless the state employs procedural safeguards against the\n\nerroneous deprivation of fundamental rights, a claim for a denial\n\nof procedural due process may be stated.      See Cleveland Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985) (\"The categories of\n\nsubstance and procedure are distinct.\").\n\n           Ordinarily, a deprivation of a fundamental right such as\n\nthe custody of one's children must be preceded by notice and an\n\nopportunity to be heard on the matter.   See Loudermill, 470 U.S. at\n\n542.   However, in cases where the safety of the child is at risk,\n\nthe parents' rights are not absolute.    \"[I]n those extra-ordinary\n\nsituations where deprivation of a protected interest is permitted\n\nwithout prior process, the constitutional requirements of notice\n\nand an opportunity to be heard are not eliminated, but merely\n\npostponed.\"   Suboh, 298 F.3d at 92.       There still must be \"an\n\nadequate post-deprivation hearing within a reasonable time.\"    Id.\n\nat 94 (internal quotations omitted); see also Loudermill, 470 U.S.\n\nat 542 n.7 (\"There are, of course, some situations in which a\n\npostdeprivation hearing will satisfy due process requirements.\")\n\n           The post-deprivation hearing took place three business-\n\ndays after the children's removal, and Leslie-Brown had gone to the\n\nhome of a Maine Probate Court judge to seek ex parte review of the\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fremoval    decision   within      hours   of   the    removal.     These   two\n\nopportunities for judicial review satisfied the prompt and fair\n\nprocess requirement due the Towers. See Jordan v. Jackson, 15 F.3d\n\n333, 349    (4th   Cir.   1994)    (finding    no    procedural   due   process\n\nviolation where child was removed and no ex parte review was sought\n\nfor sixty-five hours); Cecere v. City of New York, 967 F.2d 826,\n\n830 (2d Cir. 1992) (holding that emergency circumstances justified\n\nan immediate removal of the child from her parent, and that a four-\n\nday delay without a post-deprivation hearing was constitutionally\n\npermissible); see also Berman v. Young, 291 F.3d 976, 985 (7th Cir.\n\n2002) (holding that a 72-day delay in providing a hearing after\n\nchild was removed was not \"prompt and fair\" post-deprivation\n\njudicial review, but that no harm resulted).\n\n           The Towers argue that, despite the post-removal measures\n\ntaken in this case, no notice or hearing was given before the\n\nchildren were removed.     But we have said that state actors may take\n\nemergency measures and place a child in temporary custody before\n\nobtaining a court order when they have evidence that a child has\n\nbeen abused or is in imminent danger.           See Suboh, 298 F.3d at 92.\n\nBecause such evidence existed here, and because adequate post-\n\nremoval procedures were employed, the plaintiffs have failed to\n\nstate a constitutional violation of due process.\n\nD.         First Amendment and Remaining Claims\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f          The Towers claim perfunctorily that their First Amendment\n\nrights were violated by Leslie-Brown when she refused to permit the\n\nTowers to attend the same religious services, and to refrain from\n\nall contact with each other.     \"It is not enough merely to mention\n\na possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to\n\ndo counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put\n\nflesh on its bones.\"   United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).   The mere allusion to the infringement of the right to\n\nworship or the right to free association is insufficient to put the\n\nmatter in issue.\n\n          Similarly, the plaintiffs state in their reply brief that\n\nthere remain issues as to substantive and procedural due process,\n\nequal protection, and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act that\n\nare not argued in their briefs, but which were not intended to be\n\nabandoned on appeal.   Despite these protestations, we have made it\n\nabundantly clear that failure to brief an argument does, in fact,\n\nconstitute waiver for purposes of appeal.       See Oritz v.

The plaintiffs appeal the denial of their motion for judgment on the pleadings as well as the granting of defendants' motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' numerous civil rights claims. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's decision de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <i>See Macone v. Town of Wakefield,</i> 277 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2002). Plaintiffs William Tower, Jr. (\"Tower\"), and his wife Ann Tower are the parents of five children. Tower has a fifteen-year-old daughter, Melissa; Ann Tower has two teenaged children, Abigail and Marc; and together the Towers have two young children, William III (\"Billy\"), three years old, and Patricia, aged eleven months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> All five children lived with the Towers prior to the date of Tower's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 2001, Abigail reported to her high school guidance counselor that she and Marc had been beaten by their stepfather, Tower. She related three incidents: that Tower had pushed her into a trough in the family's barn that contained sharp objects including nails and glass; that he had bent her backwards over a board and beaten her about the face; and that he had knocked Marc down and had hit and kicked him because he believed that Marc had been spying on their stepsister, Melissa, through a hole in the bathroom wall. The guidance counselor also spoke with Marc, who attended the same high school, and who confirmed that this third incident had occurred. Marc further related that Tower had on another occasion chased him around the living room and told him that if he caught him, he would kill him. Marc said that he was afraid to go home, and that he was tired of being hit. The counselor notified the high school principal about the children's reports of abuse, and the principal notified the school superintendent. A school official then forwarded the information to defendant State Trooper Darryl Peary, either in person or by leaving a telephone message. No further action was taken that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Peary went to the high school to interview Abigail and Marc. The children repeated their reports of abuse, and reported additional details about the assault on Marc in which he was repeatedly kicked in the head. They also told Peary about another incident in which Tower hit his own daughter, Melissa. After these interviews, Peary returned to his office in Skowhegan, Maine, to draft a request for a warrant to arrest Tower for misdemeanor assault. He also contacted the Maine Department of Human Services (\"DHS\"). Based on the information gathered by Peary, DHS sent two child protective workers, including defendant Joan Leslie-Brown, to interview the children at school. Marc and Abigail repeated their reports, and added that there was ongoing conflict in the house where all five children resided. When Melissa was interviewed, she confirmed that her father had hit her, and that the blow had caused her tooth to go through her lip. She also stated that she was afraid to go home. The children were interviewed separately and by different caseworkers, and their stories were consistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As these interviews were taking place, Peary went to the Maine District Court in Skowhegan to submit his warrant request. He presented the warrant application to a clerk, who took the application from him, and then returned a while later to inform him that the warrant was active. Peary did not receive a copy of the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peary returned to the high school after having been told the warrant was active, and met with the workers from DHS. One worker stayed with the three teenaged children at the high school, while Peary and Leslie-Brown headed to the Tower residence. Peary went with the purpose of arresting Tower, and Leslie-Brown accompanied him because they expected Tower to be alone with the two younger children at that time of day, and she intended to supervise the children after Tower was arrested and until Ann Tower came home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the Tower residence, Peary, Leslie-Brown, and a number of state troopers who had joined them gained entry to the Towers' home, and shortly thereafter, the troopers handcuffed and arrested Tower. During the arrest, Peary took Tower's key ring from him, stating that he needed the key to the gun cabinet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the arrest, Peary and Leslie-Brown remained in the house with the two younger children until Ann Tower returned, approximately forty minutes later. During that time, Leslie-Brown called the high school and told the other caseworker to bring the three teenagers home. Peary made a number of long-distance phone calls to other state officers. When Ann Tower arrived, she spoke with Peary as well as Leslie-Brown and the other caseworker. Her conversation with the DHS workers led them to doubt her ability to protect the children, and the caseworkers decided to remove all five children from the home. The children have been out of the Towers' custody ever since.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After taking the children to the DHS office in Skowhegan, the caseworkers drafted a preliminary child protection order to grant DHS emergency custody over them. See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 4034 (West 2002). The caseworkers then went with a supervisor to the home of a Maine Probate Court judge, who granted the petition and issued a preliminary protection order to place the children in DHS custody. A hearing on the order was held five days later, on January 30, 2001, at which point the Towers consented to the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 12, 2001, Ann Tower consented to the entry of a \"jeopardy order,\" which represents a finding by the state court that the children were in \"circumstances of jeopardy to [their] health or welfare\" in her care. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 4035 (West 2002). Tower contested the entry of a similar jeopardy order against him, but after an adversarial hearing, the order was entered by the court. <i>See In re Melissa T.,</i> 791 A.2d 98, 99 (Me.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2001, the Towers brought the underlying 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 action against the Maine State Police, DHS, the children's guardian ad litem, and Trooper Peary and Caseworker Leslie-Brown in their individual and official capacities. On October 9, 2001, the district court dismissed all claims except those against Peary and Leslie-Brown in their individual capacities. <i>See Tower v. Leslie-Brown,</i> 167 F.Supp.2d 399, 402-04 (D.Me.2001) (dismissing claims against Maine State Police, Maine DHS, and Peary and Leslie-Brown in their official capacities on the basis that, as state agencies and officials, they are not subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983; dismissing claims against the children's guardian ad litem for failure to state any factual allegations against her). The plaintiffs chose not to appeal those dismissals, and filed an amended complaint on January 15, 2002, seeking relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and alleging that Peary and Leslie-Brown violated their First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and violated Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 2002, the Maine Law Court affirmed the jeopardy orders against both Tower and Ann Tower. <i>See In re Melissa T.,</i> 791 A.2d at 99. On February 27, 2002, the state prosecutor dismissed the criminal charges against Tower. On June 19, 2002, the district court entered a sealed order and memorandum granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all claims, and denying the plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings. On June 20, 2002, the district court entered final judgment for the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers claim that the district court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, arguing that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity as to their Fourth Amendment claims, and that valid constitutional violations were stated as to their Fifth, Fourteenth, and First Amendment claims. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Fourth Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. The Towers contend that this security was violated when defendants entered their home without a warrant, and then proceeded to unreasonably seize and search the premises. They further argue that the district court erred in its conclusion that Peary and Leslie-Brown were entitled to qualified immunity with regard to these alleged violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Entry to Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers claim that Peary violated their Fourth Amendment rights by entering their home to arrest Tower without a valid warrant. It is well established that \"a non-consensual, non-exigent, warrantless entry into a home to effectuate an arrest transgresse[s] the Fourth Amendment, notwithstanding that probable cause sufficient to justify the same arrest in a more public arena may have existed.\" <i>Buenrostro v. Collazo,</i> 973 F.2d 39, 43 (1st Cir.1992) (citing <i>Payton v. New York,</i> 445 U.S. 573, 590, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980)). In this case, some doubt exists as to whether a valid arrest warrant was issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the defendants insist that Peary obtained a proper warrant for Tower's arrest, no copy of the arrest warrant has been produced. Instead, the defendants produced a copy of the docket sheet in Tower's criminal case, which stated that a warrant had issued. Unable to determine from the record whether a valid warrant existed, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had raised, albeit by a slim margin, a genuine issue of fact as to whether the arrest warrant had been validly issued. Accordingly, the district court assumed for the purposes of evaluating the defendants' motion for summary judgment that the Towers had stated a Fourth Amendment violation. The defendants do not dispute this conclusion, and there is no suggestion that exigent circumstances existed to alleviate the need for the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once we have determined that a viable constitutional claim has been stated, we may move on to the qualified immunity inquiry. \"[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Certainly, the unlawfulness of entering a person's home to effectuate a warrantless arrest in the absence of exigent circumstances was clearly established at the time of Tower's arrest in January 2001. <i>See Payton,</i> 445 U.S. at 590, 100 S.Ct. 1371. But the qualified immunity inquiry demands that we ask a second, more specific question: would a reasonable officer have known that it was unlawful to enter the home under the specific circumstances faced? <i>See Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 637, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine law largely answers this question. By statute, an arresting officer \"need not have the warrant in [his] possession at the time of the arrest.\" Me. R.Crim. P. 4(c)(3). It is uncontested that Peary was told by a court employee that a valid warrant had issued. The district court concluded, as do we, that it was reasonable for defendants to rely on the representation of a district court official, and that a reasonable actor would have believed that the warrant had issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers argue that the district court improperly failed to engage in an analysis of the defendants' subjective intent and absence of \"good faith.\" In evaluating the officer's conduct, \"we do not focus on the official's subjective state of mind, such as bad faith or malicious intention... we [must instead] make an objective analysis of the reasonableness of conduct in light of the facts actually known to the officer and not consider the individual officer's subjective assessment of those facts. Nor are actual motives for conduct to be considered in evaluating a qualified immunity defense.\" <i>Sheehy v. Town of Plymouth,</i> 191 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.1999) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <i>Floyd v. Farrell,</i> 765 F.2d 1, 4-6 (1st Cir. 1985)); <i>see also Harlow,</i> 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727. Because objectively reasonable officers would not have known they were violating the Towers' Fourth Amendment rights by entering their home, the defendants enjoy qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Seizure of Residence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers also assert that the defendants unreasonably seized their property by remaining in their home after Tower had been removed. \"A `seizure' of property occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in that property.\" <i>United States v. Jacobsen,</i> 466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984). However, even if defendants' presence in the home did constitute a seizure, it was not an unreasonable one. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. IV; <i>Soldal v. Cook County,</i> 506 U.S. 56, 61-62, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992). In circumstances such as this, \"we balance the privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion was reasonable.\" <i>Illinois v. McArthur,</i> 531 U.S. 326, 331, 121 S.Ct. 946, 148 L.Ed.2d 838 (2001). The defendants remained in the Towers' home to preserve the safety of its remaining occupants: the Towers' eleven-month-old and three-year-old children, Billy and Patricia. Because the government has a compelling interest in the welfare of children, <i>see Watterson v. Page,</i> 987 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1993), we find that no Fourth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs say, however, that Tower was not voluntarily absent from the home. Certainly Tower's arrest and detainment were not of his choosing. Nevertheless, the fact that he would have preferred to remain at home with his children rather than in police custody did not render his absence from the home any less real. The defendants remained in the home to care for the Towers' younger children. The fact that Tower was involuntarily removed from the home on charges of assaulting his older children does not strengthen his argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Search of Residence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers' final Fourth Amendment claim is that the defendants improperly searched the residence after Tower was removed. But a \"protective sweep\" is permitted. <i>See Maryland v. Buie,</i> 494 U.S. 325, 334-36, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990) (permitting arresting officers \"to take reasonable steps to ensure their safety after, and while making [an] arrest\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs say that an overly extensive search took place, and cite the appearance of debris from the yard on an upstairs rug and under the stairs, the disappearance of a pair of night vision goggles from Tower's gun cabinet, and an improperly closed night stand drawer. The defendants deny that there was any search other than Peary's sweep to determine that only the Tower family members were present in the home. It is undisputed that Peary took the keys to the gun cabinet from Tower, but it is also undisputed that the missing goggles had not been seen for two months prior to the arrest. The Towers thus have presented no more than a mere scintilla of evidence, which is \"insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Torres v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Fifth Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Tower's arrest, Peary placed a number of long distance phone calls from the Towers' phone while waiting for Ann Tower to return home. The plaintiffs claim that these phone calls, for which they were billed a total of $1.60, violated their Fifth Amendment rights under the Takings Clause. We reiterate that this provision \"does not proscribe the taking of property; it proscribes taking without just compensation.\" <i>Williamson County Reg'l Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank,</i> 473 U.S. 172, 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985); <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. amend. V (\"... nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\"); <i>Ochoa Realty Corp. v. Faria,</i> 815 F.2d 812, 816-17 (1st Cir.1987) (citing <i>Williamson,</i> 473 U.S. at 195, 105 S.Ct. 3108). If state law makes \"reasonable, certain and adequate\" provision for relief, a \"property owner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.\" <i>Williamson,</i> 473 U.S. at 194-95, 105 S.Ct. 3108. Further, if no such procedure exists, it is the plaintiffs' burden to prove that a state remedy is unavailable. <i>Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> 285 F.3d 142, 147 (1st Cir.2002). Because the Towers have not sought reimbursement for the phone calls or established the futility of such a request, this claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Fourteenth Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs claim the denial of their substantive and procedural due process rights, contesting both the removal of their children from their custody and the lack of notice and hearing prior to such removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liberties protected by the Due Process Clause include \"the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\" <i>Troxel v. Granville,</i> 530 U.S. 57, 65-66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); <i>see also Suboh v. District Attorney's Office of Suffolk,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 91 (1st Cir.2002). As a general matter, this fundamental right is inviolate, and the deprivation of such right would constitute a violation of substantive due process. <i>Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth &amp; Their Families,</i> 274 F.3d 12, 22 (1st Cir. 2001). However, \"[b]ecause the welfare of the child is paramount, an objectively reasonable suspicion of abuse justifies protective measures.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants removed the Towers' five children from their care and custody, but no substantive due process violation is stated if there existed a reasonable suspicion that abuse had occurred or that a threat of abuse was imminent at the time of removal. <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 22. The defendants had been told by the three older children that Tower struck them. <i>See id.</i> at 21 (\"[E]vidence of even a single instance of abuse may ... warrant immediate state action on a child's behalf.\"). Conversations with Ann Tower led the defendants to believe that she was either unwilling or unable to prevent further abuse. An objectively reasonable suspicion of abuse existed as to the three older children, as well as an imminent threat of abuse as to all five.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the Towers' procedural due process claims. \"Once the state takes temporary custody of a child, it must follow procedures adequate to justify that detention.\" <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 21 n. 3. Unless the state employs procedural safeguards against the erroneous deprivation of fundamental rights, a claim for a denial of procedural due process may be stated. <i>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (\"The categories of substance and procedure are distinct.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a deprivation of a fundamental right such as the custody of one's children must be preceded by notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter. <i>See Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487. However, in cases where the safety of the child is at risk, the parents' rights are not absolute. \"[I]n those extra-ordinary situations where deprivation of a protected interest is permitted without prior process, the constitutional requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard are not eliminated, but merely postponed.\" <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 92. There still must be \"an adequate post-deprivation hearing within a reasonable time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 94 (internal quotations omitted); <i>see also Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 542 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 1487 (\"There are, of course, some situations in which a postdeprivation hearing will satisfy due process requirements.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The post-deprivation hearing took place three business-days after the children's removal, and Leslie-Brown had gone to the home of a Maine Probate Court judge to seek ex parte review of the removal decision within hours of the removal. These two opportunities for judicial review satisfied the prompt and fair process requirement due the Towers. <i>See Jordan v. Jackson,</i> 15 F.3d 333, 349 (4th Cir.1994) (finding no procedural due process violation where child was removed and no ex parte review was sought for sixty-five hours); <i>Cecere v. City of New York,</i> 967 F.2d 826, 830 (2d Cir.1992) (holding that emergency circumstances justified an immediate removal of the child from her parent, and that a four-day delay without a post-deprivation hearing was constitutionally permissible); <i>see also Berman v. Young,</i> 291 F.3d 976, 985 (7th Cir.2002) (holding that a 72-day delay in providing a hearing after child was removed was not \"prompt and fair\" post-deprivation judicial review, but that no harm resulted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers argue that, despite the post-removal measures taken in this case, no notice or hearing was given before the children were removed. But we have said that state actors may take emergency measures and place a child in temporary custody before obtaining a court order when they have evidence that a child has been abused or is in imminent danger. <i>See Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 92. Because such evidence existed here, and because adequate post-removal procedures were employed, the plaintiffs have failed to state a constitutional violation of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. First Amendment and Remaining Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers claim perfunctorily that their First Amendment rights were violated by Leslie-Brown when she refused to permit the Towers to attend the same religious services, and to refrain from all contact with each other. \"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\" <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). The mere allusion to the infringement of the right to worship or the right to free association is insufficient to put the matter in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the plaintiffs state in their reply brief that there remain issues as to substantive and procedural due process, equal protection, and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act that are not argued in their briefs, but which were not intended to be abandoned on appeal. Despite these protestations, we have made it abundantly clear that failure to brief an argument does, in fact, constitute waiver for purposes of appeal. <i>See Ortiz v. Gaston County Dyeing Mach. Co.,</i> 277 F.3d 594, 598 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Gosselin v. Massachusetts,</i> 276 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Garcia-Ayala v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's decision de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <i>See Macone v. Town of Wakefield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776183\"><a href=\"/opinion/776183/thomas-j-macone-and-frank-bramante-trustees-of-bramac-development-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2002). Plaintiffs William Tower, Jr. (\"Tower\"), and his wife Ann Tower are the parents of five children. Tower has a fifteen-year-old daughter, Melissa; Ann Tower has two teenaged children, Abigail and Marc; and together the Towers have two young children, William III (\"Billy\"), three years old, and Patricia, aged eleven months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> All five children lived with the Towers prior to the date of Tower's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 2001, Abigail reported to her high school guidance counselor that she and Marc had been beaten by their stepfather, Tower. She related three incidents: that Tower had pushed her into a trough in the family's barn that contained sharp objects including nails and glass; that he had bent her backwards over a board and beaten her about the face; and that he had knocked Marc down and had hit and kicked him because he believed that Marc had been spying on their stepsister, Melissa, through a hole in the bathroom wall. The guidance counselor also spoke with Marc, who attended the same high school, and who confirmed that this third incident had occurred. Marc further related that Tower had on another occasion chased him around the living room and told him that if he caught him, he would kill him. Marc said that he was afraid to go home, and that he was tired of being hit. The counselor notified the high school principal about the children's reports of abuse, and the principal notified the school superintendent. A school official then forwarded the information to defendant State Trooper Darryl Peary, either in person or by leaving a telephone message. No further action was taken that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Peary went to the high school to interview Abigail and Marc. The children repeated their reports of abuse, and reported additional details about the assault on Marc in which he was repeatedly kicked in the head. They also told Peary about another incident in which Tower hit his own daughter, Melissa. After these interviews, Peary returned to his office in Skowhegan, Maine, to draft a request for a warrant to arrest Tower for misdemeanor assault. He also contacted the Maine Department of Human Services (\"DHS\"). Based on the information gathered by Peary, DHS sent two child protective workers, including defendant Joan Leslie-Brown, to interview the children at school. Marc and Abigail repeated their reports, and added that there was ongoing conflict in the house where all five children resided. When Melissa was interviewed, she confirmed that her father had hit her, and that the blow had caused her tooth to go through her lip. She also stated that she was afraid to go home. The children were interviewed separately and by different caseworkers, and their stories were consistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As these interviews were taking place, Peary went to the Maine District Court in Skowhegan to submit his warrant request. He presented the warrant application to a clerk, who took the application from him, and then returned a while later to inform him that the warrant was active. Peary did not receive a copy of the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peary returned to the high school after having been told the warrant was active, and met with the workers from DHS. One worker stayed with the three teenaged children at the high school, while Peary and Leslie-Brown headed to the Tower residence. Peary went with the purpose of arresting Tower, and Leslie-Brown accompanied him because they expected Tower to be alone with the two younger children at that time of day, and she intended to supervise the children after Tower was arrested and until Ann Tower came home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the Tower residence, Peary, Leslie-Brown, and a number of state troopers who had joined them gained entry to the Towers' home, and shortly thereafter, the troopers handcuffed and arrested Tower. During the arrest, Peary took Tower's key ring from him, stating that he needed the key to the gun cabinet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the arrest, Peary and Leslie-Brown remained in the house with the two younger children until Ann Tower returned, approximately forty minutes later. During that time, Leslie-Brown called the high school and told the other caseworker to bring the three teenagers home. Peary made a number of long-distance phone calls to other state officers. When Ann Tower arrived, she spoke with Peary as well as Leslie-Brown and the other caseworker. Her conversation with the DHS workers led them to doubt her ability to protect the children, and the caseworkers decided to remove all five children from the home. The children have been out of the Towers' custody ever since.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After taking the children to the DHS office in Skowhegan, the caseworkers drafted a preliminary child protection order to grant DHS emergency custody over them. See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 4034 (West 2002). The caseworkers then went with a supervisor to the home of a Maine Probate Court judge, who granted the petition and issued a preliminary protection order to place the children in DHS custody. A hearing on the order was held five days later, on January 30, 2001, at which point the Towers consented to the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 12, 2001, Ann Tower consented to the entry of a \"jeopardy order,\" which represents a finding by the state court that the children were in \"circumstances of jeopardy to [their] health or welfare\" in her care. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 4035 (West 2002). Tower contested the entry of a similar jeopardy order against him, but after an adversarial hearing, the order was entered by the court. <i>See In re Melissa T.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span>, 99 (Me.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2001, the Towers brought the underlying 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 action against the Maine State Police, DHS, the children's guardian ad litem, and Trooper Peary and Caseworker Leslie-Brown in their individual and official capacities. On October 9, 2001, the district court dismissed all claims except those against Peary and Leslie-Brown in their individual capacities. <i>See Tower v.

The plaintiffs chose not to appeal those dismissals, and filed an amended complaint on January 15, 2002, seeking relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and alleging that Peary and Leslie-Brown violated their First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and violated Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 2002, the Maine Law Court affirmed the jeopardy orders against both Tower and Ann Tower. <i>See In re Melissa T.,</i> 791 A.2d at 99. On February 27, 2002, the state prosecutor dismissed the criminal charges against Tower. On June 19, 2002, the district court entered a sealed order and memorandum granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all claims, and denying the plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings. On June 20, 2002, the district court entered final judgment for the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers claim that the district court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, arguing that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity as to their Fourth Amendment claims, and that valid constitutional violations were stated as to their Fifth, Fourteenth, and First Amendment claims. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Fourth Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. The Towers contend that this security was violated when defendants entered their home without a warrant, and then proceeded to unreasonably seize and search the premises. They further argue that the district court erred in its conclusion that Peary and Leslie-Brown were entitled to qualified immunity with regard to these alleged violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Entry to Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Towers claim that Peary violated their Fourth Amendment rights by entering their home to arrest Tower without a valid warrant. It is well established that \"a non-consensual, non-exigent, warrantless entry into a home to effectuate an arrest transgresse[s] the Fourth Amendment, notwithstanding that probable cause sufficient to justify the same arrest in a more public arena may have existed.\" <i>Buenrostro v.

Instead, the defendants produced a copy of the docket sheet in Tower's criminal case, which stated that a warrant had issued. Unable to determine from the record whether a valid warrant existed, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had raised, albeit by a slim margin, a genuine issue of fact as to whether the arrest warrant had been validly issued. Accordingly, the district court assumed for the purposes of evaluating the defendants' motion for summary judgment that the Towers had stated a Fourth Amendment violation. The defendants do not dispute this conclusion, and there is no suggestion that exigent circumstances existed to alleviate the need for the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once we have determined that a viable constitutional claim has been stated, we may move on to the qualified immunity inquiry. \"[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" <i>Harlow v.

It is undisputed that Peary took the keys to the gun cabinet from Tower, but it is also undisputed that the missing goggles had not been seen for two months prior to the arrest.
