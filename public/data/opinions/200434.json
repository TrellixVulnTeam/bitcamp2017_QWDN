Jay A. Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Idalia Marie Diaz-Pedrosa with whom Moreda & Moreda was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Anita Montaner-Sevillano with whom Francisco Chevere and\nMcConnell Valdes were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 18, 2003\n\f       COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.            Appellant Maria Zukowski was\n\ndischarged by her employer, appellee St. Lukes Home Care Program,\n\nfollowing    a   verbal      exchange    with   a    supervisor     about    a    memo\n\nconcerning her history of absenteeism and tardiness. Appellee says\n\nshe was fired because the memo incident was the third instance of\n\ndisrespectful behavior toward co-workers, and she previously had\n\nbeen    warned   that     another     episode       would   lead   to     discharge.\n\nAppellant, however, maintains that she was terminated based on her\n\nage and national origin.\n\n       The United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico granted summary judgment for appellee, concluding that the\n\noffered evidence of discrimination was insufficient to support\n\nappellant's claims. She sought reconsideration, primarily based on\n\na prior Commonwealth court finding that she had been wrongfully\n\nterminated; she asserted that the earlier ruling determined that\n\nSt. Lukes' justification for her firing was pretextual, and she\n\naccused appellee of misrepresentation \"tantamount to fraud\" for\n\nfailing to fully inform         the federal court of the significance of\n\nthat decision.        The district court refused to disturb its earlier\n\nruling, and this appeal followed.             We affirm.\n\n                                    I. Background\n\n       We   briefly    set    out    additional      details     relevant    to   our\n\nconsideration     of    the    appeal.        The     incident     that    triggered\n\nappellant's discharge occurred late on Friday, March 13, 1992.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fAppellant and other employees in her department received memoranda\n\nfrom their supervisor, Eugenia Rivera, about their vacation and\n\nsick time.     Appellant stated that she was \"traumatized\" by the\n\nmemo, and it is undisputed that she expressed disagreement with its\n\ncontents and complained that it had ruined her weekend.               In a memo\n\non the incident, Rivera reported that appellant had spoken to her\n\n\"in   an   altered   and    disrespectful     manner\"   in    front   of   other\n\nemployees, asserted that she (appellant) would not work overtime\n\nany more, and complained that this was \"worse than communism with\n\nFidel Castro.\"       Rivera's superiors stated that they investigated\n\nthe incident and reviewed appellant's disciplinary file before\n\nterminating her on March 17.        She was forty-seven years old.\n\n      Following her discharge, appellant initially filed a claim\n\nagainst St. Lukes in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance (CFI),\n\nPonce District, alleging unjust dismissal under Puerto Rico \"Law\n\n80,\" P.R.    Laws    Ann.   tit.   29,   §§   185a-185m.1      In   finding   in\n\nappellant's favor, the CFI judge stated that Rivera was \"neither\n\ncredible nor trustworthy, when stating that [appellant] reacted in\n\na very belligerent and disrespectful manner.\"                The court further\n\nobserved:\n\n      The version about said events provided by [appellant]\n      seems, to us, to be more credible when she indicated that\n\n\n      1\n       Law 80 deems as without just cause discharges made \"by the\nmere whim or fancy of the employer or without any reason related to\nthe proper and normal operation of the establishment.\" 29 P.R.\nLaws Ann. tit. 29, § 185b.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f       she had asked how she could improve her absences from\n       vacation, if those were entitlements acknowledged by law,\n       and the same as to any days she was entitled to under\n       sick leave.     Equally trustworthy was [appellant's]\n       statements indicating that her only comment at the time\n       was that, as a result of such notice, her week-end had\n       gone afoul.\n\nThe court, after observing that other employees also made comments\n\nabout the memo but were not disciplined, concluded that \"[t]he\n\nsanctions imposed in view of the comments made by Complainant to\n\nMrs. Rivera Collazo, are way out of proportion.\"\n\n       After exhausting the requisite administrative requirements,\n\nappellant in October 1998 filed this action in federal court\n\nalleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42   U.S.C.    §§   2000e    to   2000e-17,   the      Age    Discrimination   in\n\nEmployment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, and Puerto Rico's\n\nemployment discrimination statute, \"Law 100,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n29, § 146. To support her discrimination claims, appellant, who is\n\nof German origin, offered the following evidence: (1) comments by\n\ntwo co-workers in 1986 and her supervisor, Rivera, in 1990 or 1991,\n\nabout the way she pronounced \"the 'ss' sound,\" (2) that Rivera and\n\nothers would refer to her as \"the German\" or \"the Polish,\" (3) a\n\ncritical     comment   \"yell[ed]\"     at    her   by    St.    Lukes'   executive\n\ndirector, Luz N. Rodriguez, about gift customs \"in your country,\"\n\n(4) that on one occasion in 1986 when plaintiff was covering the\n\nswitchboard, Rodriguez told plaintiff she was not being understood\n\nwhen   she    spoke,   (5)   that   Rivera    and      another   employee   would\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fsometimes call her \"la vieja\" (old woman), and (6) on one occasion,\n\nRivera asked her why she did not resign, get food stamps, and go\n\ntake care of her mother.\n\n     St. Lukes moved for summary judgment on May 26, 2000, and\n\nappellant replied on September 18 of that year.       On May 8, 2002,\n\nrepresented by new counsel, appellant filed a motion for additional\n\ndiscovery under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\n     Five days later, on May 14, 2002, the district court entered\n\nits summary judgment ruling (which was dated May 10).        The court\n\ndiscounted all of the allegedly discriminatory comments cited by\n\nappellant, noting that some were \"far removed from the date of\n\ndismissal in 1992\" and that none was \"even remotely related to the\n\ndecisional   process   of   firing    plaintiff.\"   Citing   Baralt   v.\n\nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 251 F.3d 10, 17 (lst Cir. 2001), the\n\ncourt stated that the alleged comments \"are best characterized as\n\nthe kind of 'stray remarks that [can be] suggestive but [are] often\n\nfound [to be] insufficient to prove discrimination in the absence\n\nof more meaningful evidence.'\"         The court thus found that the\n\nevidence in the record failed to support an inference of unlawful\n\ndiscrimination based on either age or national origin, and it\n\nentered summary judgment in favor of St. Lukes.2       On May 15, the\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The court dismissed with prejudice the Title VII and ADEA\nclaims and dismissed the supplemental claim under Puerto Rico law\nwithout prejudice.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcourt denied appellant's Rule 56(f) motion without addressing the\n\nmerits, noting that the case had been dismissed.\n\n     Appellant moved for reconsideration under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e), arguing that the CFI ruling on her Law 80 claim established\n\nthat St. Lukes' justification for the discharge – her supposedly\n\ndisrespectful conduct on March 13 and her prior discipline history\n\n– was a pretext, and that she therefore was entitled to move\n\nforward with her discrimination claims or have judgment entered in\n\nher favor.   She claimed that St. Lukes induced the federal court to\n\noverlook the findings in the Commonwealth judgment and that the\n\ncompany's    misrepresentations   about    that   earlier   ruling   were\n\n\"tantamount to fraud.\"      She further requested that the court\n\nconsider the arguments previously made in her motion under Rule\n\n56(f) for additional discovery.\n\n     The district court denied the motion for reconsideration, but\n\nresponded explicitly only on the Rule 56(f) issue, stating that\n\nappellant's motion was untimely because it was filed two years\n\nafter St. Lukes moved for summary judgment. Appellant then brought\n\nthis appeal, in which she argues that the court erred in failing to\n\naddress and credit her contention that the CFI decision precluded\n\nsummary judgment for her employer.        She contends that St. Lukes'\n\nmisrepresentations led the court to its erroneous grant of summary\n\njudgment and that that decision should therefore be vacated.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f                               II. Discussion\n\n      In essence, appellant's claim on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt should have granted her motion for reconsideration because\n\nthe CFI judgment substantiates the validity of her discrimination\n\nclaims against St. Lukes, and it was St. Lukes' dissembling –\n\nbordering on fraud – that kept the full impact of that ruling from\n\nthe district court before its summary judgment decision.3\n\n      We have multiple difficulties with this view of the case.\n\nFirst, St. Lukes by no means concealed the CFI judgment from the\n\ndistrict court; indeed, St. Lukes argued in its motion for summary\n\njudgment that res judicata, based on the Commonwealth ruling, was\n\na bar to appellant's federal action. St. Lukes also referenced the\n\nCFI   action,   including     the   case   number,      in   the    Statement   of\n\nUncontested     Facts   it   submitted     with   its    motion      for   summary\n\njudgment.       Second,      appellant     obviously     was       aware   of   the\n\nCommonwealth court findings and had every opportunity to argue that\n\nthey foreclosed summary judgment, but did not do so.\n\n      Moreover, the CFI ruling does not substantively undercut the\n\ndistrict court's summary judgment decision.                    The Commonwealth\n\ncourt, crediting appellant's version of the March 13 incident,\n\n\n      3\n       Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), a court may alter or amend a\njudgment based on a \"'manifest error of law or fact'\" or newly\ndiscovered evidence. Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 16 (lst\nCir. 1997) (citation omitted). We note that the rule \"does not\nallow a party to introduce new evidence or advance arguments that\ncould and should have been presented to the district court prior to\nthe judgment.\" Id. (citation omitted).\n\n                                     -7-\n\ffound that termination was excessive discipline for the nature of\n\nher conduct and that her dismissal was therefore unjust.       The\n\ncourt's ruling accepts, however, that some kind of confrontation\n\nbetween appellant and Rivera occurred; and the court did not\n\nattribute the termination to any other motivation, such as age or\n\nnational origin discrimination.   Appellant's suggestion that the\n\ndecision establishes pretext is, therefore, without foundation.\n\n     At best, the Commonwealth decision allowed appellant to argue\n\nin federal court that, based on the CFI findings, some explanation\n\nother than her \"disrespectful\" behavior must have motivated the\n\ntermination.   Under both Title VII and the ADEA, however, she had\n\nthe burden of proving that it resulted from unlawful discrimination\n\nrather than, for example, \"an insensitive overreaction to a series\n\nof minor transgressions.\"    Baralt, 251 F.3d at 18.     To defeat\n\nsummary judgment, therefore, appellant needed to produce competent\n\nevidence of either age or national origin discrimination.\n\n     The district court concluded in its summary judgment decision\n\nthat the evidence she offered – the various comments noted above –\n\nwas inadequate to permit a jury to rule in her favor.    Appellant\n\ndoes not argue in her brief that the district court erred in\n\nreaching that conclusion; she limits her focus to the CFI ruling\n\nand its implications.   We have said enough on why that challenge\n\nfails to taint the grant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f       Indeed, appellant's notice of appeal seeks review of only the\n\ndistrict court's denial of her motion for reconsideration, not its\n\nsubstantive summary judgment ruling, and our review is accordingly\n\nlimited to the court's refusal to reopen the case.       See Aybar v.\n\nCrispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13-15 (lst Cir. 1997).4    We may disturb\n\nthat judgment only for an abuse of discretion or error of fact or\n\nlaw.       Id. at 13, 15; see also Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d\n\n303, 318-19 (lst Cir. 2001).         As our discussion makes clear,\n\nneither occurred here.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       Although this limitation is flexible when it \"can be fairly\ninferred from the notice\" that appellant intended to appeal more\nthan just the specified order, Aybar, 118 F.3d at 15 n.5 (citation\nomitted), appellant in this case consistently has focused on the\nmotion to reconsider, and we find no basis to extend the appeal\nbeyond review of that ruling.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

Second, appellant obviously was aware of the Commonwealth court findings and had every opportunity to argue that they foreclosed summary judgment, but did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the CFI ruling does not substantively undercut the district court's summary judgment decision. The Commonwealth court, crediting appellant's version of the March 13 incident, found that termination was excessive discipline for the nature of her conduct and that her dismissal was therefore unjust. The court's ruling accepts, however, that some kind of confrontation between appellant and Rivera occurred; and the court did not attribute the termination to any other motivation, such as age or national origin discrimination. Appellant's suggestion that the decision establishes pretext is, therefore, without foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At best, the Commonwealth decision allowed appellant to argue in federal court that, based on the CFI findings, some explanation other than her \"disrespectful\" behavior must have motivated the termination. Under both Title VII and the ADEA, however, she had the burden of proving that it resulted from unlawful discrimination rather than, for example, \"an insensitive overreaction to a series of minor transgressions.\" <i>Baralt,</i> 251 F.3d at 18. To defeat summary judgment, therefore, appellant needed to produce competent evidence of either age or national origin discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded in its summary judgment decision that the evidence she offered-the various comments noted above-was inadequate to permit a jury to rule in her favor. Appellant does not argue in her brief that the district court erred in reaching that conclusion; she limits her focus to the CFI ruling and its implications. We have said enough on why that challenge fails to taint the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, appellant's notice of appeal seeks review of only the district court's denial of her motion for reconsideration, not its substantive summary judgment ruling, and our review is accordingly limited to the court's refusal to reopen the case. <i>See Aybar v.

Appellee says she was fired because the memo incident was the third instance of disrespectful behavior toward co-workers, and she previously had been warned that another episode would lead to discharge. Appellant, however, maintains that she was terminated based on her age and national origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico granted summary judgment for appellee, concluding that the offered evidence of discrimination was insufficient to support appellant's claims. She sought reconsideration, primarily based on a prior Commonwealth court finding that she had been wrongfully terminated; she asserted that the earlier ruling determined that St. Lukes' justification for her firing was pretextual, and she accused appellee of misrepresentation \"tantamount to fraud\" for failing to fully inform the federal court of the significance of that decision. The district court refused to disturb its earlier ruling, and this appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly set out additional details relevant to our consideration of the appeal. The incident that triggered appellant's discharge occurred late on Friday, March 13, 1992. Appellant and other employees in her department received memoranda from their supervisor, Eugenia Rivera, about their vacation and sick time. Appellant stated that she was \"traumatized\" by the memo, and it is undisputed that she expressed disagreement with its contents and complained that it had ruined her weekend. In a memo on the incident, Rivera reported that appellant had spoken to her \"in an altered and disrespectful manner\" in front of other employees, asserted that she (appellant) would not work overtime any more, and complained that this was \"worse than communism with Fidel Castro.\" Rivera's superiors stated that they investigated the incident and reviewed appellant's disciplinary file before terminating her on March 17. She was forty-seven years old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following her discharge, appellant initially filed a claim against St. Lukes in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance (CFI), Ponce District, alleging unjust dismissal under Puerto Rico \"Law 80,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167;&#167; 185a 185m.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In finding in appellant's favor, the CFI judge stated that Rivera was \"neither credible nor trustworthy, when stating that [appellant] reacted in a very belligerent and disrespectful manner.\" The court further observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The version about said events provided by [appellant] seems, to us, to be more credible when she indicated that she had asked how she could improve her absences from vacation, if those were entitlements acknowledged by law, and the same as to any days she was entitled to under sick leave. Equally trustworthy was [appellant's] statements indicating that her only comment at the time was that, as a result of such notice, her week-end had gone afoul.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, after observing that other employees also made comments about the memo but were not disciplined, concluded that \"[t]he sanctions imposed in view of the comments made by Complainant to Mrs. Rivera Collazo, are way out of proportion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After exhausting the requisite administrative requirements, appellant in October 1998 filed this action in federal court alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e 17, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 621-634, and Puerto Rico's employment discrimination statute, \"Law 100,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 146. To support her discrimination claims, appellant, who is of German origin, offered the following evidence: (1) comments by two co-workers in 1986 and her supervisor, Rivera, in 1990 or 1991, about the way she pronounced \"the `ss' sound,\" (2) that Rivera and others would refer to her as \"the German\" or \"the Polish,\" (3) a critical comment \"yell[ed]\" at her by St. Lukes' executive director, Luz N. Rodriguez, about gift customs \"in your country,\" (4) that on one occasion in 1986 when plaintiff was covering the switchboard, Rodriguez told plaintiff she was not being understood when she spoke, (5) that Rivera and another employee would sometimes call her \"la vieja\" (old woman), and (6) on one occasion, Rivera asked her why she did not resign, get food stamps, and go take care of her mother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Lukes moved for summary judgment on May 26, 2000, and appellant replied on September 18 of that year. On May 8, 2002, represented by new counsel, appellant filed a motion for additional discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days later, on May 14, 2002, the district court entered its summary judgment ruling (which was dated May 10). The court discounted all of the allegedly discriminatory comments cited by appellant, noting that some were \"far removed from the date of dismissal in 1992\" and that none was \"even remotely related to the decisional process of firing plaintiff.\" Citing <i>Baralt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773387\"><a href=\"/opinion/773387/manuel-a-baralt-lizette-pena-aviles-conjugal-partnership-baralt-pena-juan/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2001), the court stated that the alleged comments \"are best characterized as the kind of `stray remarks that [can be] suggestive but [are] often found [to be] insufficient to prove discrimination in the absence of more meaningful evidence.'\" The court thus found that the evidence in the record failed to support an inference of unlawful discrimination based on either age or national origin, and it entered summary judgment in favor of St. Lukes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On May 15, the court denied appellant's Rule 56(f) motion without addressing the merits, noting that the case had been dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant moved for reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), arguing that the CFI ruling on her Law 80 claim established that St. Lukes' justification for the discharge-her supposedly disrespectful conduct on March 13 and her prior discipline history-was a pretext, and that she therefore was entitled to move forward with her discrimination claims or have judgment entered in her favor. She claimed that St. Lukes induced the federal court to overlook the findings in the Commonwealth judgment and that the company's misrepresentations about that earlier ruling were \"tantamount to fraud.\" She further requested that the court consider the arguments previously made in her motion under Rule 56(f) for additional discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion for reconsideration, but responded explicitly only on the Rule 56(f) issue, stating that appellant's motion was untimely because it was filed two years after St. Lukes moved for summary judgment. Appellant then brought this appeal, in which she argues that the court erred in failing to address and credit her contention that the CFI decision precluded summary judgment for her employer. She contends that St. Lukes' misrepresentations led the court to its erroneous grant of summary judgment and that that decision should therefore be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, appellant's claim on appeal is that the district court should have granted her motion for reconsideration because the CFI judgment substantiates the validity of her discrimination claims against St. Lukes, and it was St. Lukes' dissembling-bordering on fraud-that kept the full impact of that ruling from the district court before its summary judgment decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have multiple difficulties with this view of the case. First, St. Lukes by no means concealed the CFI judgment from the district court; indeed, St. Lukes argued in its motion for summary judgment that res judicata, based on the Commonwealth ruling, was a bar to appellant's federal action. St. Lukes also referenced the CFI action, including the case number, in the Statement of Uncontested Facts it submitted with its motion for summary judgment. Second, appellant obviously was aware of the Commonwealth court findings and had every opportunity to argue that they foreclosed summary judgment, but did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the CFI ruling does not substantively undercut the district court's summary judgment decision. The Commonwealth court, crediting appellant's version of the March 13 incident, found that termination was excessive discipline for the nature of her conduct and that her dismissal was therefore unjust. The court's ruling accepts, however, that some kind of confrontation between appellant and Rivera occurred; and the court did not attribute the termination to any other motivation, such as age or national origin discrimination. Appellant's suggestion that the decision establishes pretext is, therefore, without foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At best, the Commonwealth decision allowed appellant to argue in federal court that, based on the CFI findings, some explanation other than her \"disrespectful\" behavior must have motivated the termination.
