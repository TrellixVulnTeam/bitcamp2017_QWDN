The petition for\n\nrehearing having been denied by the panel of judges who decided the case and the petition for\n\nrehearing en banc having been submitted to the active judges of this court and a majority of the\n\njudges not having voted that the case be heard en banc, it is ordered that the petition for rehearing\n\nand petition for rehearing en banc be denied.\n\n\n\n\n       *\n               Judge Howard is recused and did not participate in consideration of this matter.\n\f                TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.\n\nFed. R. App. P. 35(a) provides that en banc rehearings are not favored unless \"the proceeding\n\ninvolves a question of exceptional importance.\" This Court has now denied en banc review in a case\n\nthat not only involves a legal question of exceptional importance -- this is the first case in the history\n\nof the First Circuit to have interpreted the Federal Death Penalty Act -- but a moral question of\n\nexceptional importance: what process is necessary to deprive a man not only of his liberty and\n\npursuit of happiness, but of his life.\n\n                This might simply be a difference in opinion as to what \"exceptional importance\"\n\nmeans. However, the recent history of this Circuit convinces me that it is not. This Circuit has\n\nrecently granted en banc review to examine a credibility determination, see Castañeda-Castillo v.\n\nGonzales, 488 F.3d 17 (1st Cir. 2007) (en banc), the reasonableness of one defendant's eight year\n\nsentence, United States v. Scherrer, 444 F.3d 91 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), a dispute within this court\n\nover the interpretation of the Wiretap Act, United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(en banc), and sundry other cases involving questions that are surely less important than one where\n\na man's life is in the balance.1 This is not to suggest that it was improper for this Court to take those\n\ncases en banc -- surely, it was not -- but to point out that by comparison, this case is sufficiently\n\nimportant to rehear.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n         See, e.g., United States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc) (whether a court\nmust specify the number of drug tests to which a defendant on supervised release will be subject);\nSavard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23 (1st Cir. 2003) (en banc) (whether a municipal defendant would\nbe entitled to qualified immunity for strip searches of people arrested for non-violent, non-drug\nrelated minor offenses); JOM, Inc. v. Adell Plastics, Inc., 193 F.3d 47, 59 (1st Cir. 1999) (en banc)\n(deciding a question that \"was never briefed or argued, either below or on appeal\").\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f               Indeed, it is not only imperative for the Court to take this case en banc to answer the\n\nultimate moral question posed by this case, but also the many subsidiary legal questions. Our\n\ndecision to not take this case en banc has deprived the full court the opportunity to decide such\n\nimportant questions as the following. When, if ever, may a court deprive a member of a religious\n\norder the ability and privilege of serving on a death penalty jury simply because the court believes\n\nthat the religious order might be unhappy with the member for having done so? May a jury impose\n\nthe death penalty based on the \"vulnerability\" of a victim even if the defendant was unaware of such\n\nvulnerability? Should a jury vested with the awesome task of imposing the death penalty be asked\n\nto parse instructions on burdens of proof which are, by all accounts, confusing?\n\n               I do not mean to imply with these questions that I have prematurely concluded that\n\nthe death penalty should not apply here. We may have well decided that Sampson was eligible for\n\nthe death penalty after reviewing the evidence and hearing argument on these issues. However, this\n\nCourt has decided that these issues are insufficiently important, and thus has deprived not only\n\nSampson, but future death penalty litigants of the benefit of our collective judgment. I would have\n\nreheard this case en banc, and accordingly, I must dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f               LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial of en banc review. I was a\n\nmember of the panel in this case. With the one qualification noted in the opinion, I fully support the\n\ndecision that the panel reached. Nevertheless, I regret the denial of rehearing en banc. This case is\n\nunlike any other our circuit has considered. Despite my confidence in the panel's judgment, I believe\n\nthat the issues raised by the imposition of the death penalty are so important and challenging that our\n\ndecision here -- and future decisions -- should be informed by the views of colleagues who wish to\n\ncontribute to the circuit's developing jurisprudence in this area. I therefore respectfully dissent from\n\ndenial of the petition for en banc review.\n\n                                                       By the Court:\n                                                       Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n                                                       ____/s/________________________________\n                                                       By: Margaret Carter, Chief Deputy Clerk\n\n\n\n\n[Certified copies to Hon.
