BARBOUR,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n          [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U. S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n              John R. Gibson,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     William Gray Schaffer, for appellant.\n\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, Assistant United\nStates Attorney, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney,\nwas on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 29, 2004\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Hon. John R. Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f            JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.          Scott A. Barbour\n\nappeals his conviction of one count of conspiracy to possess with\n\nthe intent to distribute and distribution of at least 500 grams of\n\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)\n\n(2000), and one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to\n\ndistribute     and   distribution    of    at   least   fifty   kilograms   of\n\nmarijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C).\n\nOn   appeal,   Barbour    raises    four   arguments:    sentencing    factor\n\nmanipulation, prosecutorial misconduct, improper jury instruction\n\non   drug   quantities,   and   errors     in   interpreting    and   applying\n\nsentencing guidelines.      We affirm.\n\n            Barbour was convicted in Texas in 1996 for wire fraud\n\narising from a telemarketing scheme and was sentenced to eighteen\n\nmonths' imprisonment.      After he served that term, his supervised\n\nrelease was revoked in 1998, and he went back to prison until 1999.\n\nHe was again put on supervised release and required to live at a\n\nhalfway house in Maine.     In late October of 1999, while Barbour was\n\nstill on supervised release, he moved from Maine to Texas, which\n\nviolated the terms of his supervised release.             An arrest warrant\n\nwas issued two days later, but it was not served on Barbour until\n\nOctober 2000.        In the intervening period, he had established\n\nresidence and a fictitious identity (\"Jon Kugler\") in Houston,\n\nTexas and had begun shipping marijuana to Barry May, who sold it to\n\nMaine drug dealers.       Barbour and his family left Houston in the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\flate summer of 2000.\n\n            Following   his   arrest    in   October   2000,   Barbour   was\n\nsentenced to an additional twelve months' imprisonment.             On the\n\nfinal day of his imprisonment, in October 2001, Barbour and May\n\nwere arrested and indicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute\n\ncocaine and marijuana from January 1, 1999 through October 1, 2001.\n\nA jury found Barbour guilty of both counts, and the district court\n\nsentenced him to 420 months' imprisonment.\n\n            The issues raised by Barbour do not require that we deal\n\nextensively with the trial record concerning the details of the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            Barbour argues that the government's nine-month delay in\n\nexecuting on an arrest warrant and twenty-one-month delay in\n\nbringing conspiracy charges constituted impermissible sentencing\n\nfactor manipulation.    He argues that Agent Baril and the Assistant\n\nUnited States Attorney knew in early 2000 that Barbour was in\n\nHouston using the alias \"Jon Kugler,\" but they took no serious\n\naction to execute on the November 1999 warrant until September 2000\n\nwhen agents raided the house that he had been living in.           Barbour\n\nargues that Baril was motivated by improper personal animus in\n\ndelaying the arrest and charges to increase Barbour's potential\n\nsentence.   Barbour attempts to show Baril's personal animus toward\n\nhim through Baril's testimony that he was waiting for \"the right\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fmoment\" to arrest Barbour.         Barbour argues that Baril waited to\n\narrest Barbour for no legitimate reason, but only to frustrate\n\nBarbour and increase his      sentence.\n\n           It is the defendant's burden to show sentencing factor\n\nmanipulation by a preponderance of the evidence.               United States v.\n\nGibbens, 25 F.3d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1994).            We review the district\n\ncourt's determination of whether manipulation occurred for clear\n\nerror.   Id. at 32.      A district court's determination is clearly\n\nerroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the\n\nreviewing court is left with the \"definite and firm conviction that\n\na mistake has been committed.\"          United States v. Newton, 326 F.3d\n\n253, 257   (1st   Cir.   2003)(quoting       Reich   v. Newspapers      of   New\n\nEngland, Inc., 44 F.3d 1060, 1080 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n           Sentencing     factor        manipulation     occurs      where   law\n\nenforcement   agents     venture   outside     the     scope    of   legitimate\n\ninvestigation     and    engage    in     extraordinary     misconduct       that\n\nimproperly enlarges the scope or scale of the crime. United States\n\nv. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425, 427 (1st Cir. 1995).                  A manipulation\n\nclaim can be established by showing that the agents overpowered the\n\nfree will of the defendant and caused him to commit a more serious\n\noffense than he was predisposed to commit.                 United States v.\n\nConnell, 960 F.2d 191, 196 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           A typical sentencing factor manipulation claim involves\n\nundercover agents participating in criminal activity with the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fdefendant and waiting to make an arrest for the sole purpose of\n\nincreasing the defendant's sentence by encouraging the commission\n\nof a crime that the defendant was not predisposed to commit.        See,\n\ne.g., Egemonye, 62 F.3d at 427; Gibbens, 25 F.3d at 30-31.      This is\n\nnot such a case because there was no pressure to commit a more\n\nserious crime, no agent involvement in Barbour's crimes, and there\n\nwas a legitimate reason to delay Barbour's arrest.\n\n          Analysis   of    a   sentencing   factor   manipulation   claim\n\nfocuses primarily (though not exclusively) on the conduct and\n\nmotives of the government. Gibbens, 25 F.3d at 31.       The government\n\nhas \"broad latitude\" in investigating crime and can lengthen an\n\ninvestigation to explore the size, techniques and participants\n\ninvolved in a criminal operation.        Egemonye, 62 F.3d at 427-28.\n\n          The district court rejected Barbour's claim of sentencing\n\nfactor manipulation because agents did not encourage Barbour or\n\n\"lead him into new criminal conduct,\" and because it found there\n\nwas a legitimate reason to delay Barbour's arrest.         The district\n\ncourt described Barbour as the leader of an extremely large, five-\n\nyear drug conspiracy.     The government identified at least eighteen\n\nparticipants, most of whom communicated using false names and code\n\nwords.   The participants frequently switched cell phones and land\n\nlines. The method of drug transportation evolved from tackle boxes\n\nto PVC pipes to Volkswagen vehicles to commercial shrink wrap\n\npackaging.   Barbour avoided police by moving from Maine to Texas,\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fto New Hampshire, and to Florida, where he was arrested.             During\n\nthe year before Barbour's 2001 arrest, Agent Baril identified five\n\nadditional participants in the conspiracy and obtained additional\n\ntelephone and shipping records.        The agents in this case kept up\n\nwith the constantly changing size, techniques, and participants of\n\nthe conspiracy.     This is exactly the type of investigative work\n\nEgemonye considered within the legitimate scope of government\n\nagents' authority.    62 F.3d at 427.\n\n           The record reveals no improper conduct on the part of the\n\nagents during that investigation.            There is no indication that\n\nagents pressured or coerced Barbour to \"achieve a new level of\n\ncrime.\"   Id.   No undercover agent bought drugs from, or sold drugs\n\nto, Barbour.    Agents had no contact with Barbour until his arrest.\n\n           The record reflects no improper law enforcement motive.\n\nWe have said that racial hostility or personal animus would be an\n\nimproper motive.      Id. at 428.          Even if Baril's comment about\n\nwaiting for the \"right moment\" could be interpreted as personal\n\nanimus, as Barbour argues, it is also amenable to an innocent\n\ninterpretation.     Baril said he was waiting to be sure he had\n\nsufficient evidence for a conviction.            He was also waiting to\n\nidentify more of the conspirators and gather evidence against them.\n\nA   district    court's   choice    between     two   or   more   reasonable\n\ninterpretations of the evidence cannot be called clearly erroneous.\n\nGibbens, 25 F.3d at 32.            The district court did not err in\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\frejecting Barbour's claim of sentencing factor manipulation.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          Barbour argues that the district court did not properly\n\ninstruct the jury on the government's burden to prove the drug\n\nquantities from the indictment, as required by Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000).        The district court instructed\n\nthe jury that it must find elements beyond a reasonable doubt, but\n\ndid not characterize the drug quantity determination as an element.\n\nBarbour argues this error denied his Fifth and Sixth Amendment\n\nrights to a jury verdict on the drug quantities.\n\n          The district court included the drug quantities in the\n\nverdict form.    The verdict form asked, \"Did the cocaine conspiracy\n\ninvolve, in total, at least 500 grams of cocaine?\"            The jury\n\nchecked the \"yes\" box.    The verdict form asked, \"Did the marijuana\n\nconspiracy involve, in total,\" listing several quantities, with\n\ninstructions to check only one.     The jury put a checkmark next to\n\n\"at least 50 kilograms of marijuana.\" The jury instructions stated\n\nthat if the jury found Barbour guilty, it must determine the drug\n\nquantities   involved,    and   stated    seventeen   times   that   the\n\ngovernment's burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          Barbour raises this Apprendi argument for the first time\n\non appeal; he did not object to the jury instructions at trial or\n\nat sentencing.     He asks that we excuse his failure to object\n\nbecause the case that established that Apprendi errors may be\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fraised    at    sentencing     was   decided   after   Barbour's   sentencing.\n\nUnited States v. Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d 12 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied,   539     U.S.   938   (2003).     Because     confusion   existed,   in\n\nNelson-Rodriguez we assumed that the defendants preserved their\n\nobjections if they objected either before the jury instructions\n\nwere given or at sentencing.           Id. at 47-48.     Barbour did neither,\n\nso even if we made the same assumption for him, we would still\n\nreview for plain error.         Id. at 47-49.\n\n               Under the plain error standard, we reverse only if a\n\n\"clear and obvious\" error occurred.            United States v. Perez-Ruiz,\n\n353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Duarte, 246\n\nF.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 2058 (2004)).\n\nThat error also must affect the defendant's substantial rights and\n\nmust seriously impair the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\n\nof judicial proceedings.         Id.\n\n               Any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increases\n\nthe penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\n\nmust be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nApprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.           In Perez-Ruiz, we applied the Apprendi\n\nrule to drug quantity determinations.            353 F.3d at 16.\n\n               Barbour interprets United States v. Goodine, 326 F.3d 26\n\n(1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 1600 (2004), as requiring\n\nelements to be found beyond a reasonable doubt, but allowing\n\nsentencing factors to be found by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fIn Goodine, the jury found certain drug quantities, but the judge\n\nconsidered additional quantities in sentencing the defendant.              Id.\n\nat 27.   We applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to the\n\nquantities found by the judge and called them sentencing factors\n\nrather than elements.      Id. at 32.    Goodine held that Apprendi was\n\nnot violated when the sentence imposed exceeded the guideline range\n\nfor the indicted amount but did not exceed the maximum statutory\n\npenalty for the drug quantities found by the jury.\n\n           Where a fact finding, other than a prior conviction,\n\nincreases the statutory maximum, under Apprendi and Harris v.\n\nUnited States, 536 U.S. 545, 550 (2002), the fact must be found by\n\nthe jury beyond a reasonable doubt.            The Supreme Court explained\n\nthat if, because of the existence of a particular fact, the penalty\n\nis to be increased beyond the statutory maximum, that fact must be\n\nfound by the jury regardless of whether it is a sentencing factor\n\nor an element.    Harris, 536 U.S. at 550.\n\n           The   maximum    sentence     for    convictions   in   which    no\n\nparticular quantity was proved is twenty years for cocaine and five\n\nyears for marijuana.       21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C), (D) (2000).           The\n\ndistrict court sentenced Barbour to 420 months, or thirty-five\n\nyears, which exceeds the twenty- and five-year statutory maximums\n\nin the absence of a quantity determination.              Under Harris and\n\nApprendi, before Barbour could be sentenced beyond the statutory\n\nmaximums based on quantity, the drug quantity must be found by the\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fjury beyond a reasonable doubt.       The question in this case is\n\nwhether, on the instructions given, the jury would have understood\n\nthat it had to find the drug quantities beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          We held that the jury had not been instructed that it\n\nmust find drug quantities beyond a reasonable doubt in United\n\nStates v. Perez-Ruiz and United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez.     In\n\nPerez-Ruiz, the judge read the quantities listed in the indictment\n\nto the jury once and elsewhere stated that the jury must find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the indicted conspiracy existed.\n\n353 F.3d at 16.    We held that instructions did not forge the\n\nnecessary link between the concept of drug quantity and the beyond-\n\na-reasonable-doubt standard. In United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,\n\nthe court provided a copy of the indictment, which listed the drug\n\nquantities, to the jury, but the jury was asked to find only\n\nwhether there was the conspiracy as indicted, not whether the drug\n\namounts in the indictment were correct.      319 F.3d at 45.   The\n\nresult was that the jury only found that the charged conspiracy\n\nexisted but did not determine the drug quantities.   Id.\n\n          Here, in contrast, the jury was given three choices of\n\ndrug quantities - not all or nothing, but a multiple choice.   The\n\njury was asked to specify drug type and quantity, and it did so.\n\nIt is not tenable to compare this case to Perez-Ruiz or Nelson-\n\nRodriguez, in each of which the jury was not permitted to specify\n\namount and was not alerted to the need to consider the amount in\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fits   own   right.     Here,    the   district     court     included   the   drug\n\nquantities in the verdict form.          The jury was instructed that if it\n\nfound Barbour guilty, it would also \"have to answer one or more\n\nquestions concerning the quantity of the substance involved which\n\nmay   affect   the    potential   sentence.\"           The   jury    instructions\n\ncontained    seventeen    references      to     the   government’s     beyond-a-\n\nreasonable-doubt burden of proof.          The jury was clearly instructed\n\nthat the defendant's guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, and the drug quantity questions that immediately followed\n\nconnected that burden of proof to the drug quantity determination.\n\nThe instructions in this case contain a more precise finding of\n\ndrug quantity and contain a closer link between the burden of proof\n\nand the jury's quantity determination than the instructions in\n\neither Perez-Ruiz or Nelson-Rodriguez.             The district court did not\n\ncommit plain error when it instructed the jury on the government's\n\nburden of proof and included the drug quantities involved on the\n\nverdict form.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            Barbour    argues     that     the     Assistant     United    States\n\nAttorney's pervasive misconduct during the trial and the sentencing\n\nundermined the accuracy of the fact-finding process and resulted in\n\na fundamentally unfair conviction and sentence.                     Only three of\n\nBarbour's allegations of misconduct by the Assistant Attorney\n\nwarrant discussion: (1) whether the Attorney tampered with the\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fproffer statements; (2) whether the Attorney improperly bolstered\n\nthe government's credibility; and (3) whether the Attorney made\n\nimproper remarks on Barbour's failure to testify during closing.\n\n               We review Barbour's claims of prosecutorial misconduct\n\nfor plain error because he failed to object at trial. United States\n\nv. Roberts, 119 F.3d 1006, 1013-14 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n               First, Barbour claims that the Assistant Attorney changed\n\nfacts in Baril's proffer reports, which rendered them inaccurate\n\nand unreliable, and then used the reports during his impeachment of\n\nBarry May. The proffer reports were investigative reports prepared\n\nby agents of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency after interviews\n\nwith       cooperating   witnesses.    Barbour's    brief     argues    that   by\n\nreviewing and revising proffer reports, the Attorney rendered them\n\nunreliable and then injected the contents of the reports before the\n\njury without defense counsel being made aware of the tampering.\n\n               Barbour's   only   support    for   claiming    the     Assistant\n\nAttorney changed facts is that some of the facts in the reports\n\ndiffered from Baril's recollection1 or from another witness's\n\nrecollection.       If the proffer reports do not coincide perfectly\n\nwith the witnesses' memories, that inconsistency does not establish\n\nthat the Attorney changed facts in Baril's proffer report.                Baril\n\n\n       1\n      Baril remembered May telling him that packages weighed 20-50\npounds, but the proffer said \"at least 50 pounds.\" Baril explained\nthat May gave several different quantity estimates for those\npackages throughout his interview, and he averaged the quantity in\nthe proffer.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fsaid during the sentencing hearing that, during an interview, he\n\nroutinely tries to take notes verbatim and he types them into a\n\nreport as soon as possible.     A copy of that report is sent to the\n\nprosecutor, any agents who attended the interview, the witness, and\n\nthe defense attorney to be reviewed for accuracy. After the report\n\nis written and signed, any corrections are made in a supplemental\n\nreport.     Barbour received a copy of Baril's handwritten notes from\n\nthe interviews.     The record does not establish plain error because\n\nBarbour has not shown that the Assistant Attorney tampered with any\n\nof the proffer reports.\n\n             Second, Barbour contends that the Assistant Attorney\n\nimproperly bolstered the government's credibility during the trial.\n\nThe Attorney periodically questioned witnesses about what they told\n\n\"us\" or the \"agents\" in their proffer sessions.               Barbour argues\n\nthat   by    identifying   himself    with   the    agents,    the   Attorney\n\nimproperly     borrowed the prestige of those agents.         Barbour argues\n\nthat the Attorney repeatedly mentioned that the witnesses told a\n\ndifferent story to government agents to imply that because the\n\nagents worked for the government, their recollection was more\n\nlikely to be the truth than the witnesses' recollection.              We are\n\npersuaded by the government's explanation that the Attorney used\n\nthose words as context, to explain to the court and the witnesses\n\nto which interviews he was referring.              An assistant attorney's\n\ncross-examination of a witness with an inconsistent statement would\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fbe of doubtful value if he were not permitted to delineate between\n\nconversations by giving the witness more context. May participated\n\nin    several    proffers      and   at    one    point    during     the    trial,   for\n\nclarification, had to ask the Attorney, \"Is this the proffer I did\n\nwith you?\" There is no indication that the Attorney was attempting\n\nto bolster the government's credibility with those references.\n\n              The Assistant Attorney also said, \"So I guess the agents\n\ngot    that     wrong\"    when   confronting        May     with    an      inconsistent\n\nstatement.       Even if the isolated question indirectly implied that\n\nthe government was more credible than the witness, the question\n\nstill does not rise to the level of plain error in this case.\n\n              Third, Barbour claims that the Assistant Attorney made\n\ntwo improper comments during closing argument about Barbour's\n\nfailure to testify.\n\n              Comments by a prosecutor on a defendant's failure to\n\ntestify    violate       the   Fifth      Amendment       guarantee      against    self-\n\nincrimination.       Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965).\n\nThis court looks at whether the prosecutor's language shows a\n\nmanifest intention to comment on the defendant's failure to testify\n\nand whether the jury would naturally and necessarily understand it\n\nto be a comment on the defendant's failure to testify.                             United\n\nStates v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 769 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              In this case, the Assistant Attorney said, \"But if you\n\nwant to really find out what went on, go to the people on the\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\finside . . . [t]hose are the only people who laid it out for you.\"\n\nThe   government    contends       that    the   Attorney      meant    that   the\n\nconspirators were credible witnesses because their information came\n\nfrom their position inside the conspiracy.                That interpretation\n\nfails to explain why he said they were \"the only people who laid it\n\nout for you.\"   The Attorney's intention could have been to comment\n\nonly on the credibility of his witnesses, but this last phrase\n\nraises the possibility he was commenting on Barbour's failure to\n\ntestify or present witnesses.        But it seems more likely that he was\n\ncomparing the insiders to the other witnesses who testified.\n\n            The Assistant Attorney's second comment referred to one\n\nof Barbour's taped phone conversations. He said, \"The best witness\n\nin this case I submit to you is Mr. Panasonic. . . . Mr. Panasonic\n\nallowed you to listen to this defendant.\"             That comment may also be\n\nopen to more than one interpretation.             Perhaps the Attorney was\n\nsuggesting   only   that     the   taped     evidence    was   the     best,   most\n\nobjective    evidence   in   the    trial.       In   closing,    the    Attorney\n\nexplained that \"Mr. Panasonic has nothing to gain or lose.                     Mr.\n\nPanasonic has not been impeached one iota.\"               On the other hand,\n\n\"this allowed you to listen to this defendant\" arguably might be\n\ninterpreted as a reminder to the jury that Barbour did not take the\n\nstand to explain the taped conversations and as a reminder that the\n\nprosecution was the only party who made it possible for the jury to\n\nlisten to the defendant.\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f            Assuming,   arguendo,    that    the   Assistant     Attorney's\n\ncomments are each capable of at least two possible interpretations,\n\none impermissible and one innocent, it would not profit Barbour\n\nhere.   In these situations we have cautioned, \"A court should not\n\nlightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have\n\nits most damaging meaning.\"         Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 770 (citations\n\nomitted).     Nor should we assume the jury will draw from the\n\ncomments the most damaging meaning.         United States v. Newton, 327\n\nF.3d 17, 27 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 338 (2003).\n\nWihbey reviewed two comments similar to those in Barbour's case.\n\nFirst, the prosecutor mistakenly named the defendants among those\n\nwho testified; he then said, \"You've heard from all of those\n\nwitnesses except for obviously the two Defendants. . .\"                Id. at\n\n768.    The court agreed that the prosecutor was trying to correct\n\nhis earlier mistake and the jury would understand his statement as\n\na correction.    Id. at 770.     Second, the prosecutor stated that\n\ndefense counsel could not \"explain away\" a conversation that\n\nanother   witness   testified   about.       Id.   at    769.    The    court\n\ncategorized that statement as a \"how-does-counsel-explain\" Griffin\n\nviolation, but held it was not plain error, stating that the\n\ncomment did not seriously affect the fairness and integrity of the\n\nproceedings for two reasons.     Id. at 770-71.         First, the jury was\n\ninstructed on the defendant's right to not testify and on the\n\ngovernment's burden of proof, and second, the evidence against the\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fdefendant was strong, even if not overwhelming.                  Id.\n\n            Even if the Assistant Attorney intended the comments to\n\nbe a reference to Barbour's failure to testify, or if the jury\n\nbelieved them to be, the comments did not likely affect the outcome\n\nof the trial.        The potential influence of those comments on the\n\njury was mitigated by the jury instructions, which stated that the\n\ndefendant     had     no   obligation     to     testify       and   repeated   the\n\ngovernment's beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden seventeen times. The\n\nevidence of Barbour's guilt was strong, although the specific drug\n\nquantities and length of the conspiracy were disputed.                     If the\n\ncomments were objectionable, Barbour did not object, and the\n\ncomments do not rise to the level of plain error.                      See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Moran, No. 03-2148, 2004 WL 2900357 (1st Cir. Dec.\n\n15, 2004).\n\n                                        IV.\n\n            Barbour argues that in sentencing him, the district court\n\nerred in its determination of drug quantities, possession of a\n\nweapon, criminal history, and obstruction of justice.\n\n             Barbour first argues that the district court erred in\n\nattributing to him drug quantities that were outside the scope of\n\nthe   charged       conspiracy.    In     reviewing        a    district   court's\n\napplication of sentencing guidelines, we review the guideline's\n\nlegal meaning and scope de novo.              United States v. Caraballo, 200\n\nF.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1999).        We review the court's fact-finding\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\ffor clear error, giving due deference to the court's application of\n\nthe guidelines to the facts.             Id.\n\n           Under the sentencing guidelines, a defendant may be held\n\naccountable for drug quantities involved in his \"relevant conduct.\"\n\nThis includes acts committed during the commission of the offense,\n\nin preparation, in the course of attempting to avoid detection, or,\n\nin some situations, conduct that was part of the same course of\n\nconduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\n\nU.S.S.G.   §    1B1.3    (2003).         The    background    section   of     1B1.3\n\nauthorizes judges to look at conduct beyond the crimes charged in\n\nthe indictment: \"Conduct that is not formally charged or is not an\n\nelement    of   the     offense     of    conviction    may    enter    into    the\n\ndetermination     of    the    applicable       guideline    sentencing   range.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, comment: backg'd.              In the context of controlled\n\nsubstances, the background states that \"quantities and types of\n\ndrugs not specified in the count of conviction are to be included\n\nin determining the offense level\" if they fit within the definition\n\nof relevant conduct.          Id.\n\n           Barbour's argument is that the government should have\n\ncharged four separate conspiracies rather than charging a single\n\n(1999-2001) conspiracy, and the court should have viewed Barbour's\n\nactivity before 1999 as a separate conspiracy.                   The government\n\nprovided evidence to support the theory of a single evolving drug\n\nconspiracy rather than several discrete and separate conspiracies.\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fThe district court made a factual finding that Barbour was the\n\nleader of one single drug conspiracy from 1996 to 2001.                 We cannot\n\nsay this finding, which was supported by the record, was clearly\n\nerroneous.    Barbour's conduct can still be relevant, though it may\n\nbe outside the time frame of the charged conspiracy.               The district\n\ncourt's finding of a single conspiracy from 1996-2001 supports the\n\ninclusion of the drug quantities as part of the same course of\n\nconduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.                  The\n\ndistrict court made no legal error in its application of the\n\nguidelines.       Because Barbour's involvement as early as 1996 is\n\nsupported    by    the    record,   the   district   court   did   not    err    in\n\nattributing the drug quantities to Barbour as part of his relevant\n\nconduct.\n\n             Barbour also argues that the court relied on \"unreliable\"\n\nor \"inaccurate\" information in attributing to him 360 pounds of\n\nmarijuana    and    one    kilogram   and    forty-two   ounces    of    cocaine.\n\nBarbour claims the marijuana could only have been part of the\n\nconspiracy in 1999, but the district court attributed it to Barbour\n\nin 1996.    The district court relied on John Ross's testimony, a co-\n\nconspirator, whom the court found credible for determining drug\n\nquantities, even though he was unable to recall the dates of the\n\ndrug transactions.        Barbour does not claim that the marijuana was\n\ncounted twice.      Whether the transaction occurred in 1996 or 1999\n\nmakes little difference because the district court found the\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fconspiracy lasted from 1996-2001.\n\n          Barry May and Steven Case testified about Barbour's\n\ninvolvement with the cocaine.       May testified that he received a\n\nkilogram of cocaine in May 2000.      He said \"they all were involved\n\nwith it,\" but that it was either Barbour or Shane Hall who actually\n\nsent the cocaine to him.     May took some of the cocaine to Kevin\n\nWoodward's house to be divided.      Case testified that in May 2000,\n\nhe saw almost a full kilo of cocaine at May's house, and that May\n\ntold him that Barbour took some of it when he packaged the kilo.\n\nCase also testified that Barbour sent him another forty-two ounces\n\nof cocaine around the time that Barbour was leaving Texas.\n\n          The   district   court   was    only   required   to   find   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that these drug quantities were part\n\nof Barbour's relevant conduct.       United States v. Laboy, 351 F.3d\n\n578, 582 (1st Cir. 2003).    The record supports each drug quantity\n\ndetermination, and we find no clear error in the district court's\n\napplication of the guidelines to the facts.\n\n          Barbour additionally argues that the district court did\n\nnot have sufficient evidence for the weapon enhancement. Witnesses\n\nMay and Hall testified that Barbour was among a group who went to\n\ncollect a debt in Houston.         The group started from a bar and\n\ndropped by Hall's house to get a gun.              Hall went inside and\n\nreturned with a gun, and the group went to collect a drug debt from\n\nCase.   Barbour admitted they went looking for Case to \"rough him\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fup.\"\n\n            We upheld a weapon enhancement against May for the same\n\nincident.    United States v. May, 343 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2003).      In\n\nMay, we said that in a conspiracy case, the government must show\n\nthat one of the defendant's co-conspirators \"possessed a weapon\n\nduring the offense.\" May, 343 F.3d at 7 (quoting Nelson-Rodriguez,\n\n319 F.3d at 59).       Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show\n\nthe connection between the gun and the drug conspiracy was \"clearly\n\nimprobable.\"     Id.     Here, the government showed that Hall, a co-\n\nconspirator, took a gun with him on the group expedition to collect\n\non a drug debt owed to Barbour and the other conspirators.        Barbour\n\nfailed to provide evidence that the connection between the drug\n\nconspiracy and the gun was \"clearly improbable.\"            We affirm the\n\nenhancement.\n\n            Barbour argues that the district court sentenced him from\n\nthe wrong criminal history category because the government failed\n\nto establish that he was represented by counsel for his previous\n\nconvictions.\n\n            Once the government establishes the existence of a prior\n\nconviction, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the\n\nearlier     conviction    was   constitutionally   infirm   or   otherwise\n\ninappropriate for consideration.        United States v. Gray, 177 F.3d\n\n86, 89 (1st Cir. 1999).         For his lack of representation claim,\n\nBarbour must have established both that he was uncounseled and that\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fhe did not waive his right to counsel.               Id. at 90.      The Presentence\n\nInvestigation Report, which can be used to satisfy the government's\n\n\"modest\" burden, id. at 89, detailed fifteen of Barbour's prior\n\nconvictions.        Barbour provided state records of his criminal\n\nhistory;    some     of     those    records       indicate      that      Barbour     was\n\nrepresented and some of them are silent as to representation.\n\n            Even if we were to assume those records establish a lack\n\nof representation, they still do not show whether Barbour waived\n\nhis right to counsel.         Id.    We have said that as the person in the\n\nbest position to offer details about his own criminal history, a\n\ndefendant's silence at sentencing can be \"deafening.\"                        Id. at 90.\n\nHere, Barbour testified at sentencing, but failed to testify about\n\nwhether     he    was     represented       in    connection        with    his      prior\n\nconvictions, thus failing to establish the necessary element of\n\nfailure to waive counsel.            The district court did not err in its\n\ncriminal history determination.\n\n            A     lengthy    discussion      of    Barbour's      challenge       to   the\n\nobstruction of justice enhancement is not necessary. The record is\n\nreplete with references to support the district court's conclusion.\n\n            For     the     first    time    after    oral       arguments,       Barbour\n\nsubmitted a letter under Fed. R. App. P. 28(j), calling our\n\nattention    to    Blakely v.       Washington,       124   S.    Ct.   2531      (2004).\n\nAlthough Blakely stated             that    it    expressed    no    opinion      on   the\n\nvalidity of the federal sentencing guidelines, its rationale casts\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\fdoubt on their constitutionality, and the Supreme Court has taken\n\nthe question under advisement.     United States v. Del Rosario, 388\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            A party cannot normally raise a new issue in a Rule 28(j)\n\nfiling.    United States v. Morgan, 384 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nA more difficult question is whether this rule should apply when a\n\nparty is raising a new issue in response to a Supreme Court\n\ndecision that was issued only after briefing and oral argument.\n\nId.     If Barbour merely failed to raise the argument, we can still\n\nreview for plain error, but if Barbour waived the argument, no\n\nreview is available.    See id.    If we assume, in Barbour's favor,\n\nthat plain error review is available, Barbour's argument does not\n\nprevail.\n\n            We review the district court's determinations in light of\n\nthe existing precedent at that time.     The district court sentenced\n\nBarbour on February 5, 2003, which was more than one year before\n\nthe Supreme Court decided Blakely. We cannot say that the district\n\ncourt's application of the sentencing guidelines, which occurred\n\nbefore Blakely cast doubt on their constitutionality, was plain\n\nerror.    See, e.g., Del Rosario, 388F.3d at 14-15; Morgan, 384 F.3d\n\nat 8.\n\n            Barbour's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour was convicted in Texas in 1996 for wire fraud arising from a telemarketing scheme and was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. After he served that term, his supervised release was revoked in 1998, and he went back to prison until 1999. He was again put on supervised release and required to live at a halfway house in Maine. In late October of 1999, while Barbour was still on supervised release, he moved from Maine to Texas, which violated the terms of his supervised release. An arrest warrant was issued two days later, but it was not served on Barbour until October 2000. In the intervening period, he had established residence and a fictitious identity (\"Jon Kugler\") in Houston, Texas and had begun shipping marijuana to Barry May, who sold it to Maine drug dealers. Barbour and his family left Houston in the late summer of 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his arrest in October 2000, Barbour was sentenced to an additional twelve months' imprisonment. On the final day of his imprisonment, in October 2001, Barbour and May were arrested and indicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and marijuana from January 1, 1999 through October 1, 2001.

He argues that Agent Baril and the Assistant United States Attorney knew in early 2000 that Barbour was in Houston using the alias \"Jon Kugler,\" but they took no serious action to execute on the November 1999 warrant until September 2000 when agents raided the house that he had been living in. Barbour argues that Baril was motivated by improper personal animus in delaying the arrest and charges to increase Barbour's potential sentence. Barbour attempts to show Baril's personal animus toward him through Baril's testimony that he was waiting for \"the right moment\" to arrest Barbour. Barbour argues that Baril waited to arrest Barbour for no legitimate reason, but only to frustrate Barbour and increase his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the defendant's burden to show sentencing factor manipulation by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v.

A district court's determination is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court is left with the \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" <i>United States v. Newton,</i> 326 F.3d 253, 257 (1st Cir.2003)(quoting <i>Reich v.

Egemonye,</i> 62 F.3d 425, 427 (1st Cir.1995). A manipulation claim can be established by showing that the agents overpowered the free will of the defendant and caused him to commit a more serious offense than he was predisposed to commit. <i>United States v. Connell,</i> 960 F.2d 191, 196 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A typical sentencing factor manipulation claim involves undercover agents participating in criminal activity with the defendant and waiting to make an arrest for the sole purpose of increasing the defendant's sentence by encouraging the commission of a crime that the defendant was not predisposed to commit. <i>See, e.g., Egemonye,</i> 62 F.3d at 427; <i>Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d at 30-31. This is not such a case because there was no pressure to commit a more serious crime, no agent involvement in Barbour's crimes, and there was a legitimate reason to delay Barbour's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analysis of a sentencing factor manipulation claim focuses primarily (though not exclusively) on the conduct and motives of the government. <i>Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d at 31. The government has \"broad latitude\" in investigating crime and can lengthen an investigation to explore the size, techniques and participants involved in a criminal operation. <i>Egemonye,</i> 62 F.3d at 427-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Barbour's claim of sentencing factor manipulation because agents did not encourage Barbour or \"lead him into new criminal conduct,\" and because it found there was a legitimate reason to delay Barbour's arrest. The district court described Barbour as the leader of an extremely large, five-year drug conspiracy. The government identified at least eighteen participants, most of whom communicated using false names and code words. The participants frequently switched cell phones and land lines. The method of drug transportation evolved from tackle boxes to PVC pipes to Volkswagen vehicles to commercial shrink wrap packaging. Barbour avoided police by moving from Maine to Texas, to New Hampshire, and to Florida, where he was arrested. During the year before Barbour's 2001 arrest, Agent Baril identified five additional participants in the conspiracy and obtained additional telephone and shipping records. The agents in this case kept up with the constantly changing size, techniques, and participants of the conspiracy. This is exactly the type of investigative work <i>Egemonye</i> considered within the legitimate scope of government agents' authority. 62 F.3d at 427.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals no improper conduct on the part of the agents during that investigation. There is no indication that agents pressured or coerced Barbour to \"achieve a new level of crime.\" <i>Id.</i> No undercover agent bought drugs from, or sold drugs to, Barbour. Agents had no contact with Barbour until his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects no improper law enforcement motive. We have said that racial hostility or personal animus would be an improper motive. <i>Id.</i> at 428. Even if Baril's comment about waiting for the \"right moment\" could be interpreted as personal animus, as Barbour argues, it is also amenable to an innocent interpretation. Baril said he was waiting to be sure he had sufficient evidence for a conviction. He was also waiting to identify more of the conspirators and gather evidence against them. A district court's choice between two or more reasonable interpretations of the evidence cannot be called clearly erroneous. <i>Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d at 32. The district court did not err in rejecting Barbour's claim of sentencing factor manipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour argues that the district court did not properly instruct the jury on the government's burden to prove the drug quantities from the indictment, as required by <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court instructed the jury that it must find elements beyond a reasonable doubt, but did not characterize the drug quantity determination as an element. Barbour argues this error denied his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to a jury verdict on the drug quantities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court included the drug quantities in the verdict form. The verdict form asked, \"Did the cocaine conspiracy involve, in total, at least 500 grams of cocaine?\" The jury checked the \"yes\" box. The verdict form asked, \"Did the marijuana conspiracy involve, in total,\" listing several quantities, with instructions to check only one. The jury put a checkmark next to \"at least 50 kilograms of marijuana.\" The jury instructions stated that if the jury found Barbour guilty, it must determine the drug quantities involved, and stated seventeen times that the government's burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour raises this <i>Apprendi</i> argument for the first time on appeal; he did not object to the jury instructions at trial or at sentencing. He asks that we excuse his failure to object because the case that established that <i>Apprendi</i> errors may be raised at sentencing was decided after Barbour's sentencing. <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 539 U.S. 928, 123 S.Ct. 2589, 156 L.Ed.2d 606 (2003). Because confusion existed, in <i>Nelson-Rodriguez</i> we assumed that the defendants preserved their objections if they objected either before the jury instructions were given or at sentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 47-48. Barbour did neither, so even if we made the same assumption for him, we would still review for plain error. <i>Id.</i> at 47-49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plain error standard, we reverse only if a \"clear and obvious\" error occurred. <i>United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2058, 158 L.Ed.2d 522 (2004)). That error also must affect the defendant's substantial rights and must seriously impair the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In <i>Perez-Ruiz,</i> we applied the <i>Apprendi</i> rule to drug quantity determinations. 353 F.3d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour interprets <i>United States v.

In <i>Goodine,</i> the jury found certain drug quantities, but the judge considered additional quantities in sentencing the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 27. We applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to the quantities found by the judge and called them sentencing factors rather than elements. <i>Id.</i> at 32. <i>Goodine</i> held that <i>Apprendi</i> was not violated when the sentence imposed exceeded the guideline range for the indicted amount but did not exceed the maximum statutory penalty for the drug quantities found by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a fact finding, other than a prior conviction, increases the statutory maximum, under <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 550, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), the fact must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court explained that if, because of the existence of a particular fact, the penalty is to be increased beyond the statutory maximum, that fact must be found by the jury regardless of whether it is a sentencing factor or an element. <i>Harris,</i> 536 U.S. at 550, 122 S.Ct. 2406.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The maximum sentence for convictions in which no particular quantity was proved is twenty years for cocaine and five years for marijuana. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), (D) (2000). The district court sentenced Barbour to 420 months, or thirty-five years, which exceeds the twenty- and five-year statutory maximums in the absence of a quantity determination. Under <i>Harris</i> and <i>Apprendi,</i> before Barbour could be sentenced beyond the statutory maximums based on quantity, the drug quantity must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The question in this case is whether, on the instructions given, the jury would have understood that it had to find the drug quantities beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We held that the jury had not been instructed that it must find drug quantities beyond a reasonable doubt in <i>United States v. Perez-Ruiz</i> and <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez.</i> In <i>Perez-Ruiz,</i> the judge read the quantities listed in the indictment to the jury once and elsewhere stated that the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the indicted conspiracy existed. 353 F.3d at 16. We held that instructions did not forge the necessary link between the concept of drug quantity and the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. In <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> the court provided a copy of the indictment, which listed the drug quantities, to the jury, but the jury was asked to find only whether there was the conspiracy as indicted, not whether the drug amounts in the indictment were correct. 319 F.3d at 45. The result was that the jury only found that the charged conspiracy existed but did not determine the drug quantities. <i>Id.</i> Here, in contrast, the jury was given three choices of drug quantities &#8212; not all or nothing, but a multiple choice. The jury was asked to specify drug type and quantity, and it did so. It is not tenable to compare this case to <i>Perez-Ruiz</i> or <i>Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> in each of which the jury was not permitted to specify amount and was not alerted to the need to consider the amount in its own right. Here, the district court included the drug quantities in the verdict form. The jury was instructed that if it found Barbour guilty, it would also \"have to answer one or more questions concerning the quantity of the substance involved which may affect the potential sentence.\" The jury instructions contained seventeen references to the government's beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden of proof. The jury was clearly instructed that the defendant's guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the drug quantity questions that immediately followed connected that burden of proof to the drug quantity determination. The instructions in this case contain a more precise finding of drug quantity and contain a closer link between the burden of proof and the jury's quantity determination than the instructions in either <i>Perez-Ruiz</i> or <i>Nelson-Rodriguez.</i> The district court did not commit plain error when it instructed the jury on the government's burden of proof and included the drug quantities involved on the verdict form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour argues that the Assistant United States Attorney's pervasive misconduct during the trial and the sentencing undermined the accuracy of the fact-finding process and resulted in a fundamentally unfair conviction and sentence. Only three of Barbour's allegations of misconduct by the Assistant Attorney warrant discussion: (1) whether the Attorney tampered with the proffer statements; (2) whether the Attorney improperly bolstered the government's credibility; and (3) whether the Attorney made improper remarks on Barbour's failure to testify during closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review Barbour's claims of prosecutorial misconduct for plain error because he failed to object at trial. <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> 119 F.3d 1006, 1013-14 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Barbour claims that the Assistant Attorney changed facts in Baril's proffer reports, which rendered them inaccurate and unreliable, and then used the reports during his impeachment of Barry May. The proffer reports were investigative reports prepared by agents of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency after interviews with cooperating witnesses. Barbour's brief argues that by reviewing and revising proffer reports, the Attorney rendered them unreliable and then injected the contents of the reports before the jury without defense counsel being made aware of the tampering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour's only support for claiming the Assistant Attorney changed facts is that some of the facts in the reports differed from Baril's recollection<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> or from another witness's recollection. If the proffer reports do not coincide perfectly with the witnesses' memories, that inconsistency does not establish that the Attorney changed facts in Baril's proffer report. Baril said during the sentencing hearing that, during an interview, he routinely tries to take notes verbatim and he types them into a report as soon as possible. A copy of that report is sent to the prosecutor, any agents who attended the interview, the witness, and the defense attorney to be reviewed for accuracy. After the report is written and signed, any corrections are made in a supplemental report. Barbour received a copy of Baril's handwritten notes from the interviews. The record does not establish plain error because Barbour has not shown that the Assistant Attorney tampered with any of the proffer reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Barbour contends that the Assistant Attorney improperly bolstered the government's credibility during the trial. The Attorney periodically questioned witnesses about what they told \"us\" or the \"agents\" in their proffer sessions. Barbour argues that by identifying himself with the agents, the Attorney improperly borrowed the prestige of those agents. Barbour argues that the Attorney repeatedly mentioned that the witnesses told a different story to government agents to imply that because the agents worked for the government, their recollection was more likely to be the truth than the witnesses' recollection. We are persuaded by the government's explanation that the Attorney used those words as context, to explain to the court and the witnesses to which interviews he was referring. An assistant attorney's cross-examination of a witness with an inconsistent statement would be of doubtful value if he were not permitted to delineate between conversations by giving the witness more context. May participated in several proffers and at one point during the trial, for clarification, had to ask the Attorney, \"Is this the proffer I did with you?\" There is no indication that the Attorney was attempting to bolster the government's credibility with those references.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Assistant Attorney also said, \"So I guess the agents got that wrong\" when confronting May with an inconsistent statement. Even if the isolated question indirectly implied that the government was more credible than the witness, the question still does not rise to the level of plain error in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Barbour claims that the Assistant Attorney made two improper comments during closing argument about Barbour's failure to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comments by a prosecutor on a defendant's failure to testify violate the Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination. <i>Griffin v. California,</i> 380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). This court looks at whether the prosecutor's language shows a manifest intention to comment on the defendant's failure to testify and whether the jury would naturally and necessarily understand it to be a comment on the defendant's failure to testify. <i>United States v. Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d 761, 769 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Assistant Attorney said, \"But if you want to really find out what went on, go to the people on the inside... [t]hose are the only people who laid it out for you.\" The government contends that the Attorney meant that the conspirators were credible witnesses because their information came from their position inside the conspiracy. That interpretation fails to explain why he said they were \"the <i>only</i> people who laid it out for you.\" The Attorney's intention could have been to comment only on the credibility of his witnesses, but this last phrase raises the possibility he was commenting on Barbour's failure to testify or present witnesses. But it seems more likely that he was comparing the insiders to the other witnesses who testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Assistant Attorney's second comment referred to one of Barbour's taped phone conversations. He said, \"The best witness in this case I submit to you is Mr. Panasonic.... Mr. Panasonic allowed you to listen to this defendant.\" That comment may also be open to more than one interpretation. Perhaps the Attorney was suggesting only that the taped evidence was the best, most objective evidence in the trial. In closing, the Attorney explained that \"Mr. Panasonic has nothing to gain or lose. Mr. Panasonic has not been impeached one iota.\" On the other hand, \"this allowed you to listen to this defendant\" arguably might be interpreted as a reminder to the jury that Barbour did not take the stand to explain the taped conversations and as a reminder that the prosecution was the only party who made it possible for the jury to listen to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, arguendo, that the Assistant Attorney's comments are each capable of at least two possible interpretations, one impermissible and one innocent, it would not profit Barbour here. In these situations we have cautioned, \"A court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning.\" <i>Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d at 770 (citations omitted). Nor should we assume the jury will draw from the comments the most damaging meaning. <i>United States v. Newton,</i> 327 F.3d 17, 27 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 928, 124 S.Ct. 338, 157 L.Ed.2d 231 (2003). <i>Wihbey</i> reviewed two comments similar to those in Barbour's case. First, the prosecutor mistakenly named the defendants among those who testified; he then said, \"You've heard from all of those witnesses except for obviously the two Defendants ...\" <i>Id.</i> at 768. The court agreed that the prosecutor was trying to correct his earlier mistake and the jury would understand his statement as a correction. <i>Id.</i> at 770. Second, the prosecutor stated that defense counsel could not \"explain away\" a conversation that another witness testified about. <i>Id.</i> at 769. The court categorized that statement as a \"how-does-counsel-explain\" <i>Griffin</i> violation, but held it was not plain error, stating that the comment did not seriously affect the fairness and integrity of the proceedings for two reasons. <i>Id.</i> at 770-71. First, the jury was instructed on the defendant's right to not testify and on the government's burden of proof, and second, the evidence against the defendant was strong, even if not overwhelming. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Assistant Attorney intended the comments to be a reference to Barbour's failure to testify, or if the jury believed them to be, the comments did not likely affect the outcome of the trial. The potential influence of those comments on the jury was mitigated by the jury instructions, which stated that the defendant had no obligation to testify and repeated the government's beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden seventeen times. The evidence of Barbour's guilt was strong, although the specific drug quantities and length of the conspiracy were disputed. If the comments were objectionable, Barbour did not object, and the comments do not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Moran,</i> No. 03-2148, 2004 WL 2900357 (1st Cir. Dec.15, 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour argues that in sentencing him, the district court erred in its determination of drug quantities, possession of a weapon, criminal history, and obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour first argues that the district court erred in attributing to him drug quantities that were outside the scope of the charged conspiracy. In reviewing a district court's application of sentencing guidelines, we review the guideline's legal meaning and scope de novo. <i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> 200 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1999). We review the court's fact-finding for clear error, giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the sentencing guidelines, a defendant may be held accountable for drug quantities involved in his \"relevant conduct.\" This includes acts committed during the commission of the offense, in preparation, in the course of attempting to avoid detection, or, in some situations, conduct that was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 (2003). The background section of 1B1.3 authorizes judges to look at conduct beyond the crimes charged in the indictment: \"Conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment: backg'd. In the context of controlled substances, the background states that \"quantities and types of drugs not specified in the count of conviction are to be included in determining the offense level\" if they fit within the definition of relevant conduct. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour's argument is that the government should have charged four separate conspiracies rather than charging a single (1999-2001) conspiracy, and the court should have viewed Barbour's activity before 1999 as a separate conspiracy. The government provided evidence to support the theory of a single evolving drug conspiracy rather than several discrete and separate conspiracies. The district court made a factual finding that Barbour was the leader of one single drug conspiracy from 1996 to 2001. We cannot say this finding, which was supported by the record, was clearly erroneous. Barbour's conduct can still be relevant, though it may be outside the time frame of the charged conspiracy. The district court's finding of a single conspiracy from 1996-2001 supports the inclusion of the drug quantities as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The district court made no legal error in its application of the guidelines. Because Barbour's involvement as early as 1996 is supported by the record, the district court did not err in attributing the drug quantities to Barbour as part of his relevant conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour also argues that the court relied on \"unreliable\" or \"inaccurate\" information in attributing to him 360 pounds of marijuana and one kilogram and forty-two ounces of cocaine. Barbour claims the marijuana could only have been part of the conspiracy in 1999, but the district court attributed it to Barbour in 1996. The district court relied on John Ross's testimony, a co-conspirator, whom the court found credible for determining drug quantities, even though he was unable to recall the dates of the drug transactions. Barbour does not claim that the marijuana was counted twice. Whether the transaction occurred in 1996 or 1999 makes little difference because the district court found the conspiracy lasted from 1996-2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barry May and Steven Case testified about Barbour's involvement with the cocaine. May testified that he received a kilogram of cocaine in May 2000. He said \"they all were involved with it,\" but that it was either Barbour or Shane Hall who actually sent the cocaine to him. May took some of the cocaine to Kevin Woodward's house to be divided. Case testified that in May 2000, he saw almost a full kilo of cocaine at May's house, and that May told him that Barbour took some of it when he packaged the kilo. Case also testified that Barbour sent him another forty-two ounces of cocaine around the time that Barbour was leaving Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was only required to find by a preponderance of the evidence that these drug quantities were part of Barbour's relevant conduct. <i>United States v. Laboy,</i> 351 F.3d 578, 582 (1st Cir.2003). The record supports each drug quantity determination, and we find no clear error in the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour additionally argues that the district court did not have sufficient evidence for the weapon enhancement. Witnesses May and Hall testified that Barbour was among a group who went to collect a debt in Houston. The group started from a bar and dropped by Hall's house to get a gun. Hall went inside and returned with a gun, and the group went to collect a drug debt from Case. Barbour admitted they went looking for Case to \"rough him up.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We upheld a weapon enhancement against May for the same incident. <i>United States v. May,</i> 343 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2003).

The Presentence Investigation Report, which can be used to satisfy the government's \"modest\" burden, <i>id.</i> at 89, detailed fifteen of Barbour's prior convictions.

After he served that term, his supervised release was revoked in 1998, and he went back to prison until 1999. He was again put on supervised release and required to live at a halfway house in Maine. In late October of 1999, while Barbour was still on supervised release, he moved from Maine to Texas, which violated the terms of his supervised release. An arrest warrant was issued two days later, but it was not served on Barbour until October 2000. In the intervening period, he had established residence and a fictitious identity (\"Jon Kugler\") in Houston, Texas and had begun shipping marijuana to Barry May, who sold it to Maine drug dealers. Barbour and his family left Houston in the late summer of 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his arrest in October 2000, Barbour was sentenced to an additional twelve months' imprisonment. On the final day of his imprisonment, in October 2001, Barbour and May were arrested and indicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and marijuana from January 1, 1999 through October 1, 2001. A jury found Barbour guilty of both counts, and the district court sentenced him to 420 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues raised by Barbour do not require that we deal extensively with the trial record concerning the details of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour argues that the government's nine-month delay in executing on an arrest warrant and twenty-one-month delay in bringing conspiracy charges constituted impermissible sentencing factor manipulation. He argues that Agent Baril and the Assistant United States Attorney knew in early 2000 that Barbour was in Houston using the alias \"Jon Kugler,\" but they took no serious action to execute on the November 1999 warrant until September 2000 when agents raided the house that he had been living in. Barbour argues that Baril was motivated by improper personal animus in delaying the arrest and charges to increase Barbour's potential sentence. Barbour attempts to show Baril's personal animus toward him through Baril's testimony that he was waiting for \"the right moment\" to arrest Barbour. Barbour argues that Baril waited to arrest Barbour for no legitimate reason, but only to frustrate Barbour and increase his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the defendant's burden to show sentencing factor manipulation by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v.

This is not such a case because there was no pressure to commit a more serious crime, no agent involvement in Barbour's crimes, and there was a legitimate reason to delay Barbour's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analysis of a sentencing factor manipulation claim focuses primarily (though not exclusively) on the conduct and motives of the government. <i>Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d at 31. The government has \"broad latitude\" in investigating crime and can lengthen an investigation to explore the size, techniques and participants involved in a criminal operation. <i>Egemonye,</i> 62 F.3d at 427-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Barbour's claim of sentencing factor manipulation because agents did not encourage Barbour or \"lead him into new criminal conduct,\" and because it found there was a legitimate reason to delay Barbour's arrest. The district court described Barbour as the leader of an extremely large, five-year drug conspiracy. The government identified at least eighteen participants, most of whom communicated using false names and code words. The participants frequently switched cell phones and land lines. The method of drug transportation evolved from tackle boxes to PVC pipes to Volkswagen vehicles to commercial shrink wrap packaging. Barbour avoided police by moving from Maine to Texas, to New Hampshire, and to Florida, where he was arrested. During the year before Barbour's 2001 arrest, Agent Baril identified five additional participants in the conspiracy and obtained additional telephone and shipping records. The agents in this case kept up with the constantly changing size, techniques, and participants of the conspiracy. This is exactly the type of investigative work <i>Egemonye</i> considered within the legitimate scope of government agents' authority. 62 F.3d at 427.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals no improper conduct on the part of the agents during that investigation. There is no indication that agents pressured or coerced Barbour to \"achieve a new level of crime.\" <i>Id.</i> No undercover agent bought drugs from, or sold drugs to, Barbour. Agents had no contact with Barbour until his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reflects no improper law enforcement motive. We have said that racial hostility or personal animus would be an improper motive. <i>Id.</i> at 428. Even if Baril's comment about waiting for the \"right moment\" could be interpreted as personal animus, as Barbour argues, it is also amenable to an innocent interpretation. Baril said he was waiting to be sure he had sufficient evidence for a conviction. He was also waiting to identify more of the conspirators and gather evidence against them. A district court's choice between two or more reasonable interpretations of the evidence cannot be called clearly erroneous. <i>Gibbens,</i> 25 F.3d at 32.

The jury put a checkmark next to \"at least 50 kilograms of marijuana.\" The jury instructions stated that if the jury found Barbour guilty, it must determine the drug quantities involved, and stated seventeen times that the government's burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour raises this <i>Apprendi</i> argument for the first time on appeal; he did not object to the jury instructions at trial or at sentencing.

The district court sentenced Barbour to 420 months, or thirty-five years, which exceeds the twenty- and five-year statutory maximums in the absence of a quantity determination. Under <i>Harris</i> and <i>Apprendi,</i> before Barbour could be sentenced beyond the statutory maximums based on quantity, the drug quantity must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

We held that instructions did not forge the necessary link between the concept of drug quantity and the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. In <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> the court provided a copy of the indictment, which listed the drug quantities, to the jury, but the jury was asked to find only whether there was the conspiracy as indicted, not whether the drug amounts in the indictment were correct. 319 F.3d at 45. The result was that the jury only found that the charged conspiracy existed but did not determine the drug quantities. <i>Id.</i> Here, in contrast, the jury was given three choices of drug quantities &#8212; not all or nothing, but a multiple choice. The jury was asked to specify drug type and quantity, and it did so. It is not tenable to compare this case to <i>Perez-Ruiz</i> or <i>Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> in each of which the jury was not permitted to specify amount and was not alerted to the need to consider the amount in its own right. Here, the district court included the drug quantities in the verdict form. The jury was instructed that if it found Barbour guilty, it would also \"have to answer one or more questions concerning the quantity of the substance involved which may affect the potential sentence.\" The jury instructions contained seventeen references to the government's beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden of proof. The jury was clearly instructed that the defendant's guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the drug quantity questions that immediately followed connected that burden of proof to the drug quantity determination. The instructions in this case contain a more precise finding of drug quantity and contain a closer link between the burden of proof and the jury's quantity determination than the instructions in either <i>Perez-Ruiz</i> or <i>Nelson-Rodriguez.</i> The district court did not commit plain error when it instructed the jury on the government's burden of proof and included the drug quantities involved on the verdict form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour argues that the Assistant United States Attorney's pervasive misconduct during the trial and the sentencing undermined the accuracy of the fact-finding process and resulted in a fundamentally unfair conviction and sentence. Only three of Barbour's allegations of misconduct by the Assistant Attorney warrant discussion: (1) whether the Attorney tampered with the proffer statements; (2) whether the Attorney improperly bolstered the government's credibility; and (3) whether the Attorney made improper remarks on Barbour's failure to testify during closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review Barbour's claims of prosecutorial misconduct for plain error because he failed to object at trial. <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197474\"><a href=\"/opinion/197474/united-states-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1013-14 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Barbour claims that the Assistant Attorney changed facts in Baril's proffer reports, which rendered them inaccurate and unreliable, and then used the reports during his impeachment of Barry May. The proffer reports were investigative reports prepared by agents of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency after interviews with cooperating witnesses. Barbour's brief argues that by reviewing and revising proffer reports, the Attorney rendered them unreliable and then injected the contents of the reports before the jury without defense counsel being made aware of the tampering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour's only support for claiming the Assistant Attorney changed facts is that some of the facts in the reports differed from Baril's recollection<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> or from another witness's recollection. If the proffer reports do not coincide perfectly with the witnesses' memories, that inconsistency does not establish that the Attorney changed facts in Baril's proffer report. Baril said during the sentencing hearing that, during an interview, he routinely tries to take notes verbatim and he types them into a report as soon as possible. A copy of that report is sent to the prosecutor, any agents who attended the interview, the witness, and the defense attorney to be reviewed for accuracy. After the report is written and signed, any corrections are made in a supplemental report. Barbour received a copy of Baril's handwritten notes from the interviews. The record does not establish plain error because Barbour has not shown that the Assistant Attorney tampered with any of the proffer reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Barbour contends that the Assistant Attorney improperly bolstered the government's credibility during the trial. The Attorney periodically questioned witnesses about what they told \"us\" or the \"agents\" in their proffer sessions. Barbour argues that by identifying himself with the agents, the Attorney improperly borrowed the prestige of those agents. Barbour argues that the Attorney repeatedly mentioned that the witnesses told a different story to government agents to imply that because the agents worked for the government, their recollection was more likely to be the truth than the witnesses' recollection. We are persuaded by the government's explanation that the Attorney used those words as context, to explain to the court and the witnesses to which interviews he was referring. An assistant attorney's cross-examination of a witness with an inconsistent statement would be of doubtful value if he were not permitted to delineate between conversations by giving the witness more context. May participated in several proffers and at one point during the trial, for clarification, had to ask the Attorney, \"Is this the proffer I did with you?\" There is no indication that the Attorney was attempting to bolster the government's credibility with those references.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Assistant Attorney also said, \"So I guess the agents got that wrong\" when confronting May with an inconsistent statement. Even if the isolated question indirectly implied that the government was more credible than the witness, the question still does not rise to the level of plain error in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Barbour claims that the Assistant Attorney made two improper comments during closing argument about Barbour's failure to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comments by a prosecutor on a defendant's failure to testify violate the Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination. <i>Griffin v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107038\"><a href=\"/opinion/107038/griffin-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 615, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107038\"><a href=\"/opinion/107038/griffin-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span> (1965). This court looks at whether the prosecutor's language shows a manifest intention to comment on the defendant's failure to testify and whether the jury would naturally and necessarily understand it to be a comment on the defendant's failure to testify. <i>United States v. Wihbey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196557\"><a href=\"/opinion/196557/united-states-v-wihbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Assistant Attorney said, \"But if you want to really find out what went on, go to the people on the inside... [t]hose are the only people who laid it out for you.\" The government contends that the Attorney meant that the conspirators were credible witnesses because their information came from their position inside the conspiracy. That interpretation fails to explain why he said they were \"the <i>only</i> people who laid it out for you.\" The Attorney's intention could have been to comment only on the credibility of his witnesses, but this last phrase raises the possibility he was commenting on Barbour's failure to testify or present witnesses. But it seems more likely that he was comparing the insiders to the other witnesses who testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Assistant Attorney's second comment referred to one of Barbour's taped phone conversations. He said, \"The best witness in this case I submit to you is Mr. Panasonic.... Mr. Panasonic allowed you to listen to this defendant.\" That comment may also be open to more than one interpretation. Perhaps the Attorney was suggesting only that the taped evidence was the best, most objective evidence in the trial. In closing, the Attorney explained that \"Mr. Panasonic has nothing to gain or lose. Mr. Panasonic has not been impeached one iota.\" On the other hand, \"this allowed you to listen to this defendant\" arguably might be interpreted as a reminder to the jury that Barbour did not take the stand to explain the taped conversations and as a reminder that the prosecution was the only party who made it possible for the jury to listen to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, arguendo, that the Assistant Attorney's comments are each capable of at least two possible interpretations, one impermissible and one innocent, it would not profit Barbour here. In these situations we have cautioned, \"A court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning.\" <i>Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d at 770 (citations omitted). Nor should we assume the jury will draw from the comments the most damaging meaning. <i>United States v. Newton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200445\"><a href=\"/opinion/200445/united-states-v-newton/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></span> (2003). <i>Wihbey</i> reviewed two comments similar to those in Barbour's case. First, the prosecutor mistakenly named the defendants among those who testified; he then said, \"You've heard from all of those witnesses except for obviously the two Defendants ...\" <i>Id.</i> at 768. The court agreed that the prosecutor was trying to correct his earlier mistake and the jury would understand his statement as a correction. <i>Id.</i> at 770. Second, the prosecutor stated that defense counsel could not \"explain away\" a conversation that another witness testified about. <i>Id.</i> at 769. The court categorized that statement as a \"how-does-counsel-explain\" <i>Griffin</i> violation, but held it was not plain error, stating that the comment did not seriously affect the fairness and integrity of the proceedings for two reasons. <i>Id.</i> at 770-71. First, the jury was instructed on the defendant's right to not testify and on the government's burden of proof, and second, the evidence against the defendant was strong, even if not overwhelming. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Assistant Attorney intended the comments to be a reference to Barbour's failure to testify, or if the jury believed them to be, the comments did not likely affect the outcome of the trial. The potential influence of those comments on the jury was mitigated by the jury instructions, which stated that the defendant had no obligation to testify and repeated the government's beyond-a-reasonable-doubt burden seventeen times. The evidence of Barbour's guilt was strong, although the specific drug quantities and length of the conspiracy were disputed. If the comments were objectionable, Barbour did not object, and the comments do not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Moran,</i> No. 03-2148, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2900357</span></span> (1st Cir.

In reviewing a district court's application of sentencing guidelines, we review the guideline's legal meaning and scope de novo. <i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198786\"><a href=\"/opinion/198786/united-states-v-caraballo/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1999). We review the court's fact-finding for clear error, giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the sentencing guidelines, a defendant may be held accountable for drug quantities involved in his \"relevant conduct.\" This includes acts committed during the commission of the offense, in preparation, in the course of attempting to avoid detection, or, in some situations, conduct that was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 (2003). The background section of 1B1.3 authorizes judges to look at conduct beyond the crimes charged in the indictment: \"Conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment: backg'd. In the context of controlled substances, the background states that \"quantities and types of drugs not specified in the count of conviction are to be included in determining the offense level\" if they fit within the definition of relevant conduct. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour's argument is that the government should have charged four separate conspiracies rather than charging a single (1999-2001) conspiracy, and the court should have viewed Barbour's activity before 1999 as a separate conspiracy. The government provided evidence to support the theory of a single evolving drug conspiracy rather than several discrete and separate conspiracies. The district court made a factual finding that Barbour was the leader of one single drug conspiracy from 1996 to 2001. We cannot say this finding, which was supported by the record, was clearly erroneous. Barbour's conduct can still be relevant, though it may be outside the time frame of the charged conspiracy. The district court's finding of a single conspiracy from 1996-2001 supports the inclusion of the drug quantities as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The district court made no legal error in its application of the guidelines. Because Barbour's involvement as early as 1996 is supported by the record, the district court did not err in attributing the drug quantities to Barbour as part of his relevant conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour also argues that the court relied on \"unreliable\" or \"inaccurate\" information in attributing to him 360 pounds of marijuana and one kilogram and forty-two ounces of cocaine. Barbour claims the marijuana could only have been part of the conspiracy in 1999, but the district court attributed it to Barbour in 1996. The district court relied on John Ross's testimony, a co-conspirator, whom the court found credible for determining drug quantities, even though he was unable to recall the dates of the drug transactions. Barbour does not claim that the marijuana was counted twice. Whether the transaction occurred in 1996 or 1999 makes little difference because the district court found the conspiracy lasted from 1996-2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barry May and Steven Case testified about Barbour's involvement with the cocaine. May testified that he received a kilogram of cocaine in May 2000. He said \"they all were involved with it,\" but that it was either Barbour or Shane Hall who actually sent the cocaine to him. May took some of the cocaine to Kevin Woodward's house to be divided. Case testified that in May 2000, he saw almost a full kilo of cocaine at May's house, and that May told him that Barbour took some of it when he packaged the kilo. Case also testified that Barbour sent him another forty-two ounces of cocaine around the time that Barbour was leaving Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was only required to find by a preponderance of the evidence that these drug quantities were part of Barbour's relevant conduct. <i>United States v. Laboy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200764\"><a href=\"/opinion/200764/united-states-v-laboy/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span>, 582 (1st Cir.2003). The record supports each drug quantity determination, and we find no clear error in the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour additionally argues that the district court did not have sufficient evidence for the weapon enhancement. Witnesses May and Hall testified that Barbour was among a group who went to collect a debt in Houston. The group started from a bar and dropped by Hall's house to get a gun. Hall went inside and returned with a gun, and the group went to collect a drug debt from Case. Barbour admitted they went looking for Case to \"rough him up.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We upheld a weapon enhancement against May for the same incident. <i>United States v.

In <i>May,</i> we said that in a conspiracy case, the government must show that one of the defendant's co-conspirators \"possessed a weapon during the offense.\" <i>May,</i> 343 F.3d at 7 (quoting <i>Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d at 59). Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show the connection between the gun and the drug conspiracy was \"clearly improbable.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the government showed that Hall, a co-conspirator, took a gun with him on the group expedition to collect on a drug debt owed to Barbour and the other conspirators. Barbour failed to provide evidence that the connection between the drug conspiracy and the gun was \"clearly improbable.\" We affirm the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barbour argues that the district court sentenced him from the wrong criminal history category because the government failed to establish that he was represented by counsel for his previous convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the government establishes the existence of a prior conviction, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the earlier conviction was constitutionally infirm or otherwise inappropriate for consideration. <i>United States v. Gray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198495\"><a href=\"/opinion/198495/united-states-v-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.1999). For his lack of representation claim, Barbour must have established both that he was uncounseled and that he did not waive his right to counsel. <i>Id.</i> at 90. The Presentence Investigation Report, which can be used to satisfy the government's \"modest\" burden, <i>id.</i> at 89, detailed fifteen of Barbour's prior convictions. Barbour provided state records of his criminal history; some of those records indicate that Barbour was represented and some of them are silent as to representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to assume those records establish a lack of representation, they still do not show whether Barbour waived his right to counsel. <i>Id.</i> We have said that as the person in the best position to offer details about his own criminal history, a defendant's silence at sentencing can be \"deafening.\" <i>Id.</i> at 90. Here, Barbour testified at sentencing, but failed to testify about whether he was represented in connection with his prior convictions, thus failing to establish the necessary element of failure to waive counsel. The district court did not err in its criminal history determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A lengthy discussion of Barbour's challenge to the obstruction of justice enhancement is not necessary. The record is replete with references to support the district court's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time after oral arguments, Barbour submitted a letter under Fed.

Although <i>Blakely</i> stated that it expressed no opinion on the validity of the federal sentencing guidelines, its rationale casts doubt on their constitutionality, and the Supreme Court has taken the question under advisement. <i>United States v. Del Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788222\"><a href=\"/opinion/788222/united-states-v-nelson-j-del-rosario-united-states-of-america-v-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party cannot normally raise a new issue in a Rule 28(j) filing. <i>United States v.

A more difficult question is whether this rule should apply when a party is raising a new issue in response to a Supreme Court decision that was issued only after briefing and oral argument. <i>Id.</i> If Barbour merely failed to raise the argument, we can still review for plain error, but if Barbour waived the argument, no review is available. <i>See id.</i> If we assume, in Barbour's favor, that plain error review is available, Barbour's argument does not prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's determinations in light of the existing precedent at that time.
