Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond L. Sánchez-Maceira for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nGuillermo Gil, former United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 22, 2002\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    On this appeal, we face a narrow\n\nset of issues arising from a recent amendment of the Maritime Drug\n\nLaw Enforcement Act (\"Maritime Act\"), 46 U.S.C. app. §§ 1901 et\n\nseq. (2000), intended by Congress to facilitate the prosecution of\n\nhigh-seas drug smuggling on U.S. or stateless vessels.         In a\n\nnutshell, the issue is whether, by pleading guilty unconditionally\n\nto a drug trafficking charge (possession of drugs on a stateless\n\nvessel with intent to distribute) the defendant Jose Alberto\n\nGonzalez forfeited any claim that the boat in question was a\n\nforeign (rather than a stateless) vessel.\n\n           The pertinent facts, derived from the plea agreement, can\n\nbe stated briefly.     On April 27, 1999, Gonzalez and another\n\nindividual were rescued from a speed boat that was two-thirds\n\nsubmerged on the high seas off the coast of the British Virgin\n\nIslands.   Summoned by the rescuing vessel, the U.S. Coast Guard\n\nresponded and on inspection found that the speed boat carried\n\nnumerous bales of cocaine.        Defendant and his companion were\n\nindicted for possessing the cocaine, with intent to distribute it,\n\naboard \"a vessel without nationality\" in violation of 46 U.S.C.\n\napp. § 1903(a).\n\n           That statute makes possession of cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute a federal crime where possession occurs either on board\n\na \"vessel of the United States\" or on board a \"vessel subject to\n\njurisdiction of the United States\"; id. § 1903(a); and the statute\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fplaces \"a vessel without nationality\" (sometimes called a stateless\n\nvessel) in the latter category.      Id. § 1903(c)(1)(A).   \"Vessel\n\nwithout nationality\" is further defined to include:\n\n          (A) a vessel aboard which the master or person in\n     charge makes a claim of registry, which claim is denied\n     by the flag nation whose registry is claimed;\n\n          (B) any vessel aboard which the master or person in\n     charge fails, upon request of an officer of the United\n     States empowered to enforce applicable provisions of\n     United States law, to make a claim of nationality or\n     registry for that vessel; and\n\n          (C) a vessel aboard which the master or person in\n     charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation\n     of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally\n     assert that the vessel is of its nationality.\n\nId. § 1903(c)(2)(A)-(C).\n\n          Gonzalez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground\n\nthat the speed boat was not a \"vessel without nationality\" because,\n\ninter alia, no claim of registry was requested by an officer of the\n\nUnited States.   The United States resisted the motion on various\n\ngrounds directed to showing that the speed boat was a stateless\n\nvessel.   In due course, a magistrate judge recommended denial of\n\nthe motion and the district court agreed.   Suffice it to say that\n\nthe issue is complicated.\n\n          Faced with an adverse ruling by the district court,\n\nGonzalez negotiated a guilty plea.    On February 23, 2001, a plea\n\nagreement was filed, with an agreed-upon sentence of 72 months, in\n\nwhich Gonzalez admitted the offense with which he was charged.   In\n\na change of plea proceeding, Gonzalez then expressly pled to the\n\n                               -3-\n\foffense of possessing cocaine on board a vessel subject to the\n\njurisdiction of the United States with intent to distribute.\n\nThereafter, Gonzalez was sentenced to 72 months.                 No issues were\n\nreserved for appeal.       Nevertheless, after sentencing, Gonzalez did\n\nfile an appeal asserting that the vessel was not in fact a\n\nstateless vessel.\n\n            Ordinarily a guilty plea, entered unconditionally--that\n\nis, without reserving an issue or issues for appeal--establishes\n\nguilt and forfeits all objections and defenses.                United States v.\n\nCordero, 42 F.3d 697, 699 (1st Cir. 1994).                     There are a few\n\nexceptions to this principle.              One applies where the claim on\n\nappeal   is    that     the     district     court   lacked     subject   matter\n\njurisdiction over the case, that is to say, where the defendant\n\nsays that the subject matter of the case falls outside the category\n\nof cases that the court is authorized to try.                 E.g., Cordero, 42\n\nF.3d at 99; United States v. Doyle, 348 F.2d 715, 718-19 (2d Cir.\n\n1965) (Friendly, J.).\n\n            One may ask why this exception exists when so many other\n\nobjections and defenses in criminal cases, including constitutional\n\nissues and prior professions of innocence, are readily forfeited\n\nthrough a knowing and voluntary plea of guilty.               The answer is that\n\ncourts treat their responsibility to stay within their grant of\n\nauthority     as   a   matter   of   extreme   importance.       United   States\n\nCatholic Conf. v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U.S. 72,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f77 (1988).      In fact, a court is expected to raise the subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction objection on its own motion at any stage and\n\neven if no party objects.        Fed R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2); Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.12(h)(3).\n\n           Article    III   gives    to   the   federal     judicial   branch\n\nauthority--that is, subject matter jurisdiction--over all cases\n\narising under the laws of the United States; and by statute\n\nCongress has given the federal district courts this authority over\n\nfederal criminal cases in the first instance.             18 U.S.C. § 3231\n\n(2000).    Conventionally, a federal criminal case is within the\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction of the district court if the indictment\n\ncharges,   as   the   Gonzalez    indictment    certainly    did,   that   the\n\ndefendant committed a crime described in Title 18 or in one of the\n\nother statutes defining federal crimes.          See 13B Wright & Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 3575, at 244-45 (2d ed. 1984).            In\n\nsuch a case subject matter jurisdiction, that is to say, authority\n\nto decide all other issues presented within the framework of the\n\ncase, exists.\n\n           Thus, unless Congress provided otherwise, subject matter\n\njurisdiction existed in the present case because Gonzalez was\n\ncharged in district court under section 1903, which is a federal\n\ncriminal statute. By the same token, the stateless vessel issue was\n\nforfeited by an unconditional guilty plea--again, unless Congress\n\nprovided otherwise.    This was certainly this court's view prior to\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe amendment of the statute.1          And if a defendant did seek to\n\npreserve an issue, he might easily find the prosecutor refusing to\n\nbargain.\n\n             In 1996, Congress amended the Maritime Act.          It did so\n\namong other things by expanding the definition of what constitutes\n\na stateless vessel, 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c)(2)(C), and also by\n\nadding a provision reading in pertinent part as follows:\n\n                     Jurisdiction of the United States with\n             respect to vessels subject to this chapter is\n             not an element of any offense.             All\n             jurisdictional issues arising under this\n             chapter are preliminary questions of law to be\n             determined solely by the trial judge.\n\n\n46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(f).        The key question is whether this terse\n\nprovision converted the stateless vessel issue into one implicating\n\nthe subject matter jurisdiction of the district court and prevented\n\nit from being forfeited in connection with a plea of guilty.\n\n             Nothing in the wording of the statute suggests such an\n\nintention.    The term \"jurisdiction\" is notoriously malleable and is\n\nused in a variety of contexts (e.g., personal jurisdiction) that\n\nhave   nothing   whatever   to   do   with   the   court's   subject   matter\n\n\n\n       1\n      Valencia v. United States, 923 F.2d 917, 921 (1st Cir. 1991).\nBut see United States v. Pinto-Mejia, 720 F.2d 248, 256-261 (2d\nCir. 1983).    In accord with Valencia are numerous other cases\nholding that threshold or nexus elements may be forfeited through\na guilty plea. See Hugi v. United States, 164 F.3d 378, 380-381\n(7th Cir. 1999) (interstate commerce requirement); Mack v. United\nStates, 853 F.2d 585, 586 (8th Cir. 1988) (bank federally insured).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fjurisdiction. See Hugi, 164 F.3d at 380-81. In very general terms,\n\n\"jurisdiction\" means something akin to \"authority over.\"     Black's\n\nLaw Dictionary 855 (7th ed. 1999).    Here, the word evidently refers\n\nto the substantive reach of the statute--applying to some vessels\n\nbut not others--and not to the subject matter jurisdiction of the\n\ncourt.\n\n           In other words, Congress asserted its own authority to\n\nregulate drug trafficking on some ships but not all ships and, in\n\nthis context, used the word \"jurisdiction\" loosely to describe its\n\nown assertion of authority to regulate; it does the same thing\n\nwhenever it fixes an \"affects interstate commerce\" or \"involved a\n\nfederally insured bank\" as a condition of the crime.      See note 1\n\nabove.   But such conditions have nothing whatever to do with the\n\nsubject matter of the federal district court; they are routine\n\nquestions as to the reach and application of a criminal statute.\n\n           Nor does legislative history suggest that Congress had in\n\nmind the court's subject matter jurisdiction or that it meant to\n\nprevent a guilty plea from being given its normal effect.        The\n\nlegislative history does not refer to subject matter jurisdiction\n\nor reveal any purpose to limit guilty pleas.    On the contrary, the\n\ngeneral purpose of the amendments was to facilitate prosecutions or,\n\nas the President's signing statement put it, to \"strengthen[] the\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fhand of prosecutors in drug smuggling cases.\" 32 Weekly Comp. Pres.\n\nDoc. 2212 (Oct. 28, 1996).2\n\n           One way in which the statute did this was to remove from\n\nthe jury and confide to the judge an issue that had nothing to do\n\nwith whether the defendant did possess drugs with an intent to\n\ndistribute.   To make the vessel's status an issue that could never\n\nbe the subject of an effective and binding guilty plea would greatly\n\ncomplicate proceedings rather than facilitate the enforcement of the\n\ndrug laws. It would mean in practical terms that the district judge\n\nwould have to try the issue every time in order to put it completely\n\nto rest.\n\n           Admittedly two circuits have treated the amendment as\n\nmaking vessel status an issue of district court subject matter\n\njurisdiction, although only one involved the forfeiture issue.   See\n\nUnited States v. Bustos-Usche, 273 F.3d 622, 626 (5th Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Tinoco, 304 F.3d 1088, 1105 (llth Cir. 2002).   But\n\nneither decision made a detailed examination of the problem; both\n\nleapt, we think too quickly, from the bare reference to jurisdiction\n\nto the assumption that Congress was talking about the subject matter\n\njurisdiction of the court.\n\n\n     2\n      Similarly, the House Conference Report stated: \"The\nConference substitute establishes new law enforcement provisions\nwhich expand the Government's prosecutorial effectiveness in drug\nsmuggling cases . . . .    Jurisdictional issues would always be\nissues of law to be decided by the trial judge, not issues of fact\nto be decided by the jury.\"     H.R. Conf. Rep. 104-854, at 142\n(1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4292, 4337.\n\n                                -8-\n\f           Certainly by providing for a judge to decide the vessel\n\nissue rather than jury, Congress has introduced a possible Sixth\n\nAmendment objection to the statute.         See United States v. Gaudin,\n\n515 U.S. 506, 512-16 (1995).       A defendant might claim, if the issue\n\nwere tried, that he was entitled to a jury trial on whether the boat\n\nwas a stateless vessel; on the other hand there are lots of issues\n\n(e.g., recusal of the judge, suppression of evidence, standing to\n\nassert a defense, constitutional challenge to a statute) normally\n\nnot tried to the jury.        In all events, Gonzalez' guilty plea made\n\nthe mode of trial here a moot issue.\n\n           To   sum    up,   the   unconditional   guilty   plea   forfeited\n\nGonzalez' claim that the speed boat was other than a stateless\n\nvessel.   Although the result would likely be the same even if we\n\nreached the merits (as the concurring opinion forcefully suggests)\n\nthe question whether such a claim can be forfeited is an important\n\nrecurring issue that needs to be resolved.          Having resolved it in\n\nfavor of forfeiture, it is enough to hold that Gonzalez had no more\n\nthan an arguable claim which he bargained away in favor of an\n\nagreed-upon sentence.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                      - Concurring opinion follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f              TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in the judgment).\n\nI respect the majority's effort to discern and follow the intent of\n\nCongress's 1996 amendment to the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act\n\n(\"MDLEA\").      However, I believe that a plain reading of the statute,\n\nsupported by rules of interpretation, legislative history and case\n\nlaw, clearly make the statelessness of a vessel a jurisdictional\n\nmatter that is not waived by an unconditional guilty plea.              I would\n\nreach the merits of González's claim, and concur in the judgment of\n\nthe court.\n\n                                I.     Background\n\n              On April 27, 1999, the captain of a sailing vessel\n\nrescued      González   and   Manuel    Polanco,    both   Dominican   Republic\n\nnationals, from a go-fast boat3 that was two-thirds submerged on the\n\nhigh seas approximately eighteen nautical miles southwest of the\n\nBritish Virgin Islands.          González requested a hammer from his\n\nrescuer and used it to attempt to make holes in the hull of the\n\nboat.       Noting this suspicious       behavior, the captain videotaped\n\nGonzález and reported the incident to the Coast Guard. González and\n\nPolanco claimed that two English citizens had also been aboard the\n\nvessel when it began to sink.\n\n               The Coast Guard arrived at the partially submerged vessel\n\nto conduct a search and rescue mission for the reportedly missing\n\n\n        3\n      This is a small boat, customized with additional engines and\nfuel tanks for added speed and range. Experience tells us that\nsuch boats play a large role in the drug trade.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fmen.4       No one was found in the immediate vicinity.       Additionally, a\n\nteam of three Coast Guardsmen approached the vessel and reported\n\nthat it was a go-fast vessel, with no identifying marks or numbers\n\non the bow.       No further evidence of registration or nationality was\n\nfound when Coast Guard personnel dove into the water to survey the\n\nvessel.       This initial inspection did not reveal any contraband.\n\n                Having   determined   that   the   vessel   was   a   hazard   to\n\nnavigation, the Coast Guard obtained permission to sink it.               After\n\nabout fifteen minutes of firing at the boat, Coast Guard personnel\n\nreturned to the vessel.        At this time, a hatch that had previously\n\nbeen inaccessible was open, and a package of cocaine was discovered.\n\nIn all, Coast Guard personnel confiscated           233 kilograms of cocaine\n\nbefore the vessel sank.\n\n                On April 30, 1999, González and Polanco were deported\n\nfrom the British Virgin Islands and were arrested, and subsequently\n\nindicted, upon arrival in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\n                On November 29, 1999, González and Polanco moved to\n\ndismiss their indictment for lack of jurisdiction.                The district\n\ncourt denied the motion, to which defendants timely objected.\n\nGonzález entered an unconditional guilty plea, from which he now\n\nappeals.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n      The record is unclear as to whether there actually were other\npassengers, but the search and rescue mission was abandoned later\nthat evening.\n\n                                      -11-\n\f                  II.    González's Jurisdictional Claim\n\nA.   Availability of Appeal\n\n             The MDLEA makes it a crime for any person on board \"a\n\nvessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States . . . to\n\nknowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or to possess\n\nwith intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.\"\n\n46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a) (emphasis added). A \"vessel subject to the\n\njurisdiction of the United States\" includes \"a vessel without\n\nnationality,\"     or     a     stateless     vessel.     46     U.S.C.   app.\n\n§ 1903(c)(1)(A).       González asserts that the vessel in this case was\n\nnot subject to the jurisdiction of the United States because it was\n\nnot a stateless vessel.\n\n             The majority holds that González's unconditional guilty\n\nplea   has    waived    this    challenge.      I   disagree.     González's\n\nunconditional guilty plea admitted only the elements of the charged\n\noffense.     See United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 570 (1989).        As\n\nsuch, he waived all appeals other than jurisdictional defects.           See\n\nTollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973); United States v.\n\nCordero, 42 F.3d 697, 698-99 (1st Cir. 1994).             A jurisdictional\n\ndefect \"calls into doubt a court's power to entertain a matter,\"\n\nCordero, 42 F.3d at 699, thus depriving the federal court of\n\njurisdiction.     A jurisdictional defect may be raised by the party\n\nor sua sponte by the court at any point in the litigation.                See\n\nFreytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 896-97 (1991) (Scalia, J.,\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fconcurring).      In this case, González argues that the district court\n\nlacked jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea because the United\n\nStates did not have jurisdiction over the vessel from which he was\n\nrescued.       The issue is therefore whether the requirement that the\n\nvessel be \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" is a\n\nfactual predicate for federal jurisdiction.                  If so, then González\n\nhas not waived this issue.           However, if it is a substantive element\n\nof the crime, then the issue has been waived.\n\n               Although determining whether an issue is jurisdictional\n\nand thus appealable is not always easy, here, the plain language of\n\nthe statute provides the answer.                  In 1996, Congress added the\n\nfollowing to the MDLEA:             \"Jurisdiction of the United States with\n\nrespect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any\n\noffense.       All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are\n\npreliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial\n\njudge.\"    46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(f).             The legislature is responsible\n\nfor identifying the elements of an offense, see Liparota v. United\n\nStates,     471    U.S.     419,    424    (1985),    and    it    clearly   removed\n\njurisdiction as an element of the MDLEA.                     See United States v.\n\nTinoco, No. 01-11012, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 18479, at *46 (11th Cir.\n\nSept.     4,    2002)     (\"The    statutory      language    of   the   MDLEA    now\n\nunambiguously      mandates        that   the    jurisdictional     requirement    be\n\ntreated only as a question of subject matter jurisdiction for the\n\ncourt to decide.\"). The text of the statute is unambiguous: Whether\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\for not the vessel was stateless, and therefore \"subject to the\n\njurisdiction of the United States,\" is not an element of the\n\noffense.    It    has   been   made    jurisdictional    and,   as    such,   is\n\nappealable.5\n\n           The word \"jurisdiction\" can be confusing, but there is\n\nsupport for the reading that jurisdiction over the vessel is a\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction determination.         First, while it is true\n\nthat the district courts have jurisdiction, \"exclusive of the courts\n\nof the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United\n\nStates,\"   18    U.S.C.   §    3231,    Congress   can   attach      additional\n\njurisdictional requirements in substantive criminal statutes, and\n\ndid so here.      Tinoco, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 18479, at *42 n.18.\n\nUnder the MDLEA, the district court’s jurisdiction extends only so\n\nfar as a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nSee 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903.            If a defendant is apprehended on a\n\nvessel not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, the\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Appellees rely heavily on Valencia v. United States, 923 F.2d\n917 (1st Cir. 1991), our only previous decision to discuss the\nissue of whether statelessness, specifically, is a jurisdictional\ndetermination. There, we noted that \"the issue is not free from\ndoubt,\" but opined that statelessness should not be appealable\nfollowing a valid guilty plea. Id. at 921. These comments are\nmere dicta, as our decision was based on other grounds. Id. at 922\n(vacating petitioner's guilty plea because it was not knowing and\nintelligent).   Of critical importance is the date of Valencia,\nwhich was decided five years before Congress amended the MDLEA,\nremoving jurisdiction as an element of the crime.        Therefore,\nValencia is neither controlling nor persuasive on this issue.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fMDLEA does not apply, and the defendant clearly may not be charged\n\nunder the MDLEA in district court.\n\n             This     differs    from   laws    where    Congress     attaches     a\n\n\"jurisdictional\" element to enable it to act under its enumerated\n\npowers.   For example, in many cases, Congress can only criminalize\n\nactivities     that    substantially      affect   interstate        commerce,    so\n\nstatutes often include a statement limiting their reach as such.\n\nSee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (criminalizing only conduct which\n\n\"obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any\n\narticle   or    commodity       in   commerce\").        In   those    cases,     the\n\njurisdictional      element     is   critical    to     Congress's    ability    to\n\nlegislate, and therefore is likely an element of the crime.                      In\n\ncontrast, Congress obtains authority to regulate drug trafficking\n\non the high seas under the \"protective principle\" of international\n\nlaw, which permits a nation \"'to assert jurisdiction over a person\n\nwhose conduct outside the nation's territory threatens the nation's\n\nsecurity.'\"    United States v. Cardales, 168 F.3d 548, 553 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 843 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1988)).   Congress invoked the protective principle in the MDLEA,\n\nfinding that \"trafficking in controlled substances aboard vessels\n\nis a serious international problem and is universally condemned\n\n[and] . . . presents a specific threat to the security . . . of the\n\nUnited States.\"       46 U.S.C. app. § 1902; accord Cardales, 168 F.3d\n\nat 553.   Because of this authority, the MDLEA does not require a\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fjurisdictional statement to place it within Congress's regulatory\n\npower.    The jurisdictional statement of the MDLEA is therefore not\n\nan essential element of the crime, as it may be in other statutes\n\nthat lack outside authority.\n\n            Second, the \"elements\" of a crime traditionally include\n\nthe actus reus, causation, and mens rea. See Black's Law Dictionary\n\n520 (6th ed. 1990).      Whether or not a vessel is \"subject to the\n\njurisdiction of the United States\" does not go to any of these\n\ntraditional elements.     For example, in Ford v. United States, 273\n\nU.S. 593 (1927), the defendants were charged with carrying liquor\n\nduring the Prohibition era on the high seas, in violation of a\n\ntreaty between the United States and Great Britain.            Id. at 601.\n\nThe defendants contended that they were not within the zone of the\n\ntreaty. Id. at 604. The Court held this was a jurisdictional issue\n\nfor the judge to decide because \"[t]he issue whether the ship was\n\nseized within the prescribed limit did not affect the question of\n\nthe defendants' guilt or innocence.       It only affected the right of\n\nthe court to hold their persons for trial.\" Id. at 606. Similarly,\n\nwhether a vessel is within the jurisdiction of the United States for\n\npurposes of the MDLEA is a proper question for the judge, as it\n\nbears upon the right of the court to entertain the claim.                 See\n\nTinoco,   2002   U.S.   App.   LEXIS   18479,   at   *59   (\"[T]he   §   1903\n\njurisdictional requirement is not an essential ingredient or an\n\nessential element of the MDLEA substantive offense\"); see also\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fUnited States v. Smith, 282 F.3d 758, 766 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding\n\nthat § 1903(f) empowers the court to determine \"whether the United\n\nStates    had    jurisdiction       over    the   place     where   the     vessel   was\n\nallegedly intercepted,\" while the jury determines \"whether the\n\nvessel was actually intercepted at that place\").\n\n             Third,    the    legislative         history     of    the   1996     MDLEA\n\namendments does not conflict with my interpretation.                      The limited\n\nlegislative history suggests that the 1996 amendments were made to\n\n\"expand    the    Government's       prosecutorial        effectiveness       in     drug\n\nsmuggling cases.\"         H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-854, at 142 (1996),\n\nreprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4294, 4337; accord Statement by\n\nPresident William J. Clinton, October 19, 1996, reprinted in 1996\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 4341, 4341 (stating that the amendments \"strengthen[]\n\nthe hand of prosecutors in drug smuggling cases,\" and clarify United\n\nStates     jurisdiction      over     vessels     in   international         waters.).\n\nRemoving    jurisdiction      as     an     element    of    the    crime    may     ease\n\nprosecution under the MDLEA.               For example, in Smith, 282 F.3d at\n\n758, the defendant appealed his conviction under the MDLEA because\n\nthe jury was not required to find that he was on a vessel subject\n\nto the jurisdiction of the United States.                   Id. at 765.      The court\n\nheld that the district court properly determined that the United\n\nStates had jurisdiction over the area where the vessel was found,\n\n\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fpursuant to § 1903(f).     Id. at 766.6      The issue was therefore\n\nproperly removed from the jury and not available as an avenue of\n\nappeal to the defendant.    So, while the amendment might allow a\n\ndefendant to attack the jurisdiction of the United States following\n\na guilty plea, at trial it eases prosecution by permitting the\n\nGovernment to establish, as a matter of law, that the area was\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n           Finally, I note that this is not the first time we have\n\nconsidered this issue, although we have never conclusively decided\n\nit.   See Cardales, 168 F.3d at 554 n.3 (noting that jurisdiction is\n\nno longer an element of the MDLEA); United States v. Guerrero, 114\n\nF.3d 332, 340 n.9 (1st Cir. 1997) (same).7   Also, two other circuits\n\n\n      6\n      The court further held that whether or not the vessel was\nfound in that location was a jury question.     Id.   Whether this\nfactual inquiry is a jury question is disputed, see Tinoco, 2002\nU.S. App. LEXIS 18479, at *61 n.22 (holding that the judge should\ndetermine both whether the area was within the jurisdiction of the\nUnited States and whether the vessel was discovered in that area),\nbut need not be resolved here.\n      7\n      Our decision in United States v. Valdez-Santana, 279 F.3d 143\n(1st Cir. 2002) is not at odds with my position.        In Valdez-\nSantana, appellants pled guilty under 21 U.S.C. § 952(a), which\nprohibits the importation of controlled substances. Id. at 145-\n46. The United States claimed authority to board appellants' boat\nas a \"hovering vessel,\" as defined by 19 U.S.C. § 1401(k)(1). Id.\nat 145.    Appellants argued that the boat was not a \"hovering\nvessel,\" and the evidence seized during this boarding was therefore\nobtained in violation of federal laws. Id. at 146. We held that\nthe issue of whether a vessel was a \"hovering vessel\" under 19\nU.S.C. § 1401(k)(1) is not appealable as a jurisdictional element,\nbecause it is an element of the offense. Id. The instant case is\ndifferent because the statute González was charged under applies\nonly to \"vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\"\na requirement which the statute specifically states is not an\n\n                                -18-\n\fwhich have considered this issue have reached the same result as I\n\nhave. See Tinoco, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 18479, at *46; United States\n\nv. Bustos-Useche, 273 F.3d 622, 626 (5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied,\n\n2002 U.S. LEXIS 3486 (May 13, 2002) (finding jurisdiction over a\n\nvessel under the MDLEA subject to appeal following a guilty plea).\n\nThe only case to the contrary is United States v. Ramos, No. 01-\n\n50356, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 20369, at *4 (9th Cir. Sept. 20, 2002),\n\nan unpublished, three paragraph opinion which lacks any analysis of\n\nthe issue.\n\n             To summarize, I believe that by the 1996 amendment,\n\nwhether or not a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates is not an element of the offense under the MDLEA, but a\n\nquestion of subject matter jurisdiction for the court to decide.\n\nIt goes to the power of the court to hear the case, and such a\n\njurisdictional determination cannot be waived by a guilty plea.\n\nB.   Statelessness Analysis\n\n             Since I believe the statelessness of the vessel is a\n\njurisdictional determination, I review González's challenge de novo.\n\nSeahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co., 295 F.3d\n\n68, 73 (1st Cir. 2002).       Reviewing this issue on appeal is not\n\ncomplicated, as the record contains all facts relevant to whether\n\nor not the vessel was stateless.\n\n\nelement of the offense. 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903 (a), (f). González\nhas therefore not waived his right to appeal the statelessness of\nthe vessel.\n\n                                 -19-\n\f           González is neither a citizen nor a resident alien of the\n\nUnited States, and the vessel involved was not a vessel of the\n\nUnited States. Thus, for González to be prosecuted under the MDLEA,\n\nthe vessel must be \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates.\"   46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a).   On our facts, his vessel could\n\nonly be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States if it is\n\n\"a vessel without nationality,\" also known as a stateless vessel.\n\n46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c).   According to the MDLEA,\n\n           a \"vessel without nationality\" includes:\n           (A) a vessel aboard which the master or person\n           in charge makes a claim of registry,8 which\n           claim is denied by the flag nation whose\n           registry is claimed;\n           (B) any vessel aboard which the master or\n           person in charge fails, upon request of an\n           officer of the United States empowered to\n           enforce applicable provisions of United States\n           law, to make a claim of nationality or\n           registry for that vessel; and\n           (C) a vessel aboard which the master or person\n           in charge makes a claim of registry and the\n           claimed   nation    of  registry    does   not\n           affirmatively and unequivocally assert that\n           the vessel is of its nationality.\n\n46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c)(2).   González argues that the requirement\n\nof statelessness can only be satisfied in one of two ways, neither\n\nof which was satisfied in this case: when the master makes a claim\n\nof registry which is denied (or not assented to) by the flag nation,\n\n\n\n     8\n      A claim of registry only includes documentation of a vessel's\nnationality, flying a nation's flag, or a verbal claim of\nnationality or registry by the master or person in charge.       46\nU.S.C. app. § 1903(c)(3). It is undisputed that there was no claim\nof registry made in this case.\n\n                                -20-\n\for when the master fails, upon request, to make a claim of registry.\n\nGonzález asserts that the vessel cannot be deemed \"stateless\"\n\nbecause the master did not make a claim of registry or fail to make\n\na claim of registry.\n\n           González's argument must fail.        The statute does not\n\nprovide an exhaustive list of the ways that a vessel can be\n\ndetermined to be stateless, but uses the word \"includes,\" and lists\n\nthree examples.    An expansive reading furthers the Congressional\n\nintent of reaching the widest range of drug smuggling cases possible\n\nunder international law.     If Congress had intended to provide an\n\nexclusive list, it could have used the phrase \"only includes,\" as\n\nit did in the following subsection.       46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c)(3);\n\nsee also United States v. Rosero, 42 F.3d 166, 170 (3d Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Valdez, 84 F. Supp. 2d 237, 238 (D.P.R. 1999).\n\n           Although I have not found any cases with facts similar to\n\nthe present case, that is, where no one was aboard the vessel when\n\nit was approached, I do not think it is a stretch to say that an\n\nunoccupied vessel completely lacking in evidence of registry or\n\nnationality   is   a   stateless   vessel.     See   L.   Oppenheim,   1\n\nInternational Law, 595-96 (H. Lauterpacht 8th ed. 1955) (noting that\n\na stateless vessel is one sailing under the flags of two or more\n\nstates, or under no flag at all).     The United States is a party to\n\nthe Convention on the High Seas, a codification of the customary\n\nlaws of the high seas, which requires all ships to sail under a\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fnation's flag.   Convention on the High Seas, Apr. 29, 1958, art. 6,\n\n13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82 (\"Ships shall sail under the flag\n\nof one State only . . . .\" (emphasis added)).9     González has not\n\nclaimed that the vessel is authorized to fly under the flag of any\n\nnation.   More importantly, at the time it was boarded by the Coast\n\nGuard, the vessel was not flying any flag.\n\n            González argues that the Coast Guard, knowing he was\n\nbeing treated in the British Virgin Islands, should have attempted\n\nto question him or Polanco about the vessel's nationality and/or\n\nregistry.    González insists that a vessel can only be deemed\n\nstateless following such an inquiry.      I disagree.   The MDLEA's\n\nexamples of when a vessel is without nationality all presume the\n\npresence of a master or person in charge.        See 46 U.S.C. app.\n\n§ 1903(c)(2).    Appellant, who had indisputably occupied a drug-\n\nridden boat that had no master or evidence of registry, should not\n\nhave immunity from seizure and federal prosecution simply because\n\nhe was rescued before the Coast Guard arrived.    Cf. United States\n\nv. Rosero, 42 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"Under [46 U.S.C. app.\n\n§ 1903(c)(2)(B)], if the master or person in charge fails, upon\n\nrequest, to make any claim of nationality or registry, the vessel\n\nmay be regarded as stateless.    By clear implication, we believe,\n\nthis provision applies when the master of a ship flees and leaves\n\n\n     9\n      Congress was aware of international law principles, and the\nConvention on the High Seas in particular, when enacting the MDLEA.\nSee 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(b)(2) and (c)(3)(A).\n\n                                -22-\n\fno one in charge . . . .\").         An unoccupied boat, completely lacking\n\nin identifying markers, is a stateless vessel.                       As such, the\n\ndistrict court properly asserted its jurisdiction in this case.\n\n                      III.   González's Other Claims\n\n             González challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and\n\nraises   a   Fourth   Amendment     challenge.        Because   these       are   not\n\njurisdictional attacks, they are clearly foreclosed by González's\n\nunconditional guilty plea.           Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973)\n\n(\"When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that\n\nhe is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may\n\nnot thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation\n\nof constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the\n\nguilty   plea.\");     see    also    Cordero,    42    F.3d     at    698    (\"[A]n\n\nunconditional guilty plea effectuates a waiver of any and all\n\nindependent non-jurisdictional lapses that may have marred the\n\ncase's progress up to that point . . . .\").\n\n                              IV.     Conclusion\n\n             I believe that González's only viable claim on appeal is\n\nwhether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to accept\n\nhis guilty plea.       I find that jurisdiction was present because\n\nGonzález was aboard a \"vessel without nationality\" for purposes of\n\nthe MDLEA, and therefore concur in the judgment of the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f",

In a nutshell, the issue is whether, by pleading guilty unconditionally to a drug trafficking charge (possession of drugs on a stateless vessel with intent to distribute) the defendant Jose Alberto Gonzalez forfeited any claim that the boat in question was a foreign (rather than a stateless) vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent facts, derived from the plea agreement, can be stated briefly. On April 27, 1999, Gonzalez and another individual were rescued from a speed boat that was two-thirds submerged on the high seas off the coast of the British Virgin Islands. Summoned by the rescuing vessel, the U.S. Coast Guard responded and on inspection found that the speed boat carried numerous bales of cocaine. Defendant and his companion were indicted for possessing the cocaine, with intent to distribute it, aboard \"a vessel without nationality\" in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statute makes possession of cocaine with intent to distribute a federal crime where possession occurs either on board a \"vessel of the United States\" or on board a \"vessel subject to jurisdiction of the United States\"; <i>id.</i> &#167; 1903(a); and the statute places \"a vessel without nationality\" (sometimes called a stateless vessel) in the latter category. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1903(c)(1)(A). \"Vessel without nationality\" is further defined to include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry, which claim is denied by the flag nation whose registry is claimed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) any vessel aboard which the master or person in charge fails, upon request of an officer of the United States empowered to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 1903(c)(2)(A)-(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the speed boat was not a \"vessel without nationality\" because, <i>inter alia,</i> no claim of registry was requested by an officer of the United States. The United States resisted the motion on various grounds directed to showing that the speed boat was a stateless vessel. In due course, a magistrate judge recommended denial of the motion and the district court agreed. Suffice it to say that the issue is complicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with an adverse ruling by the district court, Gonzalez negotiated a guilty plea. On February 23, 2001, a plea agreement was filed, with an agreed-upon sentence of 72 months, in which Gonzalez admitted the offense with which he was charged. In a change of plea proceeding, Gonzalez then expressly pled to the offense of possessing cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States with intent to distribute. Thereafter, Gonzalez was sentenced to 72 months. No issues were reserved for appeal. Nevertheless, after sentencing, Gonzalez did file an appeal asserting that the vessel was not in fact a stateless vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily a guilty plea, entered unconditionally &#8212; that is, without reserving an issue or issues for appeal &#8212; establishes guilt and forfeits all objections and defenses. <i>United States v. Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d 697, 699 (1st Cir.1994). There are a few exceptions to this principle. One applies where the claim on appeal is that the district court lacked <i>subject matter jurisdiction</i> over the case, that is to say, where the defendant says that the subject matter of the case falls outside the category of cases that the court is authorized to try. <i>E.g., Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 699; <i>United States v. Doyle,</i> 348 F.2d 715, 718-19 (2d Cir.1965) (Friendly, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One may ask why this exception exists when so many other objections and defenses in criminal cases, including constitutional issues and prior professions of innocence, are readily forfeited through a knowing and voluntary plea of guilty. The answer is that courts treat their responsibility to stay within their grant of authority as a matter of extreme importance. <i>United States Catholic Conf. v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc.,</i> 487 U.S. 72, 77, 108 S.Ct. 2268, 101 L.Ed.2d 69 (1988). In fact, a court is expected to raise the subject-matter jurisdiction objection on its own motion at any stage and even if no party objects. Fed R.Crim. P. 12(b)(2); Fed.R.Civ.P.12(h)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article III gives to the federal judicial branch authority &#8212; that is, subject matter jurisdiction &#8212; over all cases arising under the laws of the United States; and by statute Congress has given the federal district courts this authority over federal criminal cases in the first instance. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231 (2000). Conventionally, a federal criminal case is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court if the indictment charges, as the Gonzalez indictment certainly did, that the defendant committed a crime described in Title 18 or in one of the other statutes defining federal crimes. <i>See</i> 13B Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 3575, at 244-45 (2d ed.1984). In such a case subject matter jurisdiction, that is to say, authority to decide all other issues presented within the framework of the case, exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, unless Congress provided otherwise, subject matter jurisdiction existed in the present case <i>because</i> Gonzalez was charged in district court under section 1903, which is a federal criminal statute. By the same token, the stateless vessel issue was forfeited by an unconditional guilty plea &#8212; again, unless Congress provided otherwise. This was certainly this court's view prior to the amendment of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> And if a defendant did seek to preserve an issue, he might easily find the prosecutor refusing to bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Congress amended the Maritime Act. It did so among other things by expanding the definition of what constitutes a stateless vessel, 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(2)(C), and also by adding a provision reading in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jurisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(f). The key question is whether this terse provision converted the stateless vessel issue into one implicating the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court and prevented it from being forfeited in connection with a plea of guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the wording of the statute suggests such an intention. The term \"jurisdiction\" is notoriously malleable and is used in a variety of contexts (<i>e.g.,</i> personal jurisdiction) that have nothing whatever to do with the court's subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Hugi,</i> 164 F.3d at 380-81. In very general terms, \"jurisdiction\" means something akin to \"authority over.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 855 (7th ed.1999). Here, the word evidently refers to the substantive reach of the <i>statute</i> &#8212; applying to some vessels but not others &#8212; and not to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, Congress asserted its own authority to regulate drug trafficking on some ships but not all ships and, in this context, used the word \"jurisdiction\" loosely to describe its own assertion of authority to regulate; it does the same thing whenever it fixes an \"affects interstate commerce\" or \"involved a federally insured bank\" as a condition of the crime. <i>See</i> note 1 above. But such conditions have nothing whatever to do with the subject matter of the federal district court; they are routine questions as to the reach and application of a criminal statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does legislative history suggest that Congress had in mind the court's subject matter jurisdiction or that it meant to prevent a guilty plea from being given its normal effect. The legislative history does not refer to subject matter jurisdiction or reveal any purpose to limit guilty pleas. On the contrary, the general purpose of the amendments was to facilitate prosecutions or, as the President's signing statement put it, to \"strengthen[] the hand of prosecutors in drug smuggling cases.\" 32 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2212 (Oct. 28, 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way in which the statute did this was to remove from the jury and confide to the judge an issue that had nothing to do with whether the defendant did possess drugs with an intent to distribute. To make the vessel's status an issue that could never be the subject of an effective and binding guilty plea would greatly complicate proceedings rather than facilitate the enforcement of the drug laws. It would mean in practical terms that the district judge would have to try the issue every time in order to put it completely to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly two circuits have treated the amendment as making vessel status an issue of district court subject matter jurisdiction, although only one involved the forfeiture issue. <i>See United States v. Bustos-Useche,</i> 273 F.3d 622, 626 (5th Cir. 2001); <i>United States v. Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d 1088, 1105 (11th Cir.2002). But neither decision made a detailed examination of the problem; both leapt, we think too quickly, from the bare reference to jurisdiction to the assumption that Congress was talking about the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly by providing for a judge to decide the vessel issue rather than jury, Congress has introduced a possible Sixth Amendment objection to the statute. <i>See United States v. Gaudin,</i> 515 U.S. 506, 512-16, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995). A defendant might claim, if the issue were tried, that he was entitled to a jury trial on whether the boat was a stateless vessel; on the other hand there are lots of issues (<i>e.g.,</i> recusal of the judge, suppression of evidence, standing to assert a defense, constitutional challenge to a statute) normally not tried to the jury. In all events, Gonzalez' guilty plea made the mode of trial here a moot issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the unconditional guilty plea forfeited Gonzalez' claim that the speed boat was other than a stateless vessel. Although the result would likely be the same even if we reached the merits (as the concurring opinion forcefully suggests) the question whether such a claim can be forfeited is an important recurring issue that needs to be resolved. Having resolved it in favor of forfeiture, it is enough to hold that Gonzalez had no more than an arguable claim which he bargained away in favor of an agreed-upon sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Valencia v.

In accord with <i>Valencia</i> are numerous other cases holding that threshold or nexus elements may be forfeited through a guilty plea. <i>See Hugi v.

However, I believe that a plain reading of the statute, supported by rules of interpretation, legislative history and case law, clearly make the statelessness of a vessel a jurisdictional matter that is not waived by an unconditional guilty plea. I would reach the merits of Gonz&#225;lez's claim, and concur in the judgment of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 1999, the captain of a sailing vessel rescued Gonz&#225;lez and Manuel Polanco, both Dominican Republic nationals, from a go-fast boat<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that was two-thirds submerged on the high seas approximately eighteen nautical miles southwest of the British Virgin Islands. Gonz&#225;lez requested a hammer from his rescuer and used it to attempt to make holes in the hull of the boat. Noting this suspicious behavior, the captain videotaped Gonz&#225;lez and reported the incident to the Coast Guard. Gonz&#225;lez and Polanco claimed that two English citizens had also been aboard the vessel when it began to sink.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Coast Guard arrived at the partially submerged vessel to conduct a search and rescue mission for the reportedly missing men.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> No one was found in the immediate vicinity. Additionally, a team of three Coast Guardsmen approached the vessel and reported that it was a go-fast vessel, with no identifying marks or numbers on the bow. No further evidence of registration or nationality was found when Coast Guard personnel dove into the water to survey the vessel. This initial inspection did not reveal any contraband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the vessel was a hazard to navigation, the Coast Guard obtained permission to sink it. After about fifteen minutes of firing at the boat, Coast Guard personnel returned to the vessel. At this time, a hatch that had previously been inaccessible was open, and a package of cocaine was discovered. In all, Coast Guard personnel confiscated 233 kilograms of cocaine before the vessel sank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 30, 1999, Gonz&#225;lez and Polanco were deported from the British Virgin Islands and were arrested, and subsequently indicted, upon arrival in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 1999, Gonz&#225;lez and Polanco moved to dismiss their indictment for lack of jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion, to which defendants timely objected. Gonz&#225;lez entered an unconditional guilty plea, from which he now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Gonz&#225;lez's Jurisdictional Claim</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Availability of Appeal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MDLEA makes it a crime for any person on board \"<i>a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States</i> ... to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a) (emphasis added). A \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" includes \"a vessel without nationality,\" or a stateless vessel. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(A). Gonz&#225;lez asserts that the vessel in this case was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States because it was not a stateless vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority holds that Gonz&#225;lez's unconditional guilty plea has waived this challenge. I disagree. Gonz&#225;lez's unconditional guilty plea admitted only the elements of the charged offense. <i>See United States v. Broce,</i> 488 U.S. 563, 570, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989). As such, he waived all appeals other than jurisdictional defects. <i>See Tollett v. Henderson,</i> 411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <i>United States v. Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d 697, 698-99 (1st Cir. 1994). A jurisdictional defect \"calls into doubt a court's power to entertain a matter,\" <i>Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 699, thus depriving the federal court of jurisdiction. A jurisdictional defect may be raised by the party or sua sponte by the court at any point in the litigation. <i>See Freytag v. Commissioner,</i> 501 U.S. 868, 896-97, 111 S.Ct. 2631, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring). In this case, Gonz&#225;lez argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea because the United States did not have jurisdiction over the vessel from which he was rescued. The issue is therefore whether the requirement that the vessel be \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" is a factual predicate for federal jurisdiction. If so, then Gonz&#225;lez has not waived this issue. However, if it is a substantive element of the crime, then the issue has been waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although determining whether an issue is jurisdictional and thus appealable is not always easy, here, the plain language of the statute provides the answer. In 1996, Congress added the following to the MDLEA: \"Jurisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(f). The legislature is responsible for identifying the elements of an offense, <i>see Liparota v. United States,</i> 471 U.S. 419, 424, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985), and it clearly removed jurisdiction as an element of the MDLEA. <i>See United States v. Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d 1088, 1106 (11th Cir.2002) (\"The statutory language of the MDLEA now unambiguously mandates that the jurisdictional requirement be treated only as a question of subject matter jurisdiction for the court to decide.\"). The text of the statute is unambiguous: Whether or not the vessel was stateless, and therefore \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" is not an element of the offense. It has been made jurisdictional and, as such, is appealable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"jurisdiction\" can be confusing, but there is support for the reading that jurisdiction over the vessel is a subject matter jurisdiction determination. First, while it is true that the district courts have jurisdiction, \"exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231, Congress can attach additional jurisdictional requirements in substantive criminal statutes, and did so here. <i>Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1104 n. 18. Under the MDLEA, the district court's jurisdiction extends only so far as a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903. If a defendant is apprehended on a vessel not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, the MDLEA does not apply, and the defendant clearly may not be charged under the MDLEA in district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This differs from laws where Congress attaches a \"jurisdictional\" element to enable it to act under its enumerated powers. For example, in many cases, Congress can only criminalize activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, so statutes often include a statement limiting their reach as such. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a) (criminalizing only conduct which \"obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce\"). In those cases, the jurisdictional element is critical to Congress's ability to legislate, and therefore is likely an element of the crime. In contrast, Congress obtains authority to regulate drug trafficking on the high seas under the \"protective principle\" of international law, which permits a nation \"`to assert jurisdiction over a person whose conduct outside the nation's territory threatens the nation's security.'\" <i>United States v. Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d 548, 553 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 843 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1988)). Congress invoked the protective principle in the MDLEA, finding that \"trafficking in controlled substances aboard vessels is a serious international problem and is universally condemned [and] ... presents a specific threat to the security ... of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1902; <i>accord Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d at 553. Because of this authority, the MDLEA does not require a jurisdictional statement to place it within Congress's regulatory power. The jurisdictional statement of the MDLEA is therefore not an essential element of the crime, as it may be in other statutes that lack outside authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the \"elements\" of a crime traditionally include the actus reus, causation, and mens rea. <i>See</i> Black's Law Dictionary 520 (6th ed.1990). Whether or not a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" does not go to any of these traditional elements. For example, in <i>Ford v. United States,</i> 273 U.S. 593, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793 (1927), the defendants were charged with carrying liquor during the Prohibition era on the high seas, in violation of a treaty between the United States and Great Britain. <i>Id.</i> at 601, 47 S.Ct. 531. The defendants contended that they were not within the zone of the treaty. <i>Id.</i> at 604, 47 S.Ct. 531. The Court held this was a jurisdictional issue for the judge to decide because \"[t]he issue whether the ship was seized within the prescribed limit did not affect the question of the defendants' guilt or innocence. It only affected the right of the court to hold their persons for trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 606, 47 S.Ct. 531. Similarly, whether a vessel is within the jurisdiction of the United States for purposes of the MDLEA is a proper question for the judge, as it bears upon the right of the court to entertain the claim. <i>See Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1109 (\"[T]he &#167; 1903 jurisdictional requirement is not an essential ingredient or an essential element of the MDLEA substantive offense\"); <i>see also United States v. Smith,</i> 282 F.3d 758, 766 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that &#167; 1903(f) empowers the court to determine \"whether the United States had jurisdiction over the place where the vessel was allegedly intercepted,\" while the jury determines \"whether the vessel was actually intercepted at that place\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the legislative history of the 1996 MDLEA amendments does not conflict with my interpretation. The limited legislative history suggests that the 1996 amendments were made to \"expand the Government's prosecutorial effectiveness in drug smuggling cases.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-854, at 142 (1996), <i>reprinted in</i> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4292, 4337; <i>accord</i> Statement by President William J. Clinton, October 19, 1996, <i>reprinted in</i> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4341, 4341 (stating that the amendments \"strengthen[] the hand of prosecutors in drug smuggling cases,\" and clarify United States jurisdiction over vessels in international waters.). Removing jurisdiction as an element of the crime may ease prosecution under the MDLEA. For example, in <i>Smith,</i> 282 F.3d at 758, the defendant appealed his conviction under the MDLEA because the jury was not required to find that he was on a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. <i>Id.</i> at 765. The court held that the district court properly determined that the United States had jurisdiction over the area where the vessel was found, pursuant to &#167; 1903(f). <i>Id.</i> at 766.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The issue was therefore properly removed from the jury and not available as an avenue of appeal to the defendant. So, while the amendment might allow a defendant to attack the jurisdiction of the United States following a guilty plea, at trial it eases prosecution by permitting the Government to establish, as a matter of law, that the area was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I note that this is not the first time we have considered this issue, although we have never conclusively decided it. <i>See Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d at 554 n. 3 (noting that jurisdiction is no longer an element of the MDLEA); <i>United States v. Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d 332, 340 n. 9 (1st Cir. 1997) (same).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Also, two other circuits which have considered this issue have reached the same result as I have. <i>See Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1106; <i>United States v. Bustos-Useche,</i> 273 F.3d 622, 626 (5th Cir. 2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1947, 152 L.Ed.2d 850 (2002) (finding jurisdiction over a vessel under the MDLEA subject to appeal following a guilty plea). The only case to the contrary is <i>United States v. Ramos,</i> 47 Fed.Appx. 471, 472 (9th Cir.2002), an unpublished, three paragraph opinion which lacks any analysis of the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, I believe that by the 1996 amendment, whether or not a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is not an element of the offense under the MDLEA, but a question of subject matter jurisdiction for the court to decide. It goes to the power of the court to hear the case, and such a jurisdictional determination cannot be waived by a guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Statelessness Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since I believe the statelessness of the vessel is a jurisdictional determination, I review Gonz&#225;lez's challenge de novo. <i>Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,</i> 295 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir.2002). Reviewing this issue on appeal is not complicated, as the record contains all facts relevant to whether or not the vessel was stateless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez is neither a citizen nor a resident alien of the United States, and the vessel involved was not a vessel of the United States. Thus, for Gonz&#225;lez to be prosecuted under the MDLEA, the vessel must be \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a). On our facts, his vessel could only be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States if it is \"a vessel without nationality,\" also known as a stateless vessel. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c). According to the MDLEA,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a \"vessel without nationality\" includes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> which claim is denied by the flag nation whose registry is claimed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) any vessel aboard which the master or person in charge fails, upon request of an officer of the United States empowered to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(2). Gonz&#225;lez argues that the requirement of statelessness can <i>only</i> be satisfied in one of two ways, neither of which was satisfied in this case: when the master makes a claim of registry which is denied (or not assented to) by the flag nation, or when the master fails, upon request, to make a claim of registry. Gonz&#225;lez asserts that the vessel cannot be deemed \"stateless\" because the master did not make a claim of registry or fail to make a claim of registry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez's argument must fail. The statute does not provide an exhaustive list of the ways that a vessel can be determined to be stateless, but uses the word \"includes,\" and lists three examples. An expansive reading furthers the Congressional intent of reaching the widest range of drug smuggling cases possible under international law. If Congress had intended to provide an exclusive list, it could have used the phrase \"only includes,\" as it did in the following subsection. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(3); <i>see also United States v. Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d 166, 170 (3d Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Valdez,</i> 84 F.Supp.2d 237, 238 (D.P.R.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I have not found any cases with facts similar to the present case, that is, where no one was aboard the vessel when it was approached, I do not think it is a stretch to say that an unoccupied vessel completely lacking in evidence of registry or nationality is a stateless vessel. <i>See</i> L. Oppenheim, 1 International Law, 595-96 (H. Lauterpacht 8th ed.1955) (noting that a stateless vessel is one sailing under the flags of two or more states, or under no flag at all). The United States is a party to the Convention on the High Seas, a codification of the customary laws of the high seas, which requires all ships to sail under a nation's flag. Convention on the High Seas, Apr. 29, 1958, art. 6, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82 (\"Ships <i>shall</i> sail under the flag of one State only....\" (emphasis added)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Gonz&#225;lez has not claimed that the vessel is authorized to fly under the flag of any nation. More importantly, at the time it was boarded by the Coast Guard, the vessel was not flying <i>any</i> flag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez argues that the Coast Guard, knowing he was being treated in the British Virgin Islands, should have attempted to question him or Polanco about the vessel's nationality and/or registry. Gonz&#225;lez insists that a vessel can only be deemed stateless following such an inquiry. I disagree. The MDLEA's examples of when a vessel is without nationality all presume the presence of a master or person in charge. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(2). Appellant, who had indisputably occupied a drug-ridden boat that had no master or evidence of registry, should not have immunity from seizure and federal prosecution simply because he was rescued before the Coast Guard arrived. <i>Cf. United States v. Rosero,</i> 42 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.1994) (\"Under [46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(2)(B)], if the master or person in charge fails, upon request, to make any claim of nationality or registry, the vessel may be regarded as stateless. By clear implication, we believe, this provision applies when the master of a ship flees and leaves no one in charge....\"). An unoccupied boat, completely lacking in identifying markers, is a stateless vessel. As such, the district court properly asserted its jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Gonz&#225;lez's Other Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and raises a Fourth Amendment challenge. Because these are not jurisdictional attacks, they are clearly foreclosed by Gonz&#225;lez's unconditional guilty plea. <i>Henderson,</i> 411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (\"When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\"); <i>see also Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 698 (\"[A]n unconditional guilty plea effectuates a waiver of any and all independent non-jurisdictional lapses that may have marred the case's progress up to that point....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that Gonz&#225;lez's only viable claim on appeal is whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea. I find that jurisdiction was present because Gonz&#225;lez was aboard a \"vessel without nationality\" for purposes of the MDLEA, and therefore concur in the judgment of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This is a small boat, customized with additional engines and fuel tanks for added speed and range.

There, we noted that \"the issue is not free from doubt,\" but opined that statelessness should not be appealable following a valid guilty plea. <i>Id.</i> at 921. These comments are mere dicta, as our decision was based on other grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 922 (vacating petitioner's guilty plea because it was not knowing and intelligent). Of critical importance is the date of <i>Valencia,</i> which was decided five years before Congress amended the MDLEA, removing jurisdiction as an element of the crime. Therefore, <i>Valencia</i> is neither controlling nor persuasive on this issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The court further held that whether or not the vessel was found in that location was a jury question<i>Id.</i> Whether this factual inquiry is a jury question is disputed, <i>see Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1111 n. 22 (holding that the judge should determine both whether the area was within the jurisdiction of the United States and whether the vessel was discovered in that area), but need not be resolved here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Our decision in<i>United States v.

The United States claimed authority to board appellants' boat as a \"hovering vessel,\" as defined by 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(k)(1). <i>Id.</i> at 145. Appellants argued that the boat was not a \"hovering vessel,\" and the evidence seized during this boarding was therefore obtained in violation of federal laws. <i>Id.</i> at 146. We held that the issue of whether a vessel was a \"hovering vessel\" under 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(k)(1) is not appealable as a jurisdictional element, because it is an element of the offense. <i>Id.</i> The instant case is different because the statute Gonz&#225;lez was charged under applies only to \"vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" a requirement which the statute <i>specifically states</i> is not an element of the offense. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a), (f).

In a nutshell, the issue is whether, by pleading guilty unconditionally to a drug trafficking charge (possession of drugs on a stateless vessel with intent to distribute) the defendant Jose Alberto Gonzalez forfeited any claim that the boat in question was a foreign (rather than a stateless) vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent facts, derived from the plea agreement, can be stated briefly. On April 27, 1999, Gonzalez and another individual were rescued from a speed boat that was two-thirds submerged on the high seas off the coast of the British Virgin Islands. Summoned by the rescuing vessel, the U.S. Coast Guard responded and on inspection found that the speed boat carried numerous bales of cocaine. Defendant and his companion were indicted for possessing the cocaine, with intent to distribute it, aboard \"a vessel without nationality\" in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statute makes possession of cocaine with intent to distribute a federal crime where possession occurs either on board a \"vessel of the United States\" or on board a \"vessel subject to jurisdiction of the United States\"; <i>id.</i> &#167; 1903(a); and the statute places \"a vessel without nationality\" (sometimes called a stateless vessel) in the latter category. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1903(c)(1)(A). \"Vessel without nationality\" is further defined to include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry, which claim is denied by the flag nation whose registry is claimed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) any vessel aboard which the master or person in charge fails, upon request of an officer of the United States empowered to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 1903(c)(2)(A)-(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the speed boat was not a \"vessel without nationality\" because, <i>inter alia,</i> no claim of registry was requested by an officer of the United States. The United States resisted the motion on various grounds directed to showing that the speed boat was a stateless vessel. In due course, a magistrate judge recommended denial of the motion and the district court agreed. Suffice it to say that the issue is complicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with an adverse ruling by the district court, Gonzalez negotiated a guilty plea. On February 23, 2001, a plea agreement was filed, with an agreed-upon sentence of 72 months, in which Gonzalez admitted the offense with which he was charged. In a change of plea proceeding, Gonzalez then expressly pled to the offense of possessing cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States with intent to distribute. Thereafter, Gonzalez was sentenced to 72 months. No issues were reserved for appeal. Nevertheless, after sentencing, Gonzalez did file an appeal asserting that the vessel was not in fact a stateless vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily a guilty plea, entered unconditionally &#8212; that is, without reserving an issue or issues for appeal &#8212; establishes guilt and forfeits all objections and defenses. <i>United States v.

There are a few exceptions to this principle. One applies where the claim on appeal is that the district court lacked <i>subject matter jurisdiction</i> over the case, that is to say, where the defendant says that the subject matter of the case falls outside the category of cases that the court is authorized to try. <i>E.g., Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 699; <i>United States v.

The answer is that courts treat their responsibility to stay within their grant of authority as a matter of extreme importance. <i>United States Catholic Conf. v.

Conventionally, a federal criminal case is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court if the indictment charges, as the Gonzalez indictment certainly did, that the defendant committed a crime described in Title 18 or in one of the other statutes defining federal crimes. <i>See</i> 13B Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 3575, at 244-45 (2d ed.1984).

Here, the word evidently refers to the substantive reach of the <i>statute</i> &#8212; applying to some vessels but not others &#8212; and not to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, Congress asserted its own authority to regulate drug trafficking on some ships but not all ships and, in this context, used the word \"jurisdiction\" loosely to describe its own assertion of authority to regulate; it does the same thing whenever it fixes an \"affects interstate commerce\" or \"involved a federally insured bank\" as a condition of the crime. <i>See</i> note 1 above. But such conditions have nothing whatever to do with the subject matter of the federal district court; they are routine questions as to the reach and application of a criminal statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does legislative history suggest that Congress had in mind the court's subject matter jurisdiction or that it meant to prevent a guilty plea from being given its normal effect. The legislative history does not refer to subject matter jurisdiction or reveal any purpose to limit guilty pleas. On the contrary, the general purpose of the amendments was to facilitate prosecutions or, as the President's signing statement put it, to \"strengthen[] the hand of prosecutors in drug smuggling cases.\" 32 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2212 (Oct. 28, 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way in which the statute did this was to remove from the jury and confide to the judge an issue that had nothing to do with whether the defendant did possess drugs with an intent to distribute. To make the vessel's status an issue that could never be the subject of an effective and binding guilty plea would greatly complicate proceedings rather than facilitate the enforcement of the drug laws. It would mean in practical terms that the district judge would have to try the issue every time in order to put it completely to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly two circuits have treated the amendment as making vessel status an issue of district court subject matter jurisdiction, although only one involved the forfeiture issue. <i>See United States v. Bustos-Useche,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"25901\"><a href=\"/opinion/25901/united-states-v-bustos-useche/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 626 (5th Cir. 2001); <i>United States v.

But neither decision made a detailed examination of the problem; both leapt, we think too quickly, from the bare reference to jurisdiction to the assumption that Congress was talking about the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly by providing for a judge to decide the vessel issue rather than jury, Congress has introduced a possible Sixth Amendment objection to the statute. <i>See United States v.

A defendant might claim, if the issue were tried, that he was entitled to a jury trial on whether the boat was a stateless vessel; on the other hand there are lots of issues (<i>e.g.,</i> recusal of the judge, suppression of evidence, standing to assert a defense, constitutional challenge to a statute) normally not tried to the jury.

Although the result would likely be the same even if we reached the merits (as the concurring opinion forcefully suggests) the question whether such a claim can be forfeited is an important recurring issue that needs to be resolved. Having resolved it in favor of forfeiture, it is enough to hold that Gonzalez had no more than an arguable claim which he bargained away in favor of an agreed-upon sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Valencia v.

However, I believe that a plain reading of the statute, supported by rules of interpretation, legislative history and case law, clearly make the statelessness of a vessel a jurisdictional matter that is not waived by an unconditional guilty plea. I would reach the merits of Gonz&#225;lez's claim, and concur in the judgment of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 1999, the captain of a sailing vessel rescued Gonz&#225;lez and Manuel Polanco, both Dominican Republic nationals, from a go-fast boat<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that was two-thirds submerged on the high seas approximately eighteen nautical miles southwest of the British Virgin Islands. Gonz&#225;lez requested a hammer from his rescuer and used it to attempt to make holes in the hull of the boat. Noting this suspicious behavior, the captain videotaped Gonz&#225;lez and reported the incident to the Coast Guard. Gonz&#225;lez and Polanco claimed that two English citizens had also been aboard the vessel when it began to sink.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Coast Guard arrived at the partially submerged vessel to conduct a search and rescue mission for the reportedly missing men.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> No one was found in the immediate vicinity. Additionally, a team of three Coast Guardsmen approached the vessel and reported that it was a go-fast vessel, with no identifying marks or numbers on the bow. No further evidence of registration or nationality was found when Coast Guard personnel dove into the water to survey the vessel. This initial inspection did not reveal any contraband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the vessel was a hazard to navigation, the Coast Guard obtained permission to sink it. After about fifteen minutes of firing at the boat, Coast Guard personnel returned to the vessel. At this time, a hatch that had previously been inaccessible was open, and a package of cocaine was discovered. In all, Coast Guard personnel confiscated 233 kilograms of cocaine before the vessel sank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 30, 1999, Gonz&#225;lez and Polanco were deported from the British Virgin Islands and were arrested, and subsequently indicted, upon arrival in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 1999, Gonz&#225;lez and Polanco moved to dismiss their indictment for lack of jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion, to which defendants timely objected. Gonz&#225;lez entered an unconditional guilty plea, from which he now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

A \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" includes \"a vessel without nationality,\" or a stateless vessel. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(A). Gonz&#225;lez asserts that the vessel in this case was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States because it was not a stateless vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority holds that Gonz&#225;lez's unconditional guilty plea has waived this challenge. I disagree. Gonz&#225;lez's unconditional guilty plea admitted only the elements of the charged offense. <i>See United States v.

A jurisdictional defect \"calls into doubt a court's power to entertain a matter,\" <i>Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 699, thus depriving the federal court of jurisdiction. A jurisdictional defect may be raised by the party or sua sponte by the court at any point in the litigation. <i>See Freytag v. Commissioner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112644\"><a href=\"/opinion/112644/freytag-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span>, 896-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112644\"><a href=\"/opinion/112644/freytag-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span> (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring). In this case, Gonz&#225;lez argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea because the United States did not have jurisdiction over the vessel from which he was rescued. The issue is therefore whether the requirement that the vessel be \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" is a factual predicate for federal jurisdiction. If so, then Gonz&#225;lez has not waived this issue. However, if it is a substantive element of the crime, then the issue has been waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although determining whether an issue is jurisdictional and thus appealable is not always easy, here, the plain language of the statute provides the answer. In 1996, Congress added the following to the MDLEA: \"Jurisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(f). The legislature is responsible for identifying the elements of an offense, <i>see Liparota v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span> (1985), and it clearly removed jurisdiction as an element of the MDLEA. <i>See United States v. Tinoco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75998\"><a href=\"/opinion/75998/united-states-v-pedro-luis-christopher-tinoco/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span>, 1106 (11th Cir.2002) (\"The statutory language of the MDLEA now unambiguously mandates that the jurisdictional requirement be treated only as a question of subject matter jurisdiction for the court to decide.\"). The text of the statute is unambiguous: Whether or not the vessel was stateless, and therefore \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" is not an element of the offense. It has been made jurisdictional and, as such, is appealable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"jurisdiction\" can be confusing, but there is support for the reading that jurisdiction over the vessel is a subject matter jurisdiction determination. First, while it is true that the district courts have jurisdiction, \"exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231, Congress can attach additional jurisdictional requirements in substantive criminal statutes, and did so here. <i>Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1104 n. 18. Under the MDLEA, the district court's jurisdiction extends only so far as a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903. If a defendant is apprehended on a vessel not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, the MDLEA does not apply, and the defendant clearly may not be charged under the MDLEA in district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This differs from laws where Congress attaches a \"jurisdictional\" element to enable it to act under its enumerated powers. For example, in many cases, Congress can only criminalize activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, so statutes often include a statement limiting their reach as such. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a) (criminalizing only conduct which \"obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce\"). In those cases, the jurisdictional element is critical to Congress's ability to legislate, and therefore is likely an element of the crime. In contrast, Congress obtains authority to regulate drug trafficking on the high seas under the \"protective principle\" of international law, which permits a nation \"`to assert jurisdiction over a person whose conduct outside the nation's territory threatens the nation's security.'\" <i>United States v. Cardales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198339\"><a href=\"/opinion/198339/united-states-v-julio-cardales/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 553 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503769\"><a href=\"/opinion/503769/united-states-v-hernando-robinson-united-states-of-america-v-jorge/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1988)). Congress invoked the protective principle in the MDLEA, finding that \"trafficking in controlled substances aboard vessels is a serious international problem and is universally condemned [and] ... presents a specific threat to the security ... of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1902; <i>accord Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d at 553. Because of this authority, the MDLEA does not require a jurisdictional statement to place it within Congress's regulatory power. The jurisdictional statement of the MDLEA is therefore not an essential element of the crime, as it may be in other statutes that lack outside authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the \"elements\" of a crime traditionally include the actus reus, causation, and mens rea. <i>See</i> Black's Law Dictionary 520 (6th ed.1990). Whether or not a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" does not go to any of these traditional elements. For example, in <i>Ford v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620766\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620766/ford-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span>. The Court held this was a jurisdictional issue for the judge to decide because \"[t]he issue whether the ship was seized within the prescribed limit did not affect the question of the defendants' guilt or innocence.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span>. Similarly, whether a vessel is within the jurisdiction of the United States for purposes of the MDLEA is a proper question for the judge, as it bears upon the right of the court to entertain the claim. <i>See Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1109 (\"[T]he &#167; 1903 jurisdictional requirement is not an essential ingredient or an essential element of the MDLEA substantive offense\"); <i>see also United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776817\"><a href=\"/opinion/776817/united-states-v-michael-andrew-smith-aka-the-bird/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 766 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that &#167; 1903(f) empowers the court to determine \"whether the United States had jurisdiction over the place where the vessel was allegedly intercepted,\" while the jury determines \"whether the vessel was actually intercepted at that place\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the legislative history of the 1996 MDLEA amendments does not conflict with my interpretation. The limited legislative history suggests that the 1996 amendments were made to \"expand the Government's prosecutorial effectiveness in drug smuggling cases.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-854, at 142 (1996), <i>reprinted in</i> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4292, 4337; <i>accord</i> Statement by President William J. Clinton, October 19, 1996, <i>reprinted in</i> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4341, 4341 (stating that the amendments \"strengthen[] the hand of prosecutors in drug smuggling cases,\" and clarify United States jurisdiction over vessels in international waters.). Removing jurisdiction as an element of the crime may ease prosecution under the MDLEA. For example, in <i>Smith,</i> 282 F.3d at 758, the defendant appealed his conviction under the MDLEA because the jury was not required to find that he was on a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. <i>Id.</i> at 765. The court held that the district court properly determined that the United States had jurisdiction over the area where the vessel was found, pursuant to &#167; 1903(f). <i>Id.</i> at 766.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The issue was therefore properly removed from the jury and not available as an avenue of appeal to the defendant. So, while the amendment might allow a defendant to attack the jurisdiction of the United States following a guilty plea, at trial it eases prosecution by permitting the Government to establish, as a matter of law, that the area was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I note that this is not the first time we have considered this issue, although we have never conclusively decided it. <i>See Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d at 554 n. 3 (noting that jurisdiction is no longer an element of the MDLEA); <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></span> (2002) (finding jurisdiction over a vessel under the MDLEA subject to appeal following a guilty plea). The only case to the contrary is <i>United States v. Ramos,</i> 47 Fed.Appx. 471, 472 (9th Cir.2002), an unpublished, three paragraph opinion which lacks any analysis of the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, I believe that by the 1996 amendment, whether or not a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is not an element of the offense under the MDLEA, but a question of subject matter jurisdiction for the court to decide. It goes to the power of the court to hear the case, and such a jurisdictional determination cannot be waived by a guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Statelessness Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since I believe the statelessness of the vessel is a jurisdictional determination, I review Gonz&#225;lez's challenge de novo. <i>Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200019\"><a href=\"/opinion/200019/supplies-inc-v-pr-sun-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2002). Reviewing this issue on appeal is not complicated, as the record contains all facts relevant to whether or not the vessel was stateless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez is neither a citizen nor a resident alien of the United States, and the vessel involved was not a vessel of the United States. Thus, for Gonz&#225;lez to be prosecuted under the MDLEA, the vessel must be \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a). On our facts, his vessel could only be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States if it is \"a vessel without nationality,\" also known as a stateless vessel. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c). According to the MDLEA,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a \"vessel without nationality\" includes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> which claim is denied by the flag nation whose registry is claimed;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) any vessel aboard which the master or person in charge fails, upon request of an officer of the United States empowered to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(2). Gonz&#225;lez argues that the requirement of statelessness can <i>only</i> be satisfied in one of two ways, neither of which was satisfied in this case: when the master makes a claim of registry which is denied (or not assented to) by the flag nation, or when the master fails, upon request, to make a claim of registry. Gonz&#225;lez asserts that the vessel cannot be deemed \"stateless\" because the master did not make a claim of registry or fail to make a claim of registry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez's argument must fail. The statute does not provide an exhaustive list of the ways that a vessel can be determined to be stateless, but uses the word \"includes,\" and lists three examples. An expansive reading furthers the Congressional intent of reaching the widest range of drug smuggling cases possible under international law. If Congress had intended to provide an exclusive list, it could have used the phrase \"only includes,\" as it did in the following subsection. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(3); <i>see also United States v. Rosero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684088\"><a href=\"/opinion/684088/united-states-v-marco-antonio-copete-rosero-in-no-93-7600-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 170 (3d Cir.1994); <i>United States v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>, 238 (D.P.R.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I have not found any cases with facts similar to the present case, that is, where no one was aboard the vessel when it was approached, I do not think it is a stretch to say that an unoccupied vessel completely lacking in evidence of registry or nationality is a stateless vessel. <i>See</i> L. Oppenheim, 1 International Law, 595-96 (H. Lauterpacht 8th ed.1955) (noting that a stateless vessel is one sailing under the flags of two or more states, or under no flag at all). The United States is a party to the Convention on the High Seas, a codification of the customary laws of the high seas, which requires all ships to sail under a nation's flag. Convention on the High Seas, Apr. 29, 1958, art. 6, 13 U.S.T. 2312, 450 U.N.T.S. 82 (\"Ships <i>shall</i> sail under the flag of one State only....\" (emphasis added)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Gonz&#225;lez has not claimed that the vessel is authorized to fly under the flag of any nation. More importantly, at the time it was boarded by the Coast Guard, the vessel was not flying <i>any</i> flag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez argues that the Coast Guard, knowing he was being treated in the British Virgin Islands, should have attempted to question him or Polanco about the vessel's nationality and/or registry. Gonz&#225;lez insists that a vessel can only be deemed stateless following such an inquiry. I disagree. The MDLEA's examples of when a vessel is without nationality all presume the presence of a master or person in charge. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(2). Appellant, who had indisputably occupied a drug-ridden boat that had no master or evidence of registry, should not have immunity from seizure and federal prosecution simply because he was rescued before the Coast Guard arrived. <i>Cf. United States v. Rosero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684088\"><a href=\"/opinion/684088/united-states-v-marco-antonio-copete-rosero-in-no-93-7600-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 174 (3d Cir.1994) (\"Under [46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(2)(B)], if the master or person in charge fails, upon request, to make any claim of nationality or registry, the vessel may be regarded as stateless. By clear implication, we believe, this provision applies when the master of a ship flees and leaves no one in charge....\"). An unoccupied boat, completely lacking in identifying markers, is a stateless vessel. As such, the district court properly asserted its jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Gonz&#225;lez's Other Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and raises a Fourth Amendment challenge. Because these are not jurisdictional attacks, they are clearly foreclosed by Gonz&#225;lez's unconditional guilty plea. <i>Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108762\"><a href=\"/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 267, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108762\"><a href=\"/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span> (1973) (\"When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\"); <i>see also Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 698 (\"[A]n unconditional guilty plea effectuates a waiver of any and all independent non-jurisdictional lapses that may have marred the case's progress up to that point....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that Gonz&#225;lez's only viable claim on appeal is whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea. I find that jurisdiction was present because Gonz&#225;lez was aboard a \"vessel without nationality\" for purposes of the MDLEA, and therefore concur in the judgment of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This is a small boat, customized with additional engines and fuel tanks for added speed and range.

There, we noted that \"the issue is not free from doubt,\" but opined that statelessness should not be appealable following a valid guilty plea. <i>Id.</i> at 921. These comments are mere dicta, as our decision was based on other grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 922 (vacating petitioner's guilty plea because it was not knowing and intelligent). Of critical importance is the date of <i>Valencia,</i> which was decided five years before Congress amended the MDLEA, removing jurisdiction as an element of the crime. Therefore, <i>Valencia</i> is neither controlling nor persuasive on this issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The court further held that whether or not the vessel was found in that location was a jury question<i>Id.</i> Whether this factual inquiry is a jury question is disputed, <i>see Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1111 n. 22 (holding that the judge should determine both whether the area was within the jurisdiction of the United States and whether the vessel was discovered in that area), but need not be resolved here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Our decision in<i>United States v.

In <i>Valdez-Santana,</i> appellants pled guilty under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 952(a), which prohibits the importation of controlled substances. <i>Id.</i> at 145-46. The United States claimed authority to board appellants' boat as a \"hovering vessel,\" as defined by 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(k)(1). <i>Id.</i> at 145. Appellants argued that the boat was not a \"hovering vessel,\" and the evidence seized during this boarding was therefore obtained in violation of federal laws. <i>Id.</i> at 146. We held that the issue of whether a vessel was a \"hovering vessel\" under 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(k)(1) is not appealable as a jurisdictional element, because it is an element of the offense. <i>Id.</i> The instant case is different because the statute Gonz&#225;lez was charged under applies only to \"vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" a requirement which the statute <i>specifically states</i> is not an element of the offense. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a), (f). Gonz&#225;lez has therefore not waived his right to appeal the statelessness of the vessel.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> A claim of registry only includes documentation of a vessel's nationality, flying a nation's flag, or a verbal claim of nationality or registry by the master or person in charge. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(3).
