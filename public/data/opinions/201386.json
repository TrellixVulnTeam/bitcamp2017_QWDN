This case involves another episode\n\nin the ongoing saga of disputes between the owner of a mill and the\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).              An earlier\n\nepisode is recounted in United States v. Knott, 256 F.3d 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2001). This episode involves issues of qualified immunity for\n\nEPA inspectors who took wastewater samples.\n\n           James M. Knott, Sr., and Riverdale Mills Corporation\n\n(\"Riverdale\") sued two EPA inspectors, Justin Pimpare and Daniel\n\nGranz, alleging violations of the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment\n\nright to be free from unreasonable searches.1             The plaintiffs\n\nallege that the agents' sampling, without warrant or consent, of\n\nwastewater from underneath a manhole located on Riverdale land in\n\nNorthbridge, Massachusetts, on the afternoon of October 21, 1997,\n\nconstituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment.              The Fourth\n\nAmendment claim is pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents\n\nof Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).\n\n           Pimpare and Granz defended, inter alia, on grounds of\n\nqualified immunity; the district court denied their motion for\n\nsummary   judgment   on   grounds   of    qualified   immunity,    and   they\n\nproperly filed an interlocutory appeal.        We reverse because, under\n\nthe first prong of the qualified immunity test, Knott and Riverdale\n\n\n\n     1\n      Riverdale also sued a third EPA agent, Stephen Creavin: the\ndistrict court granted Creavin qualified immunity. Riverdale Mills\nCorp. v. United States, 337 F. Supp. 2d 247, 255-57 (D. Mass.\n2004). The plaintiffs do not appeal this determination.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fhave no reasonable expectation of privacy in this wastewater under\n\nthe circumstances shown in the record and therefore they have no\n\nFourth Amendment right.         Even were this ruling incorrect, we would\n\nreverse under the second prong, since the existence of such a\n\nreasonable expectation was not clearly established law.                     We remand\n\nfor entry of judgment for Pimpare and Granz on qualified immunity\n\ngrounds.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             Riverdale     manufactures         plastic-coated        steel       wire\n\nproducts.      Knott is the company's president, treasurer, chief\n\nexecutive     officer,     chairman      of    the    board,    and    controlling\n\nshareholder.      During manufacture of the product, a water-based\n\ncleaning process is used, and this cleaning process generates both\n\nacidic and alkaline wastewater.                Riverdale has a state permit\n\nallowing it to put this wastewater into the public sewer system so\n\nlong as proper treatment (neutralizing the acidic or alkaline\n\nqualities of the water, among other things) has been applied before\n\nthe wastewater reaches the public sewer.\n\n             In   order    to     meet    state      and   federal     clean-water\n\nrequirements, Riverdale has a pretreatment system within its plant\n\nwhich   is   supposed     to    treat    and   neutralize      the   acid    or   base\n\nqualities of the wastewater before it reaches the public sewer.\n\nAfter going through the pretreatment system, the wastewater flows\n\nthrough a meter loop where the quantity of wastewater is measured\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fto determine the sewer charges that Riverdale must pay to the town\n\nof Northbridge.       The wastewater then flows through a \"test pit\"\n\noutside of Riverdale's plant (\"Manhole 1\") toward the public\n\nsewer.2\n\n            Manhole 1 is roughly two feet deep and is covered by an\n\nunmarked 171-pound steel manhole cover.              It is located on a paved\n\nstreet, Riverdale Street, that runs alongside the mill building.\n\nPimpare noted in his affidavit that it \"appears to be a public\n\nstreet.\"     Riverdale alleges that it privately owns this street,\n\nwhich runs from a public road (Route 122) across Riverdale's\n\nproperty along the northern side of the mill.                 The road dead ends,\n\nhowever,    at   a   set    of    concrete     barriers   before    a    bridge   on\n\nRiverdale's property.             On the Route 122 entrance to Riverdale\n\nStreet, a sign reads \"Bridge Closed -- Local Traffic Only.\"                       The\n\nroad is actually on top of an earthen dam built by earlier owners\n\nof the plant and used to create a millpond opposite the Riverdale\n\nmill.     Riverdale has alleged in its complaint that Riverdale owns\n\nManhole     1;   there     is,    as   we   found   in    a   previous    opinion,\n\nconsiderable reasonable dispute about whether this is so.                         See\n\nKnott, 256 F.3d at 32.           However, since the case is before us at the\n\n\n     2\n      Manhole 1 is referred to as a \"test pit\" by both sides. There\nis evidence that Knott allowed regulators to test there in the\npast. A September 8, 1987 letter from Knott to the Chairman of the\nTown of Northbridge Board of Sewer Commissioners refers to a \"pit\"\nthat is apparently Manhole 1 and states that \"[t]his pit should be\nall that is needed to do whatever the Sewer Department might ever\nneed to do with respect\" to Riverdale's wastewater discharge.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fsummary judgment stage, we must construe all disputed facts in the\n\nrecord in favor of the non-movants, and thus, we treat the road as\n\nprivately owned by Riverdale.\n\n           The plant's wastewater flows past Manhole 1 through 300\n\nmore feet of pipe allegedly owned by Riverdale to Manhole 2, which\n\nis further down Riverdale Street. At Manhole 2, the Riverdale pipe\n\ncarrying wastewater from Manhole 1 enters Manhole 2 as a separate\n\nflow and merges with other flows within Manhole 2 (it is possible\n\nto sample Riverdale's wastewater separately at Manhole 2 before it\n\nmerges with the other flows).      Manhole 2 is indisputably publicly\n\nowned and is part of the public sewer system.            From there, the\n\nwastewater eventually flows to the Town of Northbridge treatment\n\nplant before being released into the Blackstone River.\n\n           On July 28, 1997, an anonymous tipster purporting to be\n\na Riverdale employee sent a letter to the EPA alleging that the\n\nplant's pretreatment system was not being run properly and thus\n\nthat the plant might be discharging wastewater with improper pH\n\nlevels and other problems.\n\n           The EPA decided to look into it.           On the morning of\n\nOctober, 21, 1997, the Agency sent Pimpare and Granz to the mill to\n\nperform an inspection.     The two inspectors did not obtain a search\n\nwarrant, and there is no claim of exigent circumstances. Inspector\n\nPimpare   first   met   with   Knott   and   two   high-level   employees;\n\nInspector Granz arrived sometime during that opening meeting.          At\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthat meeting, Pimpare did not assert any statutory authority to\n\nsearch Riverdale property but instead asked Knott to give his\n\nconsent to an inspection of the wastewater treatment facility,\n\nincluding tests of the wastewater.\n\n          Both the complaint and Knott's affidavit state that Knott\n\n\"explicitly\" told both Pimpare and Granz that they could sample\n\nRiverdale's wastewater and tour its plant only on the \"express\n\ncondition\" that they be accompanied at all times by Knott or\n\nRiverdale employees designated by Knott.   We accept the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Knott's consent was given only on condition\n\nthat the agents be so accompanied at all times.3     See Knott, 256\n\nF.3d at 23.   At some point during the day, Knott also told the\n\ninspectors that he owned the sewer lines under Manhole 1 and that\n\nthe public sewer did not begin until Manhole 2.      Knott told the\n\ninspectors this at a closing conference after all the sampling from\n\nManhole 1 had already been completed.   Id. at 24.    Knott alleges\n\nthat he also told the agents this fact at the opening meeting,\n\nbefore any sampling was done.\n\n          That morning, right after the meeting, Pimpare and Granz\n\nwere taken by Knott and the two Riverdale employees directly to\n\nManhole 1, where the inspectors took samples from approximately\n\n\n     3\n      The agents' brief concedes that Knott imposed this condition.\nPimpare stated in an affidavit, however, that he understood Knott\nmerely to be indicating that Knott and the Riverdale employees\nwould \"walk [Pimpare and Granz] around the premises,\" not that they\nneeded to be present for any inspecting to occur.\n\n                                -6-\n\f10:40 am to 11:15 am.             One sample was provided to a Riverdale\n\nemployee.         This   first    sampling,       then,    was    indisputably          in\n\nconformity     with      Fourth    Amendment       requirements,        if    any      are\n\napplicable, because it fell within the scope of consent.\n\n             The inspectors had earlier planned on setting up a 24-\n\nhour composite sample, but this was not done.                The reason why this\n\nwas not done is in some dispute.                Pimpare's affidavit states that\n\nit   was   infeasible      because   of    the     intermittent     nature        of   the\n\nwastewater discharges. He states that he told Knott this and \"made\n\nit   clear   to    Knott   that    Granz    and    [Pimpare]      would      be    taking\n\nadditional samples from the manhole throughout the day.\"                          He says\n\nthat Knott responded, \"Okay.\"              Knott gives a different account.\n\nHis affidavit states that Pimpare told him 24-hour composite\n\nsampling would be a bad idea because it would be unsafe to leave\n\nthe equipment in the street.         Knott says he offered the agents some\n\naccommodations to fix this problem, which were declined.                            Knott\n\nstates that he was never told that the inspectors were going to\n\nconduct periodic sampling throughout the day.\n\n             After    conducting     this       initial   round    of   sampling        at\n\nManhole 1, Pimpare states that he and Granz were taken on a tour of\n\nthe mill by Knott and the two employees.                  Pimpare states that at\n\nthe conclusion of this tour, he again told Knott and the two\n\nemployees that he would need to conduct more testing at Manhole 1;\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fhe asserts that Knott did not object.   Knott disputes that Pimpare\n\ntold him the agents would need to conduct more tests at Manhole 1.\n\n          In any event, Pimpare and Granz took samples from Manhole\n\n1 during two additional intervals that afternoon: between 12:40 pm\n\nand 1:15 pm, and between 3:00 pm and 3:04 pm.           These sampling\n\nevents are the crucial ones for purposes of this appeal.         Knott\n\nstates that Pimpare and Granz took these samples without him or any\n\nof his representatives present, and thus that this afternoon\n\nsampling exceeded the scope of his consent. The inspectors concede\n\nthat no Riverdale representatives were present for this sampling.\n\nThe sampling occurred, however, on the street in front of the plant\n\nand in full view of Riverdale employees.   Id. at 23.    A sample from\n\nthe 12:40 pm to 1:15 pm testing was given to one of the Riverdale\n\nemployees, who signed a chain of custody form.   Id. at 24.     Before\n\nleaving the area that day, the inspectors also took samples from\n\nManhole 2.\n\n          The data resulting from the October 21 sampling led the\n\nEPA to obtain an administrative search warrant and to search the\n\nfacility pursuant to this warrant on November 7, 1997.       A second,\n\ncriminal search warrant was executed on July 19, 1998. These later\n\nsearches are not at issue in this appeal; only the October 21, 1997\n\nafternoon sampling is relevant.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f                                    II.\n\n           Riverdale and Knott were indicted by a grand jury on\n\nAugust 12, 1998, based on evidence found in these searches, for two\n\ncounts of violating the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.,\n\nby discharging industrial waste into publicly owned treatment works\n\nin violation of a national pretreatment standard for pH levels.\n\nSee   33   U.S.C.   §§   1317(b)(1),      1319(c)(2)(A);    40   C.F.R.   §\n\n403.5(b)(2).     Knott and Riverdale moved to suppress evidence\n\nobtained during the October 21, 1997 and November 7, 1997 searches.\n\nThe district court granted the motion in part: it determined that\n\nthe afternoon sampling on October 21 had exceeded the scope of\n\nKnott's consent because neither Knott nor a designated Riverdale\n\nemployee had been present.    It thus suppressed the fruits of those\n\nafternoon searches but declined to suppress any evidence obtained\n\non November 7.   Knott, 256 F.3d at 25.      The government sought leave\n\nof court to dismiss the indictment without prejudice on April 23,\n\n1999, and such leave was granted on May 6, 1999.           Id.\n\n           The district court then granted a motion by Riverdale to\n\nrecover reasonable attorneys' fees under the Hyde Amendment on the\n\ngrounds that the prosecution against it had been vexatious. United\n\nStates v. Knott, 106 F. Supp. 174, 179-80 (D. Mass. 2000).            This\n\ncourt reversed.      Knott,   256   F.3d   at   36.   In   the   course   of\n\nconducting our inquiry, we noted that although the district court's\n\norder suppressing the results of the October 21 search was not\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fbefore us, the \"issue was close\" because of the \"factual disputes\"\n\nsurrounding the events of October 21 and the \"at the very least .\n\n. . ambiguous\" nature of the conditions imposed on Knott's consent\n\nto the sampling.    Id. at 31, 35-36.         We also noted that even if the\n\ninspectors exceeded the scope of their permission, this \"could just\n\nas well have rested on an honest mistake of fact or misapprehension\n\nof   the   authority     they   had    been   granted,\"   an    interpretation\n\nsupported by the fact that the inspectors provided a Riverdale\n\nemployee with a sample of the afternoon's testing.               Id. at 31.\n\n            Knott and Riverdale then brought this civil action in\n\nfederal district court for damages, based on alleged constitutional\n\nviolations, against the United States, Pimpare, Granz, and another\n\nEPA agent, Stephen Creavin.           On March 16, 2004, the district court\n\ndenied Pimpare's and Granz's motions for summary judgment on the\n\ngrounds of qualified immunity.            Riverdale Mills Corp. v. United\n\nStates, 337 F. Supp. 2d 247, 254-55 (D. Mass. 2004).                 The court\n\ncorrectly articulated the three-part test for qualified immunity\n\n(which we discuss later), looking first at whether the facts viewed\n\nmost   favorably    to    the   plaintiff     allege    the    violation   of   a\n\nconstitutional     right;   second      whether   the   constitutional     right\n\nallegedly violated was clearly established; and third whether the\n\ndefendants nonetheless deserve qualified immunity because their\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\factions were objectively reasonable. See Abreu-Guzman v. Ford, 241\n\nF.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir. 2001).4\n\n           On the first prong of the test, the district court held\n\nthat Riverdale's allegation that Pimpare and Granz exceeded the\n\nscope of Knott's consent to the October 21 search of wastewater in\n\nManhole 1, if true, constituted a violation of Riverdale's Fourth\n\nAmendment rights.    Riverdale Mills Corp., 337 F. Supp. 2d at 255.\n\nThe court found defendants' attempted analogy between wastewater\n\nand trash left on the curbside for public-waste disposal (which\n\nreceives   no   Fourth   Amendment    protection   because    there   is   no\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy) to be unpersuasive. Id. On the\n\nsecond prong, whether the law constituting the constitutional\n\nviolation was clearly established, the court simply noted that\n\n\"there can be no doubt that the law regarding the necessity for a\n\nsearch warrant is clear.\"      Id.     Finally, on the third prong, the\n\ncourt held that a reasonable officer would have understood that he\n\nwas exceeding the scope of Knott's consent.         Id.      The court also\n\n\n     4\n      In the same opinion, the district court granted Creavin, who\ndid not conduct sampling on October 21, qualified immunity on the\ngrounds that he did not violate Riverdale or Knott's Fourth or\nFifth Amendment rights. Riverdale Mills Corp., 337 F. Supp. 2d at\n255-57. Knott and Riverdale have not appealed this determination.\nThe court also allowed a Federal Tort Claims Act claim against the\nUnited States, on the basis of malicious prosecution, to survive\nsummary judgment. Id. at 252-54. This claim is also not before\nus. On November 1, 2004, after a bench trial, the district court\nissued an opinion and filed judgment for the United States on the\nmalicious prosecution claim.     Riverdale Mills Corp. v. United\nStates, Civ. A. No. 00-40137-NMG, 2004 WL 2711300 (D. Mass.\nNovember 1, 2004).\n\n                                     -11-\n\fnoted that a reasonable officer would have known that in the\n\nabsence    of     consent,   a   warrant   was   necessary    to    sample   the\n\nwastewater at Manhole 1.         The court stated this was shown by the\n\nfact that the agents sought consent in the first place on October\n\n21 and that they obtained a warrant before searching again on\n\nNovember 7.        Id.   Granz and Pimpare filed a timely interlocutory\n\nappeal of this denial of qualified immunity.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             We have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from a\n\ndenial of qualified immunity, where, as here, the denial rests on\n\npurely legal questions and not on disputed issues of fact.              Dwan v.\n\nCity of Boston, 329 F.3d 275, 278 (1st Cir. 2003).                 Review is de\n\nnovo.     Id.\n\n            Qualified immunity provides \"an entitlement not to stand\n\ntrial or face the other burdens of litigation.\"              Saucier v. Katz,\n\n533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001) (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S.\n\n511, 526 (1985)).        Qualified immunity is designed to protect most\n\npublic officials: \"it provides ample protection to all but the\n\nplainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"\n\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).\n\n                As most recently explained by Justice Breyer in his\n\nconcurring opinion in Brosseau v. Haugen, the test laid out in\n\nSaucier has two basic parts: \"Saucier requires lower courts to\n\ndecide (1) the constitutional question prior to deciding (2) the\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fqualified immunity question.\"       No. 03-1261, 2004 WL 2847251, at *5\n\n(Dec. 13, 2004) (Breyer, J., concurring). This Circuit has usually\n\nexplained qualified immunity as a three-stage test by subdividing\n\nSaucier's second stage into two distinct questions.5             See Abreu-\n\nGuzman, 241 F.3d at 73.      The three-part test asks first: \"Taken in\n\nthe light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the\n\nfacts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional\n\nright?\"   Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.        As to the second prong, we have\n\nasked \"whether the right was clearly established at the time of the\n\nalleged violation\" such that a reasonable officer would \"be on\n\nnotice    that   [his]   conduct   [was]    unlawful.\"   Suboh    v.   Dist.\n\nAttorney's Office, 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            On the third prong, we ask whether a \"reasonable officer,\n\nsimilarly situated, would understand that the challenged conduct\n\nviolated\" the clearly established right at issue.          Id.    It is not\n\nalways evident at the time an official takes an action that a\n\nclearly established right is involved.          For example, the factual\n\nsituation might be ambiguous or the application of the legal\n\nstandard to the precise facts at issue might be difficult; in\n\neither case the officer's actions may be objectively reasonable and\n\nshe may be entitled to qualified immunity.          See Saucier, 533 U.S.\n\nat 205; Suboh, 298 F.3d at 95-97.          In this last stage we consider\n\n\n     5\n     However, the second and third prongs have occasionally been\ncombined into one step in this circuit. See Tremblay v. McClellan,\n350 F.3d 195, 199-200 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                    -13-\n\fany material facts as long as they are undisputed.    See Suboh, 298\n\nF.3d at 90.\n\nThe First Prong\n\n          The Supreme Court has stated that courts should begin\n\nwith the first prong, that is, whether the facts as seen in the\n\nlight most favorable to the injured party show that the officers'\n\nconduct violated a constitutional right.    See Saucier, 533 U.S. at\n\n201; see also Bellville v. Town of Northboro, 375 F.3d 25, 30 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).    This first step is meant to aid in the \"law's\n\nelaboration from case to case.\"   Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.\n\n          The issue of how specific the first prong is meant to be\n\nis an issue that has troubled courts for some time.    See Tremblay\n\nv. McClellan, 350 F.3d 195, 199-200 (1st Cir. 2003); DiMeglio v.\n\nHaines, 45 F.3d 790, 795-97 (4th Cir. 1995) (explaining different\n\ntypes of inquiries that courts have performed at the first prong,\n\nalthough ultimately concluding -- pre-Saucier -- that this prong\n\nneed not be decided first).\n\n          The level of specificity depends on the stage of the\n\nproceedings at which a qualified immunity defense is brought.     A\n\nqualified immunity defense can, of course, be brought as a Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief can be granted.     In such a case the entire qualified\n\nimmunity analysis, including the first prong, must be based only on\n\nthe facts stated in the complaint itself.   See, e.g., Butler v. San\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fDiego Dist. Attorney's Office, 370 F.3d 956, 963-64 (9th Cir.\n\n2004).   At the 12(b)(6) stage, the question on the first prong is\n\nwhether,      using    all   of    the   well-pleaded   facts   stated   in   the\n\ncomplaint and viewing them in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff, the plaintiff has stated a claim for a violation of some\n\nconstitutional right.             The first prong inquiry at this 12(b)(6)\n\nstage is unlikely to be very specific, given that federal civil\n\npractice is based on notice pleading, where great specificity is\n\nnot required, Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc.,\n\n374 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 2004), and that there is no heightened\n\npleading requirement for civil rights cases, Leatherman v. Tarrant\n\nCounty Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163,\n\n168 (1993); Educadores Puertorriqueños en Acción v. Hernández, 367\n\nF.3d 61, 67-68 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              Where, as here, qualified immunity is brought at the\n\nsummary judgment stage, the inquiry on the first prong is somewhat\n\ndifferent. The language in Saucier is ambiguous on this point; the\n\ncase refers both to \"the facts alleged\" and to the \"parties'\n\nsubmissions.\" 533 U.S. at 201. But subsequent Supreme Court cases\n\nhave clarified, implicitly if not explicitly, that courts assessing\n\nthe   first    prong    at   summary     judgment   should   look   beyond    the\n\ncomplaint to the broader summary judgment record.                   See Groh v.\n\nRamirez, 124 S. Ct. 1284, 1293 (2004) (noting on the first prong\n\ndefendants' version of a statement made to the plaintiffs, but\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fpointing out that one plaintiff had filed an affidavit contesting\n\nthis account, and concluding that the summary judgment \"posture of\n\nthe case . . . obliges us to credit [plaintiff's] account\"); Hope\n\nv. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 734 n.1 (2002) (laying out the normal\n\nsummary judgment test before assessing even the first prong of the\n\nqualified immunity test).            The first prong inquiry will usually\n\ngain specificity at this summary judgment stage because of the\n\nability to determine then whether plaintiff's claim survives in\n\nlight of all the uncontested facts and any contested facts looked\n\nat in the plaintiff's favor, rather than just the allegations that\n\nappear on the face of the complaint.\n\n                We emphasize that the rule stating that the first prong\n\nmust be         performed   before   the   rest    of    the   qualified     immunity\n\nanalysis is not completely inflexible.                   The purpose of starting\n\nwith the first prong is to aid in law elaboration.                    Saucier itself\n\nsuggests that this law elaboration function will be well served\n\nonly       in   \"appropriate   cases,\"     533    U.S.    at   207,    and   we   have\n\npreviously noted that in some cases, such as where the claim\n\ndepends on a \"kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed,\" the\n\nlaw elaboration function is not well served and thus the Saucier\n\nrule may not strictly apply.             Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't,\n\n315 F.3d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2002).6                     Moreover, the level of\n\n\n       6\n     Indeed, three Supreme Court justices expressed concern in a\nrecent concurrence that a rigid application of the Saucier rule --\nthat the first prong must be decided before the rest of the\n\n                                         -16-\n\fspecificity   at   which   the   first   prong   is   analyzed   may   change\n\ndepending on a given inquiry's utility in further elaborating the\n\nlaw.\n\n           Nonetheless, it is clear that when performing the first\n\nprong of the analysis, it is generally inadequate to state a very\n\ngeneralized proposition such as whether it is a constitutional\n\nviolation for enforcement officers to perform an unreasonable\n\nsearch.    See Int'l Action Ctr. v. United States, 365 F.3d 20, 25\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2004) (\"It does no good to allege [on the first prong]\n\nthat police officers violated the right to free speech, and then\n\n[on the second prong to] conclude that the right to free speech has\n\nbeen clearly established in this country since 1791.\"); see also\n\nButera v. Dist. of Columbia, 235 F.3d 637, 646-47 (D.C. Cir. 2001).\n\nSuch an inquiry does nothing to further elaborate the law.\n\n           In this case, Granz and Pimpare have raised the qualified\n\nimmunity defense on summary judgment and not as a 12(b)(6) motion.\n\nWe take it as undisputed at this stage that the agents lacked a\n\nwarrant and that they exceeded the scope of Knott's consent.7\n\n\nqualified immunity inquiry -- was unwise because of its tendency to\nlead to wasted judicial resources and to constitutional decisions\nthat were insulated from judicial review.      These justices thus\nasked that the rule be reconsidered.       See Brosseau, 2004 WL\n2847251, at *5 (Breyer, J., concurring). However, the Saucier rule\nhas not been overruled by the Supreme Court.\n       7\n     Pimpare and Granz do not argue that Riverdale is a\n\"pervasively regulated business\" that can be searched for this\npurpose without a warrant. See New York v. Burger, 482 U.S. 691,\n699-703 (1987) (discussing the exception to the warrant requirement\n\n                                   -17-\n\fThese issues, however, go only to the \"reasonableness\" of any\n\nFourth Amendment \"search.\"\n\n            The threshold issue is whether there was a \"search\" at\n\nall for Fourth Amendment purposes.               Granz and Pimpare's actions\n\nwere only a \"search\" if Riverdale had a reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy in the wastewater underneath Manhole 1.                      See Kyllo v.\n\nUnited States, 533 U.S. 27, 31-33 (2001); see also Katz v. United\n\nStates, 389 U.S. 347, 351-52 (1961).               Under the Katz doctrine,\n\ncourts are required to differentiate between the question of\n\nwhether a search is reasonable and the antecedent question of\n\nwhether    there    is   a   Fourth    Amendment    \"search\"    at     all.   The\n\nantecedent question turns on, first, whether there is a subjective\n\nexpectation of privacy, and, second, whether society is willing to\n\nrecognize that expectation as objectively reasonable.                     We will\n\nassume Riverdale had a subjective expectation of privacy.                     That\n\nstill leaves the objective part of the test.               We ask whether any\n\nsubjective expectation of privacy that Riverdale might have had was\n\none which society was willing to accept as objectively reasonable.\n\n            The key issue for the first prong, then, is whether\n\nRiverdale, based on the undisputed material facts and any disputed\n\nmaterial    facts    looked    at     in   its   favor,   had   an    objectively\n\n\n\nfor inspection of commercial premises in \"closely regulated\"\nindustries).   We do not address this issue. Nonetheless, the\ncommercial context is relevant to the reasonableness of any\nexpectation of privacy.\n\n                                       -18-\n\freasonable expectation of privacy in the wastewater underneath\n\nManhole 1. More specifically, our inquiry is whether a company has\n\na reasonable expectation of privacy in industrial wastewater that\n\nis on a private street and underneath a 171-pound manhole cover but\n\n300 feet away from and flowing irrevocably into the public sewer\n\nsystem.\n\n              The EPA inspectors urge that we adopt a per se rule that\n\nthere is never a reasonable expectation of privacy in wastewater.\n\nThis we decline to do.       Judgments about reasonable expectations of\n\nprivacy are very fact-specific, and there may be fact situations\n\nwhere wastewater is entitled to constitutional protection. See Dow\n\nChem.   Co.    v.   United   States,   476    U.S.   227,   238   n.5    (1986)\n\n(reasonable     expectation    of   privacy    issues,   like     most   Fourth\n\nAmendment issues, \"must be decided on the facts of each case, not\n\nby extravagant generalizations\"); United States v. Burnette, 375\n\nF.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 2004). Factual variations might matter here:\n\nsuppose, for example, the wastewater is from a sewage holding tank\n\nattached to a mobile home used as a residence by a sole occupant,\n\nand a sample is searched and seized for evidence of drug use.\n\nBecause, in some situations, people have a reasonable expectation\n\nof privacy in their own bodily waste, see, e.g., Skinner v. Ry.\n\nLabor Executives Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989) (chemical analysis\n\nof urine sample is a \"search\" for Fourth Amendment purposes; tested\n\nsubject has a reasonable expectation of privacy), the character of\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fthe   matter   seized    (i.e.,    wastewater)      may    not     prove    to   be\n\ndispositive on the issue of reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n           The trash cases that the agents cite also do not support\n\ntheir per se rule.       These cases do not establish that trash can\n\nnever be protected for Fourth Amendment purposes; rather they hold\n\nonly that trash left in bags on or near the curb for collection by\n\na third party is unprotected.       See, e.g., California v. Greenwood,\n\n486 U.S. 35, 40-42 (1988); United States v. Scott, 975 F.2d 927,\n\n929 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 27\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n           Whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\ndepends on a variety of factors in addition to the character of the\n\nsubstance as wastewater.       The commercial context is relevant; this\n\nmay reduce Riverdale's expectation of privacy somewhat.                    See Dow\n\nChem. Co., 476 U.S. at 237-38; United States v. Beaudoin, 362 F.3d\n\n60, 65 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The   fact   that   Manhole     1   is   on   private    property     is\n\nrelevant, but that fact alone does not resolve the issue one way or\n\nthe   other.     The    contours   of    the   Fourth      Amendment       are   not\n\ncoterminous with property and trespass law.               See Oliver v. United\n\nStates, 466 U.S. 170, 183-84 (1984) (\"[I]n the case of open fields,\n\nthe general rights of property protected by the common law of\n\ntrespass have little or no relevance to the applicability of the\n\nFourth Amendment.\"); Katz, 389 U.S. at 351.                This case does not\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\finvolve   stationary   wastewater     in    holding     lagoons   entirely   on\n\nprivate property and shielded from public access, in which there\n\nmay be stronger expectations of privacy.                While it is of some\n\nsupport to Riverdale that this wastewater was found on private\n\nproperty, that support is limited.             It is also relevant that\n\nManhole 1 was located on a private road; this street is an area of\n\nRiverdale property that is most akin to an open field rather than\n\nto a more heavily protected type of area, like curtilage or the\n\ninterior of a home or business.       See, e.g., Dow Chem. Co., 476 U.S.\n\nat 235-37 (applying the open field and curtilage doctrines that had\n\ndeveloped in a residential context to an industrial setting).\n\n           Ultimately, we conclude that the controlling fact here is\n\nthat the wastewater at Manhole 1 is irretrievably flowing into the\n\npublic sewer, which is only 300 feet away.               The wastewater will\n\ninevitably reach Manhole 2, where the public sewer begins, after\n\nonly a short period of time, and once it reaches that point, any\n\nmember of the public can take a sample.            Wastewater at Manhole 1\n\nunder these circumstances is similar to trash left out on the curb\n\nfor pick-up by the trash collector, which enjoys no reasonable\n\nexpectation   of   privacy,   even    if    left   in    opaque   bags.      See\n\nGreenwood, 486 U.S. at 40-41; Scott, 975 F.2d at 928-29; Wilkinson,\n\n926 F.2d at 27.    In the case of trash left on the curb, there is no\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy both because a passerby can\n\nrummage through the trash while on the curb and because the trash\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fhas been intentionally left outside for a third-party garbage\n\ncollector, who in the near future will take the trash and be free\n\nto examine it.    Greenwood, 486 U.S. at 40-41.\n\n           It is true that a passerby cannot as easily sample\n\nwastewater while it is underneath Manhole 1 as he can pick through\n\ngarbage.   However, because the wastewater will assuredly enter the\n\npublic sewer and will flow there so quickly, the trash analogy\n\ncontrols even if it is not exact.        Plaintiffs make an implicit\n\nargument that they should be able to expect privacy up until the\n\npoint at which their wastewater can no longer be differentiated\n\nfrom the other sewage flows.     This argument misfires.       Riverdale\n\nhad no cut-off valve at Manhole 1, and thus no way to stop the\n\nirretrievable flow to the public sewer.     On these facts, Riverdale\n\nhas   abandoned   any   reasonable   expectation    of   privacy   in   the\n\nwastewater by allowing it to flow irretrievably into a place where\n\nit will be \"exposed . . . to the public.\"      Id. at 40.\n\n           Riverdale relies heavily -- and incorrectly -- on the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision in Commonwealth v.\n\nKrisco Corp., 653 N.E.2d 579 (Mass. 1995).         This case held that a\n\ncommercial proprietor had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a\n\ndumpster located in an adjacent alley that was gated at either end\n\nby the owner (thus completely out of sight of passersby) until the\n\ntrash collector actually arrived.       See id. at 584.     It is surely\n\nrelevant for Fourth Amendment purposes whether and to what extent\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fsomeone seeks to \"preserve\" something as \"private\" by keeping it\n\naway from public scrutiny.   Katz, 389 U.S. at 351.   But Manhole 1\n\ndoes not play the same role as the gates in Krisco.    The gates in\n\nKrisco reasonably told the public to stay out of the area around\n\nthe dumpster and even left it ignorant as to what was in that area;\n\nthey represented affirmative steps to exclude the public from the\n\narea.\n\n          By contrast, a manhole cover is normally intended less to\n\nkeep people out than to provide them access: the manhole cover,\n\neven if heavy, is one of the few points from which an underground\n\nsewer can be reached.   Moreover, a manhole cover, unlike a gate or\n\nfence, is not intended to leave passersby ignorant as to the\n\ncontents within.   Fences might hide any number of highly private\n\nobjects; manholes, however, generally give access only to a few\n\nsorts of things, most commonly a sewer (or underground wires or\n\npipes).   Placing otherwise unprotected wastewater underneath a\n\nmanhole cover does not create a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nwhere one did not exist before.   At any rate, the trash in Krisco,\n\nwhich was being held stationary behind the gates for pickup, is\n\nquite different than the wastewater here, which is not being held\n\nwithin Manhole 1 but rather is flowing through it on its way to the\n\npublic sewer.\n\n          We hold that based on the summary judgment record and\n\nusing the normal summary judgment standard, Riverdale's Fourth\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fAmendment rights were not violated and the agents are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity on the first prong.    We thus need not reach the\n\nother two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis; we address the\n\nsecond prong merely as an alternative ground for decision, should\n\nwe be wrong on the first prong.\n\nThe Second Prong\n\n          The second prong asks whether the constitutional right\n\nthat the officer allegedly violated was \"clearly established\" at\n\nthe time of the incident such that it would \"be clear to a\n\nreasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation\n\nhe confronted.\"    Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.   The core concern is one\n\nof notice to the officers on the particular facts that they faced.\n\nSee Suboh, 298 F.3d at 90.     The Supreme Court has made it quite\n\nclear that the second inquiry is a specific one; it is necessary to\n\nlook at the particular factual context.        See Brosseau, 2004 WL\n\n2847251, at *3; Hope, 536 U.S. at 739-41; Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201-\n\n02, 207-09 (The question under the second prong on the facts of the\n\ncase was \"whether [the] general prohibition against excessive force\n\nwas the source for clearly established law that was contravened in\n\nthe circumstances [the] officer faced.\"); Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S.\n\n603, 614-15 (1999) (\"It could plausibly be asserted that any\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment is 'clearly established,' since\n\nit is clearly established that the protections of the Fourth\n\nAmendment apply to the actions of police . . . .    However, [for the\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fsecond prong] the right allegedly violated must be defined at the\n\nappropriate level of specificity before a court can determine if it\n\nwas clearly established.\"); Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635,\n\n639-40 (1987).\n\n          This does not mean that the facts of prior cases must be\n\nmaterially similar, but merely that the prior case law must give\n\nthe officer reasonable notice that the specific conduct she is\n\nalleged to have committed in this litigation is unlawful.      See\n\nHope, 536 U.S. at 739-46; see also Suboh, 298 F.3d at 94 (second\n\nprong does not require that there have been another case \"exactly\n\non all fours with the facts of this case\").\n\n          The district court below erred by posing the second prong\n\nas whether \"the law regarding the necessity for a search warrant is\n\nclear.\"   Riverdale Mills Corp., 337 F. Supp. 2d at 255.   This is\n\ntoo abstract an inquiry, at either the first or the second prong.8\n\nThe proper question is whether an officer on October 21, 1997,\n\nshould have understood based on prior law that it was unlawful,\n\nwithout a warrant or consent, to take industrial wastewater from\n\nunderneath a manhole cover on a privately-owned street, but headed\n\nirretrievably to a public sewer 300 feet away.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Similarly, Riverdale argues that the right that needs to be\nclearly established is the constitutional requirement of a search\nwarrant for a commercial establishment, as set forth in See v.

An earlier episode is recounted in <i>United States v. Knott,</i> 256 F.3d 20 (1st Cir.2001). This episode involves issues of qualified immunity for EPA inspectors who took wastewater samples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James M. Knott, Sr., and Riverdale Mills Corporation (\"Riverdale\") sued two EPA inspectors, Justin Pimpare and Daniel Granz, alleging violations of the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The plaintiffs allege that the agents' sampling, without warrant or consent, of wastewater from underneath a manhole located on Riverdale land in Northbridge, Massachusetts, on the afternoon of October 21, 1997, constituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment claim is pursuant to <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimpare and Granz defended, inter alia, on grounds of qualified immunity; the district court denied their motion for summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity, and they properly filed an interlocutory appeal. We reverse because, under the first prong of the qualified immunity test, Knott and Riverdale have no reasonable expectation of privacy in this wastewater under the circumstances shown in the record and therefore they have no Fourth Amendment right. Even were this ruling incorrect, we would reverse under the second prong, since the existence of such a reasonable expectation was not clearly established law. We remand for entry of judgment for Pimpare and Granz on qualified immunity grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale manufactures plastic-coated steel wire products. Knott is the company's president, treasurer, chief executive officer, chairman of the board, and controlling shareholder. During manufacture of the product, a water-based cleaning process is used, and this cleaning process generates both acidic and alkaline wastewater. Riverdale has a state permit allowing it to put this wastewater into the public sewer system so long as proper treatment (neutralizing the acidic or alkaline qualities of the water, among other things) has been applied before the wastewater reaches the public sewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to meet state and federal clean-water requirements, Riverdale has a pretreatment system within its plant which is supposed to treat and neutralize the acid or base qualities of the wastewater before it reaches the public sewer. After going through the pretreatment system, the wastewater flows through a meter loop where the quantity of wastewater is measured to determine the sewer charges that Riverdale must pay to the town of Northbridge. The wastewater then flows through a \"test pit\" outside of Riverdale's plant (\"Manhole 1\") toward the public sewer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manhole 1 is roughly two feet deep and is covered by an unmarked 171-pound steel manhole cover. It is located on a paved street, Riverdale Street, that runs alongside the mill building. Pimpare noted in his affidavit that it \"appears to be a public street.\" Riverdale alleges that it privately owns this street, which runs from a public road (Route 122) across Riverdale's property along the northern side of the mill. The road dead ends, however, at a set of concrete barriers before a bridge on Riverdale's property. On the Route 122 entrance to Riverdale Street, a sign reads \"Bridge Closed &#8212; Local Traffic Only.\" The road is actually on top of an earthen dam built by earlier owners of the plant and used to create a millpond opposite the Riverdale mill. Riverdale has alleged in its complaint that Riverdale owns Manhole 1; there is, as we found in a previous opinion, considerable reasonable dispute about whether this is so. <i>See Knott,</i> 256 F.3d at 32. However, since the case is before us at the summary judgment stage, we must construe all disputed facts in the record in favor of the non-movants, and thus, we treat the road as privately owned by Riverdale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plant's wastewater flows past Manhole 1 through 300 more feet of pipe allegedly owned by Riverdale to Manhole 2, which is further down Riverdale Street. At Manhole 2, the Riverdale pipe carrying wastewater from Manhole 1 enters Manhole 2 as a separate flow and merges with other flows within Manhole 2 (it is possible to sample Riverdale's wastewater separately at Manhole 2 before it merges with the other flows). Manhole 2 is indisputably publicly owned and is part of the public sewer system. From there, the wastewater eventually flows to the Town of Northbridge treatment plant before being released into the Blackstone River.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 28, 1997, an anonymous tipster purporting to be a Riverdale employee sent a letter to the EPA alleging that the plant's pretreatment system was not being run properly and thus that the plant might be discharging wastewater with improper pH levels and other problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA decided to look into it. On the morning of October, 21, 1997, the Agency sent Pimpare and Granz to the mill to perform an inspection. The two inspectors did not obtain a search warrant, and there is no claim of exigent circumstances. Inspector Pimpare first met with Knott and two high-level employees; Inspector Granz arrived sometime during that opening meeting. At that meeting, Pimpare did not assert any statutory authority to search Riverdale property but instead asked Knott to give his consent to an inspection of the wastewater treatment facility, including tests of the wastewater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the complaint and Knott's affidavit state that Knott \"explicitly\" told both Pimpare and Granz that they could sample Riverdale's wastewater and tour its plant only on the \"express condition\" that they be accompanied at all times by Knott or Riverdale employees designated by Knott. We accept the district court's conclusion that Knott's consent was given only on condition that the agents be so accompanied at all times.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Knott,</i> 256 F.3d at 23. At some point during the day, Knott also told the inspectors that he owned the sewer lines under Manhole 1 and that the public sewer did not begin until Manhole 2. Knott told the inspectors this at a closing conference after all the sampling from Manhole 1 had already been completed. <i>Id.</i> at 24. Knott alleges that he also told the agents this fact at the opening meeting, before any sampling was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That morning, right after the meeting, Pimpare and Granz were taken by Knott and the two Riverdale employees directly to Manhole 1, where the inspectors took samples from approximately 10:40 am to 11:15 am. One sample was provided to a Riverdale employee. This first sampling, then, was indisputably in conformity with Fourth Amendment requirements, if any are applicable, because it fell within the scope of consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspectors had earlier planned on setting up a 24-hour composite sample, but this was not done. The reason why this was not done is in some dispute. Pimpare's affidavit states that it was infeasible because of the intermittent nature of the wastewater discharges. He states that he told Knott this and \"made it clear to Knott that Granz and [Pimpare] would be taking additional samples from the manhole throughout the day.\" He says that Knott responded, \"Okay.\" Knott gives a different account. His affidavit states that Pimpare told him 24-hour composite sampling would be a bad idea because it would be unsafe to leave the equipment in the street. Knott says he offered the agents some accommodations to fix this problem, which were declined. Knott states that he was never told that the inspectors were going to conduct periodic sampling throughout the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After conducting this initial round of sampling at Manhole 1, Pimpare states that he and Granz were taken on a tour of the mill by Knott and the two employees. Pimpare states that at the conclusion of this tour, he again told Knott and the two employees that he would need to conduct more testing at Manhole 1; he asserts that Knott did not object. Knott disputes that Pimpare told him the agents would need to conduct more tests at Manhole 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, Pimpare and Granz took samples from Manhole 1 during two additional intervals that afternoon: between 12:40 pm and 1:15 pm, and between 3:00 pm and 3:04 pm. These sampling events are the crucial ones for purposes of this appeal. Knott states that Pimpare and Granz took these samples without him or any of his representatives present, and thus that this afternoon sampling exceeded the scope of his consent. The inspectors concede that no Riverdale representatives were present for this sampling. The sampling occurred, however, on the street in front of the plant and in full view of Riverdale employees. <i>Id.</i> at 23. A sample from the 12:40 pm to 1:15 pm testing was given to one of the Riverdale employees, who signed a chain of custody form. <i>Id.</i> at 24. Before leaving the area that day, the inspectors also took samples from Manhole 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The data resulting from the October 21 sampling led the EPA to obtain an administrative search warrant and to search the facility pursuant to this warrant on November 7, 1997. A second, criminal search warrant was executed on July 19, 1998. These later searches are not at issue in this appeal; only the October 21, 1997 afternoon sampling is relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale and Knott were indicted by a grand jury on August 12, 1998, based on evidence found in these searches, for two counts of violating the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251 <i>et seq.,</i> by discharging industrial waste into publicly owned treatment works in violation of a national pretreatment standard for pH levels. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1317(b)(1), 1319(c)(2)(A); 40 C.F.R. &#167; 403.5(b)(2). Knott and Riverdale moved to suppress evidence obtained during the October 21, 1997 and November 7, 1997 searches. The district court granted the motion in part: it determined that the afternoon sampling on October 21 had exceeded the scope of Knott's consent because neither Knott nor a designated Riverdale employee had been present. It thus suppressed the fruits of those afternoon searches but declined to suppress any evidence obtained on November 7. <i>Knott,</i> 256 F.3d at 25. The government sought leave of court to dismiss the indictment without prejudice on April 23, 1999, and such leave was granted on May 6, 1999. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then granted a motion by Riverdale to recover reasonable attorneys' fees under the Hyde Amendment on the grounds that the prosecution against it had been vexatious. <i>United States v. Knott,</i> 106 F.Supp.2d 174, 179-80 (D.Mass.2000). This court reversed. <i>Knott,</i> 256 F.3d at 36. In the course of conducting our inquiry, we noted that although the district court's order suppressing the results of the October 21 search was not before us, the \"issue was close\" because of the \"factual disputes\" surrounding the events of October 21 and the \"at the very least ... ambiguous\" nature of the conditions imposed on Knott's consent to the sampling. <i>Id.</i> at 31, 35-36. We also noted that even if the inspectors exceeded the scope of their permission, this \"could just as well have rested on an honest mistake of fact or misapprehension of the authority they had been granted,\" an interpretation supported by the fact that the inspectors provided a Riverdale employee with a sample of the afternoon's testing. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knott and Riverdale then brought this civil action in federal district court for damages, based on alleged constitutional violations, against the United States, Pimpare, Granz, and another EPA agent, Stephen Creavin. On March 16, 2004, the district court denied Pimpare's and Granz's motions for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity. <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. United States,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d 247, 254-55 (D.Mass.2004). The court correctly articulated the three-part test for qualified immunity (which we discuss later), looking first at whether the facts viewed most favorably to the plaintiff allege the violation of a constitutional right; second whether the constitutional right allegedly violated was clearly established; and third whether the defendants nonetheless deserve qualified immunity because their actions were objectively reasonable. <i>See Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> 241 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first prong of the test, the district court held that Riverdale's allegation that Pimpare and Granz exceeded the scope of Knott's consent to the October 21 search of wastewater in Manhole 1, if true, constituted a violation of Riverdale's Fourth Amendment rights. <i>Riverdale Mills Corp.,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d at 255. The court found defendants' attempted analogy between wastewater and trash left on the curbside for public-waste disposal (which receives no Fourth Amendment protection because there is no reasonable expectation of privacy) to be unpersuasive. <i>Id.</i> On the second prong, whether the law constituting the constitutional violation was clearly established, the court simply noted that \"there can be no doubt that the law regarding the necessity for a search warrant is clear.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, on the third prong, the court held that a reasonable officer would have understood that he was exceeding the scope of Knott's consent. <i>Id.</i> The court also noted that a reasonable officer would have known that in the absence of consent, a warrant was necessary to sample the wastewater at Manhole 1. The court stated this was shown by the fact that the agents sought consent in the first place on October 21 and that they obtained a warrant before searching again on November 7. <i>Id.</i> Granz and Pimpare filed a timely interlocutory appeal of this denial of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity, where, as here, the denial rests on purely legal questions and not on disputed issues of fact. <i>Dwan v. City of Boston,</i> 329 F.3d 275, 278 (1st Cir.2003). Review is de novo. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity provides \"an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.\" <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (quoting <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)). Qualified immunity is designed to protect most public officials: \"it provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As most recently explained by Justice Breyer in his concurring opinion in <i>Brosseau v. Haugen,</i> the test laid out in <i>Saucier</i> has two basic parts: \"<i>Saucier</i> requires lower courts to decide (1) the constitutional question prior to deciding (2) the qualified immunity question.\" ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 596, 600-01, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2004) (Breyer, J., concurring). This Circuit has usually explained qualified immunity as a three-stage test by subdividing <i>Saucier's</i> second stage into two distinct questions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See Abreu-Guzman,</i> 241 F.3d at 73. The three-part test asks first: \"Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?\" <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. As to the second prong, we have asked \"whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation\" such that a reasonable officer would \"be on notice that [his] conduct [was] unlawful.\" <i>Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the third prong, we ask whether a \"reasonable officer, similarly situated, would understand that the challenged conduct violated\" the clearly established right at issue. <i>Id.</i> It is not always evident at the time an official takes an action that a clearly established right is involved. For example, the factual situation might be ambiguous or the application of the legal standard to the precise facts at issue might be difficult; in either case the officer's actions may be objectively reasonable and she may be entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151; <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 95-97. In this last stage we consider any material facts as long as they are undisputed. <i>See Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The First Prong</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has stated that courts should begin with the first prong, that is, whether the facts as seen in the light most favorable to the injured party show that the officers' conduct violated a constitutional right. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151; <i>see also Bellville v. Town of Northboro,</i> 375 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.2004). This first step is meant to aid in the \"law's elaboration from case to case.\" <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of how specific the first prong is meant to be is an issue that has troubled courts for some time. <i>See Tremblay v. McClellan,</i> 350 F.3d 195, 199-200 (1st Cir.2003); <i>DiMeglio v. Haines,</i> 45 F.3d 790, 795-97 (4th Cir.1995) (explaining different types of inquiries that courts have performed at the first prong, although ultimately concluding &#8212; pre-<i>Saucier</i> &#8212; that this prong need not be decided first).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The level of specificity depends on the stage of the proceedings at which a qualified immunity defense is brought. A qualified immunity defense can, of course, be brought as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In such a case the entire qualified immunity analysis, including the first prong, must be based only on the facts stated in the complaint itself. <i>See, e.g., Butler v. San Diego Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 370 F.3d 956, 963-64 (9th Cir.2004). At the 12(b)(6) stage, the question on the first prong is whether, using all of the well-pleaded facts stated in the complaint and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the plaintiff has stated a claim for a violation of some constitutional right. The first prong inquiry at this 12(b)(6) stage is unlikely to be very specific, given that federal civil practice is based on notice pleading, where great specificity is not required, <i>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.2004), and that there is no heightened pleading requirement for civil rights cases, <i>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit,</i> 507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993); <i>Educadores Puertorriquenos en Accion v. Hernandez,</i> 367 F.3d 61, 67-68 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, qualified immunity is brought at the summary judgment stage, the inquiry on the first prong is somewhat different. The language in <i>Saucier</i> is ambiguous on this point; the case refers both to \"the facts alleged\" and to the \"parties' submissions.\" 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. But subsequent Supreme Court cases have clarified, implicitly if not explicitly, that courts assessing the first prong at summary judgment should look beyond the complaint to the broader summary judgment record. <i>See Groh v. Ramirez,</i> 540 U.S. 551, 124 S.Ct. 1284, 1293, 157 L.Ed.2d 1068 (2004) (noting on the first prong defendants' version of a statement made to the plaintiffs, but pointing out that one plaintiff had filed an affidavit contesting this account, and concluding that the summary judgment \"posture of the case ... obliges us to credit [plaintiff's] account\"); <i>Hope v. Pelzer,</i> 536 U.S. 730, 734 n. 1, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (laying out the normal summary judgment test before assessing even the first prong of the qualified immunity test). The first prong inquiry will usually gain specificity at this summary judgment stage because of the ability to determine then whether plaintiff's claim survives in light of all the uncontested facts and any contested facts looked at in the plaintiff's favor, rather than just the allegations that appear on the face of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that the rule stating that the first prong must be performed before the rest of the qualified immunity analysis is not completely inflexible. The purpose of starting with the first prong is to aid in law elaboration. <i>Saucier</i> itself suggests that this law elaboration function will be well served only in \"appropriate cases,\" 533 U.S. at 207, 121 S.Ct. 2151, and we have previously noted that in some cases, such as where the claim depends on a \"kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed,\" the law elaboration function is not well served and thus the <i>Saucier</i> rule may not strictly apply. <i>Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't,</i> 315 F.3d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Moreover, the level of specificity at which the first prong is analyzed may change depending on a given inquiry's utility in further elaborating the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, it is clear that when performing the first prong of the analysis, it is generally inadequate to state a very generalized proposition such as whether it is a constitutional violation for enforcement officers to perform an unreasonable search. <i>See Int'l Action Ctr. v. United States,</i> 365 F.3d 20, 25 (D.C.Cir.2004) (\"It does no good to allege [on the first prong] that police officers violated the right to free speech, and then [on the second prong to] conclude that the right to free speech has been clearly established in this country since 1791.\"); <i>see also Butera v. Dist. of Columbia,</i> 235 F.3d 637, 646-47 (D.C.Cir.2001). Such an inquiry does nothing to further elaborate the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Granz and Pimpare have raised the qualified immunity defense on summary judgment and not as a 12(b)(6) motion. We take it as undisputed at this stage that the agents lacked a warrant and that they exceeded the scope of Knott's consent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> These issues, however, go only to the \"reasonableness\" of any Fourth Amendment \"search.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold issue is whether there was a \"search\" at all for Fourth Amendment purposes. Granz and Pimpare's actions were only a \"search\" if Riverdale had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the wastewater underneath Manhole 1. <i>See Kyllo v. United States,</i> 533 U.S. 27, 31-33, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001); <i>see also Katz v. United States,</i> 389 U.S. 347, 351-52, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1961). Under the <i>Katz</i> doctrine, courts are required to differentiate between the question of whether a search is reasonable and the antecedent question of whether there is a Fourth Amendment \"search\" at all. The antecedent question turns on, first, whether there is a subjective expectation of privacy, and, second, whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable. We will assume Riverdale had a subjective expectation of privacy. That still leaves the objective part of the test. We ask whether any subjective expectation of privacy that Riverdale might have had was one which society was willing to accept as objectively reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key issue for the first prong, then, is whether Riverdale, based on the undisputed material facts and any disputed material facts looked at in its favor, had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the wastewater underneath Manhole 1. More specifically, our inquiry is whether a company has a reasonable expectation of privacy in industrial wastewater that is on a private street and underneath a 171-pound manhole cover but 300 feet away from and flowing irrevocably into the public sewer system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA inspectors urge that we adopt a per se rule that there is never a reasonable expectation of privacy in wastewater. This we decline to do. Judgments about reasonable expectations of privacy are very fact-specific, and there may be fact situations where wastewater is entitled to constitutional protection. <i>See Dow Chem. Co. v. United States,</i> 476 U.S. 227, 238 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 1819, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986) (reasonable expectation of privacy issues, like most Fourth Amendment issues, \"must be decided on the facts of each case, not by extravagant generalizations\"); <i>United States v. Burnette,</i> 375 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.2004). Factual variations might matter here: suppose, for example, the wastewater is from a sewage holding tank attached to a mobile home used as a residence by a sole occupant, and a sample is searched and seized for evidence of drug use. Because, in some situations, people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their own bodily waste, <i>see, e.g., Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives Ass'n,</i> 489 U.S. 602, 617, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989) (chemical analysis of urine sample is a \"search\" for Fourth Amendment purposes; tested subject has a reasonable expectation of privacy), the character of the matter seized (i.e., wastewater) may not prove to be dispositive on the issue of reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trash cases that the agents cite also do not support their per se rule. These cases do not establish that trash can never be protected for Fourth Amendment purposes; rather they hold only that trash left in bags on or near the curb for collection by a third party is unprotected. <i>See, e.g., California v. Greenwood,</i> 486 U.S. 35, 40-42, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988); <i>United States v. Scott,</i> 975 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Wilkinson,</i> 926 F.2d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy depends on a variety of factors in addition to the character of the substance as wastewater. The commercial context is relevant; this may reduce Riverdale's expectation of privacy somewhat. <i>See Dow Chem. Co.,</i> 476 U.S. at 237-38, 106 S.Ct. 1819; <i>United States v. Beaudoin,</i> 362 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Manhole 1 is on private property is relevant, but that fact alone does not resolve the issue one way or the other. The contours of the Fourth Amendment are not coterminous with property and trespass law. <i>See Oliver v. United States,</i> 466 U.S. 170, 183-84, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (\"[I]n the case of open fields, the general rights of property protected by the common law of trespass have little or no relevance to the applicability of the Fourth Amendment.\"); <i>Katz,</i> 389 U.S. at 351, 88 S.Ct. 507. This case does not involve stationary wastewater in holding lagoons entirely on private property and shielded from public access, in which there may be stronger expectations of privacy. While it is of some support to Riverdale that this wastewater was found on private property, that support is limited. It is also relevant that Manhole 1 was located on a private <i>road;</i> this street is an area of Riverdale property that is most akin to an open field rather than to a more heavily protected type of area, like curtilage or the interior of a home or business. <i>See, e.g., Dow Chem. Co.,</i> 476 U.S. at 235-37, 106 S.Ct. 1819 (applying the open field and curtilage doctrines that had developed in a residential context to an industrial setting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we conclude that the controlling fact here is that the wastewater at Manhole 1 is <i>irretrievably</i> flowing into the public sewer, which is only 300 feet away. The wastewater will inevitably reach Manhole 2, where the public sewer begins, after only a short period of time, and once it reaches that point, any member of the public can take a sample. Wastewater at Manhole 1 under these circumstances is similar to trash left out on the curb for pick-up by the trash collector, which enjoys no reasonable expectation of privacy, even if left in opaque bags. <i>See Greenwood,</i> 486 U.S. at 40-41, 108 S.Ct. 1625; <i>Scott,</i> 975 F.2d at 928-29; <i>Wilkinson,</i> 926 F.2d at 27. In the case of trash left on the curb, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy both because a passerby can rummage through the trash while on the curb and because the trash has been intentionally left outside for a third-party garbage collector, who in the near future will take the trash and be free to examine it. <i>Greenwood,</i> 486 U.S. at 40-41, 108 S.Ct. 1625.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that a passerby cannot as easily sample wastewater while it is underneath Manhole 1 as he can pick through garbage. However, because the wastewater will assuredly enter the public sewer and will flow there so quickly, the trash analogy controls even if it is not exact. Plaintiffs make an implicit argument that they should be able to expect privacy up until the point at which their wastewater can no longer be differentiated from the other sewage flows. This argument misfires. Riverdale had no cut-off valve at Manhole 1, and thus no way to stop the irretrievable flow to the public sewer. On these facts, Riverdale has abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy in the wastewater by allowing it to flow irretrievably into a place where it will be \"exposed ... to the public.\" <i>Id.</i> at 40, 108 S.Ct. 1625.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale relies heavily &#8212; and incorrectly &#8212; on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision in <i>Commonwealth v.</i> <i>Krisco Corp.,</i> 421 Mass. 37, 653 N.E.2d 579 (1995). This case held that a commercial proprietor had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a dumpster located in an adjacent alley that was gated at either end by the owner (thus completely out of sight of passersby) until the trash collector actually arrived. <i>See id.</i> at 584. It is surely relevant for Fourth Amendment purposes whether and to what extent someone seeks to \"preserve\" something as \"private\" by keeping it away from public scrutiny. <i>Katz,</i> 389 U.S. at 351, 88 S.Ct. 507. But Manhole 1 does not play the same role as the gates in <i>Krisco.</i> The gates in <i>Krisco</i> reasonably told the public to stay out of the area around the dumpster and even left it ignorant as to what was in that area; they represented affirmative steps to exclude the public from the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, a manhole cover is normally intended less to keep people out than to provide them access: the manhole cover, even if heavy, is one of the few points from which an underground sewer can be reached. Moreover, a manhole cover, unlike a gate or fence, is not intended to leave passersby ignorant as to the contents within. Fences might hide any number of highly private objects; manholes, however, generally give access only to a few sorts of things, most commonly a sewer (or underground wires or pipes). Placing otherwise unprotected wastewater underneath a manhole cover does not create a reasonable expectation of privacy where one did not exist before. At any rate, the trash in <i>Krisco,</i> which was being held stationary behind the gates for pickup, is quite different than the wastewater here, which is not being held within Manhole 1 but rather is flowing through it on its way to the public sewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that based on the summary judgment record and using the normal summary judgment standard, Riverdale's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated and the agents are entitled to qualified immunity on the first prong. We thus need not reach the other two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis; we address the second prong merely as an alternative ground for decision, should we be wrong on the first prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The Second Prong</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong asks whether the constitutional right that the officer allegedly violated was \"clearly established\" at the time of the incident such that it would \"be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\" <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151. The core concern is one of notice to the officers on the particular facts that they faced. <i>See Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90. The Supreme Court has made it quite clear that the second inquiry is a specific one; it is necessary to look at the particular factual context. <i>See Brosseau,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 599-600; <i>Hope,</i> 536 U.S. at 739-41, 122 S.Ct. 2508; <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201-02, 207-09, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (The question under the second prong on the facts of the case was \"whether [the] general prohibition against excessive force was the source for clearly established law that was contravened in the circumstances [the] officer faced.\"); <i>Wilson v.

This is too abstract an inquiry, at either the first or the second prong.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The proper question is whether an officer on October 21, 1997, should have understood based on prior law that it was unlawful, without a warrant or consent, to take industrial wastewater from underneath a manhole cover on a privately-owned street, but headed irretrievably to a public sewer 300 feet away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law did not clearly establish any such Fourth Amendment right. We have found no court decisions holding that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in industrial wastewater on its way to a public sewer. The law goes the other way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The most obvious analogy, as we have noted, is between solid waste left out for the trash collector, for which there is usually no reasonable expectation of privacy, and liquid waste flowing into the public sewer system. <i>See Greenwood,</i> 486 U.S. at 40-42, 108 S.Ct. 1625; <i>Scott,</i> 975 F.2d at 929; <i>Wilkinson,</i> 926 F.2d at 27; <i>see also United States v.

Even if Riverdale had a reasonable expectation of privacy in its wastewater at Manhole 1, prior law would not have put an officer on notice that producers of industrial wastewater located underneath a manhole on a private street but headed for a public sewer 300 feet away enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy in the wastewater.

Bureau of Narcotics,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We reverse because, under the first prong of the qualified immunity test, Knott and Riverdale have no reasonable expectation of privacy in this wastewater under the circumstances shown in the record and therefore they have no Fourth Amendment right. Even were this ruling incorrect, we would reverse under the second prong, since the existence of such a reasonable expectation was not clearly established law. We remand for entry of judgment for Pimpare and Granz on qualified immunity grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale manufactures plastic-coated steel wire products. Knott is the company's president, treasurer, chief executive officer, chairman of the board, and controlling shareholder. During manufacture of the product, a water-based cleaning process is used, and this cleaning process generates both acidic and alkaline wastewater. Riverdale has a state permit allowing it to put this wastewater into the public sewer system so long as proper treatment (neutralizing the acidic or alkaline qualities of the water, among other things) has been applied before the wastewater reaches the public sewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to meet state and federal clean-water requirements, Riverdale has a pretreatment system within its plant which is supposed to treat and neutralize the acid or base qualities of the wastewater before it reaches the public sewer. After going through the pretreatment system, the wastewater flows through a meter loop where the quantity of wastewater is measured to determine the sewer charges that Riverdale must pay to the town of Northbridge. The wastewater then flows through a \"test pit\" outside of Riverdale's plant (\"Manhole 1\") toward the public sewer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manhole 1 is roughly two feet deep and is covered by an unmarked 171-pound steel manhole cover. It is located on a paved street, Riverdale Street, that runs alongside the mill building. Pimpare noted in his affidavit that it \"appears to be a public street.\" Riverdale alleges that it privately owns this street, which runs from a public road (Route 122) across Riverdale's property along the northern side of the mill. The road dead ends, however, at a set of concrete barriers before a bridge on Riverdale's property. On the Route 122 entrance to Riverdale Street, a sign reads \"Bridge Closed &#8212; Local Traffic Only.\" The road is actually on top of an earthen dam built by earlier owners of the plant and used to create a millpond opposite the Riverdale mill. Riverdale has alleged in its complaint that Riverdale owns Manhole 1; there is, as we found in a previous opinion, considerable reasonable dispute about whether this is so. <i>See Knott,</i> 256 F.3d at 32. However, since the case is before us at the summary judgment stage, we must construe all disputed facts in the record in favor of the non-movants, and thus, we treat the road as privately owned by Riverdale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plant's wastewater flows past Manhole 1 through 300 more feet of pipe allegedly owned by Riverdale to Manhole 2, which is further down Riverdale Street. At Manhole 2, the Riverdale pipe carrying wastewater from Manhole 1 enters Manhole 2 as a separate flow and merges with other flows within Manhole 2 (it is possible to sample Riverdale's wastewater separately at Manhole 2 before it merges with the other flows). Manhole 2 is indisputably publicly owned and is part of the public sewer system. From there, the wastewater eventually flows to the Town of Northbridge treatment plant before being released into the Blackstone River.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 28, 1997, an anonymous tipster purporting to be a Riverdale employee sent a letter to the EPA alleging that the plant's pretreatment system was not being run properly and thus that the plant might be discharging wastewater with improper pH levels and other problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA decided to look into it. On the morning of October, 21, 1997, the Agency sent Pimpare and Granz to the mill to perform an inspection. The two inspectors did not obtain a search warrant, and there is no claim of exigent circumstances. Inspector Pimpare first met with Knott and two high-level employees; Inspector Granz arrived sometime during that opening meeting. At that meeting, Pimpare did not assert any statutory authority to search Riverdale property but instead asked Knott to give his consent to an inspection of the wastewater treatment facility, including tests of the wastewater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the complaint and Knott's affidavit state that Knott \"explicitly\" told both Pimpare and Granz that they could sample Riverdale's wastewater and tour its plant only on the \"express condition\" that they be accompanied at all times by Knott or Riverdale employees designated by Knott. We accept the district court's conclusion that Knott's consent was given only on condition that the agents be so accompanied at all times.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Knott,</i> 256 F.3d at 23. At some point during the day, Knott also told the inspectors that he owned the sewer lines under Manhole 1 and that the public sewer did not begin until Manhole 2. Knott told the inspectors this at a closing conference after all the sampling from Manhole 1 had already been completed. <i>Id.</i> at 24. Knott alleges that he also told the agents this fact at the opening meeting, before any sampling was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That morning, right after the meeting, Pimpare and Granz were taken by Knott and the two Riverdale employees directly to Manhole 1, where the inspectors took samples from approximately 10:40 am to 11:15 am. One sample was provided to a Riverdale employee. This first sampling, then, was indisputably in conformity with Fourth Amendment requirements, if any are applicable, because it fell within the scope of consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspectors had earlier planned on setting up a 24-hour composite sample, but this was not done. The reason why this was not done is in some dispute. Pimpare's affidavit states that it was infeasible because of the intermittent nature of the wastewater discharges. He states that he told Knott this and \"made it clear to Knott that Granz and [Pimpare] would be taking additional samples from the manhole throughout the day.\" He says that Knott responded, \"Okay.\" Knott gives a different account. His affidavit states that Pimpare told him 24-hour composite sampling would be a bad idea because it would be unsafe to leave the equipment in the street. Knott says he offered the agents some accommodations to fix this problem, which were declined. Knott states that he was never told that the inspectors were going to conduct periodic sampling throughout the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After conducting this initial round of sampling at Manhole 1, Pimpare states that he and Granz were taken on a tour of the mill by Knott and the two employees. Pimpare states that at the conclusion of this tour, he again told Knott and the two employees that he would need to conduct more testing at Manhole 1; he asserts that Knott did not object. Knott disputes that Pimpare told him the agents would need to conduct more tests at Manhole 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, Pimpare and Granz took samples from Manhole 1 during two additional intervals that afternoon: between 12:40 pm and 1:15 pm, and between 3:00 pm and 3:04 pm. These sampling events are the crucial ones for purposes of this appeal. Knott states that Pimpare and Granz took these samples without him or any of his representatives present, and thus that this afternoon sampling exceeded the scope of his consent. The inspectors concede that no Riverdale representatives were present for this sampling. The sampling occurred, however, on the street in front of the plant and in full view of Riverdale employees. <i>Id.</i> at 23. A sample from the 12:40 pm to 1:15 pm testing was given to one of the Riverdale employees, who signed a chain of custody form. <i>Id.</i> at 24. Before leaving the area that day, the inspectors also took samples from Manhole 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The data resulting from the October 21 sampling led the EPA to obtain an administrative search warrant and to search the facility pursuant to this warrant on November 7, 1997. A second, criminal search warrant was executed on July 19, 1998. These later searches are not at issue in this appeal; only the October 21, 1997 afternoon sampling is relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale and Knott were indicted by a grand jury on August 12, 1998, based on evidence found in these searches, for two counts of violating the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251 <i>et seq.,</i> by discharging industrial waste into publicly owned treatment works in violation of a national pretreatment standard for pH levels. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1317(b)(1), 1319(c)(2)(A); 40 C.F.R. &#167; 403.5(b)(2). Knott and Riverdale moved to suppress evidence obtained during the October 21, 1997 and November 7, 1997 searches. The district court granted the motion in part: it determined that the afternoon sampling on October 21 had exceeded the scope of Knott's consent because neither Knott nor a designated Riverdale employee had been present. It thus suppressed the fruits of those afternoon searches but declined to suppress any evidence obtained on November 7. <i>Knott,</i> 256 F.3d at 25. The government sought leave of court to dismiss the indictment without prejudice on April 23, 1999, and such leave was granted on May 6, 1999. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then granted a motion by Riverdale to recover reasonable attorneys' fees under the Hyde Amendment on the grounds that the prosecution against it had been vexatious. <i>United States v. Knott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510677\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510677/united-states-v-knott/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 179-80 (D.Mass.2000). This court reversed. <i>Knott,</i> 256 F.3d at 36. In the course of conducting our inquiry, we noted that although the district court's order suppressing the results of the October 21 search was not before us, the \"issue was close\" because of the \"factual disputes\" surrounding the events of October 21 and the \"at the very least ... ambiguous\" nature of the conditions imposed on Knott's consent to the sampling. <i>Id.</i> at 31, 35-36. We also noted that even if the inspectors exceeded the scope of their permission, this \"could just as well have rested on an honest mistake of fact or misapprehension of the authority they had been granted,\" an interpretation supported by the fact that the inspectors provided a Riverdale employee with a sample of the afternoon's testing. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knott and Riverdale then brought this civil action in federal district court for damages, based on alleged constitutional violations, against the United States, Pimpare, Granz, and another EPA agent, Stephen Creavin. On March 16, 2004, the district court denied Pimpare's and Granz's motions for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity. <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2470182\"><a href=\"/opinion/2470182/riverdale-mills-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 254-55 (D.Mass.2004). The court correctly articulated the three-part test for qualified immunity (which we discuss later), looking first at whether the facts viewed most favorably to the plaintiff allege the violation of a constitutional right; second whether the constitutional right allegedly violated was clearly established; and third whether the defendants nonetheless deserve qualified immunity because their actions were objectively reasonable. <i>See Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199293\"><a href=\"/opinion/199293/abreu-guzman-v-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first prong of the test, the district court held that Riverdale's allegation that Pimpare and Granz exceeded the scope of Knott's consent to the October 21 search of wastewater in Manhole 1, if true, constituted a violation of Riverdale's Fourth Amendment rights. <i>Riverdale Mills Corp.,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d at 255. The court found defendants' attempted analogy between wastewater and trash left on the curbside for public-waste disposal (which receives no Fourth Amendment protection because there is no reasonable expectation of privacy) to be unpersuasive. <i>Id.</i> On the second prong, whether the law constituting the constitutional violation was clearly established, the court simply noted that \"there can be no doubt that the law regarding the necessity for a search warrant is clear.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, on the third prong, the court held that a reasonable officer would have understood that he was exceeding the scope of Knott's consent. <i>Id.</i> The court also noted that a reasonable officer would have known that in the absence of consent, a warrant was necessary to sample the wastewater at Manhole 1. The court stated this was shown by the fact that the agents sought consent in the first place on October 21 and that they obtained a warrant before searching again on November 7. <i>Id.</i> Granz and Pimpare filed a timely interlocutory appeal of this denial of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity, where, as here, the denial rests on purely legal questions and not on disputed issues of fact. <i>Dwan v.

This Circuit has usually explained qualified immunity as a three-stage test by subdividing <i>Saucier's</i> second stage into two distinct questions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See Abreu-Guzman,</i> 241 F.3d at 73. The three-part test asks first: \"Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?\" <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A qualified immunity defense can, of course, be brought as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In such a case the entire qualified immunity analysis, including the first prong, must be based only on the facts stated in the complaint itself. <i>See, e.g., Butler v. San Diego Dist.

At the 12(b)(6) stage, the question on the first prong is whether, using all of the well-pleaded facts stated in the complaint and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the plaintiff has stated a claim for a violation of some constitutional right. The first prong inquiry at this 12(b)(6) stage is unlikely to be very specific, given that federal civil practice is based on notice pleading, where great specificity is not required, <i>Alternative Sys.

Under the <i>Katz</i> doctrine, courts are required to differentiate between the question of whether a search is reasonable and the antecedent question of whether there is a Fourth Amendment \"search\" at all. The antecedent question turns on, first, whether there is a subjective expectation of privacy, and, second, whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable. We will assume Riverdale had a subjective expectation of privacy. That still leaves the objective part of the test. We ask whether any subjective expectation of privacy that Riverdale might have had was one which society was willing to accept as objectively reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key issue for the first prong, then, is whether Riverdale, based on the undisputed material facts and any disputed material facts looked at in its favor, had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the wastewater underneath Manhole 1. More specifically, our inquiry is whether a company has a reasonable expectation of privacy in industrial wastewater that is on a private street and underneath a 171-pound manhole cover but 300 feet away from and flowing irrevocably into the public sewer system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA inspectors urge that we adopt a per se rule that there is never a reasonable expectation of privacy in wastewater. This we decline to do. Judgments about reasonable expectations of privacy are very fact-specific, and there may be fact situations where wastewater is entitled to constitutional protection. <i>See Dow Chem. Co. v.

This case does not involve stationary wastewater in holding lagoons entirely on private property and shielded from public access, in which there may be stronger expectations of privacy. While it is of some support to Riverdale that this wastewater was found on private property, that support is limited. It is also relevant that Manhole 1 was located on a private <i>road;</i> this street is an area of Riverdale property that is most akin to an open field rather than to a more heavily protected type of area, like curtilage or the interior of a home or business. <i>See, e.g., Dow Chem.

The wastewater will inevitably reach Manhole 2, where the public sewer begins, after only a short period of time, and once it reaches that point, any member of the public can take a sample. Wastewater at Manhole 1 under these circumstances is similar to trash left out on the curb for pick-up by the trash collector, which enjoys no reasonable expectation of privacy, even if left in opaque bags. <i>See Greenwood,</i> 486 U.S. at 40-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112067\"><a href=\"/opinion/112067/california-v-greenwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the case of trash left on the curb, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy both because a passerby can rummage through the trash while on the curb and because the trash has been intentionally left outside for a third-party garbage collector, who in the near future will take the trash and be free to examine it. <i>Greenwood,</i> 486 U.S. at 40-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112067\"><a href=\"/opinion/112067/california-v-greenwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, because the wastewater will assuredly enter the public sewer and will flow there so quickly, the trash analogy controls even if it is not exact. Plaintiffs make an implicit argument that they should be able to expect privacy up until the point at which their wastewater can no longer be differentiated from the other sewage flows. This argument misfires. Riverdale had no cut-off valve at Manhole 1, and thus no way to stop the irretrievable flow to the public sewer. On these facts, Riverdale has abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy in the wastewater by allowing it to flow irretrievably into a place where it will be \"exposed ... to the public.\" <i>Id.</i> at 40, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112067\"><a href=\"/opinion/112067/california-v-greenwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This case held that a commercial proprietor had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a dumpster located in an adjacent alley that was gated at either end by the owner (thus completely out of sight of passersby) until the trash collector actually arrived. <i>See id.</i> at 584. It is surely relevant for Fourth Amendment purposes whether and to what extent someone seeks to \"preserve\" something as \"private\" by keeping it away from public scrutiny. <i>Katz,</i> 389 U.S. at 351, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But Manhole 1 does not play the same role as the gates in <i>Krisco.</i> The gates in <i>Krisco</i> reasonably told the public to stay out of the area around the dumpster and even left it ignorant as to what was in that area; they represented affirmative steps to exclude the public from the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, a manhole cover is normally intended less to keep people out than to provide them access: the manhole cover, even if heavy, is one of the few points from which an underground sewer can be reached. Moreover, a manhole cover, unlike a gate or fence, is not intended to leave passersby ignorant as to the contents within. Fences might hide any number of highly private objects; manholes, however, generally give access only to a few sorts of things, most commonly a sewer (or underground wires or pipes). Placing otherwise unprotected wastewater underneath a manhole cover does not create a reasonable expectation of privacy where one did not exist before. At any rate, the trash in <i>Krisco,</i> which was being held stationary behind the gates for pickup, is quite different than the wastewater here, which is not being held within Manhole 1 but rather is flowing through it on its way to the public sewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that based on the summary judgment record and using the normal summary judgment standard, Riverdale's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated and the agents are entitled to qualified immunity on the first prong.
