This appeal involves a motion to intervene\n\nin an adversary proceeding arising out of a bankruptcy case.                          A\n\ncrisis management firm and other professionals provided services to\n\nthe debtors while they were in chapter 11.                       After the case was\n\nconverted      to    chapter        7,     those    professionals        submitted   fee\n\napplications.        Appellant Pat Costa, a former director and officer\n\nof the debtors, objected thereto, accusing the professionals of\n\nmalpractice and related misconduct.                    As a creditor, Costa had\n\nstanding to advance such objections as a basis for seeking denial\n\n(or disgorgement) of the requested fees.                    But only the chapter 7\n\ntrustee had standing to bring a malpractice action for damages.\n\nRecognizing this fact, and noting that disposition of the fee\n\napplications would bar a future malpractice action on res judicata\n\ngrounds, the bankruptcy court sua sponte converted the contested\n\nmatter into an adversary proceeding and designated the trustee as\n\nthe plaintiff.        Costa was given a limited right of participation.\n\nHe nonetheless complained of his inability to prosecute a dispute\n\nthat he had initiated and, in particular, protested that the\n\ntrustee   did       not    share     his    assessment      of   the     professionals'\n\nperformance.        Costa thus moved to intervene as a full party.                   The\n\nbankruptcy court denied this motion, the district court affirmed,\n\nand Costa has now appealed to this court.\n\n            The appeal ends up foundering on procedural shoals.\n\nNowhere   in    his       lengthy    pro    se     brief   has   Costa    provided   any\n\n\n                                            - 2 -\n\fdeveloped analysis of the intervention issue. Instead, he purports\n\nto incorporate by reference arguments advanced by his counsel in\n\ndistrict     court--a     practice    that    this    court    has   repeatedly\n\ncondemned.        Those   arguments    have   thus    been    forfeited.    And\n\nparticularly because Costa's various challenges to the denial of\n\nintervention would likely fail on the merits in any event, we see\n\nno reason to excuse his default.\n\n            \"In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy\n\ncourt    order,    we   independently    review      the   bankruptcy   court's\n\ndecision ....\"     Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).        Costa asserts that, under Bank. R. 7024 (which\n\nadopts Fed. R. Civ. P. 24), he has satisfied the criteria for both\n\npermissive and mandatory intervention.                As to the former, the\n\nbankruptcy court cannot possibly be faulted for denying relief\n\nbased on concerns about undue delay and expense, given that Costa\n\nhad requested much more extensive discovery and a lengthier hearing\n\nthan had the existing parties.          See, e.g., Daggett v. Comm'n on\n\nGov. Ethics, 172 F.3d 104, 113 (1st Cir. 1999) (determining whether\n\npermissive intervention would cause disruption or delay \"is the\n\nkind of judgment on which the district court's expertise and\n\nauthority is at its zenith\").          The appeal thus hinges on Costa's\n\nentitlement to intervene as of right.1\n\n\n     1\n        As an alternative basis for relief, the bankruptcy court\nalso found a violation of Rule 24(c), which requires that a motion\nto intervene \"be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim\n\n                                      - 3 -\n\f          Rule 24(a)(2) sets forth four criteria for intervention\n\nas of right, which we have summarized as follows:\n\n          A putative intervenor ... must show that (1)\n          it timely moved to intervene; (2) it has an\n          interest   relating   to   the   property   or\n          transaction that forms the basis of the\n          ongoing suit; (3) the disposition of the\n          action threatens to create a practical\n          impediment to its ability to protect[] its\n          interest; and (4) no existing party adequately\n          represents its interests.\n\nB. Fernandez & Hnos., Inc. v. Kellogg USA, Inc., 440 F.3d 541, 544-\n\n45 (1st Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted); accord, e.g., Geiger v. Foley\n\nHoag LLP Retirement Plan, 521 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 2008).     All four\n\ncriteria--timeliness;   sufficiency    of    interest;   likelihood    of\n\nimpairment; and inadequacy of representation--must be met.            See,\n\ne.g., Fernandez, 440 F.3d at 545.     The bankruptcy court determined\n\nthat Costa had satisfied neither the third nor the fourth, while\n\nthe district court focused on the latter.\n\n          In district court, Costa filed a comprehensive opening\n\nbrief (and reply brief) through counsel.       In this court, where he\n\nappears pro se, he could have simply relied thereon.       Instead, he\n\nelected to prepare new documents.           His 30-page opening brief\n\n\n\n\nor defense for which intervention is sought.\" Given the unusual\ncircumstances involved here--particularly the fact that Costa's\nobjection to the fee applications was designated as the operative\ncomplaint in the adversary proceeding--we find this a closer\nquestion, but one that need not be resolved.\n\n                               - 4 -\n\fcontains two arguments, the longer of which is mostly inapposite.2\n\nThe other argument touches on the fourth Rule 24(a)(2) criterion,\n\nbut does so in cursory fashion only (and ignores the third one\n\naltogether).    Costa there contends that the trustee, even before\n\nbeing installed as plaintiff in the adversary proceeding, had\n\ndiscounted     the   allegations   of      malpractice,   had   negotiated\n\nsettlements with the professionals involving minor fee reductions\n\nin return for full releases,3 and had been preparing a suit against\n\nCosta for breach of fiduciary duties.         Under these circumstances,\n\nhe insists, it would be \"astounding\" to conclude that the trustee\n\nwould adequately represent his interests.             Costa then simply\n\nstates:\n\n               I believe it is clear that the Bankruptcy\n          laws and procedures allow me to intervene, and\n          as the original filings clearly convey, both\n          the Lower Court and District Court did not\n          apply the law properly.      The result is a\n          denial of my right to due process.\n               (My intervention filings ... are attached\n          as APPENDIX B.)\n\n\n\n\n     2\n        Costa there repeats his allegations of malpractice and\nfraud against the professionals; accuses the trustee and the\nbankruptcy court of covering up such misconduct; and complains\nabout the procedural consequences of converting his fee objections\ninto an adversary proceeding.\n     3\n        The trustee's motions for approval of those settlements\nwere made part of the adversary proceeding.\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fThe cited portion of his appendix contains his motion to intervene,\n\nthe   opening        district   court    brief   filed    by   counsel,    and   the\n\npertinent court rulings.4\n\n                 \"[A]dopting by reference memoranda filed in the district\n\ncourt       is   a   practice   that    has   been    consistently   and   roundly\n\ncondemned by the Courts of Appeals.\"                 Gilday v. Callahan, 59 F.3d\n\n257, 273 n.23 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted);\n\naccord, e.g., Northland Ins. Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 327\n\nF.3d 448, 452-53 (6th Cir. 2003) (collecting cases).                 Among other\n\nproblems, advancing an argument in this fashion violates the\n\nrequirement in Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) that a brief contain the\n\nparty's contentions and reasoning, see, e.g., Rhode Island Dep't of\n\nEnv. Mngmt. v. United States, 304 F.3d 31, 48 n.6 (1st Cir. 2002),\n\nand enables a party to circumvent the page/word limits in Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 32(a)(7), see, e.g., Exec. Leasing Corp. v. Banco Popular\n\nde Puerto Rico, 48 F.3d 66, 67 (1st Cir. 1995).5                      This court\n\n\n\n        4\n        In his reply brief in this court, Costa quotes at length\nfrom both of his district court briefs and includes copies thereof\nin an addendum. Yet \"[a]rguments omitted from an opening brief on\nappeal ordinarily are deemed waived.\" Credit Francais Int'l, S.A.\nv. Bio-Vita, Ltd., 78 F.3d 698, 709 n.18 (1st Cir. 1996). Costa\ncannot claim ignorance of this rule inasmuch as appellees relied\nthereon in district court. See D.N.H. No. 06-412, Dkt. # 33, at\n10.\n        5\n        The practice also ignores the fact that the \"posture and\nfocus\" of a case typically will have \"changed substantially on\nappeal.\" Cray Comms., Inc. v. Novatel Computer Sys., Inc., 33 F.3d\n390, 396 n.6 (4th Cir. 1994). This is less of a concern here, since\nthe district court was sitting in an appellate capacity.\n\n                                         - 6 -\n\fordinarily regards such an \"incorporated by reference\" argument as\n\nforfeited.      See, e.g., Sleeper Farms v. Agway, Inc., 506 F.3d 98,\n\n104-05 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2008 WL 310964\n\n(2008); Rhode Island Dep't of Env. Mngmt, 304 F.3d at 48 n.6;\n\nGilday, 59 F.3d at 273 n.23; Exec. Leasing Corp., 48 F.3d at 68.\n\nAn appellant's pro se status provides no exemption.             See, e.g.,\n\nYohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); Cofield v.\n\nFirst Wis. Trust Co., 1996 WL 521199, at *1 (1st Cir. 1996) (per\n\ncuriam) (unpub.).      Costa, having been informed of this rule by\n\nappellees, has provided no reason why a different result should\n\nobtain here.\n\n           Nor are the substantive arguments advanced by Costa in\n\ndistrict court so compelling as to suggest that a declaration of\n\nforfeiture would be unfair; in fact, quite to the contrary.              In\n\nattempting to establish inadequacy of representation, Costa has\n\nemphasized the contrast between his views and those of the trustee\n\nconcerning the potential viability of the malpractice allegations.\n\nAs mentioned, he has accused the professionals of gross misconduct,\n\nwhereas   the    trustee   has   discounted   those   claims   and   reached\n\nsettlements involving only minor reductions in fees.6                 In an\n\n\n     6\n         Only one professional--the crisis management firm--is\ninvolved in the instant appeal. Matters concerning the others were\neither resolved at the outset or handled in parallel proceedings\nthat stopped short of an appeal to this court. The district court\njudge in the instant case specifically adopted the decision of\nanother judge in a related case. We will treat that decision as\nthe operative one here.\n\n                                    - 7 -\n\fordinary case, this would likely suffice--especially since an\n\nintervenor \"[t]ypically ... need only make a 'minimal' showing that\n\nthe   representation   afforded    by     a   named   party   would   prove\n\ninadequate.\"    Fernandez, 440 F.3d at 545 (quoting Trbovich v.\n\nUnited Mine Workers, 404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10 (1972)); see, e.g.,\n\nConservation Law Found. v. Mosbacher, 966 F.2d 39, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (finding inadequate representation where party agreed to\n\nconsent decree imposing burdens unacceptable to intervenors).\n\n          Yet \"where the intervenor's ultimate objective matches\n\nthat of the named party, a rebuttable presumption of adequate\n\nrepresentation applies.\"      Fernandez, 440 F.3d at 546.        And that\n\npresumption becomes especially robust where, as here, \"an existing\n\nparty is under a legal obligation to represent the interests\n\nasserted by the putative intervenor.\"          In re Thompson, 965 F.2d\n\n1136, 1142 (1st Cir. 1992).    In that event, the applicant's burden\n\n\"is at its most onerous\" and requires a \"compelling showing\" of\n\ninadequacy.    Id. (internal quotation marks and emphasis deleted).\n\nWe explained in Thompson that, in this context, the applicant must\n\nassert \"concrete facts\" showing that the trustee is guilty of one\n\nof three things: adversity of interest, collusion, or nonfeasance.\n\nId. at 1143 (emphasis deleted).\n\n          We think that the bankruptcy court was likely justified\n\nin finding that Costa had failed to rebut this presumption.             In\n\nobjecting to the fee applications and the proposed settlements,\n\n\n                                  - 8 -\n\fCosta appeared as a creditor claiming an interest in the estate\n\nproperty.7          Because the trustee has a fiduciary obligation to\n\nrepresent         the    interests     of   creditors,      see,    e.g.,   Petitioning\n\nCreditors of Melon Produce, Inc. v. Braunstein, 112 F.3d 1232, 1240\n\n(1st Cir. 1997), Costa's interests and those of the trustee are\n\nessentially in alignment.              To be sure, Costa has advanced a series\n\nof allegations accusing the trustee (and others) of collusion and\n\ncover-up and related misconduct.                But a court need only accept as\n\ntrue       \"the    non-conclusory       allegations        made    in    support   of   an\n\nintervention            motion.\"     Fernandez,      440    F.3d    at    543   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).              We note that the bankruptcy court found\n\n\"no    specific          allegations    from   which    even      the    possibility    of\n\ncollusion          may    be   inferred.\"       It     also       held   that   \"Costa's\n\ndisagreement with the Trustee's assessment of the benefits and\n\nrisks of litigation and of the benefits to the estate of a\n\ncompromise of professional fees is insufficient to meet [his] heavy\n\nburden.\"          We cannot say, based on our preliminary review, that\n\nthese determinations are clearly misplaced.\n\n                  Indeed, Costa's principal argument in this regard has\n\nbeen directed elsewhere. As mentioned, the bankruptcy court relied\n\non Thompson to hold that the presumption of adequacy could only be\n\nrebutted by a showing of (1) adversity of interest, (2) collusion,\n\n\n       7\n          Costa holds general unsecured, priority unsecured,\nadministrative priority unsecured, and secured claims against the\nestates.\n\n                                            - 9 -\n\for (3) nonfeasance.   We have since clarified that this trilogy of\n\ngrounds is not \"exclusive,\" Daggett, 172 F.3d at 111, but \"only\n\nillustrative,\" Fernandez, 440 F.3d at 546.8   This means, according\n\nto Costa, that the bankruptcy court employed an erroneous legal\n\nstandard.    But even assuming arguendo that he is correct,9 we see\n\nlittle cause for concern.   Costa has failed to identify any other\n\npertinent factors--beyond those comprising the Thompson trilogy--\n\nthat if considered would have swung the balance in favor of\n\nintervention.   He has mentioned two others, neither of which seems\n\nparticularly helpful.\n\n            First, Costa has voiced the concern that resolution of\n\nthe fee applications might preclude him from pursuing personal\n\nclaims (such as for tortious interference or fraud) against the\n\n\n\n     8\n        These cases were not addressing Thompson (which was not\nmentioned), but rather Moosehead Sanitary Dist. v. S.G. Phillips\nCorp., 610 F.2d 49 (1st Cir. 1979)--where we stated that, if the\nwould-be intervenor has the \"same ultimate goal\" as an existing\nparty, it must \"ordinarily\" make one of the three showings to\novercome the ensuing presumption of adequacy.     Id. at 54.   The\nconcern was that such language could be mistakenly read to suggest\n\"that only a limited number of 'cubbyholes' existed for claims of\ninadequate representation.\"    Mass. Food Assoc. v. Mass Alcohol\nBeverages Control Comm., 197 F.3d 560, 567 n.5 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     9\n        We note that the cases declaring the trilogy non-exclusive\ninvolved a slightly different situation.       The presumption of\nadequacy arose there because an existing party and the putative\nintervenor had the same ultimate goal, whereas it arises here\nbecause an existing party has a fiduciary duty to represent the\ninterests of the putative intervenor. As mentioned, it is in the\nlatter situation that the burden of demonstrating inadequacy \"is at\nits most onerous.\" Thompson, 965 F.2d at 1142.\n\n                               - 10 -\n\fprofessionals in the future.          Yet the district court deemed this\n\nargument forfeited, since it was not raised in bankruptcy court,\n\nand in any event meritless, since the basis for any such preclusion\n\nwas not explained.      Costa has not addressed either finding.\n\n            Second,    Costa    has      pointed     to    the     circumstances\n\nsurrounding   the     conversion    of   the    contested       matter   into   an\n\nadversary   proceeding.        He   complains      that,   by    means   of   this\n\n\"discretionary\" and unrequested step, the bankruptcy court removed\n\nhim from \"[his] own dispute\" and thereby deprived him of \"due\n\nprocess and appellate rights.\"10          Much of Costa's briefing, both\n\nbelow and on appeal, is devoted to this subject.                 Yet the May 26,\n\n2006 conversion order is not before us and has little direct\n\nbearing on the intervention issue.11           Costa has gone so far as to\n\ncontend that, because of the case's unique procedural posture, it\n\nis questionable \"whether the traditional intervention analysis is\n\neven appropriate.\"      We disagree that the remedy for any improper\n\nconversion would be to jettison or even relax the intervention\n\n\n     10\n        The parties appear to agree that, had the dispute remained\na contested matter, Costa would have had standing to appeal from\nany adverse judgment, but that, once it became an adversary\nproceeding, his standing to do so depended on intervention. Costa\nalso complains of restrictions on his ability to obtain discovery\nand present evidence. But it is not clear that intervention would\nhave accorded him any greater latitude in those respects.      For\nexample, he and the trustee were allotted the same amount of time\nto examine witnesses at the hearing.\n     11\n        The district court summarily rejected as \"not persuasive\"\nCosta's attempt to rely on the conversion order \"as part of the\nreasoning supporting his motion to intervene.\"\n\n                                    - 11 -\n\fcriteria.    In fact, Costa has mentioned the possibility of filing\n\nan appeal to challenge the conversion order once the adversary\n\nproceeding   has   concluded.    Whether   such   a   course   would   be\n\nprocedurally feasible, and whether such a challenge would have any\n\nprospect of success, are matters as to which we express no opinion.\n\n            Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Costa has\n\nforfeited his appellate arguments and that no compelling reason\n\nexists to excuse his default.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 12 -\n\f",

This appeal involves a motion to intervene\n\nin an adversary proceeding arising out of a bankruptcy case.                          A\n\ncrisis management firm and other professionals provided services to\n\nthe debtors while they were in chapter 11.                       After the case was\n\nconverted      to    chapter        7,     those    professionals        submitted   fee\n\napplications.        Appellant Pat Costa, a former director and officer\n\nof the debtors, objected thereto, accusing the professionals of\n\nmalpractice and related misconduct.                    As a creditor, Costa had\n\nstanding to advance such objections as a basis for seeking denial\n\n(or disgorgement) of the requested fees.                    But only the chapter 7\n\ntrustee had standing to bring a malpractice action for damages.\n\nRecognizing this fact, and noting that disposition of the fee\n\napplications would bar a future malpractice action on res judicata\n\ngrounds, the bankruptcy court sua sponte converted the contested\n\nmatter into an adversary proceeding and designated the trustee as\n\nthe plaintiff.        Costa was given a limited right of participation.\n\nHe nonetheless complained of his inability to prosecute a dispute\n\nthat he had initiated and, in particular, protested that the\n\ntrustee   did       not    share     his    assessment      of   the     professionals'\n\nperformance.        Costa thus moved to intervene as a full party.                   The\n\nbankruptcy court denied this motion, the district court affirmed,\n\nand Costa has now appealed to this court.\n\n            The appeal ends up foundering on procedural shoals.\n\nNowhere   in    his       lengthy    pro    se     brief   has   Costa    provided   any\n\n\n                                            - 2 -\n\fdeveloped analysis of the intervention issue. Instead, he purports\n\nto incorporate by reference arguments advanced by his counsel in\n\ndistrict     court--a     practice    that    this    court    has   repeatedly\n\ncondemned.        Those   arguments    have   thus    been    forfeited.    And\n\nparticularly because Costa's various challenges to the denial of\n\nintervention would likely fail on the merits in any event, we see\n\nno reason to excuse his default.\n\n            \"In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy\n\ncourt    order,    we   independently    review      the   bankruptcy   court's\n\ndecision ....\"     Grella v.

As to the former, the\n\nbankruptcy court cannot possibly be faulted for denying relief\n\nbased on concerns about undue delay and expense, given that Costa\n\nhad requested much more extensive discovery and a lengthier hearing\n\nthan had the existing parties.

The appeal thus hinges on Costa's\n\nentitlement to intervene as of right.1\n\n\n     1\n        As an alternative basis for relief, the bankruptcy court\nalso found a violation of Rule 24(c), which requires that a motion\nto intervene \"be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim\n\n                                      - 3 -\n\f          Rule 24(a)(2) sets forth four criteria for intervention\n\nas of right, which we have summarized as follows:\n\n          A putative intervenor ... must show that (1)\n          it timely moved to intervene; (2) it has an\n          interest   relating   to   the   property   or\n          transaction that forms the basis of the\n          ongoing suit; (3) the disposition of the\n          action threatens to create a practical\n          impediment to its ability to protect[] its\n          interest; and (4) no existing party adequately\n          represents its interests.\n\nB.

All four\n\ncriteria--timeliness;   sufficiency    of    interest;   likelihood    of\n\nimpairment; and inadequacy of representation--must be met.            See,\n\ne.g., Fernandez, 440 F.3d at 545.     The bankruptcy court determined\n\nthat Costa had satisfied neither the third nor the fourth, while\n\nthe district court focused on the latter.\n\n          In district court, Costa filed a comprehensive opening\n\nbrief (and reply brief) through counsel.       In this court, where he\n\nappears pro se, he could have simply relied thereon.       Instead, he\n\nelected to prepare new documents.           His 30-page opening brief\n\n\n\n\nor defense for which intervention is sought.\" Given the unusual\ncircumstances involved here--particularly the fact that Costa's\nobjection to the fee applications was designated as the operative\ncomplaint in the adversary proceeding--we find this a closer\nquestion, but one that need not be resolved.\n\n                               - 4 -\n\fcontains two arguments, the longer of which is mostly inapposite.2\n\nThe other argument touches on the fourth Rule 24(a)(2) criterion,\n\nbut does so in cursory fashion only (and ignores the third one\n\naltogether).    Costa there contends that the trustee, even before\n\nbeing installed as plaintiff in the adversary proceeding, had\n\ndiscounted     the   allegations   of      malpractice,   had   negotiated\n\nsettlements with the professionals involving minor fee reductions\n\nin return for full releases,3 and had been preparing a suit against\n\nCosta for breach of fiduciary duties.         Under these circumstances,\n\nhe insists, it would be \"astounding\" to conclude that the trustee\n\nwould adequately represent his interests.             Costa then simply\n\nstates:\n\n               I believe it is clear that the Bankruptcy\n          laws and procedures allow me to intervene, and\n          as the original filings clearly convey, both\n          the Lower Court and District Court did not\n          apply the law properly.      The result is a\n          denial of my right to due process.\n               (My intervention filings ... are attached\n          as APPENDIX B.)\n\n\n\n\n     2\n        Costa there repeats his allegations of malpractice and\nfraud against the professionals; accuses the trustee and the\nbankruptcy court of covering up such misconduct; and complains\nabout the procedural consequences of converting his fee objections\ninto an adversary proceeding.\n     3\n        The trustee's motions for approval of those settlements\nwere made part of the adversary proceeding.\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fThe cited portion of his appendix contains his motion to intervene,\n\nthe   opening        district   court    brief   filed    by   counsel,    and   the\n\npertinent court rulings.4\n\n                 \"[A]dopting by reference memoranda filed in the district\n\ncourt       is   a   practice   that    has   been    consistently   and   roundly\n\ncondemned by the Courts of Appeals.\"                 Gilday v.

Costa, having been informed of this rule by\n\nappellees, has provided no reason why a different result should\n\nobtain here.\n\n           Nor are the substantive arguments advanced by Costa in\n\ndistrict court so compelling as to suggest that a declaration of\n\nforfeiture would be unfair; in fact, quite to the contrary.              In\n\nattempting to establish inadequacy of representation, Costa has\n\nemphasized the contrast between his views and those of the trustee\n\nconcerning the potential viability of the malpractice allegations.\n\nAs mentioned, he has accused the professionals of gross misconduct,\n\nwhereas   the    trustee   has   discounted   those   claims   and   reached\n\nsettlements involving only minor reductions in fees.6                 In an\n\n\n     6\n         Only one professional--the crisis management firm--is\ninvolved in the instant appeal.

To be sure, Costa has advanced a series\n\nof allegations accusing the trustee (and others) of collusion and\n\ncover-up and related misconduct.                But a court need only accept as\n\ntrue       \"the    non-conclusory       allegations        made    in    support   of   an\n\nintervention            motion.\"     Fernandez,      440    F.3d    at    543   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).              We note that the bankruptcy court found\n\n\"no    specific          allegations    from   which    even      the    possibility    of\n\ncollusion          may    be   inferred.\"       It     also       held   that   \"Costa's\n\ndisagreement with the Trustee's assessment of the benefits and\n\nrisks of litigation and of the benefits to the estate of a\n\ncompromise of professional fees is insufficient to meet [his] heavy\n\nburden.\"          We cannot say, based on our preliminary review, that\n\nthese determinations are clearly misplaced.\n\n                  Indeed, Costa's principal argument in this regard has\n\nbeen directed elsewhere. As mentioned, the bankruptcy court relied\n\non Thompson to hold that the presumption of adequacy could only be\n\nrebutted by a showing of (1) adversity of interest, (2) collusion,\n\n\n       7\n          Costa holds general unsecured, priority unsecured,\nadministrative priority unsecured, and secured claims against the\nestates.\n\n                                            - 9 -\n\for (3) nonfeasance.   We have since clarified that this trilogy of\n\ngrounds is not \"exclusive,\" Daggett, 172 F.3d at 111, but \"only\n\nillustrative,\" Fernandez, 440 F.3d at 546.8   This means, according\n\nto Costa, that the bankruptcy court employed an erroneous legal\n\nstandard.    But even assuming arguendo that he is correct,9 we see\n\nlittle cause for concern.   Costa has failed to identify any other\n\npertinent factors--beyond those comprising the Thompson trilogy--\n\nthat if considered would have swung the balance in favor of\n\nintervention.   He has mentioned two others, neither of which seems\n\nparticularly helpful.\n\n            First, Costa has voiced the concern that resolution of\n\nthe fee applications might preclude him from pursuing personal\n\nclaims (such as for tortious interference or fraud) against the\n\n\n\n     8\n        These cases were not addressing Thompson (which was not\nmentioned), but rather Moosehead Sanitary Dist. v.

Mass Alcohol\nBeverages Control Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198729\"><a href=\"/opinion/198729/food-association-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 n.5 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     9\n        We note that the cases declaring the trilogy non-exclusive\ninvolved a slightly different situation.       The presumption of\nadequacy arose there because an existing party and the putative\nintervenor had the same ultimate goal, whereas it arises here\nbecause an existing party has a fiduciary duty to represent the\ninterests of the putative intervenor. As mentioned, it is in the\nlatter situation that the burden of demonstrating inadequacy \"is at\nits most onerous.\" Thompson, 965 F.2d at 1142.\n\n                               - 10 -\n\fprofessionals in the future.          Yet the district court deemed this\n\nargument forfeited, since it was not raised in bankruptcy court,\n\nand in any event meritless, since the basis for any such preclusion\n\nwas not explained.      Costa has not addressed either finding.\n\n            Second,    Costa    has      pointed     to    the     circumstances\n\nsurrounding   the     conversion    of   the    contested       matter   into   an\n\nadversary   proceeding.        He   complains      that,   by    means   of   this\n\n\"discretionary\" and unrequested step, the bankruptcy court removed\n\nhim from \"[his] own dispute\" and thereby deprived him of \"due\n\nprocess and appellate rights.\"10          Much of Costa's briefing, both\n\nbelow and on appeal, is devoted to this subject.                 Yet the May 26,\n\n2006 conversion order is not before us and has little direct\n\nbearing on the intervention issue.11           Costa has gone so far as to\n\ncontend that, because of the case's unique procedural posture, it\n\nis questionable \"whether the traditional intervention analysis is\n\neven appropriate.\"      We disagree that the remedy for any improper\n\nconversion would be to jettison or even relax the intervention\n\n\n     10\n        The parties appear to agree that, had the dispute remained\na contested matter, Costa would have had standing to appeal from\nany adverse judgment, but that, once it became an adversary\nproceeding, his standing to do so depended on intervention. Costa\nalso complains of restrictions on his ability to obtain discovery\nand present evidence. But it is not clear that intervention would\nhave accorded him any greater latitude in those respects.      For\nexample, he and the trustee were allotted the same amount of time\nto examine witnesses at the hearing.\n     11\n        The district court summarily rejected as \"not persuasive\"\nCosta's attempt to rely on the conversion order \"as part of the\nreasoning supporting his motion to intervene.\"\n\n                                    - 11 -\n\fcriteria.    In fact, Costa has mentioned the possibility of filing\n\nan appeal to challenge the conversion order once the adversary\n\nproceeding   has   concluded.    Whether   such   a   course   would   be\n\nprocedurally feasible, and whether such a challenge would have any\n\nprospect of success, are matters as to which we express no opinion.\n\n            Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Costa has\n\nforfeited his appellate arguments and that no compelling reason\n\nexists to excuse his default.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 12 -\n\f</pre>",
