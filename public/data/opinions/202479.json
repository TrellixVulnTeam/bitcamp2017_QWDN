Raymond L. Acosta,    Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n               Selya, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Carlos M.

In    this     unusual   employment\n\ndiscrimination case, we must decide what prima facie showing is\n\nnecessary to establish an adverse employment action, within the\n\nmeaning of Title VII, when a plaintiff alleges a retaliatory\n\nfailure-to-hire.          Claims of retaliation in the failure-to-hire\n\ncontext are sufficiently rare that this question is one of first\n\nimpression for this court.           When a plaintiff makes such a claim, we\n\nconclude that the establishment of an \"adverse employment action\"\n\nrequires a showing that (1) she applied for a particular position\n\n(2) which was vacant and (3) for which she was qualified.                             In\n\naddition, of course, she must show that she was not hired for that\n\nposition.\n\n            Appellant Gladden Velez claims that her former employer,\n\nappellee Janssen Ortho, refused to consider her for re-employment\n\nin retaliation for a previous lawsuit she filed against the company\n\nin   the   Puerto    Rico    Court    of    First       Instance    alleging   sexual\n\nharassment    by    her     supervisor.          She    brought     this   employment\n\ndiscrimination lawsuit, in the federal district court of Puerto\n\nRico, under Title VII and Puerto Rico commonwealth statutes.                         The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for Janssen on all claims,\n\nfinding    that    Velez    failed    to    make    a    prima     facie   showing    of\n\nretaliation.      We affirm the district court's judgment, although on\n\nnarrower grounds.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\f                                         I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n            We recount the facts of this case with the summary\n\njudgment standard in mind, drawing all reasonable inferences and\n\nviewing the record in favor of Velez, the non-moving party.                  See,\n\ne.g., Clifford v. Barnhart, 449 F.3d 276, 280 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Velez was first hired to work for Janssen in August 1989,\n\nand she remained at Janssen's Gurabo chemical plant until December\n\n1998.     While working at the Gurabo plant, Velez claimed that she\n\nwas sexually harassed by her supervisor; she also alleged that her\n\nboss    retaliated      against    her     for       reports   of   manufacturing\n\nirregularities she submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn response to the alleged harassment and retaliation, Velez filed\n\na commonwealth law claim in the Court of First Instance of Puerto\n\nRico (the \"Caguas court\") on June 23, 1997.                 After the Caguas case\n\nwas filed, Velez remained a Janssen employee and continued to\n\nperform her duties satisfactorily for over a year.\n\n            In November 1998, Velez applied for a promotion to the\n\nposition of Senior Packaging Engineer. Janssen denied her request\n\nbecause    she   was    not   qualified        for    the   position.     Shortly\n\nthereafter, in December 1998, Janssen closed the Gurabo chemical\n\nplant and Velez lost her job; Velez received a standard severance\n\npackage totaling $12,704.86.          Two weeks later, Velez amended her\n\noriginal    Caguas     case   to   include     an     additional    allegation   of\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fretaliation, based on Janssen's failure to transfer her to a new\n\nposition after the closing of the Gurabo plant.\n\n            In February 1999, Velez sent a letter and resume to\n\nJanssen requesting that she be considered for a Manufacturing\n\nSupervisor position.   Janssen did not respond.        In May 1999, Velez\n\nsent another letter and resume applying for the Senior Packaging\n\nEngineer job, for which she had been rejected prior to the closing\n\nof the Gurabo plant.       Again, Janssen sent no reply to Velez.1\n\n            About two years later, on August 8, 2001, Velez again\n\ncontacted Janssen seeking employment.           She sent a general cover\n\nletter and resume to Janssen's human resources department via\n\ncertified mail, requesting consideration for employment.                  Her\n\nletter expressed interest in \"any position available.\"                Velez\n\nmentioned    a   variety     of   general     job   categories    (such   as\n\nmanufacturing    supervisor,      warehouse   supervisor,   and   utilities\n\nsupervisor) and asked to be considered for any position for which\n\nthe human resources department considered her qualified.           One week\n\nlater, on August 15, Velez sent an identical letter and resume to\n\nthe human resources department, this time via facsimile.\n\n            In response to Velez's August 2001 letters and resumes,\n\nJanssen's director of human resources, Carlos Otero, sent a letter\n\nstating that she would not be considered for an interview or\n\n\n1\n  Velez filed a Second Amended Complaint in the Caguas court in\nDecember 2001, alleging that Janssen was continuing to retaliate\nagainst her by failing to respond to her 1999 job applications.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f\"rehiring.\"     Otero's letter mentioned Velez's prior lay-off and\n\nseverance,    as    well   as   the    company's   \"business    needs\"    as   an\n\nexplanation.       Otero subsequently testified that he consulted with\n\none of Janssen's lawyers prior to finalizing and sending the\n\nrejection    letter.       He   also    testified,   as   did   other    Janssen\n\nemployees, that the human resources department typically sent no\n\nresponse to rejected applicants.\n\n            Three days after Otero sent Velez the rejection letter,\n\nJanssen published an advertisement in the local newspaper for two\n\nManufacturing Process Facilitator (\"MPF\") positions.2                    Janssen\n\ninterviewed at least one candidate for one of the MPF jobs sometime\n\nin September.      Janssen did not hire anyone for either position at\n\nthat time.    One of the positions remained vacant until July 2002,\n\nalmost a year after Velez applied.3\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Velez has claimed that her letters and resumes were sent in\nresponse to newspaper ads.    In her brief to this court and her\nopposition to Janssen's Motion for Summary Judgment, she alleges\nthat Janssen advertised two MPF jobs on July 20, 2001. Velez does\nnot support this claim with exhibits or deposition testimony.\nElsewhere, she concedes that the newspaper advertisements for the\ntwo MPF positions appeared on August 19, 2001. It appears that the\nJuly 20, 2001 date is a typographical error or mistake, as the\nrecord contains no evidence that Janssen advertised these positions\nprior to her August 8 and August 15 letters. For purposes of this\nappeal, therefore, we assume that Janssen advertised two MPF\npositions on August 19 and not before.\n3\n  The record is unclear as to when the first MPF position was\nfilled. It appears that someone was hired for that job within the\nyear following the advertisement, but it is not clear precisely\nwhen that occurred.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fB. Procedural Background\n\n            Velez filed her complaint in this case on January 27,\n\n2003, alleging federal claims under the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3.\n\nShe also asserted claims under Puerto Rico's Act No. 44, P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 1, § 501 (disability discrimination); Act No. 100, P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 29, § 146 (gender-based employment discrimination);\n\nAct No. 115, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 194a (retaliatory employment\n\ndiscrimination) (\"Law 115\"); Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto\n\nRico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141-42 (general tort\n\nstatute);    and   the   privacy   protections   in   the   Puerto   Rican\n\nconstitution.\n\n            Janssen subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing\n\nthat Velez: (1) failed to meet her prima facie burden of showing\n\nretaliation because her prior lawsuit was not protected activity\n\nunder Title VII, and (2) failed to show a causal connection between\n\nher conduct and an \"adverse employment action\" by Janssen.\n\n            In granting judgment for Janssen, the district court used\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework for employment\n\ndiscrimination claims.     See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792 (1973).    That is, the district court found that Velez bore\n\nthe initial burden of making a prima facie showing of three\n\nelements: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) she suffered\n\nan adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection existed\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fbetween her protected activity and the adverse employment action.\n\nSee Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2004). The court also discussed the more precise standard for\n\ncausation in failure-to-hire cases, as articulated in Ruggles v.\n\nCal. Polytechnic State Univ., 797 F.2d 782, 786 (9th Cir. 1986). In\n\nRuggles, the Ninth Circuit held that a plaintiff claiming that a\n\nfailure-to-hire amounted to discriminatory retaliation must \"show\n\nthat the position for which she applied was eliminated or not\n\navailable to her because of her protected activities.\" Id.\n\n             The   district   court    first   concluded       that   Velez's\n\nactivities were not protected under Title VII.                 It found that\n\nVelez's \"filing and successive amended filings of discrimination\n\nlawsuits against Janssen [were] unreasonable,\" and therefore held\n\nthat Velez had not engaged in protected activity. See Hochstadt v.\n\nWorcester Found. for Experimental Biology, 545 F.2d 222, 230-31\n\n(1st Cir. 1976) (applying a balancing test to determine whether\n\nspecific actions are protected \"opposition activity\" and holding\n\nthat an employee's actions may not be protected under Title VII\n\nwhere they are hostile and disruptive).\n\n             The district court alternatively held that Velez failed\n\nto satisfy the causation element of her prima facie case.             It found\n\nthat   her    allegations     could    not   support      an   inference   of\n\ndiscriminatory     retaliation   because     she   sent    her   letters   of\n\n\"application\" without specifying a particular job opening and at a\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ftime when there were no positions open to external candidates. The\n\ncourt therefore concluded that there was no failure-to-hire that\n\ncould have been caused by Velez's prior opposition conduct.\n\n            The court also rejected Velez's claim under the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act and the supplemental commonwealth law claims.\n\nOn appeal, she challenges only the dismissal of her employment\n\ndiscrimination claims under Title VII and Puerto Rico law.\n\n                                 II.\n\n            Our review of the district court's summary judgment is de\n\nnovo.    Ingram v. Brink's, Inc., 414 F.3d 222, 228 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nHillstrom v. Best W. TLC Hotel, 354 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nWe must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving party, and give that party \"the benefit of any and all\n\nreasonable inferences.\"    Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).    Summary judgment is an appropriate resolution of claims\n\nwhere \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,\" and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.     Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c); see also Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 19.\n\n            Our evaluation of Velez's claims begins with § 704(a) of\n\nTitle VII, which prohibits an employer from \"discriminat[ing]\n\nagainst any of [its] employees or applicants for employment . . .\n\nbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment\n\npractice by this subchapter, or because he has . . . participated\n\nin any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthis subchapter.\"     42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).          As already noted,\n\nclaims of retaliatory discrimination under this provision must\n\nbegin with a prima facie showing of three elements: (1) protected\n\nopposition activity, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) a\n\ncausal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse\n\naction. Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 25. The district court focused\n\non the deficiencies in Velez's prima facie showing of protected\n\nopposition activities and the causal relationship between those\n\nactivities and Janssen's failure to hire her.           We focus on the\n\nsecond prong of the retaliatory discrimination test, the existence\n\nof an adverse employment action.\n\n           The district court did not explicitly address this prong.\n\nAlthough   the    court   noted   Velez's    failure    to    submit    her\n\n\"application\" in a form that complied with Janssen's typical hiring\n\nprocedures, and concluded that her letters \"cannot reasonably be\n\ndeemed applications to be considered for [the MPF] position,\" it\n\ntreated these deficiencies as matters of causation.           The parties\n\nalso discussed the specifics of Velez's August 2001 inquiries about\n\njobs at Janssen as a causation issue.       We think that this focus on\n\ncausation was at best awkward on the facts of this case.\n\n           In the retaliatory failure-to-hire context, the specifics\n\nof the job application or applications that underlie a claim of\n\nfailure-to-hire   usually   relate   most   naturally    to   the   adverse\n\nemployment action prong of such a claim.       Put most simply, in the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fabsence of a job application, there cannot be a failure-to-hire.\n\nWe are not suggesting that there was a complete absence of a job\n\napplication in this case.   But Velez only sent two general letters\n\nin August 2001 expressing interest in any available job.4    Guided\n\nby some precedents from the other circuits, we conclude that such\n\ngeneral letters ordinarily cannot be the predicate for the adverse\n\nemployment action prong in a retaliatory failure-to-hire case.\n\nInstead, a plaintiff alleging such a claim must show that (1) she\n\napplied for a particular position (2) which was vacant and (3) for\n\nwhich she was qualified.    In addition, she must show that she was\n\nnot hired for that position.\n\n          In Morgan v. Fed. Home Loan Mort. Corp., 328 F.3d 647,651\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003), the court held that the plaintiff claiming a\n\nretaliatory failure-to-hire must show \"that he applied for an\n\navailable job; and . . . that he was qualified for that position.\"\n\nThe court later reiterated this formulation of the required prima\n\nfacie showing in Carter v. George Washington Univ., 387 F.3d 872,\n\n878 (D.C. Cir. 2004).   In Cichon v. Exelon Generation Co., 401 F.3d\n\n803, 812 (7th Cir. 2005), the court applied the generally-accepted\n\nstandard for retaliatory failure-to-hire claims, but also specified\n\nthat plaintiffs making such claims must show that they applied for,\n\n\n\n4\n  In 1999, Velez sent two letters to Janssen requesting employment\nin specific positions. Janssen's rejection of those applications\nis not at issue in this case.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fand had the technical qualifications for, the position sought. Id.5\n\nIn Ruggles, the Ninth Circuit implicitly adopted the same view,\n\nholding that a plaintiff claiming retaliatory failure-to-hire must\n\n\"show that the position for which she applied was eliminated or not\n\navailable to her because of her protected activities.\" 797 F.2d at\n\n786 (emphasis added).\n\n          Precedent in the analogous context of failure-to-promote\n\nclaims also reflects the requirement that plaintiffs asserting\n\ndiscriminatory retaliation must show that they applied for a\n\nspecific vacant position for which they were qualified, and that\n\nthey did not get the job.   See Brown v. Coach Stores, Inc., 163\n\nF.3d 706, 711-12 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding that a plaintiff claiming\n\na failure-to-promote must show that she \"applied for a specific\n\nposition or positions . . . rather than merely asserting that on\n\n\n\n5\n  In nearly all of the failure-to-hire cases we have examined,\ncausation was the dispositive issue because the court found that\nthe plaintiffs had applied for and been rejected for a specific\njob.    Thus the critical issue was the motivation for that\nrejection. See, e.g., Arraleh v. County of Ramsey, 461 F.3d 967,\n977-78 (8th Cir. 2006); Price v. Thompson, 380 F.3d 209, 212-13\n(4th Cir. 2004); Walker v. Glickman, 241 F.3d 884, 889-90 (7th Cir.\n2001); Kelley v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 220 F.3d 1174, 1179\n(10th Cir. 2000); Bullington v. United Air Lines, Inc., 186 F.3d\n1301, 1321 (10th Cir. 1999); Sarno v. Douglas Elliman-Gibbons &\nIves, Inc., 183 F.3d 155, 160 (2d Cir. 1999); Williams v. Nashville\nNetwork, 132 F.3d 1123, 1131-33 (6th Cir. 1998); Fleming v. Boeing\nCo., 120 F.3d 242, 248 (11th Cir. 1997). Likewise, Carter, 387\nF.3d at 878-82, Cichon, 401 F.3d at 812-15, and Ruggles, 797 F.2d\nat 786-88, were also decided on the causation question, as there\nwas no dispute about the plaintiffs having applied for the sought\nposition. Morgan is the only notable exception to this pattern.\n328 F.3d at 651-54.\n\n                               -11-\n\fseveral    occasions    she   or   he    generally    requested     promotion\");\n\nPetrosino v. Bell Atlantic, 385 F.3d 210, 226-27 (2d Cir. 2004)\n\n(same); Ricci v. Applebee's Ne., Inc., 297 F. Supp.2d 311, 320-22\n\n(D. Me. 2003) (applying the Brown standard and holding that a\n\ngeneral expression of interest in, without formal application for,\n\na position is insufficient to support a legal claim of adverse\n\nemployment action).      Indeed, the Brown case provides the closest\n\nfactual    similarity    we   have   found     to   this   case.     There,   the\n\nplaintiff repeatedly requested a promotion, without success, but\n\nher claim for failure-to-promote was dismissed by the district\n\ncourt because of her inability to identify any specific positions\n\nfor which she had applied.         163 F.3d at 708-09.       The Second Circuit\n\naffirmed   the   district     court's     decision    on    the   ground   that    a\n\nfailure-to-promote claim necessitates a prima facie showing \"that\n\n[the plaintiff] applied for a specific position or positions.\" Id.\n\nat 710.     In its decision, the court explicitly articulated the\n\nconcern that, absent this showing, employees could establish a\n\nclaim without identifying a particular application that gave rise\n\nto the alleged adverse employment action.             Id.\n\n            This specificity requirement is sensible and fair.                    An\n\nopen-ended request for employment should not put a burden on an\n\nemployer to review an applicant's generally stated credentials any\n\ntime a position becomes available, at the risk of a Title VII\n\nclaim.     If we were to find such a general request the legal\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fequivalent of an application, we would require employers to answer\n\nfor their failure to hire individuals who did nothing more than\n\nexpress a desire to be employed.        Cf. Brown, 163 F.3d at 710\n\n(stating that general expressions of interest cannot be sufficient\n\nto state a Title VII claim because such a result would \"unfairly\n\nburden\" employers by requiring them \"to keep track of all employees\n\nwho have generally expressed an interest in promotion and consider\n\neach of them for any opening for which they are qualified but did\n\nnot   specifically   apply\").   A   failure-to-hire   claim   obviously\n\ndepends on the availability of a job opening.    It is not unfair or\n\nunduly burdensome to expect a plaintiff to submit an application\n\nfor that vacancy as a prerequisite for stating a failure-to-hire\n\nclaim.   In short, we do not believe an employer is obliged to\n\ndefend its decision not to hire an individual for a position for\n\nwhich she has not specifically applied.6\n\n           The parties in this case dispute whether there was a\n\nvacant position at the relevant time.    Janssen argues that the MPF\n\nposition was not available to external candidates at the time it\n\nreceived Velez's August 2001 letters.    Velez places heavy emphasis\n\non Janssen's advertisement for the two MPF openings only three days\n\n\n\n6\n   Like the Second Circuit, we recognize the potential for\nexceptions to this general rule.     See Brown, 163 F.3d at 710\n(\"[T]he general rule . . . is subject to modification where the\nfacts of a particular case make an allegation of a specific\napplication a quixotic requirement.\").\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fafter her rejection letter stated that she would not be considered\n\ndue to \"business needs.\" Although Janssen has offered explanations\n\nfor this seeming-contradiction, Velez has raised a sufficient\n\nfactual dispute to foreclose summary judgment on the issue of a job\n\nvacancy when Velez submitted her August letters.\n\n          Velez has, nonetheless, failed to make a prima facie\n\nshowing of an adverse employment action.   She stated only that she\n\nwas \"interested in being considered for any position available such\n\nas manufacturing supervisor, warehouse supervisor, maintenance\n\nsupervisor, utilities supervisor, quality engineer, preventive\n\nmaintenance supervisor or any other position.\"       Such a letter\n\nmerely expresses interest in a wide range of positions.    It is not\n\nthe application for a discrete, identifiable position required\n\nunder § 704(a) of Title VII.     On that basis alone, the district\n\ncourt properly entered summary judgment for Janssen on Velez's\n\nTitle VII claim.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          Velez argues that the district court erroneously granted\n\nsummary judgment for Janssen under Law 115 of the Puerto Rico code.\n\nTitle VII and Law 115 are largely symmetrical in scope.   See, e.g.,\n\nSalva v. Eagle Global Logistics, __ F. Supp.2d __, 2006 WL 2685109,\n\nat *4 (D.P.R. Sept. 18, 2006).   Velez argues, however, that even if\n\nher Title VII claim were appropriately rejected, her Law 115 claim\n\nshould survive because the defendant-employer's burden is greater\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\funder that law.    We do not have to address that contention here.\n\nWe have affirmed summary judgment on her Title VII claim based on\n\nthe   deficiency   in   her   prima   facie   showing    for    the   adverse\n\nemployment action element of a retaliation claim.                 Thus, the\n\ndefendant's burden of proof is irrelevant.              Neither party has\n\nsuggested that the prima facie showing for a Law 115 claim is\n\ndistinct from that required for a Title VII claim.             Because Velez\n\nhas not shown that she suffered an adverse employment action under\n\nthe latter, she has likewise not made such a showing under the\n\nformer.\n\n           We note an arguable alternative ground for decision\n\nwithout deciding its merits.      The language of Law 115 raises the\n\npossibility (although not mentioned by either party or the district\n\ncourt) that Velez's claim is not cognizable under Law 115.                The\n\nprovision under which Velez makes her claim states: \"No employer\n\nmay . . . discriminate against an employee regarding the terms,\n\nconditions, compensation, location, benefits or privileges of the\n\nemployment should the employee offer or attempt to offer, verbally\n\nor in writing, any testimony, expression or information before a .\n\n. . judicial forum in Puerto Rico . . . .\"       P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,\n\n§ 194a(a).     In order to prevail on a claim under Law 115, a\n\nplaintiff-employee must show that she engaged in protected activity\n\nand that she was thereafter \"discriminated against regarding her\n\nemployment.\"   Salva,__ F. Supp.2d __, 2006 WL 2685109, at *4.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f            Title VII, however, explicitly protects both \"employees\n\n[and]   applicants      for   employment\"      against    retaliatory\n\ndiscrimination.    42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).      Title VII's explicit\n\nembrace of applicants appears, therefore, to be broader than Law\n\n115's coverage of employees only.      Nonetheless, we do not explore\n\nthis potential difference between the two statutes because Velez's\n\nclaim must be dismissed in any event.     As discussed above, Law 115\n\nrequires the same prima facie showing of an \"adverse employment\n\naction\" as Title VII.    Thus, Velez's claim fails, as a matter of\n\nlaw, because she has not applied for a specific and available\n\nposition.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            We hold that a plaintiff asserting a Title VII claim of\n\nretaliatory discrimination based on a failure-to-hire must, in\n\norder to establish an adverse employment action, make a prima facie\n\nshowing that (1) she applied for a particular position (2) which\n\nwas vacant and (3) for which she was qualified.     In addition, she\n\nmust show that she was not hired for that position.          For the\n\nreasons discussed above, Velez has not made such a showing here.\n\nThus, we affirm summary judgment for appellee Janssen on Velez's\n\nTitle VII and Law 115 claims.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f",

In    this     unusual   employment\n\ndiscrimination case, we must decide what prima facie showing is\n\nnecessary to establish an adverse employment action, within the\n\nmeaning of Title VII, when a plaintiff alleges a retaliatory\n\nfailure-to-hire.          Claims of retaliation in the failure-to-hire\n\ncontext are sufficiently rare that this question is one of first\n\nimpression for this court.           When a plaintiff makes such a claim, we\n\nconclude that the establishment of an \"adverse employment action\"\n\nrequires a showing that (1) she applied for a particular position\n\n(2) which was vacant and (3) for which she was qualified.

See,\n\ne.g., Clifford v. Barnhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202257\"><a href=\"/opinion/202257/clifford-v-barnhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Velez was first hired to work for Janssen in August 1989,\n\nand she remained at Janssen's Gurabo chemical plant until December\n\n1998.     While working at the Gurabo plant, Velez claimed that she\n\nwas sexually harassed by her supervisor; she also alleged that her\n\nboss    retaliated      against    her     for       reports   of   manufacturing\n\nirregularities she submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn response to the alleged harassment and retaliation, Velez filed\n\na commonwealth law claim in the Court of First Instance of Puerto\n\nRico (the \"Caguas court\") on June 23, 1997.                 After the Caguas case\n\nwas filed, Velez remained a Janssen employee and continued to\n\nperform her duties satisfactorily for over a year.\n\n            In November 1998, Velez applied for a promotion to the\n\nposition of Senior Packaging Engineer. Janssen denied her request\n\nbecause    she   was    not   qualified        for    the   position.     Shortly\n\nthereafter, in December 1998, Janssen closed the Gurabo chemical\n\nplant and Velez lost her job; Velez received a standard severance\n\npackage totaling $12,704.86.          Two weeks later, Velez amended her\n\noriginal    Caguas     case   to   include     an     additional    allegation   of\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fretaliation, based on Janssen's failure to transfer her to a new\n\nposition after the closing of the Gurabo plant.\n\n            In February 1999, Velez sent a letter and resume to\n\nJanssen requesting that she be considered for a Manufacturing\n\nSupervisor position.   Janssen did not respond.        In May 1999, Velez\n\nsent another letter and resume applying for the Senior Packaging\n\nEngineer job, for which she had been rejected prior to the closing\n\nof the Gurabo plant.       Again, Janssen sent no reply to Velez.1\n\n            About two years later, on August 8, 2001, Velez again\n\ncontacted Janssen seeking employment.           She sent a general cover\n\nletter and resume to Janssen's human resources department via\n\ncertified mail, requesting consideration for employment.                  Her\n\nletter expressed interest in \"any position available.\"                Velez\n\nmentioned    a   variety     of   general     job   categories    (such   as\n\nmanufacturing    supervisor,      warehouse   supervisor,   and   utilities\n\nsupervisor) and asked to be considered for any position for which\n\nthe human resources department considered her qualified.           One week\n\nlater, on August 15, Velez sent an identical letter and resume to\n\nthe human resources department, this time via facsimile.\n\n            In response to Velez's August 2001 letters and resumes,\n\nJanssen's director of human resources, Carlos Otero, sent a letter\n\nstating that she would not be considered for an interview or\n\n\n1\n  Velez filed a Second Amended Complaint in the Caguas court in\nDecember 2001, alleging that Janssen was continuing to retaliate\nagainst her by failing to respond to her 1999 job applications.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f\"rehiring.\"     Otero's letter mentioned Velez's prior lay-off and\n\nseverance,    as    well   as   the    company's   \"business    needs\"    as   an\n\nexplanation.       Otero subsequently testified that he consulted with\n\none of Janssen's lawyers prior to finalizing and sending the\n\nrejection    letter.       He   also    testified,   as   did   other    Janssen\n\nemployees, that the human resources department typically sent no\n\nresponse to rejected applicants.\n\n            Three days after Otero sent Velez the rejection letter,\n\nJanssen published an advertisement in the local newspaper for two\n\nManufacturing Process Facilitator (\"MPF\") positions.2                    Janssen\n\ninterviewed at least one candidate for one of the MPF jobs sometime\n\nin September.      Janssen did not hire anyone for either position at\n\nthat time.    One of the positions remained vacant until July 2002,\n\nalmost a year after Velez applied.3\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Velez has claimed that her letters and resumes were sent in\nresponse to newspaper ads.    In her brief to this court and her\nopposition to Janssen's Motion for Summary Judgment, she alleges\nthat Janssen advertised two MPF jobs on July 20, 2001. Velez does\nnot support this claim with exhibits or deposition testimony.\nElsewhere, she concedes that the newspaper advertisements for the\ntwo MPF positions appeared on August 19, 2001. It appears that the\nJuly 20, 2001 date is a typographical error or mistake, as the\nrecord contains no evidence that Janssen advertised these positions\nprior to her August 8 and August 15 letters. For purposes of this\nappeal, therefore, we assume that Janssen advertised two MPF\npositions on August 19 and not before.\n3\n  The record is unclear as to when the first MPF position was\nfilled. It appears that someone was hired for that job within the\nyear following the advertisement, but it is not clear precisely\nwhen that occurred.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fB. Procedural Background\n\n            Velez filed her complaint in this case on January 27,\n\n2003, alleging federal claims under the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3.\n\nShe also asserted claims under Puerto Rico's Act No. 44, P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 1, § 501 (disability discrimination); Act No. 100, P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 29, § 146 (gender-based employment discrimination);\n\nAct No. 115, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 194a (retaliatory employment\n\ndiscrimination) (\"Law 115\"); Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto\n\nRico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141-42 (general tort\n\nstatute);    and   the   privacy   protections   in   the   Puerto   Rican\n\nconstitution.\n\n            Janssen subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing\n\nthat Velez: (1) failed to meet her prima facie burden of showing\n\nretaliation because her prior lawsuit was not protected activity\n\nunder Title VII, and (2) failed to show a causal connection between\n\nher conduct and an \"adverse employment action\" by Janssen.\n\n            In granting judgment for Janssen, the district court used\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework for employment\n\ndiscrimination claims.     See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973).    That is, the district court found that Velez bore\n\nthe initial burden of making a prima facie showing of three\n\nelements: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) she suffered\n\nan adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection existed\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fbetween her protected activity and the adverse employment action.\n\nSee Calero-Cerezo v.

In\n\nRuggles, the Ninth Circuit held that a plaintiff claiming that a\n\nfailure-to-hire amounted to discriminatory retaliation must \"show\n\nthat the position for which she applied was eliminated or not\n\navailable to her because of her protected activities.\" Id.\n\n             The   district   court    first   concluded       that   Velez's\n\nactivities were not protected under Title VII.                 It found that\n\nVelez's \"filing and successive amended filings of discrimination\n\nlawsuits against Janssen [were] unreasonable,\" and therefore held\n\nthat Velez had not engaged in protected activity.

It found\n\nthat   her    allegations     could    not   support      an   inference   of\n\ndiscriminatory     retaliation   because     she   sent    her   letters   of\n\n\"application\" without specifying a particular job opening and at a\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ftime when there were no positions open to external candidates. The\n\ncourt therefore concluded that there was no failure-to-hire that\n\ncould have been caused by Velez's prior opposition conduct.\n\n            The court also rejected Velez's claim under the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act and the supplemental commonwealth law claims.\n\nOn appeal, she challenges only the dismissal of her employment\n\ndiscrimination claims under Title VII and Puerto Rico law.\n\n                                 II.\n\n            Our review of the district court's summary judgment is de\n\nnovo.

Summary judgment is an appropriate resolution of claims\n\nwhere \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,\" and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.     Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c); see also Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 19.\n\n            Our evaluation of Velez's claims begins with § 704(a) of\n\nTitle VII, which prohibits an employer from \"discriminat[ing]\n\nagainst any of [its] employees or applicants for employment . . .\n\nbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment\n\npractice by this subchapter, or because he has . . . participated\n\nin any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthis subchapter.\"     42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).          As already noted,\n\nclaims of retaliatory discrimination under this provision must\n\nbegin with a prima facie showing of three elements: (1) protected\n\nopposition activity, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) a\n\ncausal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse\n\naction. Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 25. The district court focused\n\non the deficiencies in Velez's prima facie showing of protected\n\nopposition activities and the causal relationship between those\n\nactivities and Janssen's failure to hire her.           We focus on the\n\nsecond prong of the retaliatory discrimination test, the existence\n\nof an adverse employment action.\n\n           The district court did not explicitly address this prong.\n\nAlthough   the    court   noted   Velez's    failure    to    submit    her\n\n\"application\" in a form that complied with Janssen's typical hiring\n\nprocedures, and concluded that her letters \"cannot reasonably be\n\ndeemed applications to be considered for [the MPF] position,\" it\n\ntreated these deficiencies as matters of causation.           The parties\n\nalso discussed the specifics of Velez's August 2001 inquiries about\n\njobs at Janssen as a causation issue.       We think that this focus on\n\ncausation was at best awkward on the facts of this case.\n\n           In the retaliatory failure-to-hire context, the specifics\n\nof the job application or applications that underlie a claim of\n\nfailure-to-hire   usually   relate   most   naturally    to   the   adverse\n\nemployment action prong of such a claim.       Put most simply, in the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fabsence of a job application, there cannot be a failure-to-hire.\n\nWe are not suggesting that there was a complete absence of a job\n\napplication in this case.   But Velez only sent two general letters\n\nin August 2001 expressing interest in any available job.4    Guided\n\nby some precedents from the other circuits, we conclude that such\n\ngeneral letters ordinarily cannot be the predicate for the adverse\n\nemployment action prong in a retaliatory failure-to-hire case.\n\nInstead, a plaintiff alleging such a claim must show that (1) she\n\napplied for a particular position (2) which was vacant and (3) for\n\nwhich she was qualified.    In addition, she must show that she was\n\nnot hired for that position.\n\n          In Morgan v. Fed. Home Loan Mort. Corp., 328 F.3d 647,651\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003), the court held that the plaintiff claiming a\n\nretaliatory failure-to-hire must show \"that he applied for an\n\navailable job; and . . . that he was qualified for that position.\"\n\nThe court later reiterated this formulation of the required prima\n\nfacie showing in Carter v.

Me. 2003) (applying the Brown standard and holding that a\n\ngeneral expression of interest in, without formal application for,\n\na position is insufficient to support a legal claim of adverse\n\nemployment action).      Indeed, the Brown case provides the closest\n\nfactual    similarity    we   have   found     to   this   case.     There,   the\n\nplaintiff repeatedly requested a promotion, without success, but\n\nher claim for failure-to-promote was dismissed by the district\n\ncourt because of her inability to identify any specific positions\n\nfor which she had applied.         163 F.3d at 708-09.       The Second Circuit\n\naffirmed   the   district     court's     decision    on    the   ground   that    a\n\nfailure-to-promote claim necessitates a prima facie showing \"that\n\n[the plaintiff] applied for a specific position or positions.\" Id.\n\nat 710.     In its decision, the court explicitly articulated the\n\nconcern that, absent this showing, employees could establish a\n\nclaim without identifying a particular application that gave rise\n\nto the alleged adverse employment action.             Id.\n\n            This specificity requirement is sensible and fair.                    An\n\nopen-ended request for employment should not put a burden on an\n\nemployer to review an applicant's generally stated credentials any\n\ntime a position becomes available, at the risk of a Title VII\n\nclaim.     If we were to find such a general request the legal\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fequivalent of an application, we would require employers to answer\n\nfor their failure to hire individuals who did nothing more than\n\nexpress a desire to be employed.        Cf. Brown, 163 F.3d at 710\n\n(stating that general expressions of interest cannot be sufficient\n\nto state a Title VII claim because such a result would \"unfairly\n\nburden\" employers by requiring them \"to keep track of all employees\n\nwho have generally expressed an interest in promotion and consider\n\neach of them for any opening for which they are qualified but did\n\nnot   specifically   apply\").   A   failure-to-hire   claim   obviously\n\ndepends on the availability of a job opening.    It is not unfair or\n\nunduly burdensome to expect a plaintiff to submit an application\n\nfor that vacancy as a prerequisite for stating a failure-to-hire\n\nclaim.   In short, we do not believe an employer is obliged to\n\ndefend its decision not to hire an individual for a position for\n\nwhich she has not specifically applied.6\n\n           The parties in this case dispute whether there was a\n\nvacant position at the relevant time.    Janssen argues that the MPF\n\nposition was not available to external candidates at the time it\n\nreceived Velez's August 2001 letters.    Velez places heavy emphasis\n\non Janssen's advertisement for the two MPF openings only three days\n\n\n\n6\n   Like the Second Circuit, we recognize the potential for\nexceptions to this general rule.     See Brown, 163 F.3d at 710\n(\"[T]he general rule . . . is subject to modification where the\nfacts of a particular case make an allegation of a specific\napplication a quixotic requirement.\").\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fafter her rejection letter stated that she would not be considered\n\ndue to \"business needs.\" Although Janssen has offered explanations\n\nfor this seeming-contradiction, Velez has raised a sufficient\n\nfactual dispute to foreclose summary judgment on the issue of a job\n\nvacancy when Velez submitted her August letters.\n\n          Velez has, nonetheless, failed to make a prima facie\n\nshowing of an adverse employment action.   She stated only that she\n\nwas \"interested in being considered for any position available such\n\nas manufacturing supervisor, warehouse supervisor, maintenance\n\nsupervisor, utilities supervisor, quality engineer, preventive\n\nmaintenance supervisor or any other position.\"       Such a letter\n\nmerely expresses interest in a wide range of positions.    It is not\n\nthe application for a discrete, identifiable position required\n\nunder § 704(a) of Title VII.     On that basis alone, the district\n\ncourt properly entered summary judgment for Janssen on Velez's\n\nTitle VII claim.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          Velez argues that the district court erroneously granted\n\nsummary judgment for Janssen under Law 115 of the Puerto Rico code.\n\nTitle VII and Law 115 are largely symmetrical in scope.   See, e.g.,\n\nSalva v. Eagle Global Logistics, __ F. Supp.2d __, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2685109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nat *4 (D.P.R. Sept. 18, 2006).   Velez argues, however, that even if\n\nher Title VII claim were appropriately rejected, her Law 115 claim\n\nshould survive because the defendant-employer's burden is greater\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\funder that law.    We do not have to address that contention here.\n\nWe have affirmed summary judgment on her Title VII claim based on\n\nthe   deficiency   in   her   prima   facie   showing    for    the   adverse\n\nemployment action element of a retaliation claim.                 Thus, the\n\ndefendant's burden of proof is irrelevant.              Neither party has\n\nsuggested that the prima facie showing for a Law 115 claim is\n\ndistinct from that required for a Title VII claim.             Because Velez\n\nhas not shown that she suffered an adverse employment action under\n\nthe latter, she has likewise not made such a showing under the\n\nformer.\n\n           We note an arguable alternative ground for decision\n\nwithout deciding its merits.      The language of Law 115 raises the\n\npossibility (although not mentioned by either party or the district\n\ncourt) that Velez's claim is not cognizable under Law 115.                The\n\nprovision under which Velez makes her claim states: \"No employer\n\nmay . . . discriminate against an employee regarding the terms,\n\nconditions, compensation, location, benefits or privileges of the\n\nemployment should the employee offer or attempt to offer, verbally\n\nor in writing, any testimony, expression or information before a .\n\n. . judicial forum in Puerto Rico . . . .\"       P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,\n\n§ 194a(a).     In order to prevail on a claim under Law 115, a\n\nplaintiff-employee must show that she engaged in protected activity\n\nand that she was thereafter \"discriminated against regarding her\n\nemployment.\"   Salva,__ F. Supp.2d __, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2685109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f            Title VII, however, explicitly protects both \"employees\n\n[and]   applicants      for   employment\"      against    retaliatory\n\ndiscrimination.    42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).      Title VII's explicit\n\nembrace of applicants appears, therefore, to be broader than Law\n\n115's coverage of employees only.      Nonetheless, we do not explore\n\nthis potential difference between the two statutes because Velez's\n\nclaim must be dismissed in any event.     As discussed above, Law 115\n\nrequires the same prima facie showing of an \"adverse employment\n\naction\" as Title VII.    Thus, Velez's claim fails, as a matter of\n\nlaw, because she has not applied for a specific and available\n\nposition.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            We hold that a plaintiff asserting a Title VII claim of\n\nretaliatory discrimination based on a failure-to-hire must, in\n\norder to establish an adverse employment action, make a prima facie\n\nshowing that (1) she applied for a particular position (2) which\n\nwas vacant and (3) for which she was qualified.     In addition, she\n\nmust show that she was not hired for that position.          For the\n\nreasons discussed above, Velez has not made such a showing here.\n\nThus, we affirm summary judgment for appellee Janssen on Velez's\n\nTitle VII and Law 115 claims.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f</pre>",
