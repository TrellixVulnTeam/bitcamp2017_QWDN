Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                  Boudin, John R. Gibson,* and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Shannon Frison with whom Frison Law Firm, P.C. was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Argie K. Shapiro with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General,\nand James J. Arguin, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwere on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 4, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.       In 1998, Jordan Martell Rice was\n\nconvicted     in   Massachusetts    state      court   of    the    murder     of   his\n\nneighbor Diane Harrigan.           Harrigan was raped and then fatally\n\nstabbed eleven times; afterward, the couch on which she was raped\n\nand stabbed and the bed on which her body was placed were set\n\nafire.    After a four-day trial, a jury convicted Rice of arson and\n\nfirst-degree murder by reason of extreme atrocity and cruelty and\n\nhe was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for\n\nmurder, concurrent with a 19- to 20-year prison term for arson.\n\n              There was substantial evidence at the trial that Rice had\n\ncommitted the rape, the murder and the arson.                 This included DNA\n\nevidence that Rice was the source of sperm found in the victim.\n\nFurther, he had initially denied to police that he had ever had\n\nsexual relations with her but admitted at trial that they had had\n\nsexual relations on the day before her death.               But, said Rice, this\n\nhad    been   consensual,    earlier     in    the   day    and    at    a   different\n\nlocation.      He denied any involvement in the crimes.\n\n              However,   several    different        witnesses          testified   to\n\ninculpatory statements by Rice on several different occasions, some\n\nclose to the time of the crime and others considerably later.                       The\n\nmost damning were statements on two different occasions amounting\n\nto    confessions;    one   was   that    Rice   had   had    a    girlfriend       who\n\n\"disrespected him, and he had gotten rid of her, and had put plenty\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fof holes in her and burned her.\"         The jury convicted after four\n\ndays of deliberation.\n\n            Rice thereafter filed a post-conviction motion for a new\n\ntrial in state court, alleging inter alia that he had been denied\n\neffective assistance of counsel because his lawyer had not acted to\n\npreserve,   test   and   present   \"potentially   exculpatory   forensic\n\nevidence at the crime scene.\"       The state trial court denied the\n\nmotion and the Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") affirmed, saying\n\nthat Rice \"had made no showing that any tests would have produced\n\nsomething that likely would have influenced the outcome of the\n\ncase.\"   Commonwealth v. Rice, 805 N.E.2d 26, 38 (2004).\n\n            Rice then sought habeas review in the federal district\n\ncourt on a host of grounds, but was denied relief.       Our review of\n\nthis is effectively review of the SJC's disposition, Teti v.\n\nBender, 507 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2007), which is cabined by\n\nstatute and case law: pertinently, state court factual findings are\n\npresumed correct and the SJC's legal determinations are to be\n\noverturned only if unreasonable or contrary to clearly established\n\nfederal law.    28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)-(e) (2006); see also McCambridge\n\nv. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            The competency claim before us, based on a certificate of\n\nappealability, requires some context to be understood.          A large\n\nnumber of items in the victim's apartment were collected by the\n\npolice and catalogued, many apparently stained with blood; the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fprosecution had a few tested which proved by DNA analysis to be\n\nthat of the victim.    Nothing suggested that the attacker had been\n\nwounded and, apparently assuming with some reason that the badly\n\nwounded victim was the source of all of the blood, the prosecution\n\nleft it at that.\n\n          The gist of Rice's competency claim is that defense\n\ncounsel should have insisted on DNA testing of all of the blood or\n\nhair samples. Rice requested this of his attorney but the attorney\n\ndid not do so.     And even if all the DNA samples belonged to the\n\nvictim, the jury (Rice argues) could have found it exculpatory that\n\nno DNA evidence directly tied Rice to the immediate crime scene.\n\nSo, he says, defense counsel ought to have moved to test all 65\n\nitems from the scene that had blood, hair, or fibers affixed.\n\n          To prevail, a defendant must show that the counsel's\n\nperformance was unreasonable and that the outcome would likely have\n\nbeen different but for the error.      Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 668, 687-92 (1984).      The prejudice requirement has been\n\nvariously stated, Sleeper v. Spencer, 510 F.3d 32, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); in practice, at least, perhaps more egregious errors may\n\nmore readily be deemed prejudicial.    But in the present case there\n\nis no showing of incompetence, let alone likely prejudice.\n\n          At trial Rice's counsel presented what appears to be a\n\ndecent defense.      There was no eye-witness proof that he had\n\ncommitted the crime; Rice gave testimony explaining the forensic\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fevidence   (although    the   original   false   denial   remained);1    and\n\ncounsel's efforts kept jury deliberations going for four days and\n\nresulted in an acquittal on the rape charge.\n\n           Further, counsel took advantage of the lack of any other\n\nforensic evidence linking Rice to the crime scene.          The defense's\n\nclosing argument stressed the fact that the Commonwealth had not\n\npresented any fingerprints, hair samples or other DNA evidence\n\nlinking Rice to the murder itself; and, of course, the sperm DNA\n\nshowed only what Rice was now prepared to admit, namely, voluntary\n\nsexual relations.      But the question remains to be answered:         What\n\nwas to be lost by pressing for the testing of the other items?\n\n           Defense counsel had to consider the likelihood that\n\nfurther forensic testing on items found in the apartment would have\n\nprovided a link to Rice, thus supplying the missing forensic link.\n\nCounsel's judgment in situations like this is accorded great\n\nrespect.   Sleeper, 510 F.3d at 38-39.       Rice's trial counsel, who\n\nhad defended many murder cases, rejected Rice's request for testing\n\nbut made numerous pre-trial motions, including a motion to suppress\n\nthe results of DNA testing of sperm found in the victim’s body and\n\nmotions to hire a microbiologist and population frequency expert.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Rice's position at trial was that he was having an affair\nwith the victim and that he and the victim had engaged in sexual\nrelations at approximately 4 p.m. the afternoon of her death--the\nlatter occurring sometime between 1:15 and 4:40 a.m. the next\nmorning.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          On appeal Rice argues that he had already admitted having\n\nsexual relations with the victim, so DNA evidence linking him to\n\nher apartment would have left him no worse off; and evidence\n\nshowing the presence of someone else could have helped his cause.\n\nBut the sexual relations, according to Rice, had occurred elsewhere\n\nand DNA evidence showing Rice at the victim's apartment, especially\n\nif derived from blood stains, could have made his position worse.\n\nOne can challenge witnesses who say that the defendant confessed;\n\nforensic evidence would have made the defense hopeless.\n\n          In addition, nothing creates any likelihood that the\n\nresult of forensic testing would have been exculpatory, let alone\n\nso exculpatory as to overturn a conviction heavily supported by\n\nfour different witnesses testifying to incriminating statements by\n\nRice, two of them constituting virtual confessions.    Prejudice is\n\nan independent requirement for relief, and Rice's argument as to\n\nprejudice rests almost entirely upon \"mays\" and \"could haves.\"\n\n          On appeal, Rice points us to an affidavit from a forensic\n\ngeneticist submitted for the first time in this court and so not\n\npart of the record, In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 186 F.3d\n\n46, 49-50 (1st Cir. 1999), and so has been stricken.    Apart from\n\nquestioning the DNA evidence against Rice (an irrelevance since\n\nRice admits to sexual relations with the victim), the affidavit\n\nsays in entirely general terms that testing \"may\" have proved the\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fpresence of someone aside from Rice.   This, as already explained,\n\nis not enough.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Rice's trial counsel, who had defended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*526</span> many murder cases, rejected Rice's request for testing but made numerous pre-trial motions, including a motion to suppress the results of DNA testing of sperm found in the victim's body and motions to hire a microbiologist and population frequency expert.</p>\n<p>On appeal Rice argues that he had already admitted having sexual relations with the victim, so DNA evidence linking him to her apartment would have left him no worse off; and evidence showing the presence of someone else could have helped his cause. But the sexual relations, according to Rice, had occurred elsewhere and DNA evidence showing Rice at the victim's apartment, especially if derived from blood stains, could have made his position worse. One can challenge witnesses who say that the defendant confessed; forensic evidence would have made the defense hopeless.</p>\n<p>In addition, nothing creates any <i>likelihood</i> that the result of forensic testing would have been exculpatory, let alone so exculpatory as to overturn a conviction heavily supported by four different witnesses testifying to incriminating statements by Rice, two of them constituting virtual confessions. Prejudice is an independent requirement for relief, and Rice's argument as to prejudice rests almost entirely upon \"mays\" and \"could haves.\"</p>\n<p>On appeal, Rice points us to an affidavit from a forensic geneticist submitted for the first time in this court and so not part of the record, <i>In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198590\"><a href=\"/opinion/198590/colonial-mortgage-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49-50 (1st Cir.1999), and so has been stricken. Apart from questioning the DNA evidence against Rice (an irrelevance since Rice admits to sexual relations with the victim), the affidavit says in entirely general terms that testing \"may\" have proved the presence of someone aside from Rice. This, as already explained, is not enough.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Rice's position at trial was that he was having an affair with the victim and that he and the victim had engaged in sexual relations at approximately 4 p.m. the afternoon of her death  the latter occurring sometime between 1:15 and 4:40 a.m. the next morning.</p>\n\n</div>",
