Tauro,           U.S. District Judge]\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jerome J. Froelich, Jr., and McKenney & Froelich on brief for\nappellant.\n     Carmen M. Ortiz, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               May 26, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam.   Daniel DelPiano pled guilty to conspiring\n\nwith others to defraud a commercial lender, Microfinancial, Inc.,\n\ninto providing his company, Premier Holidays International, Inc.,\n\nwith a line of credit of $12 million.1      After United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), DelPiano was sentenced to 60 months'\n\nimprisonment, the statutory maximum, which was three months below\n\nthe bottom of the otherwise applicable guideline sentencing range.\n\nOn appeal, DelPiano challenges his sentence on the sole ground that\n\nthe sentence imposed is contrary to the court's findings in his\n\nfavor at the sentencing hearing.     Notably, he does not argue that\n\nthe district court failed to make factual findings on disputed\n\nissues, made factual or legal errors in applying the guidelines,2\n\nor imposed an unreasonably high sentence under Booker.\n\n          The district court's \"reasoning can . . . be inferred by\n\ncomparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-\n\nsentence report with what the judge did.\"         United States v.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc); see\n\n\n     1\n      The details of this fraudulent scheme are set forth in this\ncourt's affirmance of a $23 million civil judgment against\nDelPiano's company arising from the same scheme, Microfinancial,\nInc. v. Premier Holidays Int'l, Inc., 385 F.3d 72, 75-76 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n     2\n      In the district court, DelPiano argued that one of his two\nprior convictions should not have been counted in determining his\ncriminal history category because he was not sentenced to\nimprisonment or probation but only required to pay a fine.     On\nappeal, he alludes to, but does not brief, that argument.\nTherefore, we need not address it. Lupien v. City of Marlborough,\n387 F.3d 83, 89 n.4 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                               -2-\n\falso United States v. Cruz, 981 F.2d 613, 618 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nBecause   the    court    imposed   a   guidelines    sentence,    it   was   not\n\nrequired to state its reasons with specificity in the written\n\njudgment.       See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).           Its reasoning is fully\n\nconsistent with the sentence imposed.\n\n            In particular, we infer that the district court rejected\n\nDelPiano's request for an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction\n\nfor the primary reason argued by the government--DelPiano's failure\n\nto provide complete and accurate information about his financial\n\nsituation.      That failure was fully detailed in the presentence\n\nreport.      Although DelPiano's counsel took the \"position [that\n\nDelPiano]    provided     the    financial    information,\"   he    offered   no\n\nevidence to contradict the contrary findings of the presentence\n\nreport, with which the district court was familiar and whose\n\nfindings the court adopted in its written statement of reasons. We\n\nfurther   infer    that    the    district    court   was   not    sufficiently\n\nimpressed by the limited extent of DelPiano's cooperation, as\n\ndescribed by a testifying government agent, to grant an acceptance-\n\nof-responsibility reduction on that ground.            Because the district\n\ncourt's denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction was\n\nconsistent with these implicit reasons, it is immaterial that the\n\ncourt expressly declined to rely on DelPiano's recent arrest as a\n\nfurther reason for declining to grant such a reduction.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f              As to calculation of the criminal history category--the\n\nonly other disputed issue--we infer that the district court relied\n\non the calculations contained in the presentence report,                     which\n\nplaced DelPiano in criminal history category II based on his two\n\nprior convictions, and that it rejected DelPiano's argument that\n\none of the convictions should not be counted for the same reasons\n\nstated by the probation officer in overruling DelPiano's objection\n\nto the presentence report on that ground.                  DelPiano's contention\n\nthat the district court agreed with his argument on that point is\n\nnot supported by the transcript of the sentencing hearing.                  Taken\n\nin context, it is apparent that the court was agreeing to disregard\n\nonly DelPiano's recent arrest--not his prior conviction.\n\n              We   further     infer   that   the    court     agreed    with   the\n\ngovernment's       arguments    that   a   60-month    sentence     was   further\n\nwarranted \"based on other factors . . . under [18 U.S.C. §] 3553(a)\n\n. . ., not only just the seriousness of the offense but the\n\nbackground and characteristics of the defendant and trying to\n\nreflect   a    sentence      that   [provides]      just    punishment    for   the\n\noffense.\"      DelPiano made no argument that the statutory factors\n\nwarranted a lesser sentence.\n\n              Given the above inferences, all of which are supported by\n\nthe record, there is no inconsistency between the district court's\n\nreasoning and the 60-month sentence imposed.                   Nor is there any\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\finconsistency between the district court's written statement of\n\nreasons and its oral statements at sentencing.\n\n          Accordingly, the sentence is summarily affirmed.
