Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Brian J. Kelly, with whom Roland Orlandi was on brief for\nappellants.\n     A. Neil Hartzell, with whom David J. Hatem, Adam P. Whitney,\nand Donovan Hatem LLP, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                May 22, 2003\n\f          Per Curiam.         The appellants in this case, Andrew and\n\nCatherine Kehoe, appeal from the district court's denial of their\n\nRule 60(b)(1) motion to vacate a judgment of dismissal on the basis\n\nof excusable neglect.         The Kehoes' travels through the federal\n\ncourts began with their bankruptcy proceedings.             After the U.S.\n\nBankruptcy     Court    granted    Norman   Novinsky's     application    for\n\nreimbursement of legal fees for services rendered during the\n\nKehoes' bankruptcy proceeding, the Kehoes appealed to the District\n\nCourt of Massachusetts.       After the district court dismissed their\n\nappeal on November 10, 1999, on the ground that the Bankruptcy\n\nCourt's order     was   not   an   appealable   final    order,   the   Kehoes\n\nappealed to this court.           After granting a series of extensions\n\nbefore oral argument, we vacated the dismissal on July 2, 2001, and\n\nremanded the case to the district court for continued proceedings.\n\n             On August 30, 2001, the district court ordered a status\n\nconference to be held on October 22, 2001.          The court sent notice\n\nof this conference to counsel of record.         After neither the Kehoes\n\nnor their counsel appeared at the conference, the court dismissed\n\nthe case on October 24, 2001.         The Kehoes took no further action\n\nuntil August 13, 2002, nearly ten months after the dismissal, when\n\nthey filed a motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) to vacate\n\nthe judgment of dismissal.         The District Court denied the motion,\n\nand the Kehoes now appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          The decision to grant relief from judgment under Rule\n\n60(b) is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\n\nWe reverse only if there has been an abuse of that discretion.\n\nStonkus v. City of Brockton Sch. Dep't, 322 F.3d 97, 100 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). The Kehoes argue that they never received the notice of the\n\nscheduling conference from the district court, and they cite their\n\nstatus as pro se plaintiffs.       Yet the Kehoes never informed the\n\nclerk's   office   that   they   would   be   representing   themselves.\n\nAdditionally, the Kehoes were aware that they had won their first\n\nappeal to this court in July 2001, yet they waited more than a year\n\nbefore inquiring into the status of their suit on remand.           They\n\noffered no explanation for this delay to the district court. While\n\nno single factor is determinative of the 60(b)(1) issue, the\n\naggregation of relevant factors confirms that the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for 60(b)(1)\n\nrelief.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f",
