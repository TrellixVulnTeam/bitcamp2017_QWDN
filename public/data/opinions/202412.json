Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Felix M.

Claimant Miriam Candelaria appeals from the\n\ndistrict court judgment affirming the denial of Social Security\n\ndisability benefits. In the underlying administrative proceedings,\n\nthe   administrative   law   judge    (ALJ)    determined    that    claimant\n\nsuffered from the following severe impairments:             (1) depression;\n\n(2) anxiety; and (3) a back condition.          The ALJ also specifically\n\ndetermined   that   claimant's   back      condition   precluded    her   from\n\nengaging in frequent bending or frequent overhead reaching --\n\nnonexertional limitations. At the end of the sequential evaluation\n\nprocess, the ALJ concluded that, although claimant could not return\n\nto her past work, she (claimant) nonetheless retained the residual\n\nfunctional capacity (RFC) to perform substantially the full range\n\nof light work and that this range had not been reduced by any\n\nnonexertional   limitations.          Using     the    Medical     Vocational\n\nGuidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, App. 2 (grid), as a\n\nframework, the ALJ concluded that claimant was not disabled.\n\nAlthough we reject most of claimant's arguments on appeal, we agree\n\nwith her that reliance on the grid in this case was in error.\n\n           Where a claimant cannot return to her past work, as here,\n\nthe Commissioner bears the burden of proving the existence of other\n\njobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform.                See\n\nOrtiz v. Sec'y of HHS, 890 F.2d 520, 524 (1st Cir. 1989) (per\n\ncuriam).   The grid allows the Commissioner to satisfy this burden\n\nwithout having to resort to the testimony of a vocational expert\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f(VE).    Id.   However, the use of the grid is permissible only if a\n\nclaimant's nonexertional limitations do not impose significant\n\nrestrictions on the range of work that the claimant is exertionally\n\nable    to   perform.   Id.     In   situations    where   a   nonexertional\n\nimpairment does \"significantly affect\" a claimant's capacity to\n\nperform the full range of jobs she is otherwise exertionally\n\ncapable of performing, \"the [Commissioner] must carry [her] burden\n\nof proving the availability of jobs in the national economy by\n\nother means, typically through the use of a vocational expert.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n             Here, there is no question that claimant's inability to\n\nbend frequently does not significantly affect the full range of\n\nlight work that she otherwise can perform.           The Commissioner, in\n\ndescribing what nonexertional abilities are necessary to perform\n\nthe full range of light work, has stated that a person \"would need\n\nto [bend] only occasionally.\"        Social Security Ruling 83-14, 1983\n\nWL 31254, at *2 (emphasis added).           Because the ALJ's findings did\n\nnot    preclude   claimant    from   such   occasional   bending   --   which\n\nfindings are supported by the non-examining RFC assessment --\n\nclaimant's limitation in this regard did not prevent reliance on\n\nthe grid.\n\n             As for the ability to reach, the Commissioner has stated\n\nthat this ability -- which is defined as \"extending the hands and\n\narms in any direction\" -- is required \"in almost all jobs\" and that\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f\"[s]ignificant limitations of reaching . . . may eliminate a large\n\nnumber    of    occupations          a   person      could    otherwise     do.\"   Social\n\nSecurity Ruling 85-15, 1985 WL 56857, at *7.                          As a result, the\n\nCommissioner has explained that \"[v]arying degrees of limitations\n\n[in reaching] would have different effects, and the assistance of\n\na [VE] may be needed to determine the effects of the limitations.\"\n\nId.\n\n               Here,      the    ALJ     found    only    a   limited     restriction   on\n\nreaching       --   i.e.,       he   found    that    claimant    was     precluded   from\n\nfrequent overhead reaching.                  Apparently, since the ALJ determined\n\nthat claimant's capacity for the full range of light work had not\n\nbeen reduced by any nonexertional limitations, he implicitly had\n\ndecided    (or      had     assumed)      that     such   a   limited     restriction   on\n\nreaching did not significantly affect this range.                         Unlike with the\n\nissue of bending, however, the Commissioner does not cite to\n\nanything in the regulations or rulings that would support the ALJ's\n\nimplicit decision.\n\n               A similar case is Mondragon v. Apfel, 3 Fed. Appx. 912\n\n(10th Cir. 2001).                In Mondragon, the ALJ had determined that\n\nalthough the claimant could not return to her former work, she\n\nnonetheless         could    perform       light     work     which   (1)   permitted   an\n\noccasional change of position and (2) did not require \"regular\n\noverhead reaching or lifting.\"                     Id. at 915 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).                  Based on \"his own impression\" that\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fmost light jobs \"allow for occasional change of position and do not\n\nrequire regular overhead reaching,\" the ALJ relied on the grid to\n\nfind that the claimant was not disabled.       See id.    The Tenth\n\nCircuit ordered a remand for the purpose of obtaining the testimony\n\nof a VE, noting that the ALJ's \"impression\" that the claimant could\n\nperform most light jobs was not supported either by such testimony\n\nor by any other source.   Id. at 917.\n\n           We think that the same reasoning applies here. The ALJ's\n\nassumption (or implicit decision) that the full range of light work\n\nwould not be significantly reduced by a limited restriction on\n\noverhead reaching may very well be correct.      However, the only\n\nsupport for this assumption is, as in Mondragon, the ALJ's own\n\nimpression. In such a situation, we think that an expert's opinion\n\nis required for an assessment of the significance of claimant's\n\nreaching restriction.\n\n           The judgment of the district court is vacated and the\n\ncase is remanded to that court with instructions to remand, in\n\nturn, to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.   We express no view as to the eventual outcome of the\n\nclaim.   No costs are awarded.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
