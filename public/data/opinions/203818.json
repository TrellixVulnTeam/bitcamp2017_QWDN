Castro Lang for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, was on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            May 15, 2009\n\f           LYNCH, Chief Judge.         In a crime apparently motivated by\n\njealousy over a woman, the woman's suitor, Kelvin Ramos, was taken\n\nfrom his motorcycle in a Puerto Rican housing project, forced into\n\na van by a group of assailants, including defendant, and murdered\n\nby the father of her children.         The murderer was killed, perhaps by\n\nRamos's friends, before any federal charges were brought.\n\n           The defendant here, Angel Melendez-Rivas, maintained his\n\ninnocence on the stand and said he was forced to participate in the\n\ncrime.    He was convicted of conspiracy and of aiding and abetting\n\na motor vehicle hijacking with intent to cause death, as well as of\n\na firearms offense during and in relation to the crime.                   Three\n\nother co-defendants were also charged, but the indictments against\n\nthem were dismissed without prejudice, at the government's request,\n\non the eve of trial.        Melendez-Rivas, who had no prior criminal\n\nrecord,   was   sentenced    to   50    years'   imprisonment,     after   the\n\ngovernment declined to seek the death penalty.\n\n           Melendez-Rivas     appeals,       primarily   arguing   that    the\n\nevidence was insufficient to meet the elements of the offenses of\n\nconviction and that he is entitled to an acquittal.            We disagree.\n\nDefendant's second argument is that the intervention of the trial\n\ncourt in questioning a defense witness went beyond the appropriate\n\nlimits and put prejudicial, inadmissible hearsay before the jury,\n\nto his detriment. We are sufficiently concerned about the possible\n\ninterference with defendant's fair trial rights engendered by the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fparticular questions and answers that we vacate the conviction and\n\nremand for a new trial.\n\n                                           I.\n\n                  Appeal From Denial of Rule 29 Motion\n\n           We     first    address    the       defendant's   argument     that   the\n\nevidence was insufficient.           If defendant is correct, then the case\n\nends and he may not be tried again.                See Smith v. Massachusetts,\n\n543 U.S. 462, 467 (2005) (\"[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause of the\n\nFifth    Amendment       prohibits    reexamination         of    a    court-decreed\n\nacquittal to the same extent it prohibits reexamination of an\n\nacquittal by jury verdict.\").               \"For purposes of assessing the\n\nsufficiency claim, we recite the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the verdict.\"      United States v. Upton, 559 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\nA.         Factual background\n\n           On the evening of June 16, 2005, Kelvin Ramos drove his\n\nHyabusa Suzuki motorcycle to the Quintana Housing Project, where\n\nhis girlfriend Taishanet Falu lived.                He wore a red shirt, short,\n\nblack    pants,    and     jewelry,       including    a    bracelet      watch   and\n\ndistinctive gold chain.        The chain was a thick \"Cuban-type\" chain\n\nwith two panthers and the letter \"K\" on it.                           While visiting\n\nTaishanet,   Kelvin       received    a    phone     call   and   went    to   leave.\n\nTaishanet also left her home and went over to visit her sister\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fGinLin Falu Garcia and her cousin Glenda Falu Rivera, both of whom\n\nalso lived at the Quintana Project.\n\n              As Kelvin got on his motorcycle, three men surrounded\n\nhim.       At trial, Taishanet identified them as Edwin, Taishanet's\n\nestranged husband and the father of her children, Johal, a known\n\nassociate of Edwin, and Melendez-Rivas.      Edwin held a gun up to\n\nKelvin's face on one side of the motorcycle, while Johal stood on\n\nthe other side of the motorcycle, and Melendez-Rivas stood behind\n\nJohal.       Taishanet yelled at Edwin and begged him not to harm\n\nKelvin, at which point Edwin said to her: \"Don't you get up close\n\nhere, because I will hit you with the gun, you little bitch.\"\n\nJohal grabbed Taishanet while Edwin confronted Kelvin and told him\n\nto pull up his shirt.      Kelvin pulled out his gun from under his\n\nshirt and gave it to Edwin, who handed the gun to Melendez-Rivas.\n\nTaishanet continued to beg Edwin not to hurt Kelvin.     Kelvin told\n\nher he would be fine and asked her to leave.\n\n              Soon after, \"Bondy,\" co-defendant Luis Nieves-Burgos,\n\narrived in a white and gray van.1       Bondy got out of the van as\n\nEdwin and Melendez-Rivas struggled with Kelvin to get him off the\n\n       1\n          The government's theory of the events of June 16 differs\nsubstantially from the defendant's account of the events that\nevening, as we discuss later in more detail.        The government\ntheorized based on Taishanet's testimony that Bondy drove the van\nto the scene of the kidnapping, that Johal drove the van away, and\nthat the defendant was already there with Edwin and Johal before\nthe van arrived. The defendant testified that he drove the van to\nand from the scene, an account consistent with the testimony of one\ngovernment eyewitness.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fmotorcycle and into the back of the van.   Edwin and Melendez-Rivas\n\nforced Kelvin into the van, which Johal then drove away.\n\n           Shortly afterward, \"Jonty,\" co-defendant John T. Ayala,\n\narrived with \"Pupen,\" co-defendant José Luis Cora-Meléndez.    They\n\ntried to start the motorcycle but were unable to ride it.     Later,\n\nGuillermo Rodriguez arrived and drove the motorcycle away.\n\n           Taishanet then returned to her house with her sister, who\n\ncontacted Kelvin's wife, Irysa García-Reyes to let her know what had\n\nhappened   to   Kelvin and that she thought he had been killed.\n\nTaishanet tried to call Kelvin's cell phone several times; once,\n\nEdwin picked up, and when Taishanet told him not to harm Kelvin,\n\nEdwin started laughing.\n\n           Taishanet testified that later that evening, she saw\n\nEdwin and Melendez-Rivas in the project.    She saw that Edwin was\n\nwearing Kelvin's jewelry. Edwin said to her, \"I gave him 30 because\n\nhe is a pig.\"\n\n           Kelvin's body was found two days later with thirty-two\n\ngunshot wounds.     There was no physical evidence other than the\n\njewelry linking the death to the defendant.       The government's\n\nargument at trial was that the defendant's presence at the scene\n\nwhere Kelvin was forced off his motorcycle and the fact that Edwin\n\nhanded Melendez-Rivas Kelvin's gun proved intent to aid and abet.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fB.        Sufficiency challenge\n\n          Defendant's argument that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for acquittal is based on a misapprehension of\n\nthe elements of the statutory offense; it is also foreclosed by\n\ncircuit precedent.   Our review is de novo both because we are\n\nreviewing evidentiary sufficiency and because we are interpreting\n\nthe terms of a statute.   United States v. Teleguz, 492 F.3d 80, 86\n\n(1st Cir. 2007) (\"Our review of legal questions is de novo, and we\n\nreview the entire record on [the defendant's] sufficiency claim.\").\n\n          If a reasonable factfinder could have found the defendant\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we must affirm.   United States v.\n\nLipscomb, 539 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"Viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most flattering to the jury's guilty verdict, we assess\n\nwhether a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that the\n\ndefendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\").\n\n          Here, the jury answered a special verdict that \"the\n\ntaking of the motorcycle occur[red] with the intent to cause death\n\nor serious bodily injury [to Kelvin Ramos]\" and that \"[t]he intent\n\nor motive behind the killing of [Ramos] was . . . jealousy.\"\n\n          Melendez-Rivas argues from this second finding.    He says\n\nthe relevant motive which separates the federal crime from a state\n\ncrime is the motive for the ultimate killing (not the taking of the\n\nvehicle), and since the motive for the killing found by the jury\n\nhere was jealousy, no federal crime was committed.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f            He is wrong.     Not only does the specific language of the\n\nstatute say otherwise but our case law has already rejected this\n\nargument.\n\n            The statute reads:\n\n            Whoever, with the intent to cause death or\n            serious bodily harm takes a motor vehicle that\n            has been transported, shipped, or received in\n            interstate or foreign commerce from the person\n            or presence of another by force and violence\n            or by intimidation, or attempt to do so, shall\n            . . . (3) if death results, be fined under\n            this title or imprisoned for any number of\n            years up to life, or both, or sentenced to\n            death.\n\n18 U.S.C § 2119(3) (emphasis added).\n\n            The requisite intent was that first found by the jury:\n\nthat at the time the victim's motorcycle was taken, it was done with\n\nthe intent to cause death or serious bodily injury.           The relevant\n\nintent may be conditional -- that is, the intent requirement is\n\nsatisfied   if   at   the   time   Melendez-Rivas   took   control   of   the\n\nmotorcycle, he had an intent to kill or cause serious bodily injury\n\nto the driver, whether or not the intent was necessary to take the\n\nvehicle.    Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 12 (1999) (\"The\n\nintent requirement of § 2119 is satisfied when the Government proves\n\nthat at the moment the defendant demanded or took control over the\n\ndriver's [vehicle] the defendant possessed the intent to seriously\n\nharm or kill the driver if necessary to steal the [vehicle] (or,\n\nalternatively, if unnecessary to steal the [vehicle]).\").                 The\n\nstatute does not require that the taking of the motor vehicle be \"an\n\n                                     -7-\n\fultimate motive for the crime.\"       United States v. Rivera-Figueroa,\n\n149 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998).         Rather, \"[i]t is enough that the\n\ndefendant be aware that the action in which he is engaged, whether\n\nby himself or through direction or assistance to another, involves\n\nthe taking of a motor vehicle.\"        Id.\n\n              More recently, in United States v. García-Álvarez, 541\n\nF.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2008), this court rejected an argument similar to\n\ndefendant's.     Defendant there argued that he took the victim's car\n\nsolely for use as a getaway vehicle and that the taking of the car\n\nwas never the motive for the crime.          García-Álvarez affirmed the\n\nRivera-Figueroa holding that the taking of a vehicle need not be the\n\nultimate motive for the crime under § 2119(3).             Id. at 6.\n\n              Based on the evidence here, Melendez-Rivas had to be\n\naware that he was involved in the taking of a motor vehicle, and\n\nthat Ramos had already started the motorcycle when Melendez-Rivas\n\nand his co-defendants surrounded him.        They had to take control of\n\nthe motorcycle in order to subdue Ramos.        In doing so, they pointed\n\na gun at the victim, showing an intent to cause death or serious\n\ninjury, an intent reinforced by what happened next.            The evidence,\n\nviewed   in    the   light   most   favorable   to   the    government,   was\n\nsufficient.\n\n              We affirm the denial of his motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f                                      II.\n\n       Questioning by the District Court and Answers Elicited\n\n              Two separate strands of legal doctrine are combined in\n\ndefendant's     second   challenge.      He   first   argues   that   certain\n\nquestions, which were asked by the trial judge, elicited answers\n\nthat   were   inadmissible   and   prejudicial    because      the   responses\n\nerroneously suggested to the jury that Melendez-Rivas was involved\n\nin other crimes not charged in the instant indictment.\n\n              Secondly, defendant argues, the prejudicial effect on\n\ndefendant was made worse by the fact that it was the trial judge who\n\nasked the questions sua sponte and then refused to give any curative\n\ninstruction.     In reviewing the district court's questioning, our\n\n\"inquiry . . . necessarily turns on the question of whether the\n\ncomplaining party can show serious prejudice.\"          Logue v. Dore, 103\n\nF.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nA.            Conflicting testimony presented at trial\n\n              We set the stage.       The evidence presented was largely\n\ntestimonial, and the witnesses' accounts often conflicted. The jury\n\nfaced credibility contests on several central issues in the case.2\n\nFirst, Melendez-Rivas testified that he was driving the van home,\n\n\n\n       2\n          Indeed, at closing argument, the prosecution emphasized\nthe inconsistencies and credibility contests in the case,\ncharacterizing the defendant's account as too \"convenient\" to be\nbelieved, and insisting that Taishanet could not have simply\n\"ma[d]e . . . up\" her account.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwhen he arrived at a spot in the street where he was blocked by the\n\nkidnappers who were confronting Kelvin.         He further testified that\n\nhe only became involved in driving the getaway van because he had\n\nbeen threatened by Edwin and Johal, who carried loaded guns when\n\nthey demanded he become involved and drive the van.            He feared he\n\nwould be killed if he did not participate.       He said he did not force\n\nKelvin into the van.      Finally, he also testified that he had no\n\nprior criminal record and was not friendly with the other men\n\naccused of kidnapping Kelvin.        The crime was motivated by Edwin's\n\njealousy, the defendant claimed, and he carried no grudge against\n\nKelvin and had no reason to be involved in killing him. We describe\n\nthe testimony in more detail below.\n\n           The prosecution anticipated and countered defendant's\n\nthemes with Taishanet's testimony, which was the primary evidence\n\npresented against the defendant at trial.3         Taishanet's testimony\n\npainted a picture of voluntary participation by the defendant.\n\nTaishanet placed the defendant as already at the basketball court\n\nwith   Edwin   and   Johal:   she   testified   that   the   three   of   them\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          Defendant also argues that the prosecution engaged in\nimproper vouching during its questioning of Taishanet and that the\ndistrict court erred in admitting her testimony that the FBI had\ninstructed her to tell the truth. The defendant did not object on\nthis basis in the district court, and therefore our review is for\nplain error. There was no error in this regard, let alone plain\nerror.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fconfronted Kelvin and forced him off his motorcycle.4   Indeed, the\n\ndefendant took the gun from Edwin when Edwin disarmed Kelvin.   This\n\nwas the strongest evidence at trial contradicting defendant's claim\n\nof coercion.\n\n           Taishanet testified that Bondy, not Melendez-Rivas, then\n\narrived in a white van and that it was Edwin, Johal, and the\n\ndefendant who forced Kelvin into the van. She stated that Bondy got\n\nout of the truck, that Edwin and Melendez-Rivas forced Kelvin into\n\nthe back of the van, and that Johal (not defendant) then got into\n\nthe van and drove it away.   Further, she testified that later that\n\nevening, she saw Edwin, accompanied by Melendez-Rivas, and that\n\nEdwin (and not Melendez-Rivas) was wearing Kelvin's jewelry.    The\n\ndefendant, by contrast, claimed he did not see Edwin and Johal until\n\nthe next day.\n\n           To attack Taishanet's credibility, defense counsel on\n\ncross-examination elicited testimony from Taishanet that she never\n\nreported Kelvin's kidnapping to the police, that she had received\n\n$2600 for her testimony, and that she associated with several\n\nnotorious local criminals and had never reported their criminal\n\nactivities.\n\n           One of the prosecution's two other eyewitnesses, GinLin,\n\narrived on the scene after the altercation had already begun and so\n\n     4\n          Although witnesses and the government described Kelvin as\nTaishanet's boyfriend, she denied having a romantic relationship\nwith him and stated that they were just friends.\n\n                                -11-\n\fcould not address whether defendant initially had been forced to\n\nparticipate.      Her testimony confirmed only that Melendez-Rivas had\n\ndriven the van away, a point Melendez-Rivas admitted, but that\n\nconflicted with Taishanet's testimony that Johal had driven the\n\ngetaway vehicle.      She further testified that Edwin and Johal (and\n\nnot    Melendez-Rivas)    dragged   Kelvin    into   the   van,   which   was\n\nconsistent with Melendez-Rivas's testimony.           She also said that\n\nlater that evening, she saw the defendant (rather than Edwin, as\n\nTaishanet had testified) wearing Kelvin's \"K\" necklace, and that he\n\nwas standing with Edwin and Johal.\n\n            The     prosecution's    third     eyewitness, Glenda, whose\n\ncredibility was under heavy attack at trial, testified she saw Edwin\n\npoint a gun at Kelvin to force him off the motorcycle and that Johal\n\nand the defendant were there.         She testified that she then ran\n\nupstairs into her aunt's house.            Her testimony did not address\n\nwhether defendant was participating voluntarily. She testified that\n\nshe then ran out onto the balcony and saw Edwin put Kelvin into the\n\nvan.    She stated that Melendez-Rivas got into the front passenger\n\ndoor of the van before it drove away.        She did not see who drove the\n\nvan away.    She testified that she later saw Edwin, but that she\n\ncould not identify who he was with.\n\n            Glenda admitted that she initially told the FBI agents\n\nthat she only saw Edwin and Johal on June 16, and that after being\n\nshown a picture of Melendez-Rivas she told the agents that she had\n\n                                    -12-\n\fnot seen him.        Cross-examination further elicited that two FBI\n\nagents had approached Glenda three months later and told her that\n\nthey believed that Melendez-Rivas was involved and that she had\n\ncommitted a very serious crime by not giving them the information\n\nthey wanted.        Only after that did she say that she had seen the\n\ndefendant on the evening of June 16.\n\n              The   prosecution    presented   additional   evidence    in   an\n\neffort to refute Melendez-Rivas's defense theories in several ways.\n\nIt tried to establish that: (1) Melendez-Rivas was friends with\n\nmembers of the group which had accosted Kelvin (thus making it\n\nimprobable that he was forced into participating); (2) Melendez-\n\nRivas had admitted this connection to FBI agents who investigated\n\nthe crime in the project; and (3) Melendez-Rivas had Kelvin's\n\ndistinctive jewelry, a Cuban-type chain with two panthers containing\n\na   letter.     Despite    the    difference   between   \"A\"   and   \"K,\"    the\n\nprosecution's theory was that defendant's \"A\" necklace was the same\n\n\"K\" necklace that originally belonged to Kelvin, and that defendant,\n\nprior to Kelvin's murder, had worn a simpler gold chain.             Melendez-\n\nRivas denied the first two and put on evidence (including from his\n\nwife and two jewelers who claimed to have made the necklace) of his\n\nprior ownership of the similar Cuban-type \"A\" chain.\n\n              During the defense case, Melendez-Rivas testified that\n\nalthough he was driving the white van, he was coerced into becoming\n\ninvolved in the altercation between Kelvin and Edwin, Johal, and\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fPupen.   Defendant testified that he was driving from the project\n\nbasketball court when he stopped the van near where the others were\n\nalready confronting Kelvin on his motorcycle. Defendant stated that\n\nat that time, he saw Taishanet, GinLin, and Glenda in the street.\n\nAt that point, defendant testified, Edwin and Johal had a gun on\n\nKelvin and they forced Kelvin into the rear of the van.   Edwin then\n\nwent to the front passenger door and \"told me to take off.\"\n\nMelendez-Rivas said he obeyed because Edwin \"had two weapons and I\n\nunderstood that if I didn't take off, they were going to kill me.\"\n\nHe testified that Edwin and Johal let him out of the van once they\n\nleft the housing project with Kelvin, he walked to his mother's\n\nhouse, which was also in the project, and Edwin and Johal drove the\n\nvan away with Kelvin still alive inside.    Although Taishanet and\n\nGinLin testified they saw defendant that evening in the project with\n\nEdwin,5 defendant said he did not see Edwin and Johal until the next\n\nday, when they came by to threaten defendant not to tell anything\n\nto the police.\n\n           Melendez-Rivas further testified that he had no prior\n\nrecord and he did not \"hang with\" the conspirators.    He said that\n\nalthough he knew Kelvin as an acquaintance from vocational school,\n\nhe had carried no grudge against Kelvin and had never been in a\n\n\n\n     5\n          GinLin testified to having seen Edwin, Johal, and\ndefendant, while Taishanet testified she saw only Edwin and\ndefendant. Glenda saw Edwin that evening, but she testified that\nshe could not identify who was with Edwin.\n\n                               -14-\n\ffight with him.      He also stated that he was afraid to go to the\n\npolice because he was afraid of Edwin and Johal because they ran the\n\ndrug point at the Quintana project.\n\nB.          Questioning by the district court\n\n            The   district   court's   questioning,    challenged    by   the\n\ndefendant, occurred during the re-cross-examination of a defense\n\nwitness    and   police   officer,   Victor   Rivera   Martinez,    who   was\n\nMelendez-Rivas's father-in-law.6       On re-direct, Rivera stated that\n\nhe was familiar with the neighborhood, that he knew of no close\n\nrelationship between Melendez-Rivas and Edwin and Johal, and that\n\nthis was despite the fact that Edwin and Johal were notorious\n\nfigures at the Quintana project.\n\n            Before beginning re-cross-examination, the prosecutor\n\nrequested a bench conference where she stated that, in order to\n\nundermine the defense's lack of connection theory, she wanted to ask\n\nRivera about whether he knew that defendant had admitted to the FBI\n\nthat he was in the van with Edwin and Johal on the evening of June\n\n16.   This statement was the subject of a pending suppression\n\nmotion.7    The district court determined that it would not allow\n\n\n      6\n            When Rivera took the stand, the defendant had not yet\ntestified.\n      7\n          The court completed the suppression hearing later in the\ntrial, at defense counsel's request. The court determined that\ndefendant's statements to the FBI during two separate interviews\nwere voluntary admissions, that the statements to the FBI only\nconfirmed what was already in the record, and that not only was the\ninformation admissible, \"some of it [was] even exculpatory, up to\n\n                                     -15-\n\fquestions directly about the statements to the FBI, but that the\n\nprosecution could ask about rumors regarding connections between\n\nMelendez-Rivas and the kidnappers on the evening of the kidnapping.\n\n            On   re-cross-examination,   the   prosecution,   trying   to\n\nundermine the defense's lack of connection theory, asked Rivera\n\nabout whether he had heard that the defendant, Edwin, and Johal had\n\ntaken Kelvin outside the project on the night of June 16.       A bench\n\nconference ensued over the questioning, the court directed the\n\nprosecution to ask about rumors.\n\n            The prosecution then asked whether Rivera had heard\n\nrumors as to what had happened to Kelvin on June 16.             Rivera\n\nanswered \"yes, that's right.\"    The district court then asked \"what\n\nhave you heard?\"    Rivera stated that he had heard a rumor \"[t]hat\n\nMr. Cora, Edwin and Johal took [Kelvin] out [of] the housing\n\nproject.\"   Defendant was not mentioned.   The prosecution then asked\n\nwhether Rivera had heard that it was Melendez-Rivas who took Kelvin\n\nout of the project.   Rivera responded \"Never\" and proceeded to deny\n\nhearing about any connection between the defendant and the men who\n\nhad kidnapped Kelvin.\n\n            At that point the district court intervened and asked\n\nquestions, apparently meant to refer back to the prosecution's\n\nsuggestion that defendant had earlier admitted his connection to\n\n\n\n\na certain point, in favor of [defendant].\"\n\n                                 -16-\n\fother kidnappers to the FBI agents.          The questioning went as\n\nfollows:\n\n           The Court:   Did the FBI ever interview you\n           about the facts of this case?\n\n           Rivera: They made a comment to me one time\n           when they came by the front of my house.\n\n           The Court:   And can I ask you what the comment\n           was?\n\n           Rivera: They went to the house of a neighbor,\n           and when I am coming to my house, one of the\n           agents comes up to me and says to me that my\n           son-in-law was involved in a series of felony\n           crimes that could lead to the death penalty.\n\n           Defense Counsel:   I have an objection at this\n           time.\n\n           The Court: That is what they told you?      That\n           is what they told you?\n\n           Rivera:   That is correct.\n\n           Defense Counsel:    I have an objection and a\n           motion.\n\n           The Court:    You can make your motion. Please\n           approach.\n\n           The Court:   And, of course, you did not believe\n           that?\n\n           Rivera:   No, never in my life.\n\nA bench conference ensued.    The defense objected and immediately\n\nmoved for a mistrial on the grounds that \"[Rivera] has now said that\n\nthe FBI told him that there were a series of felonies that could\n\nlead to the death penalty.     That has been introduced.      There is\n\nnothing to that.\" The court responded, \"You heard what I said, 'and\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fyou did not believe that?' And he said, 'No.'\"          Defense counsel\n\nresponded, \"But the FBI said it.\"    The court then overruled defense\n\ncounsel's objection and denied his motion for a mistrial.8\n\n           The court also denied a subsequent written motion for\n\nreconsideration of the defendant's motion for a mistrial, which\n\nelaborated on defense counsel's objections to the testimony. In the\n\nmemorandum accompanying the motion, defense counsel made three\n\ncentral arguments regarding the judge's interjection into the cross-\n\nexamination of Rivera.      First, defense counsel argued that the\n\njudge's question called for a hearsay answer and that the answer\n\nelicited was hearsay.      Second, defense counsel stated that the\n\ndeparture from the district court's otherwise neutral conduct during\n\nthe trial posed particular risks:\n\n           The Court has more credibility than either\n           party before a jury. The manner in which this\n           was done would reasonably make it seem to a\n           juror that the Court is imparting information\n           to them that it wants them especially to have\n           because of its importance.\n\nFinally,   defense   counsel   explained   the   prejudicial   effect   on\n\ndefendant's trial strategy:      \"A crucial element for the defense\n\n. . . was to highlight the fact that the defendant had no prior\n\ninvolvement with the criminal justice system, and was therefore an\n\n\n     8\n          Following the suppression hearing the next day on the\nadmissibility of defendant's statements to the FBI, the prosecution\nrecalled Rivera to ask only whether it would surprise him to learn\nthat the defendant had admitted to the FBI that he was with Edwin\nand Johal in the van on the evening of June 16 and that defendant\nhad \"hung out\" with them. Rivera said it would surprise him.\n\n                                  -18-\n\funlikely person to have been chosen to engage in the conduct of\n\nwhich he stands accused,\" and that as a result of the district\n\ncourt's question, \"the average juror will [receive] the impression\n\nthat the Court has doubts about a key element of the defense.\"      In\n\nwhat defense counsel described as \"a close case on the evidence\n\n[where] [t]here is no overwhelming proof of guilt,\" any such\n\ninfluence by the district court must affect the jury's verdict.\n\n          In the same written motion, defense counsel requested, in\n\nthe alternative, a curative instruction as follows:\n\n          You are instructed that a judge may ask\n          questions during a case. However, on occasion\n          a judge may ask a question that is not proper\n          and which you should not consider.        This\n          happened in this case. This Court asked a\n          question of the witness, Police Officer Victor\n          Rivera[,] which brought about an answer that\n          is improper for you to consider. Therefore,\n          you are instructed to strike from your minds\n          the question asked by the Court and the\n          response of the witness. It would be a\n          violation of your oath as jurors to consider\n          that question and the response to it.\n\nThe district court denied the motion altogether, including the\n\nrequested instruction.\n\nC.        The district court's denial of      the   motions   for   a\n          mistrial and curative instruction\n\n          We consider the court's questions, the elicited answers,\n\nthe refusal to give any curative instructions, and what impact they\n\nmay have had.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f             1.       Judge's power to question witnesses\n\n             The prosecution argues that the court did nothing more\n\nthan to exercise its power under Fed. R. Evid. 614(b) to interrogate\n\nwitnesses.        It is well-established that judges are free to ask\n\nquestions to elicit facts to facilitate a \"clear presentation of the\n\nissues.\"   United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d 552, 560 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).   Nonetheless, the judge's right to ask questions should\n\nbe \"exercised with care,\" Logue, 103 F.3d at 1045, particularly when\n\ndoing so may affect the rights of a criminal defendant.       The need\n\nfor restraint is related to the need for a judge to \"be balanced;\n\nhe cannot become an advocate or otherwise use his judicial powers\n\nto advantage or disadvantage a party unfairly.\"      Id.\n\n             There is particular concern when it is the judge's\n\nquestioning which brings in evidence which is both inadmissible and\n\nprejudicial hearsay.       4 J.B. Weinstein & M.A. Berger, Weinstein's\n\nFederal Evidence § 614.04[1][b], at 614-15 (J.M. McLaughlin ed., 2d\n\ned. 2006) (\"There is . . . the danger that the judge may elicit from\n\nthe witness responses hurtful to the accused, and to which the jury\n\nmay assign peculiar weight because of their ostensible judicial\n\nsponsorship.\").      Defendant argues that in a close case, the risk is\n\nparticularly acute: the judge's interjection suggested that the\n\ncourt might have additional information about defendant's guilt, and\n\ncast serious doubt on Melendez-Rivas's central defenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f              The prosecution contends the court was only seeking\n\nclarity to assist the jury.9        See Rodriguez v. Banco Cent. Corp.,\n\n990 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1993).           Although the prosecution did not\n\ncreate the problem, it is held accountable for it.\n\n              The mere crossing of the line by a diligent trial judge\n\nwill not itself lead to reversal.         United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d\n\n148, 159 (1st Cir. 1989). In evaluating whether defendant has shown\n\nsufficient prejudice, we consider all the factors in the case.               If\n\nthis   case   were   solely   to   rest    on   a   claim   that   the   court's\n\nquestioning evidenced partiality to the prosecution, we would deny\n\nrelief.    Cf. Deary v. City of Gloucester, 9 F.3d 191, 194-95 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (rejecting allegation that trial judge was so biased as\n\nto deprive defendant of a fair trial).                 A different type of\n\nprejudice is at issue here, as we explain below.\n\n              2.     Introduction    of     inadmissible     and   prejudicial\n                     hearsay\n\n              We conclude that defendant was seriously prejudiced.\n\nFirst, the question about what comments the FBI had made to the\n\nwitness called for inadmissible hearsay.            The witness's answer was\n\nnot only inadmissible, but was very harmful to the defendant: the\n\nFBI agent purportedly stated \"that [Melendez-Rivas] was involved in\n\n\n\n       9\n          The problem is not one of the judge's questioning\ninterfering with the jury's proper role.    See United States v.\nOfray-Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir. 2008). Nor is the problem\nreally one of the judge becoming a witness. See Quercia v. United\nStates, 289 U.S. 466, 470 (1933).\n\n                                    -21-\n\fa series of felony crimes that could lead to the death penalty.\"\n\nThe jury could easily have understood this to be a representation\n\nthat Melendez-Rivas was involved in other serious crimes, crimes so\n\nserious as to raise the prospect of the death penalty.              That was\n\nsimply untrue.        Second, this certainly undercut the defendant's\n\ntestimony that he had no criminal record or charges against him and\n\ndid not associate with two notorious criminals in the project.\n\n            Further, the jurors could have perceived the question as\n\nenhancing the prosecution's effort to impeach a defense witness.\n\nSee   4   Weinstein    &   Berger,   supra,    §   614.04[4][b],   at   614-27\n\n(suggesting that the trial court ought not conduct questioning that\n\nresembles a cross-examination challenging the credibility of a\n\nwitness).\n\n            Over counsel's objection, the court did not strike the\n\nanswer and tell the jury to disregard it.           Instead, the court asked\n\nagain whether that is what the FBI agents had told the witness. The\n\nwitness answered, \"That is correct.\"           This repetition, made within\n\nearshot of the jurors, reinforced the prejudicial effect.\n\n            Counsel objected again.           Before counsel could approach\n\nthe bench, the court, perhaps realizing the potential prejudice to\n\ndefendant, may have attempted to ameliorate the problem by asking\n\nif the witness believed the FBI, and then repeated that the witness\n\ndisbelieved what the FBI agents had said.               We cannot say with\n\nconfidence this ameliorated the harm.               In addition, this then\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fcreated an issue for the jury of whether the defendant's father-in-\n\nlaw or the FBI was lying.      There was never any curative instruction\n\ngiven.     The prejudice was not offset by the judge's preliminary\n\ninstructions at the start of trial.         Those instructions were that\n\n\"nothing that I may say or nothing that I may do is intended to\n\nindicate, nor should [it] be taken by you as indicating, what your\n\nverdict should be,\" and that the jury \"should never be influenced\n\nby any ruling that I make or for the reasons behind the ruling.\"\n\n             These instructions are mismatches to the problem at\n\nhand.10    Nor were instructions given which were closer to a match.\n\n             The   totality   of   the   record   shows   that   the   judge's\n\nquestions    elicited   inadmissible,      prejudicial    testimony.      The\n\ntestimony was not stricken, nor was a curative instruction given.\n\nThe inadmissible evidence contradicted one of defendant's central\n\n\n      10\n          There was, for example, no instruction that the jury\nshould not assume the court had any view on the subject of the\ncourt's questions and that the jury could disregard all the court's\nquestions. 4 Weinstein & Berger, supra, § 614.04[4][c], at 614-\n28.1 to -28.2 (\"The risk that a judge's questioning conveys a\nmessage regarding a defendant's guilt may be reduced by instructing\nthe jurors that they should not assume that the judge holds any\nopinion on the subject of the court's questions and that the jury\nmay disregard all the court's comments in arriving at its findings\nof fact.\"); see also Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez, 341 F.3d 86, 100\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"[A]ny possible risk of prejudice to [defendant]\nas a result of the judge's questions was abated by the clear\ninstruction to the jury that it should ignore any impression that\nhis questions might have had on them.\" (alterations in original)\n(quoting United States v. Henry, 136 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 1998)));\nUnited States v. Candelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d 19, 36 (1st Cir. 1999)\n(strong jury instructions sufficient to eliminate any potential\nprejudice stemming from judge's \"facial expressions\" or other signs\nof frustration exhibited in contentious trial).\n\n                                    -23-\n\fdefenses and cast doubt on the credibility of his coercion defense.\n\nWe cannot say this error was harmless.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We vacate and remand to the district court for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f",

In a crime apparently motivated by\n\njealousy over a woman, the woman's suitor, Kelvin Ramos, was taken\n\nfrom his motorcycle in a Puerto Rican housing project, forced into\n\na van by a group of assailants, including defendant, and murdered\n\nby the father of her children.         The murderer was killed, perhaps by\n\nRamos's friends, before any federal charges were brought.\n\n           The defendant here, Angel Melendez-Rivas, maintained his\n\ninnocence on the stand and said he was forced to participate in the\n\ncrime.    He was convicted of conspiracy and of aiding and abetting\n\na motor vehicle hijacking with intent to cause death, as well as of\n\na firearms offense during and in relation to the crime.                   Three\n\nother co-defendants were also charged, but the indictments against\n\nthem were dismissed without prejudice, at the government's request,\n\non the eve of trial.        Melendez-Rivas, who had no prior criminal\n\nrecord,   was   sentenced    to   50    years'   imprisonment,     after   the\n\ngovernment declined to seek the death penalty.\n\n           Melendez-Rivas     appeals,       primarily   arguing   that    the\n\nevidence was insufficient to meet the elements of the offenses of\n\nconviction and that he is entitled to an acquittal.            We disagree.\n\nDefendant's second argument is that the intervention of the trial\n\ncourt in questioning a defense witness went beyond the appropriate\n\nlimits and put prejudicial, inadmissible hearsay before the jury,\n\nto his detriment. We are sufficiently concerned about the possible\n\ninterference with defendant's fair trial rights engendered by the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fparticular questions and answers that we vacate the conviction and\n\nremand for a new trial.\n\n                                           I.\n\n                  Appeal From Denial of Rule 29 Motion\n\n           We     first    address    the       defendant's   argument     that   the\n\nevidence was insufficient.

Factual background\n\n           On the evening of June 16, 2005, Kelvin Ramos drove his\n\nHyabusa Suzuki motorcycle to the Quintana Housing Project, where\n\nhis girlfriend Taishanet Falu lived.                He wore a red shirt, short,\n\nblack    pants,    and     jewelry,       including    a    bracelet      watch   and\n\ndistinctive gold chain.        The chain was a thick \"Cuban-type\" chain\n\nwith two panthers and the letter \"K\" on it.                           While visiting\n\nTaishanet,   Kelvin       received    a    phone     call   and   went    to   leave.\n\nTaishanet also left her home and went over to visit her sister\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fGinLin Falu Garcia and her cousin Glenda Falu Rivera, both of whom\n\nalso lived at the Quintana Project.\n\n              As Kelvin got on his motorcycle, three men surrounded\n\nhim.       At trial, Taishanet identified them as Edwin, Taishanet's\n\nestranged husband and the father of her children, Johal, a known\n\nassociate of Edwin, and Melendez-Rivas.      Edwin held a gun up to\n\nKelvin's face on one side of the motorcycle, while Johal stood on\n\nthe other side of the motorcycle, and Melendez-Rivas stood behind\n\nJohal.       Taishanet yelled at Edwin and begged him not to harm\n\nKelvin, at which point Edwin said to her: \"Don't you get up close\n\nhere, because I will hit you with the gun, you little bitch.\"\n\nJohal grabbed Taishanet while Edwin confronted Kelvin and told him\n\nto pull up his shirt.      Kelvin pulled out his gun from under his\n\nshirt and gave it to Edwin, who handed the gun to Melendez-Rivas.\n\nTaishanet continued to beg Edwin not to hurt Kelvin.     Kelvin told\n\nher he would be fine and asked her to leave.\n\n              Soon after, \"Bondy,\" co-defendant Luis Nieves-Burgos,\n\narrived in a white and gray van.1       Bondy got out of the van as\n\nEdwin and Melendez-Rivas struggled with Kelvin to get him off the\n\n       1\n          The government's theory of the events of June 16 differs\nsubstantially from the defendant's account of the events that\nevening, as we discuss later in more detail.        The government\ntheorized based on Taishanet's testimony that Bondy drove the van\nto the scene of the kidnapping, that Johal drove the van away, and\nthat the defendant was already there with Edwin and Johal before\nthe van arrived. The defendant testified that he drove the van to\nand from the scene, an account consistent with the testimony of one\ngovernment eyewitness.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fmotorcycle and into the back of the van.   Edwin and Melendez-Rivas\n\nforced Kelvin into the van, which Johal then drove away.\n\n           Shortly afterward, \"Jonty,\" co-defendant John T. Ayala,\n\narrived with \"Pupen,\" co-defendant José Luis Cora-Meléndez.    They\n\ntried to start the motorcycle but were unable to ride it.     Later,\n\nGuillermo Rodriguez arrived and drove the motorcycle away.\n\n           Taishanet then returned to her house with her sister, who\n\ncontacted Kelvin's wife, Irysa García-Reyes to let her know what had\n\nhappened   to   Kelvin and that she thought he had been killed.\n\nTaishanet tried to call Kelvin's cell phone several times; once,\n\nEdwin picked up, and when Taishanet told him not to harm Kelvin,\n\nEdwin started laughing.\n\n           Taishanet testified that later that evening, she saw\n\nEdwin and Melendez-Rivas in the project.    She saw that Edwin was\n\nwearing Kelvin's jewelry. Edwin said to her, \"I gave him 30 because\n\nhe is a pig.\"\n\n           Kelvin's body was found two days later with thirty-two\n\ngunshot wounds.     There was no physical evidence other than the\n\njewelry linking the death to the defendant.       The government's\n\nargument at trial was that the defendant's presence at the scene\n\nwhere Kelvin was forced off his motorcycle and the fact that Edwin\n\nhanded Melendez-Rivas Kelvin's gun proved intent to aid and abet.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fB.        Sufficiency challenge\n\n          Defendant's argument that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for acquittal is based on a misapprehension of\n\nthe elements of the statutory offense; it is also foreclosed by\n\ncircuit precedent.

Conflicting testimony presented at trial\n\n              We set the stage.       The evidence presented was largely\n\ntestimonial, and the witnesses' accounts often conflicted. The jury\n\nfaced credibility contests on several central issues in the case.2\n\nFirst, Melendez-Rivas testified that he was driving the van home,\n\n\n\n       2\n          Indeed, at closing argument, the prosecution emphasized\nthe inconsistencies and credibility contests in the case,\ncharacterizing the defendant's account as too \"convenient\" to be\nbelieved, and insisting that Taishanet could not have simply\n\"ma[d]e . . . up\" her account.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwhen he arrived at a spot in the street where he was blocked by the\n\nkidnappers who were confronting Kelvin.         He further testified that\n\nhe only became involved in driving the getaway van because he had\n\nbeen threatened by Edwin and Johal, who carried loaded guns when\n\nthey demanded he become involved and drive the van.            He feared he\n\nwould be killed if he did not participate.       He said he did not force\n\nKelvin into the van.      Finally, he also testified that he had no\n\nprior criminal record and was not friendly with the other men\n\naccused of kidnapping Kelvin.        The crime was motivated by Edwin's\n\njealousy, the defendant claimed, and he carried no grudge against\n\nKelvin and had no reason to be involved in killing him. We describe\n\nthe testimony in more detail below.\n\n           The prosecution anticipated and countered defendant's\n\nthemes with Taishanet's testimony, which was the primary evidence\n\npresented against the defendant at trial.3         Taishanet's testimony\n\npainted a picture of voluntary participation by the defendant.\n\nTaishanet placed the defendant as already at the basketball court\n\nwith   Edwin   and   Johal:   she   testified   that   the   three   of   them\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          Defendant also argues that the prosecution engaged in\nimproper vouching during its questioning of Taishanet and that the\ndistrict court erred in admitting her testimony that the FBI had\ninstructed her to tell the truth. The defendant did not object on\nthis basis in the district court, and therefore our review is for\nplain error. There was no error in this regard, let alone plain\nerror.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fconfronted Kelvin and forced him off his motorcycle.4   Indeed, the\n\ndefendant took the gun from Edwin when Edwin disarmed Kelvin.   This\n\nwas the strongest evidence at trial contradicting defendant's claim\n\nof coercion.\n\n           Taishanet testified that Bondy, not Melendez-Rivas, then\n\narrived in a white van and that it was Edwin, Johal, and the\n\ndefendant who forced Kelvin into the van. She stated that Bondy got\n\nout of the truck, that Edwin and Melendez-Rivas forced Kelvin into\n\nthe back of the van, and that Johal (not defendant) then got into\n\nthe van and drove it away.   Further, she testified that later that\n\nevening, she saw Edwin, accompanied by Melendez-Rivas, and that\n\nEdwin (and not Melendez-Rivas) was wearing Kelvin's jewelry.    The\n\ndefendant, by contrast, claimed he did not see Edwin and Johal until\n\nthe next day.\n\n           To attack Taishanet's credibility, defense counsel on\n\ncross-examination elicited testimony from Taishanet that she never\n\nreported Kelvin's kidnapping to the police, that she had received\n\n$2600 for her testimony, and that she associated with several\n\nnotorious local criminals and had never reported their criminal\n\nactivities.\n\n           One of the prosecution's two other eyewitnesses, GinLin,\n\narrived on the scene after the altercation had already begun and so\n\n     4\n          Although witnesses and the government described Kelvin as\nTaishanet's boyfriend, she denied having a romantic relationship\nwith him and stated that they were just friends.\n\n                                -11-\n\fcould not address whether defendant initially had been forced to\n\nparticipate.      Her testimony confirmed only that Melendez-Rivas had\n\ndriven the van away, a point Melendez-Rivas admitted, but that\n\nconflicted with Taishanet's testimony that Johal had driven the\n\ngetaway vehicle.      She further testified that Edwin and Johal (and\n\nnot    Melendez-Rivas)    dragged   Kelvin    into   the   van,   which   was\n\nconsistent with Melendez-Rivas's testimony.           She also said that\n\nlater that evening, she saw the defendant (rather than Edwin, as\n\nTaishanet had testified) wearing Kelvin's \"K\" necklace, and that he\n\nwas standing with Edwin and Johal.\n\n            The     prosecution's    third     eyewitness, Glenda, whose\n\ncredibility was under heavy attack at trial, testified she saw Edwin\n\npoint a gun at Kelvin to force him off the motorcycle and that Johal\n\nand the defendant were there.         She testified that she then ran\n\nupstairs into her aunt's house.            Her testimony did not address\n\nwhether defendant was participating voluntarily. She testified that\n\nshe then ran out onto the balcony and saw Edwin put Kelvin into the\n\nvan.    She stated that Melendez-Rivas got into the front passenger\n\ndoor of the van before it drove away.        She did not see who drove the\n\nvan away.    She testified that she later saw Edwin, but that she\n\ncould not identify who he was with.\n\n            Glenda admitted that she initially told the FBI agents\n\nthat she only saw Edwin and Johal on June 16, and that after being\n\nshown a picture of Melendez-Rivas she told the agents that she had\n\n                                    -12-\n\fnot seen him.        Cross-examination further elicited that two FBI\n\nagents had approached Glenda three months later and told her that\n\nthey believed that Melendez-Rivas was involved and that she had\n\ncommitted a very serious crime by not giving them the information\n\nthey wanted.        Only after that did she say that she had seen the\n\ndefendant on the evening of June 16.\n\n              The   prosecution    presented   additional   evidence    in   an\n\neffort to refute Melendez-Rivas's defense theories in several ways.\n\nIt tried to establish that: (1) Melendez-Rivas was friends with\n\nmembers of the group which had accosted Kelvin (thus making it\n\nimprobable that he was forced into participating); (2) Melendez-\n\nRivas had admitted this connection to FBI agents who investigated\n\nthe crime in the project; and (3) Melendez-Rivas had Kelvin's\n\ndistinctive jewelry, a Cuban-type chain with two panthers containing\n\na   letter.     Despite    the    difference   between   \"A\"   and   \"K,\"    the\n\nprosecution's theory was that defendant's \"A\" necklace was the same\n\n\"K\" necklace that originally belonged to Kelvin, and that defendant,\n\nprior to Kelvin's murder, had worn a simpler gold chain.             Melendez-\n\nRivas denied the first two and put on evidence (including from his\n\nwife and two jewelers who claimed to have made the necklace) of his\n\nprior ownership of the similar Cuban-type \"A\" chain.\n\n              During the defense case, Melendez-Rivas testified that\n\nalthough he was driving the white van, he was coerced into becoming\n\ninvolved in the altercation between Kelvin and Edwin, Johal, and\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fPupen.   Defendant testified that he was driving from the project\n\nbasketball court when he stopped the van near where the others were\n\nalready confronting Kelvin on his motorcycle. Defendant stated that\n\nat that time, he saw Taishanet, GinLin, and Glenda in the street.\n\nAt that point, defendant testified, Edwin and Johal had a gun on\n\nKelvin and they forced Kelvin into the rear of the van.   Edwin then\n\nwent to the front passenger door and \"told me to take off.\"\n\nMelendez-Rivas said he obeyed because Edwin \"had two weapons and I\n\nunderstood that if I didn't take off, they were going to kill me.\"\n\nHe testified that Edwin and Johal let him out of the van once they\n\nleft the housing project with Kelvin, he walked to his mother's\n\nhouse, which was also in the project, and Edwin and Johal drove the\n\nvan away with Kelvin still alive inside.    Although Taishanet and\n\nGinLin testified they saw defendant that evening in the project with\n\nEdwin,5 defendant said he did not see Edwin and Johal until the next\n\nday, when they came by to threaten defendant not to tell anything\n\nto the police.\n\n           Melendez-Rivas further testified that he had no prior\n\nrecord and he did not \"hang with\" the conspirators.    He said that\n\nalthough he knew Kelvin as an acquaintance from vocational school,\n\nhe had carried no grudge against Kelvin and had never been in a\n\n\n\n     5\n          GinLin testified to having seen Edwin, Johal, and\ndefendant, while Taishanet testified she saw only Edwin and\ndefendant. Glenda saw Edwin that evening, but she testified that\nshe could not identify who was with Edwin.\n\n                               -14-\n\ffight with him.      He also stated that he was afraid to go to the\n\npolice because he was afraid of Edwin and Johal because they ran the\n\ndrug point at the Quintana project.\n\nB.          Questioning by the district court\n\n            The   district   court's   questioning,    challenged    by   the\n\ndefendant, occurred during the re-cross-examination of a defense\n\nwitness    and   police   officer,   Victor   Rivera   Martinez,    who   was\n\nMelendez-Rivas's father-in-law.6       On re-direct, Rivera stated that\n\nhe was familiar with the neighborhood, that he knew of no close\n\nrelationship between Melendez-Rivas and Edwin and Johal, and that\n\nthis was despite the fact that Edwin and Johal were notorious\n\nfigures at the Quintana project.\n\n            Before beginning re-cross-examination, the prosecutor\n\nrequested a bench conference where she stated that, in order to\n\nundermine the defense's lack of connection theory, she wanted to ask\n\nRivera about whether he knew that defendant had admitted to the FBI\n\nthat he was in the van with Edwin and Johal on the evening of June\n\n16.   This statement was the subject of a pending suppression\n\nmotion.7    The district court determined that it would not allow\n\n\n      6\n            When Rivera took the stand, the defendant had not yet\ntestified.\n      7\n          The court completed the suppression hearing later in the\ntrial, at defense counsel's request. The court determined that\ndefendant's statements to the FBI during two separate interviews\nwere voluntary admissions, that the statements to the FBI only\nconfirmed what was already in the record, and that not only was the\ninformation admissible, \"some of it [was] even exculpatory, up to\n\n                                     -15-\n\fquestions directly about the statements to the FBI, but that the\n\nprosecution could ask about rumors regarding connections between\n\nMelendez-Rivas and the kidnappers on the evening of the kidnapping.\n\n            On   re-cross-examination,   the   prosecution,   trying   to\n\nundermine the defense's lack of connection theory, asked Rivera\n\nabout whether he had heard that the defendant, Edwin, and Johal had\n\ntaken Kelvin outside the project on the night of June 16.       A bench\n\nconference ensued over the questioning, the court directed the\n\nprosecution to ask about rumors.\n\n            The prosecution then asked whether Rivera had heard\n\nrumors as to what had happened to Kelvin on June 16.             Rivera\n\nanswered \"yes, that's right.\"    The district court then asked \"what\n\nhave you heard?\"    Rivera stated that he had heard a rumor \"[t]hat\n\nMr. Cora, Edwin and Johal took [Kelvin] out [of] the housing\n\nproject.\"   Defendant was not mentioned.   The prosecution then asked\n\nwhether Rivera had heard that it was Melendez-Rivas who took Kelvin\n\nout of the project.   Rivera responded \"Never\" and proceeded to deny\n\nhearing about any connection between the defendant and the men who\n\nhad kidnapped Kelvin.\n\n            At that point the district court intervened and asked\n\nquestions, apparently meant to refer back to the prosecution's\n\nsuggestion that defendant had earlier admitted his connection to\n\n\n\n\na certain point, in favor of [defendant].\"\n\n                                 -16-\n\fother kidnappers to the FBI agents.          The questioning went as\n\nfollows:\n\n           The Court:   Did the FBI ever interview you\n           about the facts of this case?\n\n           Rivera: They made a comment to me one time\n           when they came by the front of my house.\n\n           The Court:   And can I ask you what the comment\n           was?\n\n           Rivera: They went to the house of a neighbor,\n           and when I am coming to my house, one of the\n           agents comes up to me and says to me that my\n           son-in-law was involved in a series of felony\n           crimes that could lead to the death penalty.\n\n           Defense Counsel:   I have an objection at this\n           time.\n\n           The Court: That is what they told you?      That\n           is what they told you?\n\n           Rivera:   That is correct.\n\n           Defense Counsel:    I have an objection and a\n           motion.\n\n           The Court:    You can make your motion. Please\n           approach.\n\n           The Court:   And, of course, you did not believe\n           that?\n\n           Rivera:   No, never in my life.\n\nA bench conference ensued.    The defense objected and immediately\n\nmoved for a mistrial on the grounds that \"[Rivera] has now said that\n\nthe FBI told him that there were a series of felonies that could\n\nlead to the death penalty.     That has been introduced.      There is\n\nnothing to that.\" The court responded, \"You heard what I said, 'and\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fyou did not believe that?' And he said, 'No.'\"          Defense counsel\n\nresponded, \"But the FBI said it.\"    The court then overruled defense\n\ncounsel's objection and denied his motion for a mistrial.8\n\n           The court also denied a subsequent written motion for\n\nreconsideration of the defendant's motion for a mistrial, which\n\nelaborated on defense counsel's objections to the testimony. In the\n\nmemorandum accompanying the motion, defense counsel made three\n\ncentral arguments regarding the judge's interjection into the cross-\n\nexamination of Rivera.      First, defense counsel argued that the\n\njudge's question called for a hearsay answer and that the answer\n\nelicited was hearsay.      Second, defense counsel stated that the\n\ndeparture from the district court's otherwise neutral conduct during\n\nthe trial posed particular risks:\n\n           The Court has more credibility than either\n           party before a jury. The manner in which this\n           was done would reasonably make it seem to a\n           juror that the Court is imparting information\n           to them that it wants them especially to have\n           because of its importance.\n\nFinally,   defense   counsel   explained   the   prejudicial   effect   on\n\ndefendant's trial strategy:      \"A crucial element for the defense\n\n. . . was to highlight the fact that the defendant had no prior\n\ninvolvement with the criminal justice system, and was therefore an\n\n\n     8\n          Following the suppression hearing the next day on the\nadmissibility of defendant's statements to the FBI, the prosecution\nrecalled Rivera to ask only whether it would surprise him to learn\nthat the defendant had admitted to the FBI that he was with Edwin\nand Johal in the van on the evening of June 16 and that defendant\nhad \"hung out\" with them. Rivera said it would surprise him.\n\n                                  -18-\n\funlikely person to have been chosen to engage in the conduct of\n\nwhich he stands accused,\" and that as a result of the district\n\ncourt's question, \"the average juror will [receive] the impression\n\nthat the Court has doubts about a key element of the defense.\"      In\n\nwhat defense counsel described as \"a close case on the evidence\n\n[where] [t]here is no overwhelming proof of guilt,\" any such\n\ninfluence by the district court must affect the jury's verdict.\n\n          In the same written motion, defense counsel requested, in\n\nthe alternative, a curative instruction as follows:\n\n          You are instructed that a judge may ask\n          questions during a case. However, on occasion\n          a judge may ask a question that is not proper\n          and which you should not consider.        This\n          happened in this case. This Court asked a\n          question of the witness, Police Officer Victor\n          Rivera[,] which brought about an answer that\n          is improper for you to consider. Therefore,\n          you are instructed to strike from your minds\n          the question asked by the Court and the\n          response of the witness. It would be a\n          violation of your oath as jurors to consider\n          that question and the response to it.\n\nThe district court denied the motion altogether, including the\n\nrequested instruction.\n\nC.        The district court's denial of      the   motions   for   a\n          mistrial and curative instruction\n\n          We consider the court's questions, the elicited answers,\n\nthe refusal to give any curative instructions, and what impact they\n\nmay have had.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f             1.       Judge's power to question witnesses\n\n             The prosecution argues that the court did nothing more\n\nthan to exercise its power under Fed. R. Evid. 614(b) to interrogate\n\nwitnesses.        It is well-established that judges are free to ask\n\nquestions to elicit facts to facilitate a \"clear presentation of the\n\nissues.\"   United States v. Rosario-Peralta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198440\"><a href=\"/opinion/198440/united-states-v-rosario-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).   Nonetheless, the judge's right to ask questions should\n\nbe \"exercised with care,\" Logue, 103 F.3d at 1045, particularly when\n\ndoing so may affect the rights of a criminal defendant.       The need\n\nfor restraint is related to the need for a judge to \"be balanced;\n\nhe cannot become an advocate or otherwise use his judicial powers\n\nto advantage or disadvantage a party unfairly.\"      Id.\n\n             There is particular concern when it is the judge's\n\nquestioning which brings in evidence which is both inadmissible and\n\nprejudicial hearsay.       4 J.B. Weinstein & M.A. Berger, Weinstein's\n\nFederal Evidence § 614.04[1][b], at 614-15 (J.M. McLaughlin ed., 2d\n\ned. 2006) (\"There is . . . the danger that the judge may elicit from\n\nthe witness responses hurtful to the accused, and to which the jury\n\nmay assign peculiar weight because of their ostensible judicial\n\nsponsorship.\").      Defendant argues that in a close case, the risk is\n\nparticularly acute: the judge's interjection suggested that the\n\ncourt might have additional information about defendant's guilt, and\n\ncast serious doubt on Melendez-Rivas's central defenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f              The prosecution contends the court was only seeking\n\nclarity to assist the jury.9        See Rodriguez v. Banco Cent. Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603795\"><a href=\"/opinion/603795/raul-f-rodriguez-v-banco-central-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir. 1993).           Although the prosecution did not\n\ncreate the problem, it is held accountable for it.\n\n              The mere crossing of the line by a diligent trial judge\n\nwill not itself lead to reversal.         United States v. Paiva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534182\"><a href=\"/opinion/534182/united-states-v-james-earl-paiva/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 159 (1st Cir. 1989). In evaluating whether defendant has shown\n\nsufficient prejudice, we consider all the factors in the case.               If\n\nthis   case   were   solely   to   rest    on   a   claim   that   the   court's\n\nquestioning evidenced partiality to the prosecution, we would deny\n\nrelief.    Cf. Deary v. City of Gloucester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195029\"><a href=\"/opinion/195029/deary-v-city-of-gloucester/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194-95 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (rejecting allegation that trial judge was so biased as\n\nto deprive defendant of a fair trial).                 A different type of\n\nprejudice is at issue here, as we explain below.\n\n              2.     Introduction    of     inadmissible     and   prejudicial\n                     hearsay\n\n              We conclude that defendant was seriously prejudiced.\n\nFirst, the question about what comments the FBI had made to the\n\nwitness called for inadmissible hearsay.            The witness's answer was\n\nnot only inadmissible, but was very harmful to the defendant: the\n\nFBI agent purportedly stated \"that [Melendez-Rivas] was involved in\n\n\n\n       9\n          The problem is not one of the judge's questioning\ninterfering with the jury's proper role.    See United States v.\nOfray-Campos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203367\"><a href=\"/opinion/203367/united-states-v-ofray-campos/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 2008). Nor is the problem\nreally one of the judge becoming a witness. See Quercia v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102106\"><a href=\"/opinion/102106/quercia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470 (1933).\n\n                                    -21-\n\fa series of felony crimes that could lead to the death penalty.\"\n\nThe jury could easily have understood this to be a representation\n\nthat Melendez-Rivas was involved in other serious crimes, crimes so\n\nserious as to raise the prospect of the death penalty.              That was\n\nsimply untrue.        Second, this certainly undercut the defendant's\n\ntestimony that he had no criminal record or charges against him and\n\ndid not associate with two notorious criminals in the project.\n\n            Further, the jurors could have perceived the question as\n\nenhancing the prosecution's effort to impeach a defense witness.\n\nSee   4   Weinstein    &   Berger,   supra,    §   614.04[4][b],   at   614-27\n\n(suggesting that the trial court ought not conduct questioning that\n\nresembles a cross-examination challenging the credibility of a\n\nwitness).\n\n            Over counsel's objection, the court did not strike the\n\nanswer and tell the jury to disregard it.           Instead, the court asked\n\nagain whether that is what the FBI agents had told the witness. The\n\nwitness answered, \"That is correct.\"           This repetition, made within\n\nearshot of the jurors, reinforced the prejudicial effect.\n\n            Counsel objected again.           Before counsel could approach\n\nthe bench, the court, perhaps realizing the potential prejudice to\n\ndefendant, may have attempted to ameliorate the problem by asking\n\nif the witness believed the FBI, and then repeated that the witness\n\ndisbelieved what the FBI agents had said.               We cannot say with\n\nconfidence this ameliorated the harm.               In addition, this then\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fcreated an issue for the jury of whether the defendant's father-in-\n\nlaw or the FBI was lying.      There was never any curative instruction\n\ngiven.     The prejudice was not offset by the judge's preliminary\n\ninstructions at the start of trial.         Those instructions were that\n\n\"nothing that I may say or nothing that I may do is intended to\n\nindicate, nor should [it] be taken by you as indicating, what your\n\nverdict should be,\" and that the jury \"should never be influenced\n\nby any ruling that I make or for the reasons behind the ruling.\"\n\n             These instructions are mismatches to the problem at\n\nhand.10    Nor were instructions given which were closer to a match.\n\n             The   totality   of   the   record   shows   that   the   judge's\n\nquestions    elicited   inadmissible,      prejudicial    testimony.      The\n\ntestimony was not stricken, nor was a curative instruction given.\n\nThe inadmissible evidence contradicted one of defendant's central\n\n\n      10\n          There was, for example, no instruction that the jury\nshould not assume the court had any view on the subject of the\ncourt's questions and that the jury could disregard all the court's\nquestions. 4 Weinstein & Berger, supra, § 614.04[4][c], at 614-\n28.1 to -28.2 (\"The risk that a judge's questioning conveys a\nmessage regarding a defendant's guilt may be reduced by instructing\nthe jurors that they should not assume that the judge holds any\nopinion on the subject of the court's questions and that the jury\nmay disregard all the court's comments in arriving at its findings\nof fact.\"); see also Rivera-Torres v.
