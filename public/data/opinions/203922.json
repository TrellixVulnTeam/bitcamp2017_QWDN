  "plain_text": "          United States Court of Appeals\n                      For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 08-1451\n\n                    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                            Appellee,\n\n                                v.\n\n                        DARRELL D. ALLEN,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n         ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Neil S. Tassel, with whom Gary G. Pelletier and Denner\nPellegrino, LLP were on brief, for appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          July 22, 2009\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       Pursuant to a conditional guilty\n\nplea which preserved his right to challenge the district court's\n\nsuppression rulings, appellant Darrell D. Allen was sentenced to\n\n180 months in prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\nIn his sole argument on appeal, citing disputed material facts, he\n\nclaims that the court erred by failing to hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing before denying his motion to suppress certain statements\n\nand physical evidence.       Unfortunately for appellant, he did not\n\ngenerate the supposedly disputed material facts until he submitted\n\nmaterial in support of a motion for reconsideration.          We conclude,\n\ntherefore, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nruling on appellant's motion to suppress without a hearing and in\n\ndenying his motion for reconsideration of that order.\n\n                                     I.\n\nA. Procedural Background\n\n           On June 7, 2006, a federal grand jury in the District of\n\nMassachusetts returned an indictment charging appellant with being\n\na felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n922(g)(1).       On November 3, 2006, appellant filed a motion to\n\nsuppress   the    firearm   and   ammunition   seized   by   Boston   police\n\nofficers on May 28, 2005, the night of his arrest, as well as\n\ncertain statements he made to Officer John Coyne that evening. The\n\ngovernment filed its opposition to the motion on November 16, 2006.\n\nOn February 8, 2007, without holding an evidentiary hearing, the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fdistrict court granted in part and denied in part the motion to\n\nsuppress, prompting appellant to file, on February 27, 2007, a\n\nmotion for reconsideration, with a supplemental affidavit and\n\nexhibits. The district court was unpersuaded and denied the motion\n\nfor reconsideration on May 10, 2007.\n\n           Appellant entered his guilty plea on June 7, 2007. Under\n\nthe terms of the plea agreement, Allen retained the right, which he\n\nnow exercises, to appeal the district court's suppression ruling.\n\nHe was sentenced on March 5, 2008, to 180 months (15 years) in\n\nprison, the mandatory minimum sentence for the charged offense, and\n\nthree years of supervised release.\n\nB.   Factual Background\n\n           We begin by describing the record before the district\n\ncourt at the time of defendant's original motion to suppress,\n\nnoting purportedly disputed facts where relevant.\n\n           On May 28, 2005, Lieutenant Luis Cruz, Sergeant Felipe\n\nColon,   and   Officer   Ivan   Bermejo,   all   of   the   Boston   Police\n\nDepartment, were on patrol in an unmarked police cruiser in the\n\nRoxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.          At approximately\n\n1:00 a.m., while driving down Blue Hill Avenue, they saw two men,\n\nlater identified as appellant and Balgene Samuels, drinking from a\n\nclear bottle of beer.      The officers turned their car around and\n\nreturned to the location where they had seen the two men.              The\n\nofficers observed two cars parked nearby on Maywood Street; a\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fMercedes Benz CLK 320 Sedan, and a Ford Expedition sports utility\n\nvehicle.      According to Lieutenant Cruz's affidavit, as the police\n\napproached the men, Lieutenant Cruz noticed a half-full bottle of\n\nCorona brand beer sticking out of Allen's jacket pocket.             The two\n\nmen identified themselves to the police; appellant stated that the\n\nMercedes belonged to his aunt and Samuels told the officers that\n\nthe Expedition was his brother's.        Sergeant Colon informed the men\n\nthat because of the high gun activity in the area, they were going\n\nto be pat frisked.       After the frisk, Sergeant Colon removed the\n\nbottle of Corona from appellant's right jacket pocket and a small\n\nsilver knife from his left pant pocket.            Samuels, for his part,\n\nadmitted that there were several bags of marijuana in his pocket\n\nand gave them to Sergeant Colon, along with a knife he removed from\n\nhis back pocket.     According to the police report, when Colon then\n\nasked Samuels about the contents of the Ford, Samuels became\n\nnervous.      Sergeant Colon opened the driver's side door of the\n\nExpedition and found a firearm - a loaded Ruger 9mm handgun - on\n\nthe floor.     Both Samuels and Allen were then placed under arrest;\n\nSamuels for unlawful possession of a handgun and marijuana, and\n\nappellant for drinking in public (which is an arrestable offense\n\nunder City of Boston Ordinance 16-5.1).\n\n              At that point, other law enforcement officers began to\n\narrive   to    provide   assistance,   including   Officer   James    Coyne.\n\nAccording to Officer Coyne's affidavit, Sergeant Colon advised him\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthat they had already found a gun in the Expedition, and \"handed\n\n[appellant]   off\"   to   Coyne.     In    his   affidavit,   Officer   Coyne\n\nexplained that at this point he assumed, based on his training and\n\nexperience, that Sergeant Colon wanted to separate the two suspects\n\nwhile he continued to investigate the gun.           Officer Coyne did not\n\nrealize that appellant had already been placed under arrest but had\n\nnot been given his Miranda warnings.\n\n          Officer Coyne walked appellant over to his police cruiser\n\nand pat-frisked him again, finding a single Mercedes Benz key\n\n(which Allen said belonged to his aunt) and some cash in his front\n\npockets, both of which he returned to Allen.           After placing Allen\n\nin the rear of the cruiser, Officer Coyne asked him whether there\n\nwas anything illegal in the Mercedes, stating that if there were,\n\nAllen's aunt would be charged with it. Appellant replied \"whatever\n\nyou find, charge me with it.\"       According to his affidavit, Officer\n\nCoyne then asked appellant for the key to the Mercedes, but\n\nappellant denied having it.        Officer Coyne instructed appellant to\n\nget out of the cruiser.      He then discovered that the key was no\n\nlonger in the pocket where he had found it just moments before.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully searching the rear compartment of the cruiser\n\nand the area outside the vehicle for the key, Officer Coyne told\n\nAllen that, if need be, he would break the window to get into the\n\nMercedes. Appellant sat down on the sidewalk and retrieved the key\n\nfrom his sock.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            Once Allen was returned to the rear of the cruiser,\n\nOfficer Coyne walked up to the Mercedes. In his affidavit, Officer\n\nCoyne averred that, once he had reached the Mercedes, he began to\n\nlook inside, shining his flashlight to illuminate the vehicle's\n\ninterior.   Officer Coyne explained that he began his inspection by\n\nlooking through the rear window and then proceeded to the windows\n\non the driver's side as he walked around the side of the car along\n\nthe curb.    According to his sworn testimony, when Officer Coyne\n\nreached the corner of the front windshield, he leaned over the\n\nfender and the hood of the vehicle, with both feet planted on the\n\nground, and shone his flashlight into the driver's side area.   He\n\nspecifically denied having to walk or sit on the hood to look\n\ninside of the car, although he admitted that he may have made some\n\nincidental contact with the fender and the windshield as he moved\n\naround the vehicle.\n\n            As we discuss further infra, in the memorandum of law\n\naccompanying his motion to suppress, Allen presented a different\n\naccount of this incident.   Allen claimed that, \"according to the\n\nreports provided in discovery, Officer Coyne then began to attempt\n\nto examine the interior of the locked Mercedes.      Unable to see\n\nanything incriminating in the interior . . ., he positioned himself\n\non top of the hood of the Mercedes, and shined his flashlight into\n\nthe vehicle's interior.\"     The memorandum contained no record\n\ncitations for this version of events, and Allen's affidavit did not\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fmention Officer Coyne's physical location when he saw the weapon.\n\n             Officer Coyne's affidavit recounted how, once he shone\n\nhis flashlight into the vehicle from the vantage point he had\n\ndescribed (i.e., leaning over the fender and the hood), he was able\n\nto see the top of a chrome-colored gun.              He immediately notified\n\nSergeant Colon, who walked over to the vehicle, took the key from\n\nCoyne, and opened up the driver's side door to confirm that the\n\nobject was indeed a gun.          Officer Coyne approached appellant and\n\ndemanded his license to carry a firearm, which appellant stated he\n\ndid not have.        According to the officer's affidavit, Coyne then\n\nremoved Allen from the cruiser, placed him in handcuffs, informed\n\nhim of his Miranda rights, and took him to the police station for\n\nbooking.\n\n             Officer Coyne's affidavit further states that, after they\n\narrived at the station, and appellant had been informed of his\n\nMiranda     rights   for    a   second    time,   appellant   stated   that   the\n\n\"peashooter\" was his and that the police \"should just slap me off\n\nthe head with the gun and send me home.\"             Appellant also said that\n\nthere were \"no bullets in the tube but in the clip\" and that the\n\ngun   had   a   serial     number.       According   to   Officer   Coyne,    this\n\nconversation lasted no more than 5-10 minutes.                However, in the\n\naffidavit Allen submitted in support of his motion to suppress,\n\nAllen presented an alternative version of events.                      He stated\n\ngenerally that he had been \"questioned under duress and coercion,\"\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fand claimed that the statements he had allegedly made \"were the\n\nresult of questioning after being placed under arrest but prior to\n\nbeing informed of my Miranda rights.\"\n\n          After Allen and Samuels had been arrested, Lieutenant\n\nCruz, who remained at the scene, decided to impound the cars and\n\nconduct an inventory search of the vehicles.\n\nC. The Motion to Suppress\n\n          In   the    memorandum   of    law   supporting         his     motion   to\n\nsuppress, Allen argued (1) that Officer Coyne's search of his\n\nperson and seizure of the key violated the Fourth Amendment; (2)\n\nthat the search of the Mercedes was illegal and was not justified\n\nby any exception to the warrant requirement; and (3) that his\n\nquestioning by Officer Coyne, both before and after he was given\n\nthe Miranda warnings, violated his Fifth Amendment rights. He also\n\nrequested an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          In support of his motion, appellant attached an unsigned\n\naffidavit which stated, in its entirety, as follows:\n\n          1.         My name is Darrell Allen.\n\n          2.         I am the defendant            in     the     above\n                     captioned matter.\n\n          3.         On the morning of May 28, 2005, I was\n                     with Balgene Samuels on Maywood Street\n                     in Roxbury.\n\n          4.         Three police       officers        arrived    and\n                     searched me.\n\n          5.         Items were taken from me, I was\n                     handcuffed and placed under arrest for\n\n                                    -8-\n\f                   drinking in public, and placed in a\n                   police car.\n\n           6.      A Mercedes nearby was opened with a key\n                   alleged to have been taken from me and\n                   searched.\n\n           7.      I was never seen in the Mercedes and I\n                   did not consent or grant permission to\n                   the search of the Mercedes.\n\n           8.      It is alleged that I made certain\n                   statements, which if made, were the\n                   result of questioning after being\n                   placed under arrest but prior to being\n                   informed of my Miranda rights.\n\n           9.      I made no knowing, intelligent,             or\n                   voluntary waiver of my rights.\n\n           10.     I was questioned         under   duress    and\n                   coercion.\n\n           The government filed its opposition on November 21, 2006.\n\nIt was not until December 12, 2006, nearly three weeks after the\n\ngovernment had filed its opposition, that Allen filed another\n\naffidavit in support of his motion to suppress that was identical\n\nin all respects to the first one, except that he had signed the\n\nsecond one.\n\n           The government's opposition to the suppression motion was\n\nsupported by excerpts of grand jury testimony by Sergeant Colon in\n\nSuffolk   County   Superior   Court   and    the    sworn    affidavits   of\n\nLieutenant Cruz and Officer Coyne, each of which had a number of\n\naccompanying exhibits. These included the Boston Police Department\n\nMotor Vehicle Inventory Search Policy and the Vehicle Inventory\n\nreports on the two cars, a map generated by the Boston Regional\n\n                                  -9-\n\fIntelligence Center regarding the incidence of larcenies of motor\n\nvehicles in the neighborhood of the arrest, the Boston Police\n\nIncident Report on the arrests, photographs of the vehicles at the\n\nscene, and appellant's Boston Police Department Prisoner Booking\n\nForm containing a signed acknowledgment that he had been informed\n\nof his Miranda rights.\n\n          The government argued (1) that Officer Coyne's search of\n\nthe defendant and seizure of the key to the Mercedes was justified\n\nas a search incident to a lawful arrest; (2) that the seizure of\n\nthe firearm was proper both because its discovery would have been\n\ninevitable after the Mercedes had been (properly) impounded, towed,\n\nand subject to an inventory search, and also because the weapon was\n\nin plain view; and (3) that with the exception of one statement\n\nthat he had made to Officer Coyne before he was administered the\n\nMiranda warnings, all of appellant's statements were voluntary and\n\ntherefore admissible.    Finally, the government argued that Allen\n\nhad not met his burden to obtain an evidentiary hearing because he\n\nhad failed to adequately contest the government's claims.       It\n\nmaintained that Allen's one-page affidavit was insufficient to\n\nestablish the existence of any disputed facts that would warrant an\n\nevidentiary hearing, even though Allen had an opportunity to\n\ngenerate those disputes.    The government's version of the events\n\n(as contained in Colon's grand jury testimony, the Boston Police\n\nDepartment Incident report, and the Supplemental Report prepared by\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fOfficer Coyne) had been disclosed to Allen at the outset of the\n\ncase.\n\n            The district court ruled for the government. In reaching\n\nits conclusion, the district court considered as evidence \"only the\n\nstatements made in the affidavits\" submitted.          On this basis, the\n\ncourt found that an evidentiary hearing was not required because\n\nAllen had \"not made a threshold showing that material facts [were]\n\nin dispute.\"    The court then denied the motion to suppress the\n\nfirearm and ammunition on the ground that the items \"inevitably\n\nwould have been discovered [in] an inventory search pursuant to the\n\nimpoundment of the Mercedes following the defendant's arrest.\"\n\nCiting the affidavit of Luis Cruz and the Boston Police Department\n\nInventory   Search   Policy,   both    of   which   were   attached   to   the\n\ngovernment's opposition, the court explained that the impoundment\n\nof the Mercedes would have been proper in order to protect it from\n\nvandalism or theft, given the \"hour of the day and the undisputed\n\ndescription of the area of defendant's arrest as one 'plagued by []\n\nfirearm-related violence' and one 'in which car theft and car\n\nvandalism frequently occur.'\"         Additionally, the court held that\n\nthe seizure of the firearm was independently justified by the fact\n\nthat Officer Coyne had discovered it in plain view.            Finally, the\n\ncourt ruled that, with the exception of Allen's statement that\n\n\"[w]hatever you find, charge me with it,\" which the government\n\nconceded was made prior to Officer Coyne's recitation of the\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fMiranda    warnings,        all    of    appellant's       other     statements      were\n\nvoluntary and thus admissible.\n\nD. The Motion for Reconsideration\n\n            Three weeks after the district court's ruling, Allen\n\nfiled a request for reconsideration, supplementing his original\n\nmotion with \"additional information\" which, he asserted, was \"not\n\npreviously available at the time it was filed.\"                            Specifically,\n\nappellant    submitted       the    affidavit      of      Balgene    Samuels,      which\n\ncontained certain factual assertions regarding the neighborhood in\n\nwhich the men had been arrested and the events of May 28, 2005.                        In\n\nhis motion for reconsideration, appellant claimed that Samuels's\n\ntestimony    was      not   previously     available        because    state      charges\n\nagainst    Samuels,     which      had   raised      legitimate      Fifth    Amendment\n\nconcerns for him, had been pending until November 8, 2006, and\n\nbecause Samuels had been unreachable until his phone service was\n\n\"reconnected\" on February 13, 2007.\n\n            In his affidavit, Samuels stated, inter alia, that his\n\nfamily had owned a home at 33 Maywood Street since 1951; that none\n\nof the family's cars, which had always been parked lawfully                        on the\n\nstreet nearby, had ever been broken into, stolen, or vandalized\n\nwhile parked there; and that at no time had his family's home been\n\nbroken    into   or    vandalized,       nor   had    he    heard     of    any   similar\n\noccurrences in the neighborhood.                 Samuels further asserted that\n\nneither he nor Allen had a beer bottle in their possession on May\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f28, 2005, although Sergeant Colon did pick one up from the sidewalk\n\nnear where they were standing. He claimed that Sergeant Colon told\n\nboth men that they would not be arrested for the marijuana or the\n\ndrinking because the police were only \"looking for guns.\"            Samuels\n\nalso stated that Allen told him that before being taken from the\n\nscene, he had observed a police officer climb onto the hood of the\n\nMercedes.\n\n            Appellant   argued   that    the   \"newly   available\"   Samuels\n\naffidavit called into question a number of the government's factual\n\nallegations, including its assertion, adopted by the court, that\n\nthe neighborhood where appellant was arrested was \"plagued\" by\n\nfirearm violence and that if left unattended, the Mercedes would\n\nhave been at risk of vandalism and theft.           Allen noted that the\n\nSamuels affidavit contradicted the government's claim that Allen\n\nwas drinking a beer or had a beer in his pocket when the police\n\napproached.     He emphasized that the new evidence presented serious\n\nquestions regarding the sequence of events leading up to the\n\nseizure of the firearm, including Officer Coyne's location as he\n\nlooked   into   the   Mercedes   and    noticed   the   weapon.      Finally,\n\nappellant pointed out that the government's own discovery materials\n\ndemonstrated that even at the time of his original motion, there\n\nhad been a genuine factual dispute in the record: ATF Agent Thomas\n\nCrowley, in his grand jury testimony, had stated that Officer Coyne\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fhad actually gotten onto the hood of the car in order to look into\n\nthe vehicle.1\n\n            In   opposing   the   motion   for   reconsideration,   the\n\ngovernment argued that Allen had failed to show that Samuels was\n\nunavailable while the original motion was pending or that the\n\ninformation in his affidavit was \"newly discovered,\" particularly\n\ngiven that Allen himself had been present at the underlying events\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         The grand jury minutes contained the following exchange:\n\n            Q: And he actually had to get up, he got up on\n            the hood with a flashlight and shined it in?\n\n            A: Yes.\n\n     Later, in response to a juror's question, the following\ncolloquy occurred:\n\n            A: He was on the driver's side kind of like\n            where the door and the windshield come\n            together looking down that way. I believe.\n\n            Q: Let me ask you, Special Agent Crowley, at\n            some point, and if you need to refer to the\n            Form 26 about this, did Mr. Coyne - - did\n            Officer Coyne actually sit up on the, on the\n            hood of the car and look in?\n\n            A: Yes.\n\n            Q: On the inside, so he could see inside the\n            passenger compartment?\n\n            A: Yes. He actually looked through the front\n            windshield, I'm sorry, not the side door.\n\n            Q: Okay.\n\n            A: From the windshield right in.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fbut had chosen not to include any substantive information in his\n\nown affidavit.\n\n            In a careful written opinion that was significantly\n\nlonger than its original decision denying the motion to suppress,\n\nthe district court denied the motion for reconsideration.                       The\n\ncourt noted that appellant had been put on notice as to the\n\ngovernment's version of the events in question as early as November\n\n17, 2006, when the government filed its original opposition to the\n\nmotion to suppress.2     Nevertheless, in the affidavit Allen signed\n\nand executed twenty-one days later, he chose not to address any of\n\nthe government's central factual assertions or to present any\n\nadditional   evidence    that    would      have    controverted    its    story.\n\nSpecifically,    appellant's     affidavit         disputed    neither    Officer\n\nCoyne's assertion that he had discovered the firearm in plain view\n\nin the Mercedes by simply peering into it from the sidewalk, nor\n\nthe   government's    claim   that    the     Mercedes   was    subject    to    an\n\ninventory    search   pursuant       to   a   lawful     impoundment      by    the\n\ninvestigating officers.\n\n            Turning to the Samuels affidavit, the district court\n\nobserved that all of the proffered evidence regarding the Grove\n\nHill neighborhood of Roxbury had been available to appellant when\n\n\n\n      2\n       On the same day, the government filed a motion for leave to\nfile a memorandum in excess of twenty pages. After the district\ncourt denied this motion on November 21, 2006, the government\nimmediately filed its amended opposition on the same day.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fhe filed his initial motion to suppress, or at least by the time he\n\nfiled his own sworn affidavit on December 12, 2006.           Indeed, on the\n\ncritical issue of \"whether the firearm . . . was discovered in\n\nplain view without Coyne's having to climb onto the hood of the\n\nMercedes,\" the district court emphasized that the Samuels affidavit\n\ndid \"nothing more than recite an out-of-court-statement made by the\n\ndefendant himself.\"     The court found it curious that Allen did not\n\ninclude this crucial fact in his own affidavit, and that he had\n\nsince   failed    to   file    a   supplemental    affidavit     with    this\n\ninformation.     Nor did the court credit appellant's assertion that\n\nSamuels had been unavailable because of Fifth Amendment concerns,\n\nnoting that Samuels's state court proceedings had concluded with\n\nhis guilty plea on November 8, 2006, and he was therefore available\n\nat the time that Allen had filed his sworn affidavit.             Moreover,\n\nthe court discounted Allen's insistence that the fact that Samuels'\n\nphone had only been reconnected on February 13, 2007, had prevented\n\nAllen from reaching him; the court inferred that, since Samuels'\n\nown affidavit stated that he had lived at his family's Maywood\n\nStreet residence since 2001, Allen would have known how to find\n\nhim.\n\n           Finally, the district court noted that, in his original\n\nmotion to suppress, appellant had not cited Special Agent Crowley's\n\ngrand jury testimony, and that the court was not required to\n\n\"rummage   through     [its]   files   looking    for   the   evidence   now\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fadvanced.\"3    Finally, the court indicated that its decision on the\n\nmotion to suppress would not necessarily have been affected by the\n\nCrowley testimony even if it had been aware of it, since Crowley\n\nwas not a percipient witness to the relevant events.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA. The Motion to Suppress\n\n           \"The test for granting an evidentiary hearing in a\n\ncriminal case [is] substantive: did the defendant make a sufficient\n\nthreshold showing that material facts were in doubt or dispute?\"\n\nUnited States v. Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(quotation marks and citation omitted) (concluding that district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by failing to hold evidentiary\n\nhearing   on   a   motion   to   suppress).   \"The   district   court   has\n\nconsiderable discretion in determining the need for, and the\n\nutility of, evidentiary hearings, and we will reverse the court's\n\ndenial of an evidentiary hearing in respect to a motion in a\n\ncriminal case only for manifest abuse of that discretion.\"         United\n\nStates v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 603 (1st Cir. 1996) (upholding\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       It is unclear whether the court did indeed have this\nmaterial \"in its files\" before it received appellant's motion for\nreconsideration. Allen obtained the grand jury testimony as part\nof the government's production of documents in the case, but did\nnot specifically identify that testimony as the source of his\nunsupported claim that Officer Coyne climbed on top of the Mercedes\nuntil he filed his Motion to Reconsider. At that point, he also\nsubmitted the grand jury testimony to the court as an exhibit to\nhis motion.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fdistrict court's decision to forego evidentiary hearing on motion\n\nto suppress).\n\n          To obtain an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress\n\nphysical evidence, a defendant must make a sufficient showing that\n\nthe seized evidence \"was the product of a warrantless search that\n\ndoes not fall within any exception to the warrant requirement. The\n\nburden is on the defendant to allege facts, sufficiently definite,\n\nspecific, detailed, and nonconjectural, to enable the court to\n\nconclude that a substantial claim is presented.\"   United States v.\n\nCalderon, 77 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted).\n\n          Appellant now argues that the district court committed\n\nreversible error by making numerous factual determinations adverse\n\nto appellant in spite of what he characterizes as a \"contradictory\"\n\nrecord.   Under these circumstances, he contends that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion by failing to conduct an evidentiary\n\nhearing to allow him to present evidence, contest the government's\n\nversion of events, and subject its witnesses to cross-examination.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          1.      The Firearm and Ammunition\n\n          We focus on the plain view exception to the warrant\n\nrequirement, an alternative ground for the court's denial of the\n\nmotion to suppress. Under that exception, a warrantless seizure is\n\nnevertheless lawful if \"(1) the seizing police officer lawfully\n\n\n                               -18-\n\freached the position from which he could see the item in plain\n\nview; (2) the seizure satisfied the probable cause standard; and\n\n(3) the seizing officer had a 'lawful right of access to the object\n\nitself.'\"    United States v. Antrim, 389 F.3d 276, 283 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).      Thus,   in   order    to   demonstrate     the       existence    of    a\n\nsubstantial constitutional claim, appellant was required to proffer\n\nspecific facts plausibly suggesting that the search of the Mercedes\n\ndid not satisfy at least one of the prongs of the plain view\n\nexception.    As the government points out, Allen does not challenge\n\nthe third prong (i.e., whether the officer had a lawful right of\n\naccess to the object itself).4         Accordingly, we inquire whether it\n\nwas an abuse of discretion for the district court to find that\n\nappellant had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact\n\nregarding    either   whether     Officer     Coyne   \"lawfully      reached      the\n\nposition\" from which he saw the gun in plain view or the existence\n\nof probable cause.\n\n            As we have noted, in ruling on appellant's original\n\nmotion to suppress, the district court \"considered as evidence only\n\nthe statements made in the affidavits submitted by the parties.\"\n\nIn the affidavit attached to his motion, Allen did not dispute the\n\nGovernment's   version    of     events   related     to   the    search     of   the\n\n\n     4\n       This element asks not whether the officer was lawfully in a\nposition to see the contraband (the first element of the plain view\nanalysis), but whether he could lawfully seize it without\ncommitting a trespass. See United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d 210,\n221 n.10 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                       -19-\n\fvehicle.      The affidavit does not contradict the officer's direct\n\nstatement that he was able to see the gun in the driver's side door\n\nof the Mercedes by simply leaning over the hood and shining his\n\nflashlight into the window.           See Staula, 80 F.3d at 604 (noting\n\nthat an evidentiary hearing was not required where appellant's\n\naffidavit contained no facts that contradicted a police officer's\n\ndirect statements). Indeed, the affidavit's only references to the\n\nsearch   of    the   Mercedes   are   appellant's   assertions   that   \"[a]\n\nMercedes nearby was opened with a key alleged to have been taken\n\nfrom me and searched\" and \"I was never seen with the Mercedes and\n\nI did not consent or grant permission to the search of the\n\nMercedes.\"     These vague statements, neither of which even mentions\n\nthe manner in which Officer Coyne searched the vehicle, were\n\ninsufficient to call into question the government's account.\n\n              That is also true of the unsupported factual assertions\n\nin appellant's memorandum of law that Officer Coyne \"positioned\n\nhimself on top of the hood of the Mercedes,\" and that he \"climbed\n\nonto the hood of the Mercedes,\" from which point he made his\n\nobservations about the vehicle's content.           Appellant's memorandum\n\ndid not contain any record citations that would have confirmed\n\nthese allegations, and it was not an abuse of discretion for the\n\ndistrict court to consider only the verified evidence before it.\n\nIn Calderon, we similarly found no reason to disturb the district\n\ncourt's denial of an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fwhere the defendant \"vaguely claim[ed]\" that a consent to search\n\nwas \"coerced or was otherwise ineffective,\" but \"offer[ed] no\n\naffidavit or statement . . . to that effect, describe[d] no\n\ncircumstances supporting his assertion, and ma[de] no offer of\n\nproof   relative     to   any   other    facts   that   might   support   his\n\nassertion.\"     77 F.3d at 9.\n\n           It   is   true   that,   before   describing    Officer   Coyne's\n\nactions while he was ostensibly positioned on the hood of the\n\nMercedes, the memorandum stated that \"[o]utside the view of the\n\ndefendant, according to the reports provided in discovery, Officer\n\nCoyne then began to attempt to examine the interior of the locked\n\nMercedes\" (emphasis added).             This vague allusion to \"reports\n\nprovided in discovery,\" is insufficient to generate a material\n\nfactual dispute about whether Officer Coyne \"lawfully reached the\n\nposition from which he could see the item in plain view,\" Antrim,\n\n389 F.3d at 283.     Appellant did not attach the relevant Grand Jury\n\ntestimony to his motion.        Nor did he describe its contents in his\n\naffidavit, or even specifically identify it as the source of the\n\nallegations in his motion to suppress. Because appellant failed to\n\nsubstantiate the vague assertion that Coyne had climbed upon the\n\nvehicle, he failed to raise a genuine disputed fact with respect to\n\nthis prong of the plain view analysis.\n\n           Nor did appellant's filings in the district court call\n\ninto question whether there was probable cause to seize the gun,\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fsee Antrim, 389 F.3d at 283.           In his affidavit, Officer Coyne\n\nstated unequivocally that when he shined the flashlight into the\n\nMercedes, he observed the top of a chrome gun and immediately\n\ninformed   the   other    officers   of     his   discovery   of   a    firearm.\n\nAppellant's affidavit proffers no specific facts to contradict this\n\nassertion.   In the face of Officer Coyne's observation of specific\n\ncontraband, appellant does not raise a serious question regarding\n\nprobable   cause,   and   the   district     court's    refusal    to   hold   an\n\nevidentiary hearing was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n           2.       The Statements\n\n           Appellant's      affidavit       contained     three     assertions\n\npertaining to his questioning by the Boston Police Department:\n\n           It is alleged that I made certain statements,\n           which if made, were the result of questioning\n           after being placed under arrest but prior to\n           being informed of my Miranda rights[;]\n                  I made no knowing, intelligent, or\n           voluntary waiver of my rights [and;]\n                  I was questioned under duress and\n           coercion.\n\nSetting aside the one statement properly suppressed by the district\n\ncourt, which the Government concedes appellant made before he\n\nreceived the Miranda warnings, these conclusory assertions must be\n\nevaluated in light of the government's response.\n\n           In his affidavit, Officer Coyne averred that after he had\n\ndiscovered the handgun and confirmed that Allen did not have a\n\nlicense to carry a firearm, he handcuffed Allen, read him his\n\nMiranda rights, and took him to the police station for booking.                At\n\n                                     -22-\n\fthe station, Officer Coyne administered the Miranda warnings a\n\nsecond   time,   and   had    a   conversation   with   appellant   lasting\n\napproximately five to ten minutes.          According to his affidavit,\n\nduring this time, Officer Coyne acted professionally and never\n\nyelled or threatened appellant. Furthermore, the record before the\n\ndistrict court included a booking form containing a Miranda warning\n\nacknowledgment that had been signed by the defendant.\n\n           In the face of the Coyne affidavit and the signed Miranda\n\nacknowledgment, and faced only with appellant's vague assertion\n\nthat \"certain statements . . . if made, were the result of\n\nquestioning after being placed under the arrest but prior to being\n\ninformed of [his] Miranda rights,\" unsupported by any references to\n\nspecific statements he sought to suppress, it was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for the district court to find, without an evidentiary\n\nhearing, that the statements were voluntary.\n\nB. The Motion for Reconsideration\n\n           We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for\n\nabuse of discretion.5        United States v. Fanfan, 558 F.3d 105, 106\n\n\n     5\n       The government argues that appellant has waived this issue\nby failing in his brief to separately enumerate the denial of the\nmotion for reconsideration as one of the issues presented in this\nappeal or to independently challenge this decision in the argument\nsection of his brief. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(5), (a)(9); Ramos\nv. Roche Prods., Inc., 936 F.2d 43, 51 (1st Cir. 1991). Instead,\nappellant raises a general challenge to the district court's\nfailure to hold an evidentiary hearing in light of the evidence\nbefore it - including the evidence he submitted in connection with\nhis motion for reconsideration. We do not address the government's\nwaiver argument because we conclude that the district court did not\n\n                                     -23-\n\f(1st Cir. 2009).       Motions for reconsideration are not to be used as\n\n\"a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures [or]\n\nallow a party to advance arguments that could and should have been\n\npresented to the district court prior to judgment.\"                        Iverson v.\n\nCity    of   Boston,    452    F.3d   94,    104    (1st   Cir.   2006)     (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).                     Instead, motions for\n\nreconsideration        are    appropriate     only    in   a   limited     number   of\n\ncircumstances:     if    the    moving      party    presents     newly    discovered\n\nevidence, if there has been an intervening change in the law, or if\n\nthe movant can demonstrate that the original decision was based on\n\na manifest error of law or was clearly unjust.                     Marie v. Allied\n\nHome Mortgage Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 7 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005).                       A court\n\nwill deny a motion for reconsideration based on the \"new evidence\"\n\nexception if that evidence \"in the exercise of due diligence[]\n\ncould have been presented earlier.\"                  Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of\n\nTeamsters, Local Union No. 25, 426 F.3d 416, 422 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                          Although we\n\nreview for abuse of discretion the district court's determination\n\nthat Allen had not made this required showing, we would find no\n\nerror in the district court's decision even if our review were de\n\nnovo.\n\n             Appellant's motion for reconsideration was based on two\n\npropositions: first, that the \"new evidence\" he proffered - the\n\n\nabuse its discretion in denying the motion.\n\n                                         -24-\n\fSamuels affidavit - required the court to hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the merits of appellant's motion to suppress, and\n\nsecond, that the court had erred by overlooking evidence in its own\n\nrecords and ruling on the original motion without an evidentiary\n\nhearing.   The district court was correct to reject both these\n\nclaims.\n\n           Allen had filed his original motion to suppress, along\n\nwith the unsigned affidavit, on November 3, 2006.        The government\n\nfiled its original opposition on November 16, and an amended\n\nopposition on November 21.     At least by this date, then, Allen was\n\non notice about the government's version of events.       Nevertheless,\n\non December 16, the defendant filed a signed affidavit which,\n\ndespite his access to the government's opposition papers, was\n\nidentical to the original ten-paragraph affidavit, and none of\n\nwhich directly responded to the government's plain view assertions\n\nor specified the alleged Miranda violations.         The court ruled on\n\nthe motion on February 8, 2007.\n\n           All   of   the   evidence   in   the   Samuels affidavit was\n\navailable to appellant at the time the original motion was filed,\n\nand Allen himself could have provided that information in his\n\noriginal affidavit; indeed, on the key plain view inquiry, the\n\nSamuels affidavit says only that it was Allen who told him that he\n\nhad seen Officer Coyne climb onto the car.        Appellant provided no\n\nexplanation for why this information was missing from his own\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\faffidavit, and no satisfactory justification for the submission of\n\nthe Samuels affidavit in late February.             Samuels's state court\n\nproceedings were resolved by November 8, 2006, and the district\n\ncourt was not obligated to accept Allen's argument that Samuels was\n\n\"unavailable\" due to a lack of phone service. Indeed, the district\n\ncourt reasonably inferred that Allen knew where Samuels lived and\n\ncould get in touch with him if he had wanted to.\n\n           Nor did the court abuse its discretion in concluding that\n\nthe mere reference in appellant's memorandum in support of his\n\nmotion to suppress to Officer Coyne having climbed on the hood of\n\nthe Mercedes was insufficient cause for an evidentiary hearing. As\n\nwe have discussed, the reference was unsupported by any source.\n\nAlthough   appellant    cited   to    ATF   Agent   Crowley's   grand   jury\n\ntestimony in his motion for reconsideration to argue that record\n\nevidence supported his version of events, this proffer was too\n\nlittle, too late.      Indeed, as the court noted, Agent Crowley was\n\nnot even \"a percipient witness to the events in question,\"6 and\n\ntherefore the court explicitly disclaimed the notion that its\n\ndecision to deny the suppression motion without a hearing would\n\nhave been different if it had known about the Crowley testimony.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n     6\n       Asked to describe his involvement in the case before the\nGrand Jury, Agent Crowley stated that he had \"reviewed all the\nreports relative to that arrest,\" \"spoken to the arresting\nofficers,\" and done a background check on the firearm in question,\nbut that he \"was not present that night.\"\n\n                                     -26-\n\f",

Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>On June 7, 2006, a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging appellant with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1). On November 3, 2006, appellant filed a motion to suppress the firearm and ammunition seized by Boston police officers on May 28, 2005, the night of his arrest, as well as certain statements <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> he made to Officer John Coyne that evening. The government filed its opposition to the motion on November 16, 2006. On February 8, 2007, without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted in part and denied in part the motion to suppress, prompting appellant to file, on February 27, 2007, a motion for reconsideration, with a supplemental affidavit and exhibits. The district court was unpersuaded and denied the motion for reconsideration on May 10, 2007.</p>\n<p>Appellant entered his guilty plea on June 7, 2007. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Allen retained the right, which he now exercises, to appeal the district court's suppression ruling. He was sentenced on March 5, 2008, to 180 months (15 years) in prison, the mandatory minimum sentence for the charged offense, and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>We begin by describing the record before the district court at the time of defendant's original motion to suppress, noting purportedly disputed facts where relevant.</p>\n<p>On May 28, 2005, Lieutenant Luis Cruz, Sergeant Felipe Colon, and Officer Ivan Bermejo, all of the Boston Police Department, were on patrol in an unmarked police cruiser in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. At approximately 1:00 a.m., while driving down Blue Hill Avenue, they saw two men, later identified as appellant and Balgene Samuels, drinking from a clear bottle of beer. The officers turned their car around and returned to the location where they had seen the two men. The officers observed two cars parked nearby on Maywood Street; a Mercedes Benz CLK 320 Sedan, and a Ford Expedition sports utility vehicle. According to Lieutenant Cruz's affidavit, as the police approached the men, Lieutenant Cruz noticed a half-full bottle of Corona brand beer sticking out of Allen's jacket pocket. The two men identified themselves to the police; appellant stated that the Mercedes belonged to his aunt and Samuels told the officers that the Expedition was his brother's. Sergeant Colon informed the men that because of the high gun activity in the area, they were going to be pat frisked. After the frisk, Sergeant Colon removed the bottle of Corona from appellant's right jacket pocket and a small silver knife from his left pant pocket. Samuels, for his part, admitted that there were several bags of marijuana in his pocket and gave them to Sergeant Colon, along with a knife he removed from his back pocket. According to the police report, when Colon then asked Samuels about the contents of the Ford, Samuels became nervous. Sergeant Colon opened the driver's side door of the Expedition and found a firearm ย a loaded Ruger 9mm handgun-on the floor. Both Samuels and Allen were then placed under arrest; Samuels for unlawful possession of a handgun and marijuana, and appellant for drinking in public (which is an arrestable offense under City of Boston Ordinance 16-5.1).</p>\n<p>At that point, other law enforcement officers began to arrive to provide assistance, including Officer James Coyne. According to Officer Coyne's affidavit, Sergeant Colon advised him that they had already found a gun in the Expedition, and \"handed [appellant] off\" to Coyne. In his affidavit, Officer Coyne explained that at this point he assumed, based on his training and experience, that Sergeant Colon wanted to separate the two suspects while he continued to investigate the gun. Officer Coyne did not realize that appellant had already been placed under arrest but had not been given his <i>Miranda</i> warnings.</p>\n<p>Officer Coyne walked appellant over to his police cruiser and pat-frisked him again, finding a single Mercedes Benz key <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> (which Allen said belonged to his aunt) and some cash in his front pockets, both of which he returned to Allen. After placing Allen in the rear of the cruiser, Officer Coyne asked him whether there was anything illegal in the Mercedes, stating that if there were, Allen's aunt would be charged with it. Appellant replied \"whatever you find, charge me with it.\" According to his affidavit, Officer Coyne then asked appellant for the key to the Mercedes, but appellant denied having it. Officer Coyne instructed appellant to get out of the cruiser. He then discovered that the key was no longer in the pocket where he had found it just moments before. After unsuccessfully searching the rear compartment of the cruiser and the area outside the vehicle for the key, Officer Coyne told Allen that, if need be, he would break the window to get into the Mercedes. Appellant sat down on the sidewalk and retrieved the key from his sock.</p>\n<p>Once Allen was returned to the rear of the cruiser, Officer Coyne walked up to the Mercedes. In his affidavit, Officer Coyne averred that, once he had reached the Mercedes, he began to look inside, shining his flashlight to illuminate the vehicle's interior. Officer Coyne explained that he began his inspection by looking through the rear window and then proceeded to the windows on the driver's side as he walked around the side of the car along the curb. According to his sworn testimony, when Officer Coyne reached the corner of the front windshield, he leaned over the fender and the hood of the vehicle, with both feet planted on the ground, and shone his flashlight into the driver's side area. He specifically denied having to walk or sit on the hood to look inside of the car, although he admitted that he may have made some incidental contact with the fender and the windshield as he moved around the vehicle.</p>\n<p>As we discuss further <i>infra,</i> in the memorandum of law accompanying his motion to suppress, Allen presented a different account of this incident. Allen claimed that, \"according to the reports provided in discovery, Officer Coyne then began to attempt to examine the interior of the locked Mercedes. Unable to see anything incriminating in the interior . . ., he positioned himself on top of the hood of the Mercedes, and shined his flashlight into the vehicle's interior.\" The memorandum contained no record citations for this version of events, and Allen's affidavit did not mention Officer Coyne's physical location when he saw the weapon.</p>\n<p>Officer Coyne's affidavit recounted how, once he shone his flashlight into the vehicle from the vantage point he had described (i.e., leaning over the fender and the hood), he was able to see the top of a chrome-colored gun. He immediately notified Sergeant Colon, who walked over to the vehicle, took the key from Coyne, and opened up the driver's side door to confirm that the object was indeed a gun. Officer Coyne approached appellant and demanded his license to carry a firearm, which appellant stated he did not have. According to the officer's affidavit, Coyne then removed Allen from the cruiser, placed him in handcuffs, informed him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and took him to the police station for booking.</p>\n<p>Officer Coyne's affidavit further states that, after they arrived at the station, and appellant had been informed of his <i>Miranda</i> rights for a second time, appellant stated that the \"peashooter\" was his and that the police \"should just slap me off the head with the gun and send me home.\" Appellant also said that there were \"no bullets in the tube but in the clip\" and that the gun had a serial number. According to Officer Coyne, this conversation lasted no more than 5-10 minutes. However, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> the affidavit Allen submitted in support of his motion to suppress, Allen presented an alternative version of events. He stated generally that he had been \"questioned under duress and coercion,\" and claimed that the statements he had allegedly made \"were the result of questioning after being placed under arrest but prior to being informed of my <i>Miranda</i> rights.\"</p>\n<p>After Allen and Samuels had been arrested, Lieutenant Cruz, who remained at the scene, decided to impound the cars and conduct an inventory search of the vehicles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>In the memorandum of law supporting his motion to suppress, Allen argued (1) that Officer Coyne's search of his person and seizure of the key violated the Fourth Amendment; (2) that the search of the Mercedes was illegal and was not justified by any exception to the warrant requirement; and (3) that his questioning by Officer Coyne, both before and after he was given the <i>Miranda</i> warnings, violated his Fifth Amendment rights. He also requested an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>In support of his motion, appellant attached an unsigned affidavit which stated, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>1. My name is Darrell Allen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. I am the defendant in the above captioned matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. On the morning of May 28, 2005, I was with Balgene Samuels on Maywood Street in Roxbury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. Three police officers arrived and searched me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5. Items were taken from me, I was handcuffed and placed under arrest for drinking in public, and placed in a police car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>6. A Mercedes nearby was opened with a key alleged to have been taken from me and searched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7. I was never seen in the Mercedes and I did not consent or grant permission to the search of the Mercedes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>8. It is alleged that I made certain statements, which if made, were the result of questioning after being placed under arrest but prior to being informed of my <i>Miranda</i> rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>9. I made no knowing, intelligent, or voluntary waiver of my rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>10. I was questioned under duress and coercion.</blockquote>\n<p>The government filed its opposition on November 21, 2006. It was not until December 12, 2006, nearly three weeks after the government had filed its opposition, that Allen filed another affidavit in support of his motion to suppress that was identical in all respects to the first one, except that he had signed the second one.</p>\n<p>The government's opposition to the suppression motion was supported by excerpts of grand jury testimony by Sergeant Colon in Suffolk County Superior Court and the sworn affidavits of Lieutenant Cruz and Officer Coyne, each of which had a number of accompanying exhibits. These included the Boston Police Department Motor Vehicle Inventory Search Policy and the Vehicle Inventory reports on the two cars, a map generated by the Boston Regional Intelligence Center regarding the incidence of larcenies of motor vehicles in the neighborhood of the arrest, the Boston Police Incident Report on the arrests, photographs of the vehicles at the scene, and appellant's Boston Police Department Prisoner Booking Form containing a signed acknowledgment that he had been informed of his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> The government argued (1) that Officer Coyne's search of the defendant and seizure of the key to the Mercedes was justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest; (2) that the seizure of the firearm was proper both because its discovery would have been inevitable after the Mercedes had been (properly) impounded, towed, and subject to an inventory search, and also because the weapon was in plain view; and (3) that with the exception of one statement that he had made to Officer Coyne before he was administered the <i>Miranda</i> warnings, all of appellant's statements were voluntary and therefore admissible. Finally, the government argued that Allen had not met his burden to obtain an evidentiary hearing because he had failed to adequately contest the government's claims. It maintained that Allen's one-page affidavit was insufficient to establish the existence of any disputed facts that would warrant an evidentiary hearing, even though Allen had an opportunity to generate those disputes. The government's version of the events (as contained in Colon's grand jury testimony, the Boston Police Department Incident report, and the Supplemental Report prepared by Officer Coyne) had been disclosed to Allen at the outset of the case.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled for the government. In reaching its conclusion, the district court considered as evidence \"only the statements made in the affidavits\" submitted. On this basis, the court found that an evidentiary hearing was not required because Allen had \"not made a threshold showing that material facts [were] in dispute.\" The court then denied the motion to suppress the firearm and ammunition on the ground that the items \"inevitably would have been discovered [in] an inventory search pursuant to the impoundment of the Mercedes following the defendant's arrest.\" Citing the affidavit of Luis Cruz and the Boston Police Department Inventory Search Policy, both of which were attached to the government's opposition, the court explained that the impoundment of the Mercedes would have been proper in order to protect it from vandalism or theft, given the \"hour of the day and the undisputed description of the area of defendant's arrest as one `plagued by [ ] firearm-related violence' and one `in which car theft and car vandalism frequently occur.'\" Additionally, the court held that the seizure of the firearm was independently justified by the fact that Officer Coyne had discovered it in plain view. Finally, the court ruled that, with the exception of Allen's statement that \"[w]hatever you find, charge me with it,\" which the government conceded was made prior to Officer Coyne's recitation of the <i>Miranda</i> warnings, all of appellant's other statements were voluntary and thus admissible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The Motion for Reconsideration</h2>\n<p>Three weeks after the district court's ruling, Allen filed a request for reconsideration, supplementing his original motion with \"additional information\" which, he asserted, was \"not previously available at the time it was filed.\" Specifically, appellant submitted the affidavit of Balgene Samuels, which contained certain factual assertions regarding the neighborhood in which the men had been arrested and the events of May 28, 2005. In his motion for reconsideration, appellant claimed that Samuels's testimony was not previously available because state charges against Samuels, which had raised legitimate Fifth Amendment concerns for him, had been pending until November 8, 2006, and because Samuels had been unreachable until his phone service was \"reconnected\" on February 13, 2007.</p>\n<p>In his affidavit, Samuels stated, inter alia, that his family had owned a home at 33 Maywood Street since 1951; that none <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> of the family's cars, which had always been parked lawfully on the street nearby, had ever been broken into, stolen, or vandalized while parked there; and that at no time had his family's home been broken into or vandalized, nor had he heard of any similar occurrences in the neighborhood. Samuels further asserted that neither he nor Allen had a beer bottle in their possession on May 28, 2005, although Sergeant Colon did pick one up from the sidewalk near where they were standing. He claimed that Sergeant Colon told both men that they would not be arrested for the marijuana or the drinking because the police were only \"looking for guns.\" Samuels also stated that Allen told him that before being taken from the scene, he had observed a police officer climb onto the hood of the Mercedes.</p>\n<p>Appellant argued that the \"newly available\" Samuels affidavit called into question a number of the government's factual allegations, including its assertion, adopted by the court, that the neighborhood where appellant was arrested was \"plagued\" by firearm violence and that if left unattended, the Mercedes would have been at risk of vandalism and theft. Allen noted that the Samuels affidavit contradicted the government's claim that Allen was drinking a beer or had a beer in his pocket when the police approached. He emphasized that the new evidence presented serious questions regarding the sequence of events leading up to the seizure of the firearm, including Officer Coyne's location as he looked into the Mercedes and noticed the weapon. Finally, appellant pointed out that the government's own discovery materials demonstrated that even at the time of his original motion, there had been a genuine factual dispute in the record: ATF Agent Thomas Crowley, in his grand jury testimony, had stated that Officer Coyne had actually gotten onto the hood of the car in order to look into the vehicle.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In opposing the motion for reconsideration, the government argued that Allen had failed to show that Samuels was unavailable while the original motion was pending or that the information in his affidavit was \"newly discovered,\" particularly given that Allen himself had been present at the underlying events but had chosen not to include any substantive information in his own affidavit.</p>\n<p>In a careful written opinion that was significantly longer than its original decision denying the motion to suppress, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. The court noted that appellant had been put on notice as to the government's version of the events in question as early as November 17, 2006, when the government filed its original opposition to the motion to suppress.<sup>[2]</sup> Nevertheless, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> the affidavit Allen signed and executed twenty-one days later, he chose not to address any of the government's central factual assertions or to present any additional evidence that would have controverted its story. Specifically, appellant's affidavit disputed neither Officer Coyne's assertion that he had discovered the firearm in plain view in the Mercedes by simply peering into it from the sidewalk, nor the government's claim that the Mercedes was subject to an inventory search pursuant to a lawful impoundment by the investigating officers.</p>\n<p>Turning to the Samuels affidavit, the district court observed that all of the proffered evidence regarding the Grove Hill neighborhood of Roxbury had been available to appellant when he filed his initial motion to suppress, or at least by the time he filed his own sworn affidavit on December 12, 2006. Indeed, on the critical issue of \"whether the firearm . . . was discovered in plain view without Coyne's having to climb onto the hood of the Mercedes,\" the district court emphasized that the Samuels affidavit did \"nothing more than recite an out-of-court-statement made by the defendant himself.\" The court found it curious that Allen did not include this crucial fact in his own affidavit, and that he had since failed to file a supplemental affidavit with this information. Nor did the court credit appellant's assertion that Samuels had been unavailable because of Fifth Amendment concerns, noting that Samuels's state court proceedings had concluded with his guilty plea on November 8, 2006, and he was therefore available at the time that Allen had filed his sworn affidavit. Moreover, the court discounted Allen's insistence that the fact that Samuels' phone had only been reconnected on February 13, 2007, had prevented Allen from reaching him; the court inferred that, since Samuels' own affidavit stated that he had lived at his family's Maywood Street residence since 2001, Allen would have known how to find him.</p>\n<p>Finally, the district court noted that, in his original motion to suppress, appellant had not cited Special Agent Crowley's grand jury testimony, and that the court was not required to \"rummage through [its] files looking for the evidence now advanced.\"<sup>[3]</sup> Finally, the court indicated that its decision on the motion to suppress would not necessarily have been affected by the Crowley testimony even if it had been aware of it, since Crowley was not a percipient witness to the relevant events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>\"The test for granting an evidentiary hearing in a criminal case [is] substantive: did the defendant make a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt or dispute?\" <i>United States v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 523 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (concluding that district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to hold evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress). \"The district court has considerable discretion in determining the need for, and the utility of, evidentiary hearings, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> and we will reverse the court's denial of an evidentiary hearing in respect to a motion in a criminal case only for manifest abuse of that discretion.\" <i>United States v. Staula,</i> 80 F.3d 596, 603 (1st Cir.1996) (upholding district court's decision to forego evidentiary hearing on motion to suppress).</p>\n<p>To obtain an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress physical evidence, a defendant must make a sufficient showing that the seized evidence \"was the product of a warrantless search that does not fall within any exception to the warrant requirement. The burden is on the defendant to allege facts, sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural, to enable the court to conclude that a substantial claim is presented.\" <i>United States v. Calderon,</i> 77 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Appellant now argues that the district court committed reversible error by making numerous factual determinations adverse to appellant in spite of what he characterizes as a \"contradictory\" record. Under these circumstances, he contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing to allow him to present evidence, contest the government's version of events, and subject its witnesses to cross-examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Firearm and Ammunition</h2>\n<p>We focus on the plain view exception to the warrant requirement, an alternative ground for the court's denial of the motion to suppress. Under that exception, a warrantless seizure is nevertheless lawful if \"(1) the seizing police officer lawfully reached the position from which he could see the item in plain view; (2) the seizure satisfied the probable cause standard; and (3) the seizing officer had a `lawful right of access to the object itself.'\" <i>United States v. Antrim,</i> 389 F.3d 276, 283 (1st Cir.2004). Thus, in order to demonstrate the existence of a substantial constitutional claim, appellant was required to proffer specific facts plausibly suggesting that the search of the Mercedes did not satisfy at least one of the prongs of the plain view exception. As the government points out, Allen does not challenge the third prong (i.e., whether the officer had a lawful right of access to the object itself).<sup>[4]</sup> Accordingly, we inquire whether it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to find that appellant had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding either whether Officer Coyne \"lawfully reached the position\" from which he saw the gun in plain view or the existence of probable cause.</p>\n<p>As we have noted, in ruling on appellant's original motion to suppress, the district court \"considered as evidence only the statements made in the affidavits submitted by the parties.\" In the affidavit attached to his motion, Allen did not dispute the Government's version of events related to the search of the vehicle. The affidavit does not contradict the officer's direct statement that he was able to see the gun in the driver's side door of the Mercedes by simply leaning over the hood and shining his flashlight into the window. <i>See </i><i>Staula,</i> 80 F.3d at 604 (noting that an evidentiary hearing was not required where appellant's affidavit contained no facts that contradicted a police officer's direct statements). Indeed, the affidavit's only references to the search of the Mercedes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> are appellant's assertions that \"[a] Mercedes nearby was opened with a key alleged to have been taken from me and searched\" and \"I was never seen with the Mercedes and I did not consent or grant permission to the search of the Mercedes.\" These vague statements, neither of which even mentions the manner in which Officer Coyne searched the vehicle, were insufficient to call into question the government's account.</p>\n<p>That is also true of the unsupported factual assertions in appellant's memorandum of law that Officer Coyne \"positioned himself on top of the hood of the Mercedes,\" and that he \"climbed onto the hood of the Mercedes,\" from which point he made his observations about the vehicle's content. Appellant's memorandum did not contain any record citations that would have confirmed these allegations, and it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to consider only the verified evidence before it. In <i>Calderon,</i> we similarly found no reason to disturb the district court's denial of an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress where the defendant \"vaguely claim[ed]\" that a consent to search was \"coerced or was otherwise ineffective,\" but \"offer[ed] no affidavit or statement . . . to that effect, describe[d] no circumstances supporting his assertion, and ma[de] no offer of proof relative to any other facts that might support his assertion.\" 77 F.3d at 9.</p>\n<p>It is true that, before describing Officer Coyne's actions while he was ostensibly positioned on the hood of the Mercedes, the memorandum stated that \"[o]utside the view of the defendant, <i>according to the reports provided in discovery,</i> Officer Coyne then began to attempt to examine the interior of the locked Mercedes\" (emphasis added). This vague allusion to \"reports provided in discovery,\" is insufficient to generate a material factual dispute about whether Officer Coyne \"lawfully reached the position from which he could see the item in plain view,\" <i>Antrim,</i> 389 F.3d at 283. Appellant did not attach the relevant Grand Jury testimony to his motion. Nor did he describe its contents in his affidavit, or even specifically identify it as the source of the allegations in his motion to suppress. Because appellant failed to substantiate the vague assertion that Coyne had climbed upon the vehicle, he failed to raise a genuine disputed fact with respect to this prong of the plain view analysis.</p>\n<p>Nor did appellant's filings in the district court call into question whether there was probable cause to seize the gun, <i>see </i><i>Antrim,</i> 389 F.3d at 283. In his affidavit, Officer Coyne stated unequivocally that when he shined the flashlight into the Mercedes, he observed the top of a chrome gun and immediately informed the other officers of his discovery of a firearm. Appellant's affidavit proffers no specific facts to contradict this assertion. In the face of Officer Coyne's observation of specific contraband, appellant does not raise a serious question regarding probable cause, and the district court's refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Statements</h2>\n<p>Appellant's affidavit contained three assertions pertaining to his questioning by the Boston Police Department:</p>\n<blockquote>It is alleged that I made certain statements, which if made, were the result of questioning after being placed under arrest but prior to being informed of my <i>Miranda</i> rights[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I made no knowing, intelligent, or voluntary waiver of my rights [and;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I was questioned under duress and coercion.</blockquote>\n<p>Setting aside the one statement properly suppressed by the district court, which the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> Government concedes appellant made before he received the <i>Miranda</i> warnings, these conclusory assertions must be evaluated in light of the government's response.</p>\n<p>In his affidavit, Officer Coyne averred that after he had discovered the handgun and confirmed that Allen did not have a license to carry a firearm, he handcuffed Allen, read him his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and took him to the police station for booking. At the station, Officer Coyne administered the <i>Miranda</i> warnings a second time, and had a conversation with appellant lasting approximately five to ten minutes. According to his affidavit, during this time, Officer Coyne acted professionally and never yelled or threatened appellant. Furthermore, the record before the district court included a booking form containing a <i>Miranda</i> warning acknowledgment that had been signed by the defendant.</p>\n<p>In the face of the Coyne affidavit and the signed <i>Miranda</i> acknowledgment, and faced only with appellant's vague assertion that \"certain statements . . . if made, were the result of questioning after being placed under the arrest but prior to being informed of [his] <i>Miranda</i> rights,\" unsupported by any references to specific statements he sought to suppress, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find, without an evidentiary hearing, that the statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Motion for Reconsideration</h2>\n<p>We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.<sup>[5]</sup><i>United States v. Fanfan,</i> 558 F.3d 105, 106 (1st Cir.2009). Motions for reconsideration are not to be used as \"a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures [or] allow a party to advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.\" <i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 104 (1st Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Instead, motions for reconsideration are appropriate only in a limited number of circumstances: if the moving party presents newly discovered evidence, if there has been an intervening change in the law, or if the movant can demonstrate that the original decision was based on a manifest error of law or was clearly unjust. <i>Marie v. Allied Home Mortgage Corp.,</i> 402 F.3d 1, 7 n. 2 (1st Cir.2005). A court will deny a motion for reconsideration based on the \"new evidence\" exception if that evidence \"in the exercise of due diligence[ ] could have been presented earlier.\" <i>Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local Union No. 25,</i> 426 F.3d 416, 422 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although we review for abuse of discretion the district court's determination that Allen had not made this required showing, we would find no error in the district court's decision even if our review were de novo.</p>\n<p>Appellant's motion for reconsideration was based on two propositions: first, that the \"new evidence\" he proffered ย the Samuels affidavit ย required the court to hold an evidentiary hearing on the merits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> of appellant's motion to suppress, and second, that the court had erred by overlooking evidence in its own records and ruling on the original motion without an evidentiary hearing. The district court was correct to reject both these claims.</p>\n<p>Allen had filed his original motion to suppress, along with the unsigned affidavit, on November 3, 2006. The government filed its original opposition on November 16, and an amended opposition on November 21. At least by this date, then, Allen was on notice about the government's version of events. Nevertheless, on December 16, the defendant filed a signed affidavit which, despite his access to the government's opposition papers, was identical to the original ten-paragraph affidavit, and none of which directly responded to the government's plain view assertions or specified the alleged <i>Miranda</i> violations. The court ruled on the motion on February 8, 2007.</p>\n<p>All of the evidence in the Samuels affidavit was available to appellant at the time the original motion was filed, and Allen himself could have provided that information in his original affidavit; indeed, on the key plain view inquiry, the Samuels affidavit says only that it was <i>Allen</i> who told him that he had seen Officer Coyne climb onto the car. Appellant provided no explanation for why this information was missing from his own affidavit, and no satisfactory justification for the submission of the Samuels affidavit in late February. Samuels's state court proceedings were resolved by November 8, 2006, and the district court was not obligated to accept Allen's argument that Samuels was \"unavailable\" due to a lack of phone service. Indeed, the district court reasonably inferred that Allen knew where Samuels lived and could get in touch with him if he had wanted to.</p>\n<p>Nor did the court abuse its discretion in concluding that the mere reference in appellant's memorandum in support of his motion to suppress to Officer Coyne having climbed on the hood of the Mercedes was insufficient cause for an evidentiary hearing. As we have discussed, the reference was unsupported by any source. Although appellant cited to ATF Agent Crowley's grand jury testimony in his motion for reconsideration to argue that record evidence supported his version of events, this proffer was too little, too late. Indeed, as the court noted, Agent Crowley was not even \"a percipient witness to the events in question,\"<sup>[6]</sup> and therefore the court explicitly disclaimed the notion that its decision to deny the suppression motion without a hearing would have been different if it had known about the Crowley testimony.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The grand jury minutes contained the following exchange:\n</p>\n<p>Q: And he actually had to get up, he got up on the hood with a flashlight and shined it in?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Later, in response to a juror's question, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p>A: He was on the driver's side kind of like where the door and the windshield come together looking down that way. I believe.</p>\n<p>Q: Let me ask you, Special Agent Crowley, at some point, and if you need to refer to the Form 26 about this, did Mr. Coyne ย did Officer Coyne actually sit up on the, on the hood of the car and look in?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q: On the inside, so he could see inside the passenger compartment?</p>\n<p>A: Yes. He actually looked through the front windshield, I'm sorry, not the side door.</p>\n<p>Q: Okay.</p>\n<p>A: From the windshield right in.</p>\n<p>[2]  On the same day, the government filed a motion for leave to file a memorandum in excess of twenty pages. After the district court denied this motion on November 21, 2006, the government immediately filed its amended opposition on the same day.</p>\n<p>[3]  It is unclear whether the court did indeed have this material \"in its files\" before it received appellant's motion for reconsideration. Allen obtained the grand jury testimony as part of the government's production of documents in the case, but did not specifically identify that testimony as the source of his unsupported claim that Officer Coyne climbed on top of the Mercedes until he filed his Motion to Reconsider. At that point, he also submitted the grand jury testimony to the court as an exhibit to his motion.</p>\n<p>[4]  This element asks not whether the officer was lawfully in a position to see the contraband (the first element of the plain view analysis), but whether he could lawfully seize it without committing a trespass. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jones,</i> 187 F.3d 210, 221 n. 10 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p>[5]  The government argues that appellant has waived this issue by failing in his brief to separately enumerate the denial of the motion for reconsideration as one of the issues presented in this appeal or to independently challenge this decision in the argument section of his brief. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), (a)(9); <i>Ramos v. Roche Prods., Inc.,</i> 936 F.2d 43, 51 (1st Cir.1991). Instead, appellant raises a general challenge to the district court's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing in light of the evidence before it-including the evidence he submitted in connection with his motion for reconsideration. We do not address the government's waiver argument because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p>[6]  Asked to describe his involvement in the case before the Grand Jury, Agent Crowley stated that he had \"reviewed all the reports relative to that arrest,\" \"spoken to the arresting officers,\" and done a background check on the firearm in question, but that he \"was not present that night.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>On June 7, 2006, a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging appellant with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1). On November 3, 2006, appellant filed a motion to suppress the firearm and ammunition seized by Boston police officers on May 28, 2005, the night of his arrest, as well as certain statements <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> he made to Officer John Coyne that evening. The government filed its opposition to the motion on November 16, 2006. On February 8, 2007, without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted in part and denied in part the motion to suppress, prompting appellant to file, on February 27, 2007, a motion for reconsideration, with a supplemental affidavit and exhibits. The district court was unpersuaded and denied the motion for reconsideration on May 10, 2007.</p>\n<p>Appellant entered his guilty plea on June 7, 2007. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Allen retained the right, which he now exercises, to appeal the district court's suppression ruling. He was sentenced on March 5, 2008, to 180 months (15 years) in prison, the mandatory minimum sentence for the charged offense, and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>We begin by describing the record before the district court at the time of defendant's original motion to suppress, noting purportedly disputed facts where relevant.</p>\n<p>On May 28, 2005, Lieutenant Luis Cruz, Sergeant Felipe Colon, and Officer Ivan Bermejo, all of the Boston Police Department, were on patrol in an unmarked police cruiser in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. At approximately 1:00 a.m., while driving down Blue Hill Avenue, they saw two men, later identified as appellant and Balgene Samuels, drinking from a clear bottle of beer. The officers turned their car around and returned to the location where they had seen the two men. The officers observed two cars parked nearby on Maywood Street; a Mercedes Benz CLK 320 Sedan, and a Ford Expedition sports utility vehicle. According to Lieutenant Cruz's affidavit, as the police approached the men, Lieutenant Cruz noticed a half-full bottle of Corona brand beer sticking out of Allen's jacket pocket. The two men identified themselves to the police; appellant stated that the Mercedes belonged to his aunt and Samuels told the officers that the Expedition was his brother's. Sergeant Colon informed the men that because of the high gun activity in the area, they were going to be pat frisked. After the frisk, Sergeant Colon removed the bottle of Corona from appellant's right jacket pocket and a small silver knife from his left pant pocket. Samuels, for his part, admitted that there were several bags of marijuana in his pocket and gave them to Sergeant Colon, along with a knife he removed from his back pocket. According to the police report, when Colon then asked Samuels about the contents of the Ford, Samuels became nervous. Sergeant Colon opened the driver's side door of the Expedition and found a firearm ย a loaded Ruger 9mm handgun-on the floor. Both Samuels and Allen were then placed under arrest; Samuels for unlawful possession of a handgun and marijuana, and appellant for drinking in public (which is an arrestable offense under City of Boston Ordinance 16-5.1).</p>\n<p>At that point, other law enforcement officers began to arrive to provide assistance, including Officer James Coyne. According to Officer Coyne's affidavit, Sergeant Colon advised him that they had already found a gun in the Expedition, and \"handed [appellant] off\" to Coyne. In his affidavit, Officer Coyne explained that at this point he assumed, based on his training and experience, that Sergeant Colon wanted to separate the two suspects while he continued to investigate the gun. Officer Coyne did not realize that appellant had already been placed under arrest but had not been given his <i>Miranda</i> warnings.</p>\n<p>Officer Coyne walked appellant over to his police cruiser and pat-frisked him again, finding a single Mercedes Benz key <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> (which Allen said belonged to his aunt) and some cash in his front pockets, both of which he returned to Allen. After placing Allen in the rear of the cruiser, Officer Coyne asked him whether there was anything illegal in the Mercedes, stating that if there were, Allen's aunt would be charged with it. Appellant replied \"whatever you find, charge me with it.\" According to his affidavit, Officer Coyne then asked appellant for the key to the Mercedes, but appellant denied having it. Officer Coyne instructed appellant to get out of the cruiser. He then discovered that the key was no longer in the pocket where he had found it just moments before. After unsuccessfully searching the rear compartment of the cruiser and the area outside the vehicle for the key, Officer Coyne told Allen that, if need be, he would break the window to get into the Mercedes. Appellant sat down on the sidewalk and retrieved the key from his sock.</p>\n<p>Once Allen was returned to the rear of the cruiser, Officer Coyne walked up to the Mercedes. In his affidavit, Officer Coyne averred that, once he had reached the Mercedes, he began to look inside, shining his flashlight to illuminate the vehicle's interior. Officer Coyne explained that he began his inspection by looking through the rear window and then proceeded to the windows on the driver's side as he walked around the side of the car along the curb. According to his sworn testimony, when Officer Coyne reached the corner of the front windshield, he leaned over the fender and the hood of the vehicle, with both feet planted on the ground, and shone his flashlight into the driver's side area. He specifically denied having to walk or sit on the hood to look inside of the car, although he admitted that he may have made some incidental contact with the fender and the windshield as he moved around the vehicle.</p>\n<p>As we discuss further <i>infra,</i> in the memorandum of law accompanying his motion to suppress, Allen presented a different account of this incident. Allen claimed that, \"according to the reports provided in discovery, Officer Coyne then began to attempt to examine the interior of the locked Mercedes. Unable to see anything incriminating in the interior . . ., he positioned himself on top of the hood of the Mercedes, and shined his flashlight into the vehicle's interior.\" The memorandum contained no record citations for this version of events, and Allen's affidavit did not mention Officer Coyne's physical location when he saw the weapon.</p>\n<p>Officer Coyne's affidavit recounted how, once he shone his flashlight into the vehicle from the vantage point he had described (i.e., leaning over the fender and the hood), he was able to see the top of a chrome-colored gun. He immediately notified Sergeant Colon, who walked over to the vehicle, took the key from Coyne, and opened up the driver's side door to confirm that the object was indeed a gun. Officer Coyne approached appellant and demanded his license to carry a firearm, which appellant stated he did not have. According to the officer's affidavit, Coyne then removed Allen from the cruiser, placed him in handcuffs, informed him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and took him to the police station for booking.</p>\n<p>Officer Coyne's affidavit further states that, after they arrived at the station, and appellant had been informed of his <i>Miranda</i> rights for a second time, appellant stated that the \"peashooter\" was his and that the police \"should just slap me off the head with the gun and send me home.\" Appellant also said that there were \"no bullets in the tube but in the clip\" and that the gun had a serial number. According to Officer Coyne, this conversation lasted no more than 5-10 minutes. However, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> the affidavit Allen submitted in support of his motion to suppress, Allen presented an alternative version of events. He stated generally that he had been \"questioned under duress and coercion,\" and claimed that the statements he had allegedly made \"were the result of questioning after being placed under arrest but prior to being informed of my <i>Miranda</i> rights.\"</p>\n<p>After Allen and Samuels had been arrested, Lieutenant Cruz, who remained at the scene, decided to impound the cars and conduct an inventory search of the vehicles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>In the memorandum of law supporting his motion to suppress, Allen argued (1) that Officer Coyne's search of his person and seizure of the key violated the Fourth Amendment; (2) that the search of the Mercedes was illegal and was not justified by any exception to the warrant requirement; and (3) that his questioning by Officer Coyne, both before and after he was given the <i>Miranda</i> warnings, violated his Fifth Amendment rights. He also requested an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>In support of his motion, appellant attached an unsigned affidavit which stated, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>1. My name is Darrell Allen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. I am the defendant in the above captioned matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. On the morning of May 28, 2005, I was with Balgene Samuels on Maywood Street in Roxbury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. Three police officers arrived and searched me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5. Items were taken from me, I was handcuffed and placed under arrest for drinking in public, and placed in a police car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>6. A Mercedes nearby was opened with a key alleged to have been taken from me and searched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7. I was never seen in the Mercedes and I did not consent or grant permission to the search of the Mercedes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>8. It is alleged that I made certain statements, which if made, were the result of questioning after being placed under arrest but prior to being informed of my <i>Miranda</i> rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>9. I made no knowing, intelligent, or voluntary waiver of my rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>10. I was questioned under duress and coercion.</blockquote>\n<p>The government filed its opposition on November 21, 2006. It was not until December 12, 2006, nearly three weeks after the government had filed its opposition, that Allen filed another affidavit in support of his motion to suppress that was identical in all respects to the first one, except that he had signed the second one.</p>\n<p>The government's opposition to the suppression motion was supported by excerpts of grand jury testimony by Sergeant Colon in Suffolk County Superior Court and the sworn affidavits of Lieutenant Cruz and Officer Coyne, each of which had a number of accompanying exhibits. These included the Boston Police Department Motor Vehicle Inventory Search Policy and the Vehicle Inventory reports on the two cars, a map generated by the Boston Regional Intelligence Center regarding the incidence of larcenies of motor vehicles in the neighborhood of the arrest, the Boston Police Incident Report on the arrests, photographs of the vehicles at the scene, and appellant's Boston Police Department Prisoner Booking Form containing a signed acknowledgment that he had been informed of his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> The government argued (1) that Officer Coyne's search of the defendant and seizure of the key to the Mercedes was justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest; (2) that the seizure of the firearm was proper both because its discovery would have been inevitable after the Mercedes had been (properly) impounded, towed, and subject to an inventory search, and also because the weapon was in plain view; and (3) that with the exception of one statement that he had made to Officer Coyne before he was administered the <i>Miranda</i> warnings, all of appellant's statements were voluntary and therefore admissible. Finally, the government argued that Allen had not met his burden to obtain an evidentiary hearing because he had failed to adequately contest the government's claims. It maintained that Allen's one-page affidavit was insufficient to establish the existence of any disputed facts that would warrant an evidentiary hearing, even though Allen had an opportunity to generate those disputes. The government's version of the events (as contained in Colon's grand jury testimony, the Boston Police Department Incident report, and the Supplemental Report prepared by Officer Coyne) had been disclosed to Allen at the outset of the case.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled for the government. In reaching its conclusion, the district court considered as evidence \"only the statements made in the affidavits\" submitted. On this basis, the court found that an evidentiary hearing was not required because Allen had \"not made a threshold showing that material facts [were] in dispute.\" The court then denied the motion to suppress the firearm and ammunition on the ground that the items \"inevitably would have been discovered [in] an inventory search pursuant to the impoundment of the Mercedes following the defendant's arrest.\" Citing the affidavit of Luis Cruz and the Boston Police Department Inventory Search Policy, both of which were attached to the government's opposition, the court explained that the impoundment of the Mercedes would have been proper in order to protect it from vandalism or theft, given the \"hour of the day and the undisputed description of the area of defendant's arrest as one `plagued by [ ] firearm-related violence' and one `in which car theft and car vandalism frequently occur.'\" Additionally, the court held that the seizure of the firearm was independently justified by the fact that Officer Coyne had discovered it in plain view. Finally, the court ruled that, with the exception of Allen's statement that \"[w]hatever you find, charge me with it,\" which the government conceded was made prior to Officer Coyne's recitation of the <i>Miranda</i> warnings, all of appellant's other statements were voluntary and thus admissible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The Motion for Reconsideration</h2>\n<p>Three weeks after the district court's ruling, Allen filed a request for reconsideration, supplementing his original motion with \"additional information\" which, he asserted, was \"not previously available at the time it was filed.\" Specifically, appellant submitted the affidavit of Balgene Samuels, which contained certain factual assertions regarding the neighborhood in which the men had been arrested and the events of May 28, 2005. In his motion for reconsideration, appellant claimed that Samuels's testimony was not previously available because state charges against Samuels, which had raised legitimate Fifth Amendment concerns for him, had been pending until November 8, 2006, and because Samuels had been unreachable until his phone service was \"reconnected\" on February 13, 2007.</p>\n<p>In his affidavit, Samuels stated, inter alia, that his family had owned a home at 33 Maywood Street since 1951; that none <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> of the family's cars, which had always been parked lawfully on the street nearby, had ever been broken into, stolen, or vandalized while parked there; and that at no time had his family's home been broken into or vandalized, nor had he heard of any similar occurrences in the neighborhood. Samuels further asserted that neither he nor Allen had a beer bottle in their possession on May 28, 2005, although Sergeant Colon did pick one up from the sidewalk near where they were standing. He claimed that Sergeant Colon told both men that they would not be arrested for the marijuana or the drinking because the police were only \"looking for guns.\" Samuels also stated that Allen told him that before being taken from the scene, he had observed a police officer climb onto the hood of the Mercedes.</p>\n<p>Appellant argued that the \"newly available\" Samuels affidavit called into question a number of the government's factual allegations, including its assertion, adopted by the court, that the neighborhood where appellant was arrested was \"plagued\" by firearm violence and that if left unattended, the Mercedes would have been at risk of vandalism and theft. Allen noted that the Samuels affidavit contradicted the government's claim that Allen was drinking a beer or had a beer in his pocket when the police approached. He emphasized that the new evidence presented serious questions regarding the sequence of events leading up to the seizure of the firearm, including Officer Coyne's location as he looked into the Mercedes and noticed the weapon. Finally, appellant pointed out that the government's own discovery materials demonstrated that even at the time of his original motion, there had been a genuine factual dispute in the record: ATF Agent Thomas Crowley, in his grand jury testimony, had stated that Officer Coyne had actually gotten onto the hood of the car in order to look into the vehicle.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In opposing the motion for reconsideration, the government argued that Allen had failed to show that Samuels was unavailable while the original motion was pending or that the information in his affidavit was \"newly discovered,\" particularly given that Allen himself had been present at the underlying events but had chosen not to include any substantive information in his own affidavit.</p>\n<p>In a careful written opinion that was significantly longer than its original decision denying the motion to suppress, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. The court noted that appellant had been put on notice as to the government's version of the events in question as early as November 17, 2006, when the government filed its original opposition to the motion to suppress.<sup>[2]</sup> Nevertheless, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> the affidavit Allen signed and executed twenty-one days later, he chose not to address any of the government's central factual assertions or to present any additional evidence that would have controverted its story. Specifically, appellant's affidavit disputed neither Officer Coyne's assertion that he had discovered the firearm in plain view in the Mercedes by simply peering into it from the sidewalk, nor the government's claim that the Mercedes was subject to an inventory search pursuant to a lawful impoundment by the investigating officers.</p>\n<p>Turning to the Samuels affidavit, the district court observed that all of the proffered evidence regarding the Grove Hill neighborhood of Roxbury had been available to appellant when he filed his initial motion to suppress, or at least by the time he filed his own sworn affidavit on December 12, 2006. Indeed, on the critical issue of \"whether the firearm . . . was discovered in plain view without Coyne's having to climb onto the hood of the Mercedes,\" the district court emphasized that the Samuels affidavit did \"nothing more than recite an out-of-court-statement made by the defendant himself.\" The court found it curious that Allen did not include this crucial fact in his own affidavit, and that he had since failed to file a supplemental affidavit with this information. Nor did the court credit appellant's assertion that Samuels had been unavailable because of Fifth Amendment concerns, noting that Samuels's state court proceedings had concluded with his guilty plea on November 8, 2006, and he was therefore available at the time that Allen had filed his sworn affidavit. Moreover, the court discounted Allen's insistence that the fact that Samuels' phone had only been reconnected on February 13, 2007, had prevented Allen from reaching him; the court inferred that, since Samuels' own affidavit stated that he had lived at his family's Maywood Street residence since 2001, Allen would have known how to find him.</p>\n<p>Finally, the district court noted that, in his original motion to suppress, appellant had not cited Special Agent Crowley's grand jury testimony, and that the court was not required to \"rummage through [its] files looking for the evidence now advanced.\"<sup>[3]</sup> Finally, the court indicated that its decision on the motion to suppress would not necessarily have been affected by the Crowley testimony even if it had been aware of it, since Crowley was not a percipient witness to the relevant events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>\"The test for granting an evidentiary hearing in a criminal case [is] substantive: did the defendant make a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt or dispute?\" <i>United States v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203232\"><a href=\"/opinion/203232/united-states-v-vilches-navarrete/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (concluding that district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to hold evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress). \"The district court has considerable discretion in determining the need for, and the utility of, evidentiary hearings, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> and we will reverse the court's denial of an evidentiary hearing in respect to a motion in a criminal case only for manifest abuse of that discretion.\" <i>United States v. Staula,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196665\"><a href=\"/opinion/196665/united-states-v-staula/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 603 (1st Cir.1996) (upholding district court's decision to forego evidentiary hearing on motion to suppress).</p>\n<p>To obtain an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress physical evidence, a defendant must make a sufficient showing that the seized evidence \"was the product of a warrantless search that does not fall within any exception to the warrant requirement. The burden is on the defendant to allege facts, sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural, to enable the court to conclude that a substantial claim is presented.\" <i>United States v. Calderon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196602\"><a href=\"/opinion/196602/united-states-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Appellant now argues that the district court committed reversible error by making numerous factual determinations adverse to appellant in spite of what he characterizes as a \"contradictory\" record. Under these circumstances, he contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing to allow him to present evidence, contest the government's version of events, and subject its witnesses to cross-examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Firearm and Ammunition</h2>\n<p>We focus on the plain view exception to the warrant requirement, an alternative ground for the court's denial of the motion to suppress. Under that exception, a warrantless seizure is nevertheless lawful if \"(1) the seizing police officer lawfully reached the position from which he could see the item in plain view; (2) the seizure satisfied the probable cause standard; and (3) the seizing officer had a `lawful right of access to the object itself.'\" <i>United States v. Antrim,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201351\"><a href=\"/opinion/201351/united-states-v-antrim/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span>, 283 (1st Cir.2004). Thus, in order to demonstrate the existence of a substantial constitutional claim, appellant was required to proffer specific facts plausibly suggesting that the search of the Mercedes did not satisfy at least one of the prongs of the plain view exception. As the government points out, Allen does not challenge the third prong (i.e., whether the officer had a lawful right of access to the object itself).<sup>[4]</sup> Accordingly, we inquire whether it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to find that appellant had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding either whether Officer Coyne \"lawfully reached the position\" from which he saw the gun in plain view or the existence of probable cause.</p>\n<p>As we have noted, in ruling on appellant's original motion to suppress, the district court \"considered as evidence only the statements made in the affidavits submitted by the parties.\" In the affidavit attached to his motion, Allen did not dispute the Government's version of events related to the search of the vehicle. The affidavit does not contradict the officer's direct statement that he was able to see the gun in the driver's side door of the Mercedes by simply leaning over the hood and shining his flashlight into the window. <i>See </i><i>Staula,</i> 80 F.3d at 604 (noting that an evidentiary hearing was not required where appellant's affidavit contained no facts that contradicted a police officer's direct statements). Indeed, the affidavit's only references to the search of the Mercedes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> are appellant's assertions that \"[a] Mercedes nearby was opened with a key alleged to have been taken from me and searched\" and \"I was never seen with the Mercedes and I did not consent or grant permission to the search of the Mercedes.\" These vague statements, neither of which even mentions the manner in which Officer Coyne searched the vehicle, were insufficient to call into question the government's account.</p>\n<p>That is also true of the unsupported factual assertions in appellant's memorandum of law that Officer Coyne \"positioned himself on top of the hood of the Mercedes,\" and that he \"climbed onto the hood of the Mercedes,\" from which point he made his observations about the vehicle's content. Appellant's memorandum did not contain any record citations that would have confirmed these allegations, and it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to consider only the verified evidence before it. In <i>Calderon,</i> we similarly found no reason to disturb the district court's denial of an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress where the defendant \"vaguely claim[ed]\" that a consent to search was \"coerced or was otherwise ineffective,\" but \"offer[ed] no affidavit or statement . . . to that effect, describe[d] no circumstances supporting his assertion, and ma[de] no offer of proof relative to any other facts that might support his assertion.\" 77 F.3d at 9.</p>\n<p>It is true that, before describing Officer Coyne's actions while he was ostensibly positioned on the hood of the Mercedes, the memorandum stated that \"[o]utside the view of the defendant, <i>according to the reports provided in discovery,</i> Officer Coyne then began to attempt to examine the interior of the locked Mercedes\" (emphasis added). This vague allusion to \"reports provided in discovery,\" is insufficient to generate a material factual dispute about whether Officer Coyne \"lawfully reached the position from which he could see the item in plain view,\" <i>Antrim,</i> 389 F.3d at 283. Appellant did not attach the relevant Grand Jury testimony to his motion. Nor did he describe its contents in his affidavit, or even specifically identify it as the source of the allegations in his motion to suppress. Because appellant failed to substantiate the vague assertion that Coyne had climbed upon the vehicle, he failed to raise a genuine disputed fact with respect to this prong of the plain view analysis.</p>\n<p>Nor did appellant's filings in the district court call into question whether there was probable cause to seize the gun, <i>see </i><i>Antrim,</i> 389 F.3d at 283. In his affidavit, Officer Coyne stated unequivocally that when he shined the flashlight into the Mercedes, he observed the top of a chrome gun and immediately informed the other officers of his discovery of a firearm. Appellant's affidavit proffers no specific facts to contradict this assertion. In the face of Officer Coyne's observation of specific contraband, appellant does not raise a serious question regarding probable cause, and the district court's refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Statements</h2>\n<p>Appellant's affidavit contained three assertions pertaining to his questioning by the Boston Police Department:</p>\n<blockquote>It is alleged that I made certain statements, which if made, were the result of questioning after being placed under arrest but prior to being informed of my <i>Miranda</i> rights[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I made no knowing, intelligent, or voluntary waiver of my rights [and;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I was questioned under duress and coercion.</blockquote>\n<p>Setting aside the one statement properly suppressed by the district court, which the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> Government concedes appellant made before he received the <i>Miranda</i> warnings, these conclusory assertions must be evaluated in light of the government's response.</p>\n<p>In his affidavit, Officer Coyne averred that after he had discovered the handgun and confirmed that Allen did not have a license to carry a firearm, he handcuffed Allen, read him his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and took him to the police station for booking. At the station, Officer Coyne administered the <i>Miranda</i> warnings a second time, and had a conversation with appellant lasting approximately five to ten minutes. According to his affidavit, during this time, Officer Coyne acted professionally and never yelled or threatened appellant. Furthermore, the record before the district court included a booking form containing a <i>Miranda</i> warning acknowledgment that had been signed by the defendant.</p>\n<p>In the face of the Coyne affidavit and the signed <i>Miranda</i> acknowledgment, and faced only with appellant's vague assertion that \"certain statements . . . if made, were the result of questioning after being placed under the arrest but prior to being informed of [his] <i>Miranda</i> rights,\" unsupported by any references to specific statements he sought to suppress, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find, without an evidentiary hearing, that the statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Motion for Reconsideration</h2>\n<p>We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.<sup>[5]</sup><i>United States v.

Motions for reconsideration are not to be used as \"a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures [or] allow a party to advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.\" <i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202298\"><a href=\"/opinion/202298/iverson-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Instead, motions for reconsideration are appropriate only in a limited number of circumstances: if the moving party presents newly discovered evidence, if there has been an intervening change in the law, or if the movant can demonstrate that the original decision was based on a manifest error of law or was clearly unjust. <i>Marie v.

A court will deny a motion for reconsideration based on the \"new evidence\" exception if that evidence \"in the exercise of due diligence[ ] could have been presented earlier.\" <i>Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local Union No. 25,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201848\"><a href=\"/opinion/201848/emmanuel-v-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span>, 422 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although we review for abuse of discretion the district court's determination that Allen had not made this required showing, we would find no error in the district court's decision even if our review were de novo.</p>\n<p>Appellant's motion for reconsideration was based on two propositions: first, that the \"new evidence\" he proffered ย the Samuels affidavit ย required the court to hold an evidentiary hearing on the merits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> of appellant's motion to suppress, and second, that the court had erred by overlooking evidence in its own records and ruling on the original motion without an evidentiary hearing. The district court was correct to reject both these claims.</p>\n<p>Allen had filed his original motion to suppress, along with the unsigned affidavit, on November 3, 2006. The government filed its original opposition on November 16, and an amended opposition on November 21. At least by this date, then, Allen was on notice about the government's version of events. Nevertheless, on December 16, the defendant filed a signed affidavit which, despite his access to the government's opposition papers, was identical to the original ten-paragraph affidavit, and none of which directly responded to the government's plain view assertions or specified the alleged <i>Miranda</i> violations. The court ruled on the motion on February 8, 2007.</p>\n<p>All of the evidence in the Samuels affidavit was available to appellant at the time the original motion was filed, and Allen himself could have provided that information in his original affidavit; indeed, on the key plain view inquiry, the Samuels affidavit says only that it was <i>Allen</i> who told him that he had seen Officer Coyne climb onto the car. Appellant provided no explanation for why this information was missing from his own affidavit, and no satisfactory justification for the submission of the Samuels affidavit in late February. Samuels's state court proceedings were resolved by November 8, 2006, and the district court was not obligated to accept Allen's argument that Samuels was \"unavailable\" due to a lack of phone service. Indeed, the district court reasonably inferred that Allen knew where Samuels lived and could get in touch with him if he had wanted to.</p>\n<p>Nor did the court abuse its discretion in concluding that the mere reference in appellant's memorandum in support of his motion to suppress to Officer Coyne having climbed on the hood of the Mercedes was insufficient cause for an evidentiary hearing. As we have discussed, the reference was unsupported by any source. Although appellant cited to ATF Agent Crowley's grand jury testimony in his motion for reconsideration to argue that record evidence supported his version of events, this proffer was too little, too late. Indeed, as the court noted, Agent Crowley was not even \"a percipient witness to the events in question,\"<sup>[6]</sup> and therefore the court explicitly disclaimed the notion that its decision to deny the suppression motion without a hearing would have been different if it had known about the Crowley testimony.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The grand jury minutes contained the following exchange:\n</p>\n<p>Q: And he actually had to get up, he got up on the hood with a flashlight and shined it in?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Later, in response to a juror's question, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p>A: He was on the driver's side kind of like where the door and the windshield come together looking down that way. I believe.</p>\n<p>Q: Let me ask you, Special Agent Crowley, at some point, and if you need to refer to the Form 26 about this, did Mr. Coyne ย did Officer Coyne actually sit up on the, on the hood of the car and look in?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q: On the inside, so he could see inside the passenger compartment?</p>\n<p>A: Yes. He actually looked through the front windshield, I'm sorry, not the side door.</p>\n<p>Q: Okay.</p>\n<p>A: From the windshield right in.</p>\n<p>[2]  On the same day, the government filed a motion for leave to file a memorandum in excess of twenty pages. After the district court denied this motion on November 21, 2006, the government immediately filed its amended opposition on the same day.</p>\n<p>[3]  It is unclear whether the court did indeed have this material \"in its files\" before it received appellant's motion for reconsideration. Allen obtained the grand jury testimony as part of the government's production of documents in the case, but did not specifically identify that testimony as the source of his unsupported claim that Officer Coyne climbed on top of the Mercedes until he filed his Motion to Reconsider. At that point, he also submitted the grand jury testimony to the court as an exhibit to his motion.</p>\n<p>[4]  This element asks not whether the officer was lawfully in a position to see the contraband (the first element of the plain view analysis), but whether he could lawfully seize it without committing a trespass. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765614\"><a href=\"/opinion/765614/united-states-v-claude-s-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 221 n. 10 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p>[5]  The government argues that appellant has waived this issue by failing in his brief to separately enumerate the denial of the motion for reconsideration as one of the issues presented in this appeal or to independently challenge this decision in the argument section of his brief. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), (a)(9); <i>Ramos v. Roche Prods., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563224\"><a href=\"/opinion/563224/nixa-ramos-v-roche-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1991). Instead, appellant raises a general challenge to the district court's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing in light of the evidence before it-including the evidence he submitted in connection with his motion for reconsideration. We do not address the government's waiver argument because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p>[6]  Asked to describe his involvement in the case before the Grand Jury, Agent Crowley stated that he had \"reviewed all the reports relative to that arrest,\" \"spoken to the arresting officers,\" and done a background check on the firearm in question, but that he \"was not present that night.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
