Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for the\nUnited States.\n\n\n                           November 25, 2003\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge.           Anthony Bova, convicted in the\n\ndistrict court for lying in the course of court testimony in an\n\nearlier matter, now appeals.           He claims that his perjury grew out\n\nof a violation of his right to counsel; the government cross\n\nappeals on a sentencing issue.          We describe briefly the background\n\nevents    and   prior    proceedings,        reserving    further   detail    for\n\ndiscussion of the two quite different claims on appeal.\n\n            Well before the events that gave rise to this case, Bova\n\nwas convicted in February 1993 in federal court in Nevada for a\n\nconspiracy involving the possession of stolen credit cards, served\n\na term in prison, and was on supervised release in Massachusetts in\n\nearly 1995.     On September 1, 1995, he was arrested for an asserted\n\nsupervised release violation (an alleged stabbing).                     While in\n\ncustody   on    that    charge,   he   was    accused    of   beating   a   fellow\n\nprisoner, Paul Hurley, on November 6, 1995.\n\n            A district judge found the initial stabbing charge not\n\nproven and Bova was set free on February 9, 1996, still on\n\nsupervised release.       Three days later, on February 12, 1996, Bova\n\nallegedly used a knife to assault one Walter Tauro in Somerville,\n\nMassachusetts.     Bova was then re-arrested for violating supervised\n\nrelease conditions and brought before a magistrate judge on March\n\n15, 1996, for a hearing on bail.                  Bova initially sought to\n\nrepresent himself but was persuaded to accept appointed counsel and\n\nthe hearing was adjourned.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           The    following     Monday,       March   18,    1996,   the   hearing\n\nresumed. Although Bova faced charges that could end his supervised\n\nrelease, the sole question at the resumed hearing was whether Bova\n\nshould be released on bail or detained (as the government sought)\n\npending   resolution    of     the    new   charges.        Bova   now   sought   to\n\nrepresent himself with his new attorney acting as standby counsel;\n\nthe magistrate judge said that he would not approve this option and\n\nthat Bova must have counsel or simply represent himself.                    Saying\n\nthat he was better prepared than his counsel, Bova insisted upon\n\nrepresenting himself.\n\n           In the hearing, Bova cross-examined the government's\n\nwitness, Probation Officer John Perry, and then testified on his\n\nown behalf, denying that he had assaulted either Hurley or Tauro.\n\nThe magistrate judge ended by finding probable cause to believe\n\nthat Bova had committed both assaults and detained him as a danger\n\nto the community. Later, the district court found Bova responsible\n\nfor both assaults, as well as a third assault on a guard committed\n\non   February    15,   1996,    and    sentenced      him    for   violating      his\n\nsupervised release conditions.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      In July and August 1999, Bova was given concurrent six-month\nsentences in state court after pleading guilty to assaulting and\nthreatening to kill Tauro and entering an Alford plea to the charge\nof assault and battery on Hurley. See North Carolina v. Alford,\n400 U.S. 25 (1970).\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f              On March 15, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted Bova for\n\ntwo counts of perjury, 18 U.S.C. § 1623 (2000), and one of\n\nobstruction of justice, 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (2000), based on his\n\ntestimony at the March 18, 1996, bail hearing.            The perjury counts\n\nwere based on his denials under oath that he had assaulted Hurley\n\nand Tauro; the obstruction charge related to the threatened effect\n\nof these lies on the proceeding. After the district court declined\n\nto suppress the perjurious statements, United States v. Bova, 170\n\nF. Supp. 2d 96 (D. Mass. 2001),       Bova entered a conditional plea of\n\nguilty   to    all    counts,   reserving   the   right   to   appeal   on   the\n\nsuppression issue.         He was thereafter sentenced to 30 months\n\nimprisonment.        This appeal by Bova followed; the government cross\n\nappealed as to the sentence.\n\n              We begin with the suppression issue. Bova claims that he\n\nwas denied his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment by the\n\nmagistrate judge; that this caused his false statements in the bail\n\nhearing; and that the proper remedy is the suppression of those\n\nfalse statements, thus effectively barring the case against him.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Bova has a valid Sixth Amendment claim,\n\nbut it is even plainer that any supposed violation in the context\n\nof this case would not warrant suppression.\n\n              Although Bova declines to elaborate on his theory of a\n\nSixth Amendment violation, we think it well to lay to rest any\n\nsuggestion that Bova had a right to represent himself and to enjoy\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe benefit of standby appointed counsel. See McKaskle v. Wiggins,\n\n465 U.S. 168, 183 (1984).               True, courts often appoint standby\n\ncounsel for a defendant who insists on self-representation–-partly\n\nin the hope that proceedings will flow more smoothly--but no case\n\nsuggesting    that        the    defendant    has   a   constitutional       right    to\n\nrepresent himself and enjoy appointed counsel has been called to\n\nour attention.\n\n            One circuit has clearly stated that no right to standby\n\ncounsel exists.           McQueen v. Blackburn, 755 F.2d 1174, 1178 (5th\n\nCir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 852 (1985).                  Language from an\n\nearlier decision in this circuit points in the same direction. See\n\nUnited States v. Betancourt-Arretuche, 933 F.2d 89, 95 (1st Cir.\n\n1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 959 (1991).                    \"Although appellate\n\ncourts have suggested that appointment of standby counsel is to be\n\npreferred,    it     is    not    constitutionally       required.\"      3    Lafave,\n\nCriminal Procedure, § 11.5(f), at 589 (2d ed. 1999).\n\n            Bova's better argument, and seemingly the one he has in\n\nmind, is a fact-specific claim that Bova was forced to represent\n\nhimself because the magistrate judge supposedly confronted Bova\n\nwith   an    unfair       choice     between     self-representation         and     the\n\nassistance of a counsel who had not been given adequate time to\n\nprepare.     In lengthy dialogue we have omitted (because we do not\n\nplan to     decide    this       \"unfair     choice\"    question),   Bova     and    his\n\ninitially-appointed counsel said at the March 18, 1996, hearing\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fthat they had spoken together only for an hour before the court\n\nsession because counsel had not been able to meet with Bova over\n\nthe intervening weekend.\n\n          Why the magistrate judge did not volunteer that Bova and\n\nhis counsel could have more time to confer is a mystery; but\n\nneither Bova nor his new counsel asked for additional time and the\n\nmagistrate judge certainly did not foreclose a request.   This is\n\nwhy we are skeptical that there is any Sixth Amendment claim,\n\nalthough it is clear in retrospect (the vantage from which most\n\nthings are clear) that a postponement of the hearing to allow more\n\ntime would have been a good practical resolution.\n\n          Still, we will assume arguendo that the magistrate judge\n\ndid make some arguable mistake of constitutional dimension that\n\ncould be developed on a fuller record (say, by leading Bova to\n\nbelieve that he had to represent himself or be content with\n\ninadequately prepared counsel). Even so, on the present facts that\n\nwould not come close to licensing Bova to take the stand and\n\nfalsely deny under oath that he had committed two assaults.\n\n          The government says that even if there was a Sixth\n\nAmendment violation (which it denies), that violation may have\n\n\"caused\" Bova to represent himself but it did not \"cause\" him to\n\ntake the stand and tell clear-cut lies about his prior assaults.\n\nCausation rhetoric is of some use in focusing upon the different\n\nchoices with which Bova was faced (whether to represent himself\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fversus whether to lie).       But it does not entirely resolve the legal\n\ncontroversy in favor of the government, as it might if the supposed\n\nconstitutional violation followed the perjury rather than preceded\n\nit.\n\n            \"Causation\" is one of the terms used in the law that is\n\nnotorious   for    multiple   meanings.    Yes,   a   supposed      denial   of\n\nappointed counsel would not force Bova to lie; but it could\n\ncertainly be a \"but for\" cause of his perjury if we suppose–-not\n\nwithout some basis–-that a competent lawyer who represented Bova in\n\nthe hearing would almost certainly have persuaded Bova not to take\n\nthe stand and compound his problems by denying the assaults.                 In\n\nthis sense a wrongful denial of counsel to an interrogated suspect\n\nis said to have \"caused\" the confession that followed. Cf. Massiah\n\nv. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 207 (1964).\n\n            The issue here is not one of \"but for\" causation but (as\n\nwith proximate cause) a policy choice as to the legal consequences\n\nthat judges want to impose upon a fault or flaw.             The main policy\n\nin this case is that courts very much do not want people to tell\n\ndeliberate lies on the witness stand and, in general, take the view\n\nthat defects in the steps that may bring witnesses to the stand are\n\nnot   adequate     reason   for   tolerating   the    lies    and   foregoing\n\npunishment.       A number of Supreme Court decisions reflect this\n\ngeneral policy.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            Thus, in Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855 (1966),\n\nconvictions    for   filing   false   non-Communist   affidavits   were\n\nsustained, the Court holding that it did not matter whether the\n\nunderlying statute that required them violated the First Amendment.\n\nId. at 867; see also Bryson v. United States, 396 U.S. 64, 72\n\n(1969).     Similarly, in United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564,\n\n576, 584 (1976), and United States v. Wong, 431 U.S. 174, 176-78\n\n(1977), the respective failures to give a grand jury witness a\n\nMiranda warning (in one case) or a warning as to the privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination (in the other) were held not to excuse\n\nthe subsequent perjury of the witness.     Other cases are to the same\n\neffect.2\n\n             Admittedly, evidence secured by the police in violation\n\nof constitutional rights is often suppressed; the classic cases are\n\nMapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961) (Fourth Amendment), Miranda v.\n\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) (Fifth) and United States v. Massiah,\n\n377 U.S. 201 (1964) (Sixth).    But these cases do not immunize later\n\nperjury by the defendant even if prompted by unlawfully obtained\n\nevidence.     Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 226 (1971) (Miranda\n\n\n\n     2\n      E.g., United States v. Olmeda, 839 F.2d 1433, 1437 (11th Cir.\n1988) (Sixth Amendment violations in securing grand jury testimony\ncannot be used to suppress perjurious testimony in a later perjury\nprosecution); United States v. Winter, 348 F.2d 204, 208 (2d Cir.\n1965), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1011 (1983) (same).       Cf. United\nStates v. Masters, 484 F.2d 1251, 1253-54 (10th Cir. 1973) (lack of\ncounsel at an evidentiary hearing part of a habeas corpus\nproceeding does not excuse perjury.)\n\n                                  -8-\n\fviolation \"cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way\n\nof a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior\n\ninconsistent utterances\"); United States v. Finucan, 708 F.2d 838,\n\n845 (1st. Cir. 1983) (unlawful search and seizure cannot be used to\n\nsuppress the perjurious statement stemming from it).                 Bova's\n\nremedy, if he thought that his right to counsel was being denied,\n\nwas to avoid perjury from the denial of bail.\n\n           Bova relies upon United States v. Doss, 545 F.2d 548 (6th\n\nCir. 1976), where the prosecutor summoned a target before the grand\n\njury and did not tell him that he was already the subject of two\n\nindictments.   Later the defendant was indicted for perjury for a\n\nfalse response to a grand jury question relevant to the crimes for\n\nwhich he had already been secretly indicted.             Id. at 549.   The\n\nSixth Circuit viewed this as tantamount to questioning an indicted\n\ndefendant about his charged offenses outside the presence of his\n\ncounsel and, describing this as a Sixth Amendment violation, barred\n\nthe perjury prosecution.    Id. at 552.\n\n           The Sixth Circuit said in substance that the asserted\n\nSixth   Amendment   violation   rendered   the   grand    jury   proceeding\n\n\"void\", id. at 552, which is (at best) a conclusory epithet burying\n\na debatable policy judgment. Admittedly, Doss is not the only case\n\nin which misconduct by the prosecutor has prompted a court to bar\n\na prosecution for the ensuing perjury. See Brown v. United States,\n\n345 F.2d 549, 554-56 (9th Cir. 1957).      Yet other courts, including\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fthis one, have been reluctant to excuse grand jury or other perjury\n\non   the    ground     that    it     was    prompted   by     misconduct    of    the\n\nprosecutor.3    Here, of course, we are not concerned with any such\n\nmisconduct.\n\n             Perhaps     in    some     extreme     situation     a     prosecutor's\n\ninterference with the right to counsel might seem so egregious and\n\nfunctionally related to the perjury as to provide an arguable case\n\nfor such a sanction.          But rules designed to deprive the police or\n\nthe prosecutor of incentives to misbehave make little sense where\n\nwe are dealing with the putative error of a judicial officer who\n\nhas no such incentives.             See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897,\n\n916-17     (1984).   The      naked    perjury     in   this    case    provides   no\n\nencouragement to plough new ground.\n\n             We turn next to the government's cross appeal contesting\n\nthe district court's calculation of the sentence.                     The guidelines\n\nprovide that simple perjury has a base offense level of 12.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2J1.3(a) (2001).4                Although Bova had lied in the bail\n\n\n     3\n      E.g., United States v. Babb, 807 F.2d 272, 279 (1st Cir.\n1986); United States v. Weiss, 752 F.2d 777, 785-86 (2d Cir. 1985),\ncert. denied, 474 U.S. 944 (1985); United States v. Crocker, 568\nF.2d 1049, 1053-55 (3d Cir. 1977); United States v. Williams, 874\nF.2d 968, 973-75 (5th Cir. 1989).\n     4\n      The practice is to use the guidelines in effect at the time\nof sentencing, not those in effect when the crime was committed, as\nlong as there are no ex post facto concerns.      United States v.\nAymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 66 n.1 (1st Cir. 1991). Here, there are no\nsuch concerns because the two versions of the sentencing guidelines\nare identical for the provisions relevant in this appeal.        We\ntherefore refer to the 2001 guidelines, the guidelines in effect at\n\n                                            -10-\n\fhearing as to two different prior assaults, counts are grouped–-and\n\nonly the higher offense level considered–-where the counts involve\n\n\"the same victim\"   and the same acts or transactions linked by a\n\ncommon plan.   U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2.\n\n          Here, the district court treated the two lies as directed\n\nto a single \"victim\" (the United States) and part of a single\n\neffort by Bova to get bail and avoid revocation of his supervised\n\nrelease status; reduced the resulting combined offense level of 12\n\nby 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility; and refused the\n\ngovernment's request for an upward departure.       The resulting\n\noffense level of 10, coupled with Bova's criminal history, produced\n\na guideline range of 23 to 30 months and the district court imposed\n\nthe 30 month maximum, to be served concurrently with a 30 month\n\nsentence for obstruction of justice.\n\n          On this appeal, the government says that the district\n\ncourt should have followed the probation officer's calculation and\n\napplied the cross reference in the perjury guideline which provides\n\nas follows:\n\n     (c) Cross Reference\n     (1) If the offense involved perjury, subornation of\n     perjury, or witness bribery in respect to a criminal\n     offense, apply § 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in\n     respect to that criminal offense, if the resulting offense\n     level is greater than that determined above.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2J1.3(c).\n\n\n\nthe time Bova was sentenced.\n\n                               -11-\n\f            A rough translation of this language is that where the\n\ncross reference applies, the perjurer is sentenced as if he were an\n\naccessory after the fact to the substantive criminal offense or\n\noffenses about which he has lied.           See United States v. Suleiman,\n\n208 F.3d 32, 38-39 (2d Cir. 2000).            This makes sense where, for\n\nexample, the perjurer testifies at the trial of a confederate,\n\nfalsely     asserting   that   the   confederate     did   not   commit   the\n\nunderlying crime; but the cross reference's language is not limited\n\nto such a case.\n\n             Here, application of the cross reference would have had\n\ntwo dramatic effects on Bova's sentence.              First, Bova's lies\n\nrelated to two assaults, each fairly described as at least an\n\naggravated assault, and the guidelines treat such assaults as\n\nhaving a base offense level of 15, subject to further specific\n\noffense adjustments (e.g., for harm caused and weapons used) that\n\ncan boost the levels further.         U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2.      The probation\n\nofficer calculated that the adjusted level would be 20 for the\n\nTauro assault and 25 for the Hurley assault (which the government\n\ncorrects to 24).\n\n            Second, under the grouping rules for multiple counts,\n\nassaults cannot be treated as closely related counts.            U.S.S.G. §\n\n3D1.2(d).    This does not mean that the separate offense levels for\n\neach are added together but it does mean that they are combined so\n\nthat the combined offense level is often higher than the single\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fhighest count, U.S.S.G. § 3D1.4; in this case the probation officer\n\ncomputed a combined offense level of 26.      Since an accessory after\n\nthe fact is sentenced at 6 levels less than the perpetrator,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2X3.1, this would give Bova an offense level of 20 or,\n\nafter acceptance of responsibility, 18, U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.\n\n          This   approach   would   have   given   Bova   a   much   higher\n\nguideline range and the government asserts that this approach was\n\ndictated by the cross reference.       The government concedes that\n\ndirect precedent is scarce but says that the cross reference\n\nlanguage–-\"in respect to a criminal offense\"–-is broad and applies\n\nhere because here the perjury was about the assaults.           In truth,\n\nphrases like \"in respect to\" or \"in connection with\" are highly\n\nelastic and any sensible construction invites inquiry into what the\n\ndrafter was trying to accomplish. See United States v. Conley, 186\n\nF.3d 7, 25 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1017 (2000).\n\n          The cross reference is based on the potential of the\n\nperjury to derail or miscarry a judicial or similar proceeding\n\ndirected to another crime.    Suleiman, 208 F.3d at 39.         Where the\n\nother crime is substantially more serious than generic (offense\n\nlevel 12) perjury, the guideline drafters obviously thought that\n\nthe guideline sentence for that crime better reflected the gravity\n\nof the perjury itself, subject to a discount to reflect the fact\n\nthat the perjurer was an accessory after the fact rather than a\n\nperpetrator. This explains why the cross reference applies only to\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fraise the offense level above 12 and also explains the 6 level\n\nreduction from the cross-referenced crime's offense level.\n\n           This purpose is not a narrow one: it seemingly applies\n\nwherever the perjury is directed to the investigation or trial of\n\na criminal offense even where common-law accessory doctrine would\n\nnormally not apply.     Consider the case of perjury in a criminal\n\ntrial to inculpate an innocent third party rather than to exculpate\n\na confederate.   Still, as the Second Circuit stated, \"the purpose\n\nof the 'in respect to' enhancement is to treat more severely\n\nperjuries that risk an incomplete or an inaccurate investigation or\n\ntrial of a criminal offense.\"     Suleiman, 208 F.3d at 39.\n\n           In this case, the perjury occurred in a bail hearing in\n\nan   overall   proceeding   designed    to   determine   whether   Bova's\n\nsupervised release should be revoked.          The government has not\n\nargued that such a bail hearing is, or is part of, a proceeding to\n\nadjudicate a criminal offense; if it were, perjury at the hearing\n\nwould be \"in respect to a criminal offense\" and the cross reference\n\nwould arguably apply.   But whether or not such an argument could be\n\nmade, it was not made in the district court nor is it pressed in\n\nthis court.\n\n           Rather, the government says in substance that the cross\n\nreference applies simply because the perjury was about a criminal\n\noffense, namely, the assaults.    But it misses the point to make the\n\nsubject matter of the perjury, rather than its connection to the\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fprosecution of a criminal offense, the decisive consideration. A\n\nmaterial lie about any subject in a criminal trial could sensibly\n\ntrigger the cross reference; a lie in a civil or other non-criminal\n\nproceeding about a criminal act, at least if not a direct threat to\n\na criminal trial or investigation, deserves no more punishment than\n\na lie about a non-criminal act.\n\n            The government has a long and exceedingly complicated\n\ndiscussion of the legislative history of the perjury guideline, an\n\nassociated obstruction of justice guideline, and a specific offense\n\ncharacteristic in the perjury guideline providing for a fixed 3-\n\nlevel increase if the perjury \"resulted in substantial interference\n\nwith the administration of justice . . . .\" U.S.S.G. § 2J1.3(b)(2).\n\nThe discussion is almost beyond summary and it is enough to say\n\nthat this winding and intricate history takes us nowhere solid.\n\n           As it happens, the specific offense characteristic just\n\nmentioned–-essentially for obstructing justice–-comes much closer\n\nto a suitable adjustment for Bova's lies.            His lies had little\n\npotential to interfere with prosecution of the crimes lied about\n\nwhich is why their seriousness is not a suitable measure of Bova's\n\nperjury; but they did have a capacity to obstruct the bail hearing\n\nand   so   came   pretty   close   to   warranting   an   adjustment   for\n\nobstructing that proceeding.\n\n            Presumably such an enhancement was not sought because the\n\nobstruction adjustment is more narrowly framed than the counterpart\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fcriminal offense of obstruction of justice.              While the obstruction\n\nstatute     applies   to   one     who     \"endeavors\"     to    obstruct    court\n\nproceedings,    18    U.S.C.   §   1503(a)(2000),        the    specific    offense\n\nadjustment in the perjury guideline applies only to perjury that\n\n\"resulted\" in a \"substantial interference\" with the proceeding,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2J1.3(b)(2).        The government may have thought that lies\n\nso quickly brushed aside by the magistrate judge had no such\n\neffect.\n\n            The judgment and sentence of the district court are both\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f",

He claims that his perjury grew out of a violation of his right to counsel; the government cross appeals on a sentencing issue. We describe briefly the background events and prior proceedings, reserving further detail for discussion of the two quite different claims on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well before the events that gave rise to this case, Bova was convicted in February 1993 in federal court in Nevada for a conspiracy involving the possession of stolen credit cards, served a term in prison, and was on supervised release in Massachusetts in early 1995. On September 1, 1995, he was arrested for an asserted supervised release violation (an alleged stabbing). While in custody on that charge, he was accused of beating a fellow prisoner, Paul Hurley, on November 6, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district judge found the initial stabbing charge not proven and Bova was set free on February 9, 1996, still on supervised release. Three days later, on February 12, 1996, Bova allegedly used a knife to assault one Walter Tauro in Somerville, Massachusetts. Bova was then re-arrested for violating supervised release conditions and brought before a magistrate judge on March 15, 1996, for a hearing on bail. Bova initially sought to represent himself but was persuaded to accept appointed counsel and the hearing was adjourned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following Monday, March 18, 1996, the hearing resumed. Although Bova faced charges that could end his supervised release, the sole question at the resumed hearing was whether Bova should be released on bail or detained (as the government sought) pending resolution of the new charges. Bova now sought to represent himself with his new attorney acting as standby counsel; the magistrate judge said that he would not approve this option and that Bova must have counsel or simply represent himself. Saying that he was better prepared than his counsel, Bova insisted upon representing himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the hearing, Bova cross-examined the government's witness, Probation Officer John Perry, and then testified on his own behalf, denying that he had assaulted either Hurley or Tauro. The magistrate judge ended by finding probable cause to believe that Bova had committed both assaults and detained him as a danger to the community. Later, the district court found Bova responsible for both assaults, as well as a third assault on a guard committed on February 15, 1996, and sentenced him for violating his supervised release conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted Bova for two counts of perjury, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623 (2000), and one of obstruction of justice, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1503 (2000), based on his testimony at the March 18, 1996, bail hearing. The perjury counts were based on his denials under oath that he had assaulted Hurley and Tauro; the obstruction charge related to the threatened effect of these lies on the proceeding. After the district court declined to suppress the perjurious statements, <i>United States v. Bova,</i> 170 F.Supp.2d 96 (D.Mass. 2001), Bova entered a conditional plea of guilty to all counts, reserving the right to appeal on the suppression issue. He was thereafter sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. This appeal by Bova followed; the government cross appealed as to the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the suppression issue. Bova claims that he was denied his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment by the magistrate judge; that this caused his false statements in the bail hearing; and that the proper remedy is the suppression of those false statements, thus effectively barring the case against him. It is highly unlikely that Bova has a valid Sixth Amendment claim, but it is even plainer that any supposed violation in the context of this case would not warrant suppression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Bova declines to elaborate on his theory of a Sixth Amendment violation, we think it well to lay to rest any suggestion that Bova had a right to represent himself <i>and</i> to enjoy the benefit of standby appointed counsel. <i>See McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> 465 U.S. 168, 183, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984). True, courts often appoint standby counsel for a defendant who insists on self-representation &#8212; partly in the hope that proceedings will flow more smoothly &#8212; but no case suggesting that the defendant has a constitutional right to represent himself <i>and</i> enjoy appointed counsel has been called to our attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One circuit has clearly stated that no right to standby counsel exists. <i>McQueen v. Blackburn,</i> 755 F.2d 1174, 1178 (5th Cir.1985), <i>cert. denied,</i> 474 U.S. 852, 106 S.Ct. 152, 88 L.Ed.2d 125 (1985). Language from an earlier decision in this circuit points in the same direction. <i>See United States v. Betancourt-Arretuche,</i> 933 F.2d 89, 95 (1st Cir.1991), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 959, 112 S.Ct. 421, 116 L.Ed.2d 441 (1991). \"Although appellate courts have suggested that appointment of standby counsel is to be preferred, it is not constitutionally required.\" 3 Lafave, <i>Criminal Procedure,</i> &#167; 11.5(f), at 589 (2d ed.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bova's better argument, and seemingly the one he has in mind, is a fact-specific claim that Bova was forced to represent himself because the magistrate judge supposedly confronted Bova with an unfair choice between self-representation and the assistance of a counsel who had not been given adequate time to prepare. In lengthy dialogue we have omitted (because we do not plan to decide this \"unfair choice\" question), Bova and his initially-appointed counsel said at the March 18, 1996, hearing that they had spoken together only for an hour before the court session because counsel had not been able to meet with Bova over the intervening weekend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why the magistrate judge did not volunteer that Bova and his counsel could have more time to confer is a mystery; but neither Bova nor his new counsel asked for additional time and the magistrate judge certainly did not foreclose a request. This is why we are skeptical that there is any Sixth Amendment claim, although it is clear in retrospect (the vantage from which most things are clear) that a postponement of the hearing to allow more time would have been a good practical resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we will assume <i>arguendo</i> that the magistrate judge did make some arguable mistake of constitutional dimension that could be developed on a fuller record (say, by leading Bova to believe that he had to represent himself or be content with inadequately prepared counsel). Even so, on the present facts that would not come close to licensing Bova to take the stand and falsely deny under oath that he had committed two assaults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that even if there was a Sixth Amendment violation (which it denies), that violation may have \"caused\" Bova to represent himself but it did not \"cause\" him to take the stand and tell clear-cut lies about his prior assaults. Causation rhetoric is of some use in focusing upon the different choices with which Bova was faced (whether to represent himself versus whether to lie). But it does not entirely resolve the legal controversy in favor of the government, as it might if the supposed constitutional violation <i>followed</i> the perjury rather than preceded it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Causation\" is one of the terms used in the law that is notorious for multiple meanings. Yes, a supposed denial of appointed counsel would not force Bova to lie; but it could certainly be a \"but for\" cause of his perjury if we suppose &#8212; not without some basis &#8212; that a competent lawyer who represented Bova in the hearing would almost certainly have persuaded Bova not to take the stand and compound his problems by denying the assaults. In this sense a wrongful denial of counsel to an interrogated suspect is said to have \"caused\" the confession that followed. <i>Cf. Massiah v. United States,</i> 377 U.S. 201, 207, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here is not one of \"but for\" causation but (as with proximate cause) a policy choice as to the legal consequences that judges want to impose upon a fault or flaw. The main policy in this case is that courts very much do not want people to tell deliberate lies on the witness stand and, in general, take the view that defects in the steps that may bring witnesses to the stand are not adequate reason for tolerating the lies and foregoing punishment. A number of Supreme Court decisions reflect this general policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in <i>Dennis v. United States,</i> 384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966), convictions for filing false non-Communist affidavits were sustained, the Court holding that it did not matter whether the underlying statute that required them violated the First Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 867, 86 S.Ct. 1840; <i>see also Bryson v. United States,</i> 396 U.S. 64, 72, 90 S.Ct. 355, 24 L.Ed.2d 264 (1969). Similarly, in <i>United States v. Mandujano,</i> 425 U.S. 564, 576, 584, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976), and <i>United States v. Wong,</i> 431 U.S. 174, 176-78, 97 S.Ct. 1823, 52 L.Ed.2d 231 (1977), the respective failures to give a grand jury witness a <i>Miranda</i> warning (in one case) or a warning as to the privilege against self-incrimination (in the other) were held not to excuse the subsequent perjury of the witness. Other cases are to the same effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, evidence secured by the police in violation of constitutional rights is often suppressed; the classic cases are <i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) (Fourth Amendment), <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (Fifth) and <i>Massiah v. United States,</i> 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964) (Sixth). But these cases do not immunize later perjury by the defendant even if prompted by unlawfully obtained evidence. <i>Harris v. New York,</i> 401 U.S. 222, 226, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971) (<i>Miranda</i> violation \"cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances\"); <i>United States v. Finucan,</i> 708 F.2d 838, 845 (1st. Cir.1983) (unlawful search and seizure cannot be used to suppress the perjurious statement stemming from it). Bova's remedy, if he thought that his right to counsel was being denied, was to avoid perjury and appeal from the denial of bail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bova relies upon <i>United States v. Doss,</i> 545 F.2d 548 (6th Cir.1976), where the prosecutor summoned a target before the grand jury and did not tell him that he was already the subject of two indictments. Later the defendant was indicted for perjury for a false response to a grand jury question relevant to the crimes for which he had already been secretly indicted. <i>Id.</i> at 549. The Sixth Circuit viewed this as tantamount to questioning an indicted defendant about his charged offenses outside the presence of his counsel and, describing this as a Sixth Amendment violation, barred the perjury prosecution. <i>Id.</i> at 552.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Circuit said in substance that the asserted Sixth Amendment violation rendered the grand jury proceeding \"void\", <i>id.</i> at 552, which is (at best) a conclusory epithet burying a debatable policy judgment. Admittedly, <i>Doss</i> is not the only case in which misconduct by the prosecutor has prompted a court to bar a prosecution for the ensuing perjury. <i>See Brown v. United States,</i> 245 F.2d 549, 554-56 (8th Cir.1957). Yet other courts, including this one, have been reluctant to excuse grand jury or other perjury on the ground that it was prompted by misconduct of the prosecutor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Here, of course, we are not concerned with any such misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps in some extreme situation a prosecutor's interference with the right to counsel might seem so egregious and functionally related to the perjury as to provide an arguable case for such a sanction. But rules designed to deprive the police or the prosecutor of incentives to misbehave make little sense where we are dealing with the putative error of a judicial officer who has no such incentives. <i>See United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 916-17, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). The naked perjury in this case provides no encouragement to plough new ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the government's cross appeal contesting the district court's calculation of the sentence. The guidelines provide that simple perjury has a base offense level of 12. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.3(a) (2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Although Bova had lied in the bail hearing as to two different prior assaults, counts are grouped &#8212; and only the higher offense level considered &#8212; where the counts involve \"the same victim\" and the same acts or transactions linked by a common plan. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court treated the two lies as directed to a single \"victim\" (the United States) and part of a single effort by Bova to get bail and avoid revocation of his supervised release status; reduced the resulting combined offense level of 12 by 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility; and refused the government's request for an upward departure. The resulting offense level of 10, coupled with Bova's criminal history, produced a guideline range of 23 to 30 months and the district court imposed the 30 month maximum, to be served concurrently with a 30 month sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, the government says that the district court should have followed the probation officer's calculation and applied the cross reference in the perjury guideline which provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Cross Reference</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) If the offense involved perjury, subornation of perjury, or witness bribery in respect to a criminal offense, apply &#167; 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to that criminal offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.3(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rough translation of this language is that where the cross reference applies, the perjurer is sentenced as if he were an accessory after the fact to the substantive criminal offense or offenses about which he has lied. <i>See United States v. Suleiman,</i> 208 F.3d 32, 38-39 (2d Cir.2000). This makes sense where, for example, the perjurer testifies at the trial of a confederate, falsely asserting that the confederate did not commit the underlying crime; but the cross reference's language is not limited to such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, application of the cross reference would have had two dramatic effects on Bova's sentence. First, Bova's lies related to two assaults, each fairly described as at least an aggravated assault, and the guidelines treat such assaults as having a base offense level of 15, subject to further specific offense adjustments (<i>e.g.,</i> for harm caused and weapons used) that can boost the levels further. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2. The probation officer calculated that the adjusted level would be 20 for the Tauro assault and 25 for the Hurley assault (which the government corrects to 24).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, under the grouping rules for multiple counts, assaults cannot be treated as closely related counts. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(d). This does not mean that the separate offense levels for each are added together but it does mean that they are combined so that the combined offense level is often higher than the single highest count, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4; in this case the probation officer computed a combined offense level of 26. Since an accessory after the fact is sentenced at 6 levels less than the perpetrator, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X3.1, this would give Bova an offense level of 20 or, after acceptance of responsibility, 18, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach would have given Bova a much higher guideline range and the government asserts that this approach was dictated by the cross reference. The government concedes that direct precedent is scarce but says that the cross reference language &#8212; \"in respect to a criminal offense\" &#8212; is broad and applies here because here the perjury was <i>about</i> the assaults. In truth, phrases like \"in respect to\" or \"in connection with\" are highly elastic and any sensible construction invites inquiry into what the drafter was trying to accomplish. <i>See United States v. Conley,</i> 186 F.3d 7, 25 (1st Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> 529 U.S. 1017, 120 S.Ct. 1417, 146 L.Ed.2d 310 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross reference is based on the potential of the perjury to derail or miscarry a judicial or similar proceeding directed to another crime. <i>Suleiman,</i> 208 F.3d at 39. Where the other crime is substantially more serious than generic (offense level 12) perjury, the guideline drafters obviously thought that the guideline sentence for that crime better reflected the gravity of the perjury itself, subject to a discount to reflect the fact that the perjurer was an accessory after the fact rather than a perpetrator. This explains why the cross reference applies only to raise the offense level above 12 and also explains the 6 level reduction from the cross-referenced crime's offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This purpose is not a narrow one: it seemingly applies wherever the perjury is directed to the investigation or trial of a criminal offense even where common-law accessory doctrine would normally not apply. Consider the case of perjury in a criminal trial to <i>inculpate</i> an innocent third party rather than to exculpate a confederate. Still, as the Second Circuit stated, \"the purpose of the `in respect to' enhancement is to treat more severely perjuries that risk an incomplete or an inaccurate investigation or trial of a criminal offense.\" <i>Suleiman,</i> 208 F.3d at 39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the perjury occurred in a bail hearing in an overall proceeding designed to determine whether Bova's supervised release should be revoked. The government has not argued that such a bail hearing is, or is part of, a proceeding to adjudicate a criminal offense; if it were, perjury at the hearing would be \"in respect to a criminal offense\" and the cross reference would arguably apply. But whether or not such an argument could be made, it was not made in the district court nor is it pressed in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the government says in substance that the cross reference applies simply because the perjury was <i>about</i> a criminal offense, namely, the assaults. But it misses the point to make the subject matter of the perjury, rather than its connection to the prosecution of a criminal offense, the decisive consideration. A material lie about any subject in a criminal trial could sensibly trigger the cross reference; a lie in a civil or other non-criminal proceeding about a criminal act, at least if not a direct threat to a criminal trial or investigation, deserves no more punishment than a lie about a non-criminal act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has a long and exceedingly complicated discussion of the legislative history of the perjury guideline, an associated obstruction of justice guideline, and a specific offense characteristic in the <i>perjury</i> guideline providing for a fixed 3-level increase if the perjury \"resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice....\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.3(b)(2). The discussion is almost beyond summary and it is enough to say that this winding and intricate history takes us nowhere solid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, the specific offense characteristic just mentioned &#8212; essentially for obstructing justice &#8212; comes much closer to a suitable adjustment for Bova's lies. His lies had little potential to interfere with prosecution of the crimes lied about which is why their seriousness is not a suitable measure of Bova's perjury; but they did have a capacity to obstruct the bail hearing and so came pretty close to warranting an adjustment for obstructing that proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presumably such an enhancement was not sought because the obstruction adjustment is more narrowly framed than the counterpart criminal offense of obstruction of justice. While the obstruction statute applies to one who \"endeavors\" to obstruct court proceedings, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1503(a)(2000), the specific offense adjustment in the perjury guideline applies only to perjury that \"resulted\" in a \"substantial interference\" with the proceeding, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.3(b)(2). The government may have thought that lies so quickly brushed aside by the magistrate judge had no such effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment and sentence of the district court are both <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In July and August 1999, Bova was given concurrent six-month sentences in state court after pleading guilty to assaulting and threatening to kill Tauro and entering an<i>Alford</i> plea to the charge of assault and battery on Hurley. <i>See North Carolina v.

He claims that his perjury grew out of a violation of his right to counsel; the government cross appeals on a sentencing issue. We describe briefly the background events and prior proceedings, reserving further detail for discussion of the two quite different claims on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well before the events that gave rise to this case, Bova was convicted in February 1993 in federal court in Nevada for a conspiracy involving the possession of stolen credit cards, served a term in prison, and was on supervised release in Massachusetts in early 1995. On September 1, 1995, he was arrested for an asserted supervised release violation (an alleged stabbing). While in custody on that charge, he was accused of beating a fellow prisoner, Paul Hurley, on November 6, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district judge found the initial stabbing charge not proven and Bova was set free on February 9, 1996, still on supervised release. Three days later, on February 12, 1996, Bova allegedly used a knife to assault one Walter Tauro in Somerville, Massachusetts. Bova was then re-arrested for violating supervised release conditions and brought before a magistrate judge on March 15, 1996, for a hearing on bail. Bova initially sought to represent himself but was persuaded to accept appointed counsel and the hearing was adjourned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following Monday, March 18, 1996, the hearing resumed. Although Bova faced charges that could end his supervised release, the sole question at the resumed hearing was whether Bova should be released on bail or detained (as the government sought) pending resolution of the new charges. Bova now sought to represent himself with his new attorney acting as standby counsel; the magistrate judge said that he would not approve this option and that Bova must have counsel or simply represent himself. Saying that he was better prepared than his counsel, Bova insisted upon representing himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the hearing, Bova cross-examined the government's witness, Probation Officer John Perry, and then testified on his own behalf, denying that he had assaulted either Hurley or Tauro. The magistrate judge ended by finding probable cause to believe that Bova had committed both assaults and detained him as a danger to the community. Later, the district court found Bova responsible for both assaults, as well as a third assault on a guard committed on February 15, 1996, and sentenced him for violating his supervised release conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted Bova for two counts of perjury, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623 (2000), and one of obstruction of justice, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1503 (2000), based on his testimony at the March 18, 1996, bail hearing. The perjury counts were based on his denials under oath that he had assaulted Hurley and Tauro; the obstruction charge related to the threatened effect of these lies on the proceeding. After the district court declined to suppress the perjurious statements, <i>United States v. Bova,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2402488\"><a href=\"/opinion/2402488/united-states-v-bova/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (D.Mass. 2001), Bova entered a conditional plea of guilty to all counts, reserving the right to appeal on the suppression issue. He was thereafter sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. This appeal by Bova followed; the government cross appealed as to the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the suppression issue. Bova claims that he was denied his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment by the magistrate judge; that this caused his false statements in the bail hearing; and that the proper remedy is the suppression of those false statements, thus effectively barring the case against him. It is highly unlikely that Bova has a valid Sixth Amendment claim, but it is even plainer that any supposed violation in the context of this case would not warrant suppression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Bova declines to elaborate on his theory of a Sixth Amendment violation, we think it well to lay to rest any suggestion that Bova had a right to represent himself <i>and</i> to enjoy the benefit of standby appointed counsel. <i>See McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 183, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

True, courts often appoint standby counsel for a defendant who insists on self-representation &#8212; partly in the hope that proceedings will flow more smoothly &#8212; but no case suggesting that the defendant has a constitutional right to represent himself <i>and</i> enjoy appointed counsel has been called to our attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One circuit has clearly stated that no right to standby counsel exists. <i>McQueen v.

In lengthy dialogue we have omitted (because we do not plan to decide this \"unfair choice\" question), Bova and his initially-appointed counsel said at the March 18, 1996, hearing that they had spoken together only for an hour before the court session because counsel had not been able to meet with Bova over the intervening weekend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why the magistrate judge did not volunteer that Bova and his counsel could have more time to confer is a mystery; but neither Bova nor his new counsel asked for additional time and the magistrate judge certainly did not foreclose a request. This is why we are skeptical that there is any Sixth Amendment claim, although it is clear in retrospect (the vantage from which most things are clear) that a postponement of the hearing to allow more time would have been a good practical resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we will assume <i>arguendo</i> that the magistrate judge did make some arguable mistake of constitutional dimension that could be developed on a fuller record (say, by leading Bova to believe that he had to represent himself or be content with inadequately prepared counsel). Even so, on the present facts that would not come close to licensing Bova to take the stand and falsely deny under oath that he had committed two assaults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that even if there was a Sixth Amendment violation (which it denies), that violation may have \"caused\" Bova to represent himself but it did not \"cause\" him to take the stand and tell clear-cut lies about his prior assaults. Causation rhetoric is of some use in focusing upon the different choices with which Bova was faced (whether to represent himself versus whether to lie). But it does not entirely resolve the legal controversy in favor of the government, as it might if the supposed constitutional violation <i>followed</i> the perjury rather than preceded it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Causation\" is one of the terms used in the law that is notorious for multiple meanings. Yes, a supposed denial of appointed counsel would not force Bova to lie; but it could certainly be a \"but for\" cause of his perjury if we suppose &#8212; not without some basis &#8212; that a competent lawyer who represented Bova in the hearing would almost certainly have persuaded Bova not to take the stand and compound his problems by denying the assaults. In this sense a wrongful denial of counsel to an interrogated suspect is said to have \"caused\" the confession that followed. <i>Cf. Massiah v.

But rules designed to deprive the police or the prosecutor of incentives to misbehave make little sense where we are dealing with the putative error of a judicial officer who has no such incentives. <i>See United States v.

The guidelines provide that simple perjury has a base offense level of 12. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.3(a) (2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Although Bova had lied in the bail hearing as to two different prior assaults, counts are grouped &#8212; and only the higher offense level considered &#8212; where the counts involve \"the same victim\" and the same acts or transactions linked by a common plan. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court treated the two lies as directed to a single \"victim\" (the United States) and part of a single effort by Bova to get bail and avoid revocation of his supervised release status; reduced the resulting combined offense level of 12 by 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility; and refused the government's request for an upward departure. The resulting offense level of 10, coupled with Bova's criminal history, produced a guideline range of 23 to 30 months and the district court imposed the 30 month maximum, to be served concurrently with a 30 month sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, the government says that the district court should have followed the probation officer's calculation and applied the cross reference in the perjury guideline which provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Cross Reference</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) If the offense involved perjury, subornation of perjury, or witness bribery in respect to a criminal offense, apply &#167; 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to that criminal offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.3(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rough translation of this language is that where the cross reference applies, the perjurer is sentenced as if he were an accessory after the fact to the substantive criminal offense or offenses about which he has lied. <i>See United States v. Suleiman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768196\"><a href=\"/opinion/768196/united-states-of-america-appellant-cross-appellee-v-ibrahim-ahmad/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38-39 (2d Cir.2000). This makes sense where, for example, the perjurer testifies at the trial of a confederate, falsely asserting that the confederate did not commit the underlying crime; but the cross reference's language is not limited to such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, application of the cross reference would have had two dramatic effects on Bova's sentence. First, Bova's lies related to two assaults, each fairly described as at least an aggravated assault, and the guidelines treat such assaults as having a base offense level of 15, subject to further specific offense adjustments (<i>e.g.,</i> for harm caused and weapons used) that can boost the levels further. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2. The probation officer calculated that the adjusted level would be 20 for the Tauro assault and 25 for the Hurley assault (which the government corrects to 24).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, under the grouping rules for multiple counts, assaults cannot be treated as closely related counts. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(d). This does not mean that the separate offense levels for each are added together but it does mean that they are combined so that the combined offense level is often higher than the single highest count, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4; in this case the probation officer computed a combined offense level of 26. Since an accessory after the fact is sentenced at 6 levels less than the perpetrator, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X3.1, this would give Bova an offense level of 20 or, after acceptance of responsibility, 18, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach would have given Bova a much higher guideline range and the government asserts that this approach was dictated by the cross reference. The government concedes that direct precedent is scarce but says that the cross reference language &#8212; \"in respect to a criminal offense\" &#8212; is broad and applies here because here the perjury was <i>about</i> the assaults. In truth, phrases like \"in respect to\" or \"in connection with\" are highly elastic and any sensible construction invites inquiry into what the drafter was trying to accomplish. <i>See United States v. Conley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765470\"><a href=\"/opinion/765470/united-states-v-kenneth-m-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1417</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></span> (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross reference is based on the potential of the perjury to derail or miscarry a judicial or similar proceeding directed to another crime. <i>Suleiman,</i> 208 F.3d at 39. Where the other crime is substantially more serious than generic (offense level 12) perjury, the guideline drafters obviously thought that the guideline sentence for that crime better reflected the gravity of the perjury itself, subject to a discount to reflect the fact that the perjurer was an accessory after the fact rather than a perpetrator. This explains why the cross reference applies only to raise the offense level above 12 and also explains the 6 level reduction from the cross-referenced crime's offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This purpose is not a narrow one: it seemingly applies wherever the perjury is directed to the investigation or trial of a criminal offense even where common-law accessory doctrine would normally not apply. Consider the case of perjury in a criminal trial to <i>inculpate</i> an innocent third party rather than to exculpate a confederate. Still, as the Second Circuit stated, \"the purpose of the `in respect to' enhancement is to treat more severely perjuries that risk an incomplete or an inaccurate investigation or trial of a criminal offense.\" <i>Suleiman,</i> 208 F.3d at 39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the perjury occurred in a bail hearing in an overall proceeding designed to determine whether Bova's supervised release should be revoked. The government has not argued that such a bail hearing is, or is part of, a proceeding to adjudicate a criminal offense; if it were, perjury at the hearing would be \"in respect to a criminal offense\" and the cross reference would arguably apply. But whether or not such an argument could be made, it was not made in the district court nor is it pressed in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the government says in substance that the cross reference applies simply because the perjury was <i>about</i> a criminal offense, namely, the assaults. But it misses the point to make the subject matter of the perjury, rather than its connection to the prosecution of a criminal offense, the decisive consideration. A material lie about any subject in a criminal trial could sensibly trigger the cross reference; a lie in a civil or other non-criminal proceeding about a criminal act, at least if not a direct threat to a criminal trial or investigation, deserves no more punishment than a lie about a non-criminal act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has a long and exceedingly complicated discussion of the legislative history of the perjury guideline, an associated obstruction of justice guideline, and a specific offense characteristic in the <i>perjury</i> guideline providing for a fixed 3-level increase if the perjury \"resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice....\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.3(b)(2). The discussion is almost beyond summary and it is enough to say that this winding and intricate history takes us nowhere solid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, the specific offense characteristic just mentioned &#8212; essentially for obstructing justice &#8212; comes much closer to a suitable adjustment for Bova's lies. His lies had little potential to interfere with prosecution of the crimes lied about which is why their seriousness is not a suitable measure of Bova's perjury; but they did have a capacity to obstruct the bail hearing and so came pretty close to warranting an adjustment for obstructing that proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presumably such an enhancement was not sought because the obstruction adjustment is more narrowly framed than the counterpart criminal offense of obstruction of justice. While the obstruction statute applies to one who \"endeavors\" to obstruct court proceedings, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1503(a)(2000), the specific offense adjustment in the perjury guideline applies only to perjury that \"resulted\" in a \"substantial interference\" with the proceeding, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.3(b)(2). The government may have thought that lies so quickly brushed aside by the magistrate judge had no such effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment and sentence of the district court are both <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In July and August 1999, Bova was given concurrent six-month sentences in state court after pleading guilty to assaulting and threatening to kill Tauro and entering an<i>Alford</i> plea to the charge of assault and battery on Hurley. <i>See North Carolina v.
