Vannareth    Chreng\n\npetitions for review of an order by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals    (\"BIA\"     or   \"Board\")       dismissing     his   appeal    from   an\n\nimmigration judge's (\"IJ\") denial of his applications for asylum\n\nand withholding of removal, and ordering his removal to Cambodia.1\n\n                               I.        Background\n\n           A   Cambodian      national,         Chreng   applied   for     asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal and relief under the CAT, see supra note 1,\n\non January 15, 2002.       On November 19, 2004, he appeared before an\n\nIJ, and a removal hearing was held, during which he and the\n\ngovernment submitted evidence. On November 19, 2004, the IJ orally\n\nannounced a decision, later transcribed, ordering Chreng's removal\n\nto Cambodia.    Chreng appealed to the BIA.              On February 21, 2006,\n\nthe BIA issued a per curiam order adopting and affirming the\n\ndecision of the IJ and dismissing the appeal.                  The BIA rejected\n\nChreng's motion to remand.          This petition followed.\n\n                II.    The Hearing and the IJ's Decision\n\nA.   Evidence Presented\n\n           Chreng was the only witness to testify at his removal\n\nhearing.       Additionally,        he     submitted     documentary     evidence,\n\nincluding a copy of his I-589 form, certain internet background\n\n     1\n      Chreng's further claim for relief under the Convention\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\") was also denied; but as he does not address\nthat claim in this petition for review, it is waived. See Frazier\nv. Bailey, 957 F.2d 920, 932 (1st Cir. 1992) (arguments not fully\npresented in appellate brief are waived).\n\n                                          -2-\n\finformation, including a 2004 statement from Madeleine Albright,\n\nnewspaper clippings and public statements from the Sam Rainsy\n\npolitical party, to which he allegedly belonged.              The government's\n\nevidence    consisted   of   the    2003    Department   of    State   Cambodia\n\nconditions report indicating improved political conditions there.\n\n            Chreng told the IJ that he was a 49-year-old male who\n\ncame to the United States on January 24, 2001.           Married on November\n\n27, 1986, he left behind his wife and three children ages 19, 17,\n\nand 12.    He was born on January 3, 1957 and was thus about 18 years\n\nold at the time that Pol Pot took control of Cambodia.              His father\n\nand mother, uncle, and two older brothers were sent to \"high\n\nAngka,\" which he said meant they had been murdered.               In March of\n\n1979, Chreng joined the Molinaka political party, which opposed Hun\n\nSen, the Prime Minister of Cambodia and a key leader of the\n\nCambodian People's Party.          Because of his opposition to Hun Sen,\n\nChreng said, he was arrested by Vietnamese agents on December 26,\n\n1979 and sent to prison at Trapeang Thlong for a period of five\n\nyears.    In March 1988, he was arrested once again and sent to fight\n\nthe Khmer Rouge guerillas at the Thailand border.\n\n            Chreng said that his first job was for the United Nations\n\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (\"UNTAC\") from 1991-1993.                 He\n\nwas in charge of helping people register to vote. Chreng monitored\n\nvoters in order to determine whether they were true Cambodians. He\n\nopposed allowing Vietnamese immigrants to register to vote in the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fCambodian elections since he believed that letting the Vietnamese\n\nvote had ensured the victory of the Khmer Rouge.    Chreng testified\n\nthat an individual named Sok May threatened him at this time\n\nbecause he opposed petitioner's ideas as to who should vote.     Sok\n\nMay only threatened but never attacked petitioner.\n\n            Chreng further testified that on January 2, 1991, when he\n\nleft the polls to pick up his motorcycle, Sok May told him that he\n\nwould be killed if he continued to prevent people from voting.    On\n\ncross-examination, Chreng stated that Sok May had threatened him on\n\nNovember 30, 1991.\n\n            In 1991, Chreng became a member of the National United\n\nFront For a Neutral, Peaceful Cooperative and Independent Cambodia\n\n(hereinafter \"FUNCINPEC\") political party.    His involvement in the\n\nparty included assisting in the recruiting of members, creating\n\nflyers and banners, posting pictures and explaining the party's\n\nprinciples.    Chreng testified that the party advocated an end to\n\nviolence, assistance for Khmer women, finding justice, protecting\n\nthe country's territory, improving immigration laws, eradicating\n\ncorruption, and changing laws.\n\n            On May 23, 1993, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, President of\n\nthe FUNCINPEC, won the Cambodian elections.     Petitioner had spent\n\nthree months campaigning for FUNCINPEC, including Sundays and\n\nholidays.     He initially testified that in May 1993, Sok May had\n\ngrabbed him by the collar.    But when it was pointed out to Chreng\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthat he had testified previously that Sok May had threatened him in\n\nJanuary of 1991, Chreng revised his testimony to say that it was\n\ntwo unknown individuals who had grabbed his collar and punched him\n\nwhile he stood by his motorcycle.      On re-direct, Chreng testified\n\nthat this incident took place in May 1993, and that Sok May was not\n\ninvolved.    Chreng told the IJ that he did not know these two\n\nindividuals, who were wearing dark glasses. One grabbed him by the\n\ncollar and punched him in the face.     Thereafter, Chreng could not\n\nsee anything.    The other individual grabbed him by the shoulder,\n\nthreatened him, and told him to allow Vietnamese to register for\n\nthe election, otherwise he would be killed.         After that, they\n\ndisappeared. While Chreng could not identify them, he thought that\n\nonly members of the People's Party would slap him in the face.\n\n            After the 1993 elections, Chreng worked as a staff member\n\nfor the post office at the Ponchentong airport receiving packages\n\nand letters.    Ten of his colleagues at work belonged to Hun Sen's\n\nPeople's Party, whereas five belonged to the FUNCINPEC Party.\n\nChreng testified that he had problems with the members of the\n\nPeople's Party because they would take the customers' packages and\n\nletters.\n\n            On July 5 and 6, 1997, while Chreng was still working for\n\nthe post office, Hun Sen and his followers conducted a coup.     Hun\n\nSen had ceased to be willing to share power with Prince Ranariddh.\n\nDuring the coup, Chreng was separated from his family and went into\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fhiding until the shooting subsided.       He stayed in a water tunnel\n\nfor two days and then hid in a jungle when things calmed down.        His\n\nwife, with whom the children had been living, remained at their\n\naddress given in his I-589 form.     Chreng hid for five months, from\n\nJuly to December 1997, in the Kampong Speu Province of Cambodia.\n\nHe did not return to Phnom Penh until December 1997 because he\n\nfeared being killed by Hun Sen's party, which had tried to kill\n\nFUNCINPEC party members.\n\n           Upon returning to Phnom Penh, Chreng joined the Sam\n\nRainsy political party.       That party's goals were to eradicate\n\ncorruption, promote freedom and strive towards true democracy.\n\nAlthough never a candidate for political office himself, Chreng\n\ncampaigned for Rainsy and urged people to vote for him.          After the\n\n1997   election,   Chreng   personally   advised   Rainsy   on   political\n\nmatters, meeting with Rainsy every Monday at party headquarters\n\nfrom January 1998 to 2000.       On July 26, 1998, Cambodia held a\n\nsecond national election.     For three months prior to the election,\n\nChreng campaigned every day in Kampon Speu, lifting banners,\n\nposting pictures and promoting the party's vote among the people.\n\nHis campaign activities led to some problems.         On the morning of\n\nApril 6, 1998, Chreng found an anonymous letter at the front door\n\nof his house telling him to stop supporting Sam Rainsy's party or\n\nhe would be killed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            When Hun Sen won the second election, some people,\n\nincluding Chreng, protested, claiming that Hun Sen had won the\n\nelections by fraud. On September 8, 1998, around 10,000 dissidents\n\ngathered in front of the Wat Boton Temple.         The demonstrators,\n\nincluding petitioner, who held a microphone, walked in a line\n\ntoward the Independence Building.      Once at the building, Hun Sen's\n\nsoldiers blocked the demonstrators and impeded them from proceeding\n\nforward.    Chreng testified that three soldiers approached him and\n\none hit him on the left shoulder with a black stick so hard that he\n\nfell.   Another soldier snatched the microphone from him, while a\n\nthird hit and kicked him.   Chreng stated he did not suffer broken\n\nbones, but a wound on his leg became infected.     Chreng did not seek\n\nmedical attention for his injuries but rather applied traditional\n\nmedicine.   He claimed that he did not see a doctor because he would\n\nhave been killed since most of them belong to Hun Sen's party.\n\nChreng stated that after being kicked, he was also photographed.\n\nWhen the other demonstrators moved forward, petitioner used the\n\nopportunity to escape and went to a stadium where he rested until\n\nthe following day.\n\n            On September 9, 1998, the demonstrators moved from the\n\nIndependence Building towards the American Embassy where they\n\nappealed for a change in the electoral laws.         From there, they\n\nwalked towards the Cambodian Parliament, but, before they reached\n\nthe Parliament, they again encountered Hun Sen soldiers with water\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fvehicles blocking their way.          As they tried to move forward, the\n\nsoldiers shot water at them in an effort to disperse the crowd.\n\nChreng testified that some people died and that when he escaped and\n\nwent home, he saw that the situation was bad.           He was not injured\n\nduring the demonstrations. From September 9, 1998 to June 2000, he\n\nwas not employed because there was no work for Sam Rainsy party\n\npeople.    Instead, he survived on his wife's \"merchant\" income.\n\n            Chreng testified that in June 2000, members of the Sam\n\nRainsy party gathered in front of a tomb built in remembrance of\n\nthose who had died \"For the Cause of Justice.\"                   During the\n\nceremony, petitioner gave a speech on why those commemorated had\n\nperished and blamed the adherents of Hun Sen.           On his way home, he\n\nwas   surreptitiously    followed,      then   placed   under    arrest   and\n\nimprisoned for three days.       While Chreng was not harmed in any way\n\nwhen in detention, the police superintendent told him at the time\n\nto stop supporting Sam Rainsy's party.\n\n            On November 23, 2000, according to Chreng, Hun Sen was\n\nplanning a coup in front of the Department of Defense in order to\n\nget rid of the Sam Rainsy party.            On the following day, Chreng\n\nattended   a   party   meeting   at   the   Cambodian   Hotel.     Suddenly,\n\nChreng's son ran in to tell him that three police officers had come\n\nto their home to arrest him.          According to his son, the officers\n\nhad also threatened to kill his wife if she did not reveal his\n\nwhereabouts, so his wife had asked that petitioner not return to\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe house.     At the end of the day, he hid in the jungle.            He\n\ntestified that thereafter, his life changed.            He believed that\n\nspies were following him everywhere he went.            He testified that\n\npeople who had been arrested on November 23, 2000 all belonged to\n\nthe Sam Rainsy party and that ten of them had been killed, while\n\napproximately    50   innocent   people   had   been   imprisoned.   When\n\nconfronted with his own documentation, which stated that people\n\narrested were members of the Cambodian freedom fighters, Chreng\n\nresponded that Hun Sen fabricated that story in order to get rid of\n\nSam Rainsy party members.\n\n            Chreng came to the United States on January 24, 2001, on\n\na visitor's visa he had applied for at the American Embassy.\n\nAlthough Cambodian officials were said to be looking for him on\n\nNovember 24, 2000, he was able to get to the Embassy on November\n\n30, 2000.    He also obtained a passport on November 22, 2000 because\n\nhe was afraid he would be imprisoned.           Chreng explained that he\n\nremained in Cambodia for so long after November 24, 2000 because he\n\nwas waiting for things to calm down, in spite of the fact that he\n\nwas hiding.    He testified that if he should now return to Cambodia,\n\nhe would be killed.     In his application, he alleged that he could\n\nno longer live in Cambodia because he was afraid of Hun Sen's\n\nfollowers.    He also said he was afraid for his wife and children,\n\nnot knowing where they were.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f          During the hearing, petitioner submitted four public\n\nstatements made by the Sam Rainsy party denouncing certain acts of\n\nviolence taking place in Cambodia.           Statements dated June and\n\nOctober 2004, respectively, denounced a recent attempt by two\n\nunknown motorcyclists on the life of a member of the Sam Rainsy\n\nSteering Committee and chair of the council for the province of\n\nOddor Menchley, and a separate grenade-throwing incident by unknown\n\nindividuals, in which an active party member and two of his\n\nchildren were injured.      Chreng also submitted a July 2004 letter\n\nfrom Madeleine Albright and statements from Senate Majority Leader\n\nBill Frist condemning statements allegedly made by Hun Sen that\n\nwere meant to intimidate the opposition.          Chreng also submitted\n\nnewspaper articles relating to events taking place from 1997 to\n\n2001.\n\n          The government's evidence at the hearing consisted of the\n\nState Department's then most recent (2003) country conditions\n\nreport on Cambodia, to which the petitioner made no objection.\n\nAccording to the report, there had been in the period of the report\n\nno politically motivated disappearances; no reports of political\n\nprisoners;    greater   media   access     for   political    parties      and\n\ncandidates;   a   general   governmental    respect   for    the   right   to\n\nassociate; an ability for political parties to conduct their\n\nactivities freely without government interference; a decline in\n\npolitical violence surrounding the July 2003 National Assembly\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\felections; a smooth transfer of power to newly elected commune\n\ncouncilors; no government coercion or prohibition in respect to\n\nmembership in political organizations; and a need for all three\n\nmajor political parties to work together towards a new coalition,\n\nas no had party won the required majority to form a government.\n\nB.   IJ's Decision\n\n           On November 19, 2004, the IJ issued an oral decision\n\ndenying petitioner any relief.     While finding that petitioner's\n\ntestimony about his experiences in Cambodia was generally credible,\n\nthe IJ stated he needed to consider whether the facts, as related\n\nby respondent Chreng, satisfied the elements in the definition of\n\n\"refugee.\"   The first question was \"whether or not the events\n\ndescribed by the respondent amount to past persecution.\"   Although\n\nfinding that the petitioner had run into violent or potentially\n\nviolent situations in connection with his political activities, the\n\nIJ held that petitioner's involvement in the September 8 and 9,\n\n1998 demonstrations did not show persecution, as the violence was\n\nnot directed at him personally for the purpose of changing his\n\npolitical beliefs or punishing him. Rather, the police were acting\n\nto break up a demonstration and regain public order.\n\n           However, Chreng also described being arrested at his home\n\nfollowing a speech in support of his political party and being\n\ndetained for three days.    In addition, Chreng described a police\n\nsearch for him for the purpose of arresting him \"for what can only\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fbe described as a political motive based on the information the\n\ncourt has.\"   The IJ, therefore, said, \"the court is inclined to\n\ngive the respondent the benefit of the doubt on the issue of past\n\npersecution and will so find.\"           The IJ went on to state that\n\n\"having found past persecution, that creates only the presumption\n\nof a well-founded fear of future persecution and the burden has\n\nshifted to the Government to show a change of conditions that would\n\nrebut that presumption\" (emphasis supplied).\n\n           The IJ discussed and credited the 2003 Department of\n\nState country conditions report for Cambodia. According to the IJ,\n\n\"this Court notes that the situation in Cambodia has changed\n\nsignificantly, in a political sense, from the situation that\n\nexisted when the respondent was involved in politics four years\n\nago.\"    The IJ quoted from the report section on Human Rights\n\nPractices for the Year 2003 that \"the government did not coerce or\n\nforbid membership in political organizations.             Political parties\n\nnormally were able to conduct their activities freely without\n\ngovernment interference . . . .\"         The IJ also quoted from a later\n\nsection of the report describing the 2003 elections in which, for\n\nthe first time, local level elections were held for the purpose of\n\nelecting commune councilors for 1,621 communes in Cambodia. The IJ\n\nnoted that the Sam Rainsy party had won 1,346 seats across those\n\n1,621   communes,   and   that   while   the   People's   Party   was   again\n\nvictorious, they were required to share power with the other\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fparties in all but 148 of those communes.          According to the report,\n\nthe transfer of power to the newly elected councilors was smooth.\n\nThe IJ concluded:         \"On the basis of this report and for other\n\nreasons, the Court finds that the government has successfully\n\nrebutted    the   presumption    of    a     well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution.\"\n\n            While finding the government had successfully rebutted\n\nthe presumption, the IJ went on to note that when \"arrested and\n\nheld by the government for three days in June of 2000 he [Chreng]\n\nwas   not   beaten   or    tortured    and     admittedly   encountered   'no\n\nproblems.'\" The IJ continued: \"Although the government was looking\n\nfor him allegedly to arrest him in November of 2000, there is no\n\nway of telling whether he would have been mistreated in connection\n\nwith that arrest or whether the government had any legitimate basis\n\nfor that arrest.     The respondent did not stick around to find out\n\nso it is not just the report on country conditions that would\n\nsupport the conclusion that there is not an adequate basis to find\n\nobjectively a well-founded fear, but there is also the fact that\n\nrespondent, in personal persecution terms, was not treated in such\n\na way as to suggest he would be tortured or killed because of his\n\nconnection to the Sam Rangsi [sic] Party.\"\n\n            The IJ then stated, \"Having made these findings, the\n\nCourt makes the further finding that the respondent [Chreng] has\n\nnot met his burden with regard to his eligibility application for\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fasylum.      Accordingly,    that   application   for    asylum   is   hereby\n\ndenied.\"     The IJ went on to state that since Chreng had failed to\n\nmeet the more lenient standard for asylum, it follows that he fails\n\nto meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.\n\nRegarding CAT relief, the IJ held that there was no suggestion that\n\nthe government of Cambodia would be likely to torture petitioner\n\nshould he return to Cambodia.\n\n                   III.     Chreng's Appeal to the BIA\n\n             In his motion of appeal to the BIA, Chreng asserted he\n\nhad no objection to the immigration court's recitation of the facts\n\nbut believed that it was unfair for him to have to show both that\n\nhe experienced past persecution and also that present country\n\nconditions made it dangerous for him to return to Cambodia, in\n\nlight of his individual circumstances. He also alleged that he had\n\nlearned of the importance of present country conditions only after\n\nhis testimony, and that if the granting of immigration relief\n\nnecessitated such evidence, then he should be entitled to present\n\nthe same.    The petitioner asked the BIA to remand the case to the\n\nIJ for further testimony regarding country conditions.\n\n             The BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the decision of\n\nthe IJ. It also stated: \"The Immigration Judge correctly concluded\n\nthat   the   Department     of   Homeland   Security    (DHS)   successfully\n\nrebutted the presumption of future persecution by demonstrating\n\nthat country conditions had changed in Cambodia.\"           The BIA denied\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fChreng's   motion    to    remand    stating       that     the   relevance     of   the\n\npresent-day country conditions \"requirement\" (sic) was evident from\n\nagency regulations.        It noted that Chreng had not presented any\n\nprima facie evidence that country conditions in Cambodia were such\n\nthat he would have a well-founded fear of persecution if he\n\nreturned to his country of origin.\n\n                               IV.        Discussion\n\n           Chreng argues in his petition on appeal that the IJ and\n\nthe BIA erred in finding that the government had successfully\n\nrebutted   the   presumption         of    a     well-founded      fear    of   future\n\npersecution.        He    contends    that       the   IJ    misread      the   country\n\nconditions report and seeks reversal or remand of the decision.\n\n           We begin with the premise that the IJ and BIA did, in\n\nfact, find that Chreng had experienced past persecution, leading to\n\nthe rebuttable presumption that he had a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution were he to return to Cambodia. This leaves open\n\nthe question whether there was substantial evidence to support the\n\nIJ's and the Board's further findings that the government had\n\nrebutted this presumption.           We believe there was.2\n\n\n     2\n      While the IJ's language, quoted previously in this opinion,\nindicates a finding of past persecution, the IJ went on to say,\nsomewhat murkily, that \"in personal persecution terms,\" Chreng may\nnot have been treated so as to suggest he would be tortured or\nkilled because of his connection to the Sam Rainsy party.      The\ngovernment seizes upon this language as undermining the finding of\npast persecution, arguing that because Chreng did not appeal from\nthis language to the BIA, he failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies, leaving us without jurisdiction. But we think that the\n\n                                          -15-\n\f          Determinations     denying    asylum      are   reviewed       for\n\nsubstantial evidence.      The Board's decision will be upheld if\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\" INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992).     This standard is deferential:          the Board's\n\ndecision must be upheld unless \"the record evidence would compel a\n\nreasonable fact finder to make a contrary determination.\"          Guzman\n\nv. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.1999)).\n\n          A   petitioner's   well-founded    fear   presumption    can   be\n\nrebutted by a showing that conditions in the applicant's native\n\ncountry have so changed that he no longer has a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution.   8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B); see El\n\nMoraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 203 (1st Cir. 2003).           When the\n\nconditions in the country of origin have changed so dramatically as\n\nto undermine the well-foundedness of the fear, the presumption\n\ndisappears and the applicant is not entitled to asylum.           Civil v.\n\nINS, 140 F.3d 52, 66 (1st Cir. 1998).       However, changes of only a\n\nvery general nature in country conditions may not suffice. Quevedo\n\nv. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2003).             To rebut the\n\npresumption, the changes must be such as to \"have negated the\n\n\nIJ's and the BIA's basic assumptions -- that Chreng was subjected\nto past persecution so as to give rise to the presumption of future\npersecution -- are manifest. Additionally, as we agree with the IJ\nand the BIA that the presumption of future persecution was\nrebutted, we need not further consider this contention.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fparticular applicant's well-founded fear of persecution.\" Fergiste\n\nv. INS, 138 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1998).        Account must be taken of\n\nthe individual's particularized substantiated fear. See Yatskin v.\n\nINS, 255 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           In this case, the government's rebuttal took the form of\n\nthe circumstances presented in the 2003 country conditions report.\n\nWhile \"[t]he advice of the State Department is not binding,\"\n\nGailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 1998) (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted), State Department reports are\n\n\"generally probative of country conditions.\"           Palma-Mazariegos v.\n\nGonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2005).              Evidence in these\n\nreports   never   \"automatically    trump[s]\"    petitioner's    specific\n\nevidence, Waweru v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 199, 203 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in\n\noriginal), and is \"open to contradiction,\" Zarouite v. Gonzales,\n\n424 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 2005).           Further, as already noted,\n\n\"abstract evidence of generalized changes in country conditions,\n\nwithout more, cannot rebut a presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\"   Palma-Mazariegos, 428 F.3d at 35.         However,\n\nwhere a report demonstrates fundamental changes in the specific\n\ncircumstances that form the basis of a petitioner's presumptive\n\nfear of future persecution, it \"may be sufficient, in and of it\n\nitself,\" to rebut that presumption.       Id. at 36.    The latter appears\n\nto be the case here, as the IJ and the BIA effectively found.\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f            Chreng's claim of fear relied on how the People's Party\n\nwas treating members of the opposition.             The IJ found that the\n\ncountry conditions report negated Chreng's fears of future ill-\n\ntreatment.    Political parties, according to the report, were now\n\nable   to   conduct    their   activities   with    relative   freedom.   In\n\nparticular, the People's Party was now forced by the results of\n\nrecent elections to work in conjunction with the FUNCINPEC and the\n\nSam Rainsy parties, as each of the latter had shared to some degree\n\nin the victory.       The report stated that the CPP had won 73 seats in\n\nthe National Assembly, while the FUNCINPEC party won 26 seats and\n\nthe Sam Rainsy party 25 seats.              No party won the two-thirds\n\nmajority required to form a government.            The IJ also took note of\n\nthe report's finding that in 2002, following the first national\n\ncommune local-level elections, the CPP had won the most seats, but\n\nthe Sam Rainsy party had also won 1,346 seats in 1,621 communes.\n\nAs a consequence, the CPP party was required to share power with\n\nother parties in all but 148 of those communes.                Moreover, the\n\ngovernment was not forcing its citizens to join any particular\n\nparty, and power had been transferred smoothly.\n\n            The report also said there had been no politically\n\nmotivated disappearances and no reports of political prisoners.\n\nThere was greater media access for political parties and candidates\n\nand a general governmental respect for the right to associate.\n\nPolitical parties, moreover, were able to conduct their activities\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\ffreely without government interference.             There had been a decline\n\nin political violence during the July 2003 National Assembly\n\nelections; a smooth transfer of power to newly elected commune\n\ncouncilors; no government coercion or prohibition as to membership\n\nin   political    organizations;     and     a   need   for   all    three   major\n\npolitical parties to work together towards a new coalition, as no\n\nparty had won the required majority to form a government.               See also\n\nOuk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding no\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution for member of Sam Rainsy\n\nparty and citing the 2003 Cambodia country conditions report for\n\nthe fact that there were no reports of politically motivated\n\ndisappearances or of political prisoners); Ang v. Gonzales, 430\n\nF.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2005) (finding no well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution and noting that \"[t]he FUNCINPEC and the CPP are both\n\nintegral   parts     of   the    coalition       government   that    now    rules\n\nCambodia\").      We think the Department of State's country conditions\n\nreport provided substantial evidence to support the IJ's and BIA's\n\nfinding that the government had rebutted the presumption of future\n\npersecution.\n\n           Once the government rebutted the presumption, the burden\n\nshifted back to petitioner to show the existence of new sources of\n\npossible persecution.           In Re N-M-A, 22 I&N Dec. 312, 321 (BIA\n\n1998).   Chreng argued to the BIA he did not know until it was too\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\flate that he had to produce any such further evidence.3    But the\n\nneed to do so followed from the same statute and accompanying\n\nregulations under which he sought immigration relief.      Under 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(iii)(2005), once the government has rebutted\n\nthe presumption, an \"applicant may be granted asylum based on past\n\npersecution alone if 1) the applicant has demonstrated compelling\n\nreasons for being unwilling or unable to return to his country of\n\nnationality or last habitual residence; or 2) the applicant has\n\nestablished that there is a reasonable possibility that he may\n\nsuffer other serious harm on return to that country.\"   Hernandez-\n\nBarrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 23 (1st Cir. 2004).    Chreng was\n\nthus on notice that further evidence would be needed in the event\n\n\n     3\n      Chreng does not on appeal refer to the statements he\nsubmitted to the IJ from Madeleine Albright and Bill Frist\ncondemning comments and veiled threats made by Hun Sen in 2004\nagainst the Sam Rainsy Party. These can be said to cast a shadow\non the more optimistic assessment issued in 2003 by the Department\nof State but, by themselves, were not enough to establish that Hun\nSen and his people were actually re-engaging in systemic violence\nagainst the adherents of the Sam Rainsy Party.      Given the 2003\ncountry conditions report, we cannot say that a reasonable fact-\nfinder must find that Chreng had a well-founded fear of future\npersecution should he be returned home at this time.         That a\ncountry's politics remain volatile, leaving open the possibility of\ndeterioration and including some measure of sporadic violence, does\nnot necessarily establish an alien's well-founded fear of future\npersecution should he be returned to that country.        As noted\nearlier, Chreng did not take issue with the country conditions\nreport during the IJ's hearing. In his appeal to the BIA, Chreng\nacknowledged that he had not addressed the issue of future\npersecution:   \"It is patently unfair that the Respondent must\npresent his asylum case based upon past persecution without knowing\nthat he must also make the case that country conditions presently,\nbased upon his individual circumstances, make it dangerous for him\nto return to Cambodia\" (emphasis in original).\n\n                               -20-\n\fthe IJ determined, as he did, from the country conditions report\n\nthat the presumption had been rebutted.\n\n            Chreng argues that a \"full reading of the Country reports\n\non Human Rights Practices for Cambodia (2003) . . . shows beyond\n\nany doubt that Cambodia is still a very imperfect and troubled\n\nsociety, and that the Appellant is justifiably frightened to return\n\nthere.\" It is true that the country report describes ongoing human\n\nrights violations and systematic deficiencies in the political\n\nprocess, but it also outlined significant and specific improvements\n\nin the political atmosphere, as well as plausible reasons for\n\nbelieving that violence against members of the Sam Rainsy Party had\n\nlessened.    With sufficient evidence of changed country conditions\n\nin the political sphere and no error in the IJ's reliance on or\n\ninterpretation of the country conditions report, we believe the\n\nagency's denial of asylum must stand. Asylum is a matter committed\n\nin major degree to the immigration agencies, which are entitled\n\nwithin reasonably broad parameters to make their assessments,\n\nprovided always there is substantial evidentiary support.\n\n            This conclusion also disposes of Chreng's withholding of\n\nremoval claim.      As noted earlier, that claim places a \"more\n\nstringent burden of proof on an alien than does a counterpart claim\n\nfor asylum.\" Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    While eligibility for asylum requires a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution, withholding of removal requires that\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fthe alien show a clear probability of future persecution.      See\n\nAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 569 n.3.      It follows, then, that,\n\nbecause the petitioner's claim for asylum fails, so too does his\n\ncounterpart claim for withholding of removal.4\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Chreng also argues in his brief on appeal that in some cases\ninvolving past persecution, even if there is little likelihood of\nfuture persecution, asylum may be granted as a matter of discretion\nfor humanitarian reasons if the alien has suffered an atrocious\nform of persecution.     Even assuming arguendo such exceptional\ncircumstances might exist here, Chreng did not raise this argument\nbefore the IJ or the BIA, and thus it is waived.\n\n                               -22-\n\f",

Background\n\n           A   Cambodian      national,         Chreng   applied   for     asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal and relief under the CAT, see supra note 1,\n\non January 15, 2002.       On November 19, 2004, he appeared before an\n\nIJ, and a removal hearing was held, during which he and the\n\ngovernment submitted evidence. On November 19, 2004, the IJ orally\n\nannounced a decision, later transcribed, ordering Chreng's removal\n\nto Cambodia.    Chreng appealed to the BIA.              On February 21, 2006,\n\nthe BIA issued a per curiam order adopting and affirming the\n\ndecision of the IJ and dismissing the appeal.                  The BIA rejected\n\nChreng's motion to remand.          This petition followed.\n\n                II.    The Hearing and the IJ's Decision\n\nA.

The government's\n\nevidence    consisted   of   the    2003    Department   of    State   Cambodia\n\nconditions report indicating improved political conditions there.\n\n            Chreng told the IJ that he was a 49-year-old male who\n\ncame to the United States on January 24, 2001.           Married on November\n\n27, 1986, he left behind his wife and three children ages 19, 17,\n\nand 12.    He was born on January 3, 1957 and was thus about 18 years\n\nold at the time that Pol Pot took control of Cambodia.              His father\n\nand mother, uncle, and two older brothers were sent to \"high\n\nAngka,\" which he said meant they had been murdered.               In March of\n\n1979, Chreng joined the Molinaka political party, which opposed Hun\n\nSen, the Prime Minister of Cambodia and a key leader of the\n\nCambodian People's Party.          Because of his opposition to Hun Sen,\n\nChreng said, he was arrested by Vietnamese agents on December 26,\n\n1979 and sent to prison at Trapeang Thlong for a period of five\n\nyears.    In March 1988, he was arrested once again and sent to fight\n\nthe Khmer Rouge guerillas at the Thailand border.\n\n            Chreng said that his first job was for the United Nations\n\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (\"UNTAC\") from 1991-1993.                 He\n\nwas in charge of helping people register to vote. Chreng monitored\n\nvoters in order to determine whether they were true Cambodians. He\n\nopposed allowing Vietnamese immigrants to register to vote in the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fCambodian elections since he believed that letting the Vietnamese\n\nvote had ensured the victory of the Khmer Rouge.    Chreng testified\n\nthat an individual named Sok May threatened him at this time\n\nbecause he opposed petitioner's ideas as to who should vote.     Sok\n\nMay only threatened but never attacked petitioner.\n\n            Chreng further testified that on January 2, 1991, when he\n\nleft the polls to pick up his motorcycle, Sok May told him that he\n\nwould be killed if he continued to prevent people from voting.    On\n\ncross-examination, Chreng stated that Sok May had threatened him on\n\nNovember 30, 1991.\n\n            In 1991, Chreng became a member of the National United\n\nFront For a Neutral, Peaceful Cooperative and Independent Cambodia\n\n(hereinafter \"FUNCINPEC\") political party.    His involvement in the\n\nparty included assisting in the recruiting of members, creating\n\nflyers and banners, posting pictures and explaining the party's\n\nprinciples.    Chreng testified that the party advocated an end to\n\nviolence, assistance for Khmer women, finding justice, protecting\n\nthe country's territory, improving immigration laws, eradicating\n\ncorruption, and changing laws.\n\n            On May 23, 1993, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, President of\n\nthe FUNCINPEC, won the Cambodian elections.     Petitioner had spent\n\nthree months campaigning for FUNCINPEC, including Sundays and\n\nholidays.     He initially testified that in May 1993, Sok May had\n\ngrabbed him by the collar.    But when it was pointed out to Chreng\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthat he had testified previously that Sok May had threatened him in\n\nJanuary of 1991, Chreng revised his testimony to say that it was\n\ntwo unknown individuals who had grabbed his collar and punched him\n\nwhile he stood by his motorcycle.      On re-direct, Chreng testified\n\nthat this incident took place in May 1993, and that Sok May was not\n\ninvolved.    Chreng told the IJ that he did not know these two\n\nindividuals, who were wearing dark glasses. One grabbed him by the\n\ncollar and punched him in the face.     Thereafter, Chreng could not\n\nsee anything.    The other individual grabbed him by the shoulder,\n\nthreatened him, and told him to allow Vietnamese to register for\n\nthe election, otherwise he would be killed.         After that, they\n\ndisappeared. While Chreng could not identify them, he thought that\n\nonly members of the People's Party would slap him in the face.\n\n            After the 1993 elections, Chreng worked as a staff member\n\nfor the post office at the Ponchentong airport receiving packages\n\nand letters.    Ten of his colleagues at work belonged to Hun Sen's\n\nPeople's Party, whereas five belonged to the FUNCINPEC Party.\n\nChreng testified that he had problems with the members of the\n\nPeople's Party because they would take the customers' packages and\n\nletters.\n\n            On July 5 and 6, 1997, while Chreng was still working for\n\nthe post office, Hun Sen and his followers conducted a coup.     Hun\n\nSen had ceased to be willing to share power with Prince Ranariddh.\n\nDuring the coup, Chreng was separated from his family and went into\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fhiding until the shooting subsided.       He stayed in a water tunnel\n\nfor two days and then hid in a jungle when things calmed down.        His\n\nwife, with whom the children had been living, remained at their\n\naddress given in his I-589 form.     Chreng hid for five months, from\n\nJuly to December 1997, in the Kampong Speu Province of Cambodia.\n\nHe did not return to Phnom Penh until December 1997 because he\n\nfeared being killed by Hun Sen's party, which had tried to kill\n\nFUNCINPEC party members.\n\n           Upon returning to Phnom Penh, Chreng joined the Sam\n\nRainsy political party.       That party's goals were to eradicate\n\ncorruption, promote freedom and strive towards true democracy.\n\nAlthough never a candidate for political office himself, Chreng\n\ncampaigned for Rainsy and urged people to vote for him.          After the\n\n1997   election,   Chreng   personally   advised   Rainsy   on   political\n\nmatters, meeting with Rainsy every Monday at party headquarters\n\nfrom January 1998 to 2000.       On July 26, 1998, Cambodia held a\n\nsecond national election.     For three months prior to the election,\n\nChreng campaigned every day in Kampon Speu, lifting banners,\n\nposting pictures and promoting the party's vote among the people.\n\nHis campaign activities led to some problems.         On the morning of\n\nApril 6, 1998, Chreng found an anonymous letter at the front door\n\nof his house telling him to stop supporting Sam Rainsy's party or\n\nhe would be killed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            When Hun Sen won the second election, some people,\n\nincluding Chreng, protested, claiming that Hun Sen had won the\n\nelections by fraud. On September 8, 1998, around 10,000 dissidents\n\ngathered in front of the Wat Boton Temple.         The demonstrators,\n\nincluding petitioner, who held a microphone, walked in a line\n\ntoward the Independence Building.      Once at the building, Hun Sen's\n\nsoldiers blocked the demonstrators and impeded them from proceeding\n\nforward.    Chreng testified that three soldiers approached him and\n\none hit him on the left shoulder with a black stick so hard that he\n\nfell.   Another soldier snatched the microphone from him, while a\n\nthird hit and kicked him.   Chreng stated he did not suffer broken\n\nbones, but a wound on his leg became infected.     Chreng did not seek\n\nmedical attention for his injuries but rather applied traditional\n\nmedicine.   He claimed that he did not see a doctor because he would\n\nhave been killed since most of them belong to Hun Sen's party.\n\nChreng stated that after being kicked, he was also photographed.\n\nWhen the other demonstrators moved forward, petitioner used the\n\nopportunity to escape and went to a stadium where he rested until\n\nthe following day.\n\n            On September 9, 1998, the demonstrators moved from the\n\nIndependence Building towards the American Embassy where they\n\nappealed for a change in the electoral laws.         From there, they\n\nwalked towards the Cambodian Parliament, but, before they reached\n\nthe Parliament, they again encountered Hun Sen soldiers with water\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fvehicles blocking their way.          As they tried to move forward, the\n\nsoldiers shot water at them in an effort to disperse the crowd.\n\nChreng testified that some people died and that when he escaped and\n\nwent home, he saw that the situation was bad.           He was not injured\n\nduring the demonstrations. From September 9, 1998 to June 2000, he\n\nwas not employed because there was no work for Sam Rainsy party\n\npeople.    Instead, he survived on his wife's \"merchant\" income.\n\n            Chreng testified that in June 2000, members of the Sam\n\nRainsy party gathered in front of a tomb built in remembrance of\n\nthose who had died \"For the Cause of Justice.\"                   During the\n\nceremony, petitioner gave a speech on why those commemorated had\n\nperished and blamed the adherents of Hun Sen.           On his way home, he\n\nwas   surreptitiously    followed,      then   placed   under    arrest   and\n\nimprisoned for three days.       While Chreng was not harmed in any way\n\nwhen in detention, the police superintendent told him at the time\n\nto stop supporting Sam Rainsy's party.\n\n            On November 23, 2000, according to Chreng, Hun Sen was\n\nplanning a coup in front of the Department of Defense in order to\n\nget rid of the Sam Rainsy party.            On the following day, Chreng\n\nattended   a   party   meeting   at   the   Cambodian   Hotel.     Suddenly,\n\nChreng's son ran in to tell him that three police officers had come\n\nto their home to arrest him.          According to his son, the officers\n\nhad also threatened to kill his wife if she did not reveal his\n\nwhereabouts, so his wife had asked that petitioner not return to\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe house.     At the end of the day, he hid in the jungle.            He\n\ntestified that thereafter, his life changed.            He believed that\n\nspies were following him everywhere he went.            He testified that\n\npeople who had been arrested on November 23, 2000 all belonged to\n\nthe Sam Rainsy party and that ten of them had been killed, while\n\napproximately    50   innocent   people   had   been   imprisoned.   When\n\nconfronted with his own documentation, which stated that people\n\narrested were members of the Cambodian freedom fighters, Chreng\n\nresponded that Hun Sen fabricated that story in order to get rid of\n\nSam Rainsy party members.\n\n            Chreng came to the United States on January 24, 2001, on\n\na visitor's visa he had applied for at the American Embassy.\n\nAlthough Cambodian officials were said to be looking for him on\n\nNovember 24, 2000, he was able to get to the Embassy on November\n\n30, 2000.    He also obtained a passport on November 22, 2000 because\n\nhe was afraid he would be imprisoned.           Chreng explained that he\n\nremained in Cambodia for so long after November 24, 2000 because he\n\nwas waiting for things to calm down, in spite of the fact that he\n\nwas hiding.    He testified that if he should now return to Cambodia,\n\nhe would be killed.     In his application, he alleged that he could\n\nno longer live in Cambodia because he was afraid of Hun Sen's\n\nfollowers.    He also said he was afraid for his wife and children,\n\nnot knowing where they were.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f          During the hearing, petitioner submitted four public\n\nstatements made by the Sam Rainsy party denouncing certain acts of\n\nviolence taking place in Cambodia.           Statements dated June and\n\nOctober 2004, respectively, denounced a recent attempt by two\n\nunknown motorcyclists on the life of a member of the Sam Rainsy\n\nSteering Committee and chair of the council for the province of\n\nOddor Menchley, and a separate grenade-throwing incident by unknown\n\nindividuals, in which an active party member and two of his\n\nchildren were injured.      Chreng also submitted a July 2004 letter\n\nfrom Madeleine Albright and statements from Senate Majority Leader\n\nBill Frist condemning statements allegedly made by Hun Sen that\n\nwere meant to intimidate the opposition.          Chreng also submitted\n\nnewspaper articles relating to events taking place from 1997 to\n\n2001.\n\n          The government's evidence at the hearing consisted of the\n\nState Department's then most recent (2003) country conditions\n\nreport on Cambodia, to which the petitioner made no objection.\n\nAccording to the report, there had been in the period of the report\n\nno politically motivated disappearances; no reports of political\n\nprisoners;    greater   media   access     for   political    parties      and\n\ncandidates;   a   general   governmental    respect   for    the   right   to\n\nassociate; an ability for political parties to conduct their\n\nactivities freely without government interference; a decline in\n\npolitical violence surrounding the July 2003 National Assembly\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\felections; a smooth transfer of power to newly elected commune\n\ncouncilors; no government coercion or prohibition in respect to\n\nmembership in political organizations; and a need for all three\n\nmajor political parties to work together towards a new coalition,\n\nas no had party won the required majority to form a government.\n\nB.   IJ's Decision\n\n           On November 19, 2004, the IJ issued an oral decision\n\ndenying petitioner any relief.     While finding that petitioner's\n\ntestimony about his experiences in Cambodia was generally credible,\n\nthe IJ stated he needed to consider whether the facts, as related\n\nby respondent Chreng, satisfied the elements in the definition of\n\n\"refugee.\"   The first question was \"whether or not the events\n\ndescribed by the respondent amount to past persecution.\"   Although\n\nfinding that the petitioner had run into violent or potentially\n\nviolent situations in connection with his political activities, the\n\nIJ held that petitioner's involvement in the September 8 and 9,\n\n1998 demonstrations did not show persecution, as the violence was\n\nnot directed at him personally for the purpose of changing his\n\npolitical beliefs or punishing him. Rather, the police were acting\n\nto break up a demonstration and regain public order.\n\n           However, Chreng also described being arrested at his home\n\nfollowing a speech in support of his political party and being\n\ndetained for three days.    In addition, Chreng described a police\n\nsearch for him for the purpose of arresting him \"for what can only\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fbe described as a political motive based on the information the\n\ncourt has.\"   The IJ, therefore, said, \"the court is inclined to\n\ngive the respondent the benefit of the doubt on the issue of past\n\npersecution and will so find.\"           The IJ went on to state that\n\n\"having found past persecution, that creates only the presumption\n\nof a well-founded fear of future persecution and the burden has\n\nshifted to the Government to show a change of conditions that would\n\nrebut that presumption\" (emphasis supplied).\n\n           The IJ discussed and credited the 2003 Department of\n\nState country conditions report for Cambodia. According to the IJ,\n\n\"this Court notes that the situation in Cambodia has changed\n\nsignificantly, in a political sense, from the situation that\n\nexisted when the respondent was involved in politics four years\n\nago.\"    The IJ quoted from the report section on Human Rights\n\nPractices for the Year 2003 that \"the government did not coerce or\n\nforbid membership in political organizations.             Political parties\n\nnormally were able to conduct their activities freely without\n\ngovernment interference . . . .\"         The IJ also quoted from a later\n\nsection of the report describing the 2003 elections in which, for\n\nthe first time, local level elections were held for the purpose of\n\nelecting commune councilors for 1,621 communes in Cambodia. The IJ\n\nnoted that the Sam Rainsy party had won 1,346 seats across those\n\n1,621   communes,   and   that   while   the   People's   Party   was   again\n\nvictorious, they were required to share power with the other\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fparties in all but 148 of those communes.          According to the report,\n\nthe transfer of power to the newly elected councilors was smooth.\n\nThe IJ concluded:         \"On the basis of this report and for other\n\nreasons, the Court finds that the government has successfully\n\nrebutted    the   presumption    of    a     well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution.\"\n\n            While finding the government had successfully rebutted\n\nthe presumption, the IJ went on to note that when \"arrested and\n\nheld by the government for three days in June of 2000 he [Chreng]\n\nwas   not   beaten   or    tortured    and     admittedly   encountered   'no\n\nproblems.'\" The IJ continued: \"Although the government was looking\n\nfor him allegedly to arrest him in November of 2000, there is no\n\nway of telling whether he would have been mistreated in connection\n\nwith that arrest or whether the government had any legitimate basis\n\nfor that arrest.     The respondent did not stick around to find out\n\nso it is not just the report on country conditions that would\n\nsupport the conclusion that there is not an adequate basis to find\n\nobjectively a well-founded fear, but there is also the fact that\n\nrespondent, in personal persecution terms, was not treated in such\n\na way as to suggest he would be tortured or killed because of his\n\nconnection to the Sam Rangsi [sic] Party.\"\n\n            The IJ then stated, \"Having made these findings, the\n\nCourt makes the further finding that the respondent [Chreng] has\n\nnot met his burden with regard to his eligibility application for\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fasylum.      Accordingly,    that   application   for    asylum   is   hereby\n\ndenied.\"     The IJ went on to state that since Chreng had failed to\n\nmeet the more lenient standard for asylum, it follows that he fails\n\nto meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.\n\nRegarding CAT relief, the IJ held that there was no suggestion that\n\nthe government of Cambodia would be likely to torture petitioner\n\nshould he return to Cambodia.\n\n                   III.     Chreng's Appeal to the BIA\n\n             In his motion of appeal to the BIA, Chreng asserted he\n\nhad no objection to the immigration court's recitation of the facts\n\nbut believed that it was unfair for him to have to show both that\n\nhe experienced past persecution and also that present country\n\nconditions made it dangerous for him to return to Cambodia, in\n\nlight of his individual circumstances. He also alleged that he had\n\nlearned of the importance of present country conditions only after\n\nhis testimony, and that if the granting of immigration relief\n\nnecessitated such evidence, then he should be entitled to present\n\nthe same.    The petitioner asked the BIA to remand the case to the\n\nIJ for further testimony regarding country conditions.\n\n             The BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the decision of\n\nthe IJ. It also stated: \"The Immigration Judge correctly concluded\n\nthat   the   Department     of   Homeland   Security    (DHS)   successfully\n\nrebutted the presumption of future persecution by demonstrating\n\nthat country conditions had changed in Cambodia.\"           The BIA denied\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fChreng's   motion    to    remand    stating       that     the   relevance     of   the\n\npresent-day country conditions \"requirement\" (sic) was evident from\n\nagency regulations.        It noted that Chreng had not presented any\n\nprima facie evidence that country conditions in Cambodia were such\n\nthat he would have a well-founded fear of persecution if he\n\nreturned to his country of origin.\n\n                               IV.        Discussion\n\n           Chreng argues in his petition on appeal that the IJ and\n\nthe BIA erred in finding that the government had successfully\n\nrebutted   the   presumption         of    a     well-founded      fear    of   future\n\npersecution.        He    contends    that       the   IJ    misread      the   country\n\nconditions report and seeks reversal or remand of the decision.\n\n           We begin with the premise that the IJ and BIA did, in\n\nfact, find that Chreng had experienced past persecution, leading to\n\nthe rebuttable presumption that he had a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution were he to return to Cambodia. This leaves open\n\nthe question whether there was substantial evidence to support the\n\nIJ's and the Board's further findings that the government had\n\nrebutted this presumption.           We believe there was.2\n\n\n     2\n      While the IJ's language, quoted previously in this opinion,\nindicates a finding of past persecution, the IJ went on to say,\nsomewhat murkily, that \"in personal persecution terms,\" Chreng may\nnot have been treated so as to suggest he would be tortured or\nkilled because of his connection to the Sam Rainsy party.      The\ngovernment seizes upon this language as undermining the finding of\npast persecution, arguing that because Chreng did not appeal from\nthis language to the BIA, he failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies, leaving us without jurisdiction. But we think that the\n\n                                          -15-\n\f          Determinations     denying    asylum      are   reviewed       for\n\nsubstantial evidence.      The Board's decision will be upheld if\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\" INS v.

Further, as already noted,\n\n\"abstract evidence of generalized changes in country conditions,\n\nwithout more, cannot rebut a presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\"   Palma-Mazariegos, 428 F.3d at 35.         However,\n\nwhere a report demonstrates fundamental changes in the specific\n\ncircumstances that form the basis of a petitioner's presumptive\n\nfear of future persecution, it \"may be sufficient, in and of it\n\nitself,\" to rebut that presumption.       Id. at 36.    The latter appears\n\nto be the case here, as the IJ and the BIA effectively found.\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f            Chreng's claim of fear relied on how the People's Party\n\nwas treating members of the opposition.             The IJ found that the\n\ncountry conditions report negated Chreng's fears of future ill-\n\ntreatment.    Political parties, according to the report, were now\n\nable   to   conduct    their   activities   with    relative   freedom.   In\n\nparticular, the People's Party was now forced by the results of\n\nrecent elections to work in conjunction with the FUNCINPEC and the\n\nSam Rainsy parties, as each of the latter had shared to some degree\n\nin the victory.       The report stated that the CPP had won 73 seats in\n\nthe National Assembly, while the FUNCINPEC party won 26 seats and\n\nthe Sam Rainsy party 25 seats.              No party won the two-thirds\n\nmajority required to form a government.            The IJ also took note of\n\nthe report's finding that in 2002, following the first national\n\ncommune local-level elections, the CPP had won the most seats, but\n\nthe Sam Rainsy party had also won 1,346 seats in 1,621 communes.\n\nAs a consequence, the CPP party was required to share power with\n\nother parties in all but 148 of those communes.                Moreover, the\n\ngovernment was not forcing its citizens to join any particular\n\nparty, and power had been transferred smoothly.\n\n            The report also said there had been no politically\n\nmotivated disappearances and no reports of political prisoners.\n\nThere was greater media access for political parties and candidates\n\nand a general governmental respect for the right to associate.\n\nPolitical parties, moreover, were able to conduct their activities\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\ffreely without government interference.             There had been a decline\n\nin political violence during the July 2003 National Assembly\n\nelections; a smooth transfer of power to newly elected commune\n\ncouncilors; no government coercion or prohibition as to membership\n\nin   political    organizations;     and     a   need   for   all    three   major\n\npolitical parties to work together towards a new coalition, as no\n\nparty had won the required majority to form a government.

We think the Department of State's country conditions\n\nreport provided substantial evidence to support the IJ's and BIA's\n\nfinding that the government had rebutted the presumption of future\n\npersecution.\n\n           Once the government rebutted the presumption, the burden\n\nshifted back to petitioner to show the existence of new sources of\n\npossible persecution.           In Re N-M-A, 22 I&N Dec. 312, 321 (BIA\n\n1998).   Chreng argued to the BIA he did not know until it was too\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\flate that he had to produce any such further evidence.3    But the\n\nneed to do so followed from the same statute and accompanying\n\nregulations under which he sought immigration relief.      Under 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(iii)(2005), once the government has rebutted\n\nthe presumption, an \"applicant may be granted asylum based on past\n\npersecution alone if 1) the applicant has demonstrated compelling\n\nreasons for being unwilling or unable to return to his country of\n\nnationality or last habitual residence; or 2) the applicant has\n\nestablished that there is a reasonable possibility that he may\n\nsuffer other serious harm on return to that country.\"   Hernandez-\n\nBarrera v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786695\"><a href=\"/opinion/786695/fidel-angel-hernandez-barrera-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 2004).    Chreng was\n\nthus on notice that further evidence would be needed in the event\n\n\n     3\n      Chreng does not on appeal refer to the statements he\nsubmitted to the IJ from Madeleine Albright and Bill Frist\ncondemning comments and veiled threats made by Hun Sen in 2004\nagainst the Sam Rainsy Party. These can be said to cast a shadow\non the more optimistic assessment issued in 2003 by the Department\nof State but, by themselves, were not enough to establish that Hun\nSen and his people were actually re-engaging in systemic violence\nagainst the adherents of the Sam Rainsy Party.      Given the 2003\ncountry conditions report, we cannot say that a reasonable fact-\nfinder must find that Chreng had a well-founded fear of future\npersecution should he be returned home at this time.         That a\ncountry's politics remain volatile, leaving open the possibility of\ndeterioration and including some measure of sporadic violence, does\nnot necessarily establish an alien's well-founded fear of future\npersecution should he be returned to that country.        As noted\nearlier, Chreng did not take issue with the country conditions\nreport during the IJ's hearing. In his appeal to the BIA, Chreng\nacknowledged that he had not addressed the issue of future\npersecution:   \"It is patently unfair that the Respondent must\npresent his asylum case based upon past persecution without knowing\nthat he must also make the case that country conditions presently,\nbased upon his individual circumstances, make it dangerous for him\nto return to Cambodia\" (emphasis in original).\n\n                               -20-\n\fthe IJ determined, as he did, from the country conditions report\n\nthat the presumption had been rebutted.\n\n            Chreng argues that a \"full reading of the Country reports\n\non Human Rights Practices for Cambodia (2003) . . . shows beyond\n\nany doubt that Cambodia is still a very imperfect and troubled\n\nsociety, and that the Appellant is justifiably frightened to return\n\nthere.\" It is true that the country report describes ongoing human\n\nrights violations and systematic deficiencies in the political\n\nprocess, but it also outlined significant and specific improvements\n\nin the political atmosphere, as well as plausible reasons for\n\nbelieving that violence against members of the Sam Rainsy Party had\n\nlessened.    With sufficient evidence of changed country conditions\n\nin the political sphere and no error in the IJ's reliance on or\n\ninterpretation of the country conditions report, we believe the\n\nagency's denial of asylum must stand. Asylum is a matter committed\n\nin major degree to the immigration agencies, which are entitled\n\nwithin reasonably broad parameters to make their assessments,\n\nprovided always there is substantial evidentiary support.\n\n            This conclusion also disposes of Chreng's withholding of\n\nremoval claim.      As noted earlier, that claim places a \"more\n\nstringent burden of proof on an alien than does a counterpart claim\n\nfor asylum.\" Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    While eligibility for asylum requires a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution, withholding of removal requires that\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fthe alien show a clear probability of future persecution.      See\n\nAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 569 n.3.      It follows, then, that,\n\nbecause the petitioner's claim for asylum fails, so too does his\n\ncounterpart claim for withholding of removal.4\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Chreng also argues in his brief on appeal that in some cases\ninvolving past persecution, even if there is little likelihood of\nfuture persecution, asylum may be granted as a matter of discretion\nfor humanitarian reasons if the alien has suffered an atrocious\nform of persecution.     Even assuming arguendo such exceptional\ncircumstances might exist here, Chreng did not raise this argument\nbefore the IJ or the BIA, and thus it is waived.\n\n                               -22-\n\f</pre>",
