STEWART,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                               v.\n\n                       MICHAEL J. ASTRUE,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Lipez, Selya, and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Gregory G. Katsas, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Michael\nJ. Sullivan, United States Attorney, Thomas M. Bondy and\nChristopher J. Walker, Attorneys, Appellate Staff on brief for\nappellant.\n     William M. Stewart on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n                         January 7, 2009\n\f          Per Curiam.   In this case, the Commissioner of Social\n\nSecurity appeals from the sua sponte order of the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts directing the\n\nCommissioner to reopen an application for disability benefits that\n\nclaimant William Stewart allegedly had filed in 1988.   See Stewart\n\nv. Astrue, 532 F. Supp. 2d 243 (D. Mass. 2008).   However, because\n\n(1) there is a legitimate question whether such an application, in\n\nfact, ever was filed and (2) this question goes to the subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction of the district court, we think that the remand\n\norder was premature. Familiarity with the facts and the procedural\n\nhistory is assumed.\n\n                          I.   Background\n\n          Claimant filed a complaint against the Commissioner,\n\nalleging, among other claims not relevant here,1 that he had filed\n\nan application for Social Security disability benefits in 1988 and\n\nthat the notice of the initial denial of this application had\n\nviolated due process.     Claimant therefore contended that the\n\nCommissioner’s decision not to reopen the application, made during\n\nproceedings on a later application, was in error.       Rather than\n\nanswer the complaint (or submit the record), the Commissioner filed\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because claimant failed to file a cross-appeal, his arguments\nregarding his second claim are not properly before this court. See\nSueiro Vazquez v. Torregrosa de la Rosa, 494 F.3d 227, 232 (1st\nCir. 2007).\n\n                                -2-\n\fa motion to dismiss based on res judicata (this being claimant’s\n\nsecond complaint).\n\n            The district court granted the motion, and claimant\n\nappealed.    However, before a decision on the appeal issued, the\n\nCommissioner moved for a remand to the district court on the ground\n\nthat res judicata did not apply to the prior judgment since the\n\ndismissal of claimant’s first complaint had been without prejudice.\n\nWe then granted the Commissioner’s motion, vacated the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal of the complaint, and remanded to that court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n            Upon remand, neither party took any action, and, about\n\nfive months after our judgment entered, the district court, without\n\nproviding prior notice to the parties, entered the order of remand\n\nthat is the subject of this appeal.    See Stewart v. Astrue, 532 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 243.   In so ruling, the court “assumed” that claimant had\n\nfiled an application for disability benefits in 1988 and that the\n\nCommissioner had denied such an application.      Id. at 246.   The\n\ncourt also “presumed” that the notice of the initial denial of the\n\n1988 application had been unconstitutional and that claimant had\n\ndetrimentally relied on this notice.    Id.\n\n            Within ten days of the entry of the remand order, the\n\nCommissioner filed a motion to alter or amend, under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 59(e), arguing that computer records of claimant’s history of\n\ndisability applications showed that he had not, in fact, filed such\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fan application in 1988.        The Commissioner therefore requested that\n\nthe court vacate the remand order and order the parties to submit\n\nevidence and arguments on the following questions:                     (1) whether\n\nclaimant had filed a 1988 disability benefits application; and (2)\n\nif so, whether the initial denial notice actually had contained\n\nunconstitutional language.             The district court rejected the Rule\n\n59(e) motion on the ground that since the Commissioner had “utterly\n\nfailed    to    answer    or   otherwise       defend,”    he    was   barred    from\n\ncontesting these facts.          This appeal ensued.\n\n                                 II.    Discussion\n\n               Although the district court did not indicate the basis\n\nfor its order, we assume, based on the language quoted above, that\n\nthe court effectively was entering a judgment of default.                       As we\n\nhave noted, federal law favors the disposition of cases on the\n\nmerits, and, as a result, “a default judgment is a drastic sanction\n\nthat should be employed only in an extreme situation.” Affanato v.\n\nMerrill   Bros.     547   F.2d    138,    140    (1st     Cir.   1977)   (internal\n\npunctuation and citations omitted).               The disfavor in which such\n\njudgments are held is especially strong in situations where, as in\n\nthe instant case, the defendant is the government.                     See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 55(d) (explaining that “[a] default judgment may be entered\n\nagainst the United States, its officers, or its agencies only if\n\nthe claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence\n\nthat satisfies the court”); see also 10A Charles Alan Wright,\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fArthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure §\n\n2702, at 178-80 (1998) (stating that “when the government's default\n\nis due to a failure to plead or otherwise defend, the court\n\ntypically either will refuse to enter a default or, if a default is\n\nentered, it will be set aside”) (footnote omitted).\n\n           Leaving aside the question whether the district court’s\n\nentry of a default judgment was justified in the first place, we\n\nthink it is clear that, once the Commissioner filed his Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion, the court should have vacated the order of remand and\n\nconducted further proceedings.       That is, the Commissioner’s motion\n\nand supporting documentation raised a genuine dispute regarding a\n\nmaterial fact -- i.e., the existence of a 1988 application for\n\ndisability benefits -- and this fact goes not only to the merits of\n\nclaimant’s right to relief, but also to the more fundamental\n\nquestion of the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the existence of a possibly meritorious defense, along with\n\nthe   Commissioner’s   status   as   a     government   defendant   and   his\n\ndemonstrated willingness to engage in further proceedings, we\n\nconclude that the policy of deciding cases on their merits should\n\nhave prevailed.   See Affanato, 547 F.2d at 140.\n\n           We therefore vacate the district court’s order and remand\n\nthis matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.   No costs.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
