Garcia, United States Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-\nPabón, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 3, 2004\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.          On June 28, 2000, defendant-\n\nappellant Luis Colón Osorio was arrested after Puerto Rico police\n\nofficers investigating a drug purchase by a passenger in Colón's\n\nvehicle discovered that Colón was armed and carrying, inter alia,\n\nan explosive device.        In due course, a jury convicted Colón of\n\nbeing   a   felon   in   possession   of    a   firearm,   see   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n922(g)(1), with an obliterated serial number, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(k), and carrying an explosive during his felonious possession\n\noffenses, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h)(2), (j), and 232(5).                     The\n\nconvictions resulted in concurrent 24-month sentences on the two\n\npossession counts and a consecutive 120-month sentence on the\n\ncarrying charge.\n\n            Colón presents six arguments in favor of reversal or,\n\nalternatively, vacatur of his convictions.            Colón first contends\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion, see United States v.\n\nDeJesus, 211 F.3d 153, 155-56 (1st Cir. 2000), in denying as\n\n\"untimely\" his motion for funds (Colón is indigent) to secure an\n\nexpert's assistance in investigating whether he was carrying an\n\n\"explosive.\"    The relevant facts are as follows.\n\n            A federal grand jury indicted Colón on the charges of\n\nwhich he was convicted on August 23, 2001.          Between the date of the\n\nindictment and April 1, 2002, the only issues actively litigated\n\nwere Colón's competency and entitlement to bail, although the\n\ngovernment did file the curriculum vitae of explosives expert\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fRichard J. Campbell on October 24, 2001.         Ultimately, Colón was\n\nordered detained and found, by order dated April 1, competent to\n\nstand trial.   On April 3, Colón moved to continue the trial, which\n\nwas then scheduled to begin on April 11.              The district court\n\ngranted the motion, setting a new trial date of May 16.\n\n           On April 24, Colón filed his motion for funds to hire an\n\nexpert.    Two days later, before the government responded, the\n\ndistrict court denied it as \"untimely\" by margin order. The record\n\nreveals no pretrial order or rule specifically requiring that the\n\nmotion be filed prior to April 24.       When the matter was raised at\n\ntrial, the court clarified that it had denied the motion because it\n\n\"would    obviously   [have   been]   followed   by   a   request   for   a\n\ncontinuance\" to obtain an expert report.          The court might have\n\nadded, but did not, that the government's intention of relying on\n\nan expert to prove that the device was an explosive should have\n\nbeen known no later than October 24, 2001, when the government made\n\nits submission regarding its explosives expert.\n\n            While Colón's motion was filed later than it might have\n\nbeen, we are troubled that it was denied solely on the ground that\n\na contrary ruling would necessitate a second continuance of the\n\ntrial.    After all, a 10-year mandatory prison sentence was at\n\nstake, see 18 U.S.C. § 844(h)(2); Colón was in prison awaiting\n\ntrial and thus posed no threat to the public; the motion was filed\n\nmore than three weeks prior to the day trial was scheduled to\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fbegin; and the record contains no evidence from which to infer that\n\nthe government would have been prejudiced by any continuance that\n\nwould    have   followed   the   granting   of   the   motion.    Under   the\n\ncircumstances, the rationale provided for the denial of the motion\n\nstrikes us as being close to, if not beyond, the limits of the\n\ncourt's discretion.\n\n            Nonetheless, despite our misgivings about the slender\n\nrationale for denying the motion, we will not vacate the judgment\n\nof conviction on the carrying charge because our independent review\n\nof the record convinces us that any error was harmless.            See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 52(a) (\"Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance\n\nthat does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\");\n\nUnited States v. Meserve, 271 F.3d 314, 327 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting\n\nappellate court's power to affirm challenged judgments on any\n\nground apparent in the record).         Colón's defense theory was that\n\nlaw enforcement agents planted the firearm and the explosive device\n\nthat led to the charges against him because they were out to get\n\nhim for ulterior motives.        He did not make any effort to contradict\n\nthe     evidence   about   the   contents   of   the    device.    And    the\n\nuncontradicted evidence about those contents compels the conclusion\n\nthat the device constituted an \"explosive\" within the meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 844(h)(2).\n\n            The device consisted of two cylinders containing 5.95 and\n\n5.7 grams of a gray powder.          The cylinders were bound together,\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fencrusted with 3/4-inch metal nails, and fitted with an ignitable\n\nfuse.   Laboratory tests showed the gray powder to be a mixture of\n\npotassium perchlorate (an oxidizing agent) and aluminum (a fuel).\n\nThis mixture is commonly known as \"flash powder.\"       Flash powder is\n\nan \"explosive\" subject to commercial regulation by the Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.          See 27 C.F.R. § 555.11 (2003)\n\n(defining \"flash powder\" as \"[a]n explosive material intended to\n\nproduce an audible report and a flash of light when ignited which\n\nincludes but is not limited to oxidizers such as potassium chlorate\n\nor potassium perchlorate, and fuels such as sulfur or aluminum\n\npowder\").\n\n            The trial evidence thus established that the device Colón\n\nwas carrying contained both an \"explosive\" powder and the means for\n\nigniting it. Colón did not seek expert assistance (from a chemist,\n\nfor   example)   to   attack   these   foundational   facts;   he   sought\n\nassistance so that his attorney might better understand whether and\n\nhow the device might operate.      But the government was not required\n\nto prove the device's operational capacity to a certainty; some\n\npossibility of explosion is sufficient under the statute.           See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 844(j) (\"For the purposes of subsection[] . . . (h), . .\n\n. 'explosive' means . . . any chemical compounds, mechanical\n\nmixture, or device that contains any oxidizing and combustible\n\nunits, or other ingredients, in such proportions, quantities, or\n\npacking that ignition by fire, by friction, by concussion, by\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fpercussion, or by detonation of the compound, mixture, or device or\n\nany part thereof may cause an explosion.\") (emphasis supplied). We\n\ntherefore see no likelihood that Colón was harmed by the denial of\n\nhis motion.\n\n           Colón next argues that there was insufficient evidence\n\nfor the jury to have made the elemental determination that he was\n\na convicted felon on the day he was arrested with the firearm and\n\nexplosive device.     Colón derives this argument from the fact that,\n\nat trial, the government only introduced evidence (in the form of\n\na certified judgment) that he had been convicted in 1993 in the\n\nDistrict of Connecticut for failing to appear for a criminal trial,\n\nin   violation   of   18   U.S.C.   §    3146(a)(1).   Colón   points   out,\n\ncorrectly, that § 3146(a)(1) contains both felony and misdemeanor\n\nprovisions, and argues that one cannot tell from the face of the\n\njudgment whether his prior conviction was a felony or misdemeanor.\n\nThe government responds that one can tell that Colón's prior\n\nconviction was a felony because the judgment shows that Colón was\n\nsentenced to three years of supervised release, a term that may be\n\nimposed only in connection with a felony conviction. See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3583(b).\n\n           The government is surely correct when it says that the\n\ncertified judgment was sufficient to support an inference that\n\nColón was a convicted felon on the day of his arrest.          But that is\n\nnot really the problem about which Colón is complaining.           While a\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fjury could have drawn the inference if it had been informed that a\n\nthree-year    supervised     release       term    may    be    imposed   only   in\n\nconnection with a felony conviction, Colón's jury was not so\n\ninformed.      This   is   the    thrust    of    Colón's      somewhat   misframed\n\n\"sufficiency\" argument.          And it is a point to which the government\n\nhas made no response.\n\n            Nevertheless, as with the previous issue, we believe that\n\nthe record adequately supports the judgments of conviction against\n\nthis attack.     See Meserve, 271 F.3d at 327.                 For the reasons we\n\nhave just stated, Colón's argument is better understood not as a\n\nsufficiency challenge, but as an argument that the instructions\n\n(which merely directed the jury to determine whether Colón was a\n\nfelon based on the trial evidence) did not adequately explain to\n\nthe jury how it might infer from the trial evidence that Colón was\n\na felon on the day he was apprehended with the firearm and\n\nexplosive device.     Where, as here, there was no relevant objection\n\nto the jury instructions, an argument of this sort can prevail only\n\nwhen it meets the demanding \"plain error\" test of Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n52(b) -- that the error be \"clear\" or \"obvious,\" that it affect\n\nsubstantial rights, and that it seriously affect the fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. See United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).               In this case, the plain\n\nerror standard clearly is not met because Colón has failed to\n\npresent us with a plausible argument that his 1993 conviction under\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 3126(a)(1) was for anything other than a felony.     We\n\nwill not notice an instructional error under Rule 52(b) where there\n\nis overwhelming evidence that the jury still would have convicted\n\nabsent the error.   See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 469-\n\n70 (1997).\n\n          Colón also complains that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying as \"untimely\" a \"supplemental\" motion to\n\nsuppress that he filed on April 24, 2002, the same day Colón filed\n\nhis motion for funds to hire an expert.         Colón's motion was\n\n\"supplemental\" because he had earlier filed a suppression motion\n\nthat was denied on the ground that Colón claimed no possessory\n\ninterest in the firearm and explosive device. (Recall that his\n\ndefense theory was that the weapons had been planted by law\n\nenforcement agents out to get him for ulterior motives.)    Colón's\n\n\"supplemental\" motion, which was not accompanied by a supporting\n\naffidavit, failed to address the district court's conclusion that\n\nsuppression was inappropriate in light of Colón's defense theory.\n\nSo too does his appellate argument.    We therefore will leave the\n\ncourt's ruling undisturbed. That said, we here again must note our\n\ndoubts that the court acted within its discretion in denying the\n\nmotion on timeliness grounds. As with the motion for expert funds,\n\nthe supplemental suppression motion was filed more than three weeks\n\nprior to the day trial was to begin and was not beyond the date\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\festablished by any scheduling order or procedural rule.   The court\n\nshould have addressed its merits.\n\n          Colón next complains that the government was permitted to\n\npresent \"expert\" testimony from Rafael Uribe that the firearm had\n\nmoved in interstate commerce and was originally black in color\n\n(apparently, at trial, most of the black paint had been removed and\n\nthe gun looked metallic) even though Uribe was not noticed as a\n\ngovernment expert in accordance with Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(G).\n\nThe line between expert testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 702 (which is\n\nsubject to the disclosure requirements of Rule 16(a)(1)(G)) and lay\n\nopinion testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 701 (which is not subject to\n\nRule 16(a)(1)(G)) is not easy to draw and is not a matter on which\n\nwe wish to elaborate without more substantial briefing. Suffice it\n\nto say that the only truly germane opinion that Uribe stated --\n\nthat the firearm was manufactured outside of Puerto Rico and thus\n\nmust have moved in interstate commerce -- was properly regarded as\n\nlay opinion testimony because it was based on information gleaned\n\nfrom Uribe's personal experience (Uribe had personally visited the\n\nMassachusetts plant at which the gun was manufactured) and was\n\narrived at \"from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life.\"\n\nFed. R. Evid. 701 advisory committee's notes on the 2000 amendments\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). And in any event,\n\neven if it were not, Colón has not demonstrated that he was\n\nprejudiced by the admission of this testimony.\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f              Colón's remaining two arguments require no more than a\n\nfew words in response. Colón contends that, after United States v.\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), mere evidence that the firearm crossed\n\nstate lines prior to the alleged offense conduct is insufficient to\n\nmeet     18   U.S.C.   §   922(g)(1)'s    \"in   or   affecting   commerce\"\n\nrequirement.     A prior panel has rejected this argument, see United\n\nStates v. Joost, 133 F.3d 125, 131 (1st Cir. 1998), so we are not\n\nfree to revisit the issue, see United States v. Mayes, 332 F.3d 34,\n\n36 (1st Cir. 2003).        Colón also challenges the district court's\n\ndecision to admit testimony that Colón was in possession of drugs\n\nat the time of his arrest and that Colón had a history of drug use.\n\nBut much of this evidence was admitted without objection and, in\n\nany event, strikes us as extremely unlikely to have affected the\n\njury's rejection of Colón's defense theory -- that the firearm and\n\nexplosive device were planted on him.           Thus, even if we thought\n\nthat the district court erred in admitting some or all of this\n\nevidence, we would not vacate the judgments of conviction on this\n\nbasis.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a).\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

Col&#243;n's defense theory was that law enforcement agents planted the firearm and the explosive device that led to the charges against him because they were out to get him for ulterior motives. He did not make any effort to contradict the evidence about the <i>contents</i> of the device.

The cylinders were bound together, encrusted with &#190;-inch metal nails, and fitted with an ignitable fuse. Laboratory tests showed the gray powder to be a mixture of potassium perchlorate (an oxidizing agent) and aluminum (a fuel). This mixture is commonly known as \"flash powder.\" Flash powder is an \"explosive\" subject to commercial regulation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. <i>See</i> 27 C.F.R. &#167; 555.11 (2003) (defining \"flash powder\" as \"[a]n explosive material intended to produce an audible report and a flash of light when ignited which includes but is not limited to oxidizers such as potassium chlorate or potassium perchlorate, and fuels such as sulfur or aluminum powder\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial evidence thus established that the device Col&#243;n was carrying contained both an \"explosive\" powder and the means for igniting it.

We therefore see no likelihood that Col&#243;n was harmed by the denial of his motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n next argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to have made the elemental determination that he was a convicted felon on the day he was arrested with the firearm and explosive device. Col&#243;n derives this argument from the fact that, at trial, the government only introduced evidence (in the form of a certified judgment) that he had been convicted in 1993 in the District of Connecticut for failing to appear for a criminal trial, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146(a)(1). Col&#243;n points out, correctly, that &#167; 3146(a)(1) contains both felony and misdemeanor provisions, and argues that one cannot tell from the face of the judgment whether his prior conviction was a felony or misdemeanor. The government responds that one <i>can</i> tell that Col&#243;n's prior conviction was a felony because the judgment shows that Col&#243;n was sentenced to three years of supervised release, a term that may be imposed only in connection with a felony conviction. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government is surely correct when it says that the certified judgment was sufficient to support an inference that Col&#243;n was a convicted felon on the day of his arrest. But that is not really the problem about which Col&#243;n is complaining. While a jury could have drawn the inference <i>if</i> it had been informed that a three-year supervised release term may be imposed only in connection with a felony conviction, Col&#243;n's jury was <i>not</i> so informed. This is the thrust of Col&#243;n's somewhat misframed \"sufficiency\" argument. And it is a point to which the government has made no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, as with the previous issue, we believe that the record adequately supports the judgments of conviction against this attack. <i>See Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d at 327. For the reasons we have just stated, Col&#243;n's argument is better understood not as a sufficiency challenge, but as an argument that the instructions (which merely directed the jury to determine whether Col&#243;n was a felon based on the trial evidence) did not adequately explain to the jury how it might infer from the trial evidence that Col&#243;n was a felon on the day he was apprehended with the firearm and explosive device. Where, as here, there was no relevant objection to the jury instructions, an argument of this sort can prevail only when it meets the demanding \"plain error\" test of Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) &#8212; that the error be \"clear\" or \"obvious,\" that it affect substantial rights, and that it seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In this case, the plain error standard clearly is not met because Col&#243;n has failed to present us with a plausible argument that his 1993 conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3126(a)(1) was for anything other than a felony. We will not notice an instructional error under Rule 52(b) where there is overwhelming evidence that the jury still would have convicted absent the error. <i>See Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 469-70, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n also complains that the district court abused its discretion in denying as \"untimely\" a \"supplemental\" motion to suppress that he filed on April 24, 2002, the same day Col&#243;n filed his motion for funds to hire an expert. Col&#243;n's motion was \"supplemental\" because he had earlier filed a suppression motion that was denied on the ground that Col&#243;n claimed no possessory interest in the firearm and explosive device. (Recall that his defense theory was that the weapons had been planted by law enforcement agents out to get him for ulterior motives.) Col&#243;n's \"supplemental\" motion, which was not accompanied by a supporting affidavit, failed to address the district court's conclusion that suppression was inappropriate in light of Col&#243;n's defense theory. So too does his appellate argument. We therefore will leave the court's ruling undisturbed. That said, we here again must note our doubts that the court acted within its discretion in denying the motion on timeliness grounds. As with the motion for expert funds, the supplemental suppression motion was filed more than three weeks prior to the day trial was to begin and was not beyond the date established by any scheduling order or procedural rule. The court should have addressed its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n next complains that the government was permitted to present \"expert\" testimony from Rafael Uribe that the firearm had moved in interstate commerce and was originally black in color (apparently, at trial, most of the black paint had been removed and the gun looked metallic) even though Uribe was not noticed as a government expert in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G). The line between expert testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 702 (which is subject to the disclosure requirements of Rule 16(a)(1)(G)) and lay opinion testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 701 (which is not subject to Rule 16(a)(1)(G)) is not easy to draw and is not a matter on which we wish to elaborate without more substantial briefing. Suffice it to say that the only truly germane opinion that Uribe stated &#8212; that the firearm was manufactured outside of Puerto Rico and thus must have moved in interstate commerce &#8212; was properly regarded as lay opinion testimony because it was based on information gleaned from Uribe's personal experience (Uribe had personally visited the Massachusetts plant at which the gun was manufactured) and was arrived at \"from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life.\" Fed.R.Evid. 701 advisory committee's notes on the 2000 amendments (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). And in any event, even if it were not, Col&#243;n has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the admission of this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n's remaining two arguments require no more than a few words in response. Col&#243;n contends that, after <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), mere evidence that the firearm crossed state lines prior to the alleged offense conduct is insufficient to meet 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1)'s \"in or affecting commerce\" requirement. A prior panel has rejected this argument, <i>see United States v. Joost,</i> 133 F.3d 125, 131 (1st Cir.1998), so we are not free to revisit the issue, <i>see United States v. Mayes,</i> 332 F.3d 34, 36 (1st Cir.2003). Col&#243;n also challenges the district court's decision to admit testimony that Col&#243;n was in possession of drugs at the time of his arrest and that Col&#243;n had a history of drug use. But much of this evidence was admitted without objection and, in any event, strikes us as extremely unlikely to have affected the jury's rejection of Col&#243;n's defense theory &#8212; that the firearm and explosive device were planted on him. Thus, even if we thought that the district court erred in admitting some or all of this evidence, we would not vacate the judgments of conviction on this basis. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",

In due course, a jury convicted Col&#243;n of being a felon in possession of a firearm, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), with an obliterated serial number, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k), and carrying an explosive during his felonious possession offenses, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(h)(2), (j), and 232(5).

Col&#243;n first contends that the district court abused its discretion, <i>see United States v. DeJesus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198907\"><a href=\"/opinion/198907/united-states-v-algarin-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 155-56 (1st Cir.2000), in denying as \"untimely\" his motion for funds (Col&#243;n is indigent) to secure an expert's assistance in investigating whether he was carrying an \"explosive.\" The relevant facts are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted Col&#243;n on the charges of which he was convicted on August 23, 2001. Between the date of the indictment and April 1, 2002, the only issues actively litigated were Col&#243;n's competency and entitlement to bail, although the government did file the curriculum vitae of explosives expert Richard J. Campbell on October 24, 2001. Ultimately, Col&#243;n was ordered detained and found, by order dated April 1, competent to stand trial. On April 3, Col&#243;n moved to continue the trial, which was then scheduled to begin on April 11. The district court granted the motion, setting a new trial date of May 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, Col&#243;n filed his motion for funds to hire an expert. Two days later, before the government responded, the district court denied it as \"untimely\" by margin order. The record reveals no pretrial order or rule specifically requiring that the motion be filed prior to April 24. When the matter was raised at trial, the court clarified that it had denied the motion because it \"would obviously [have been] followed by a request for a continuance\" to obtain an expert report. The court might have added, but did not, that the government's intention of relying on an expert to prove that the device was an explosive should have been known no later than October 24, 2001, when the government made its submission regarding its explosives expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Col&#243;n's motion was filed later than it might have been, we are troubled that it was denied solely on the ground that a contrary ruling would necessitate a second continuance of the trial. After all, a 10-year mandatory prison sentence was at stake, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(2); Col&#243;n was in prison awaiting trial and thus posed no threat to the public; the motion was filed more than three weeks prior to the day trial was scheduled to begin; and the record contains no evidence from which to infer that the government would have been prejudiced by any continuance that would have followed the granting of the motion. Under the circumstances, the rationale provided for the denial of the motion strikes us as being close to, if not beyond, the limits of the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, despite our misgivings about the slender rationale for denying the motion, we will not vacate the judgment of conviction on the carrying charge because our independent review of the record convinces us that any error was harmless. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\"Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\"); <i>United States v. Meserve,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199680\"><a href=\"/opinion/199680/united-states-v-meserve/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 327 (1st Cir.2001) (noting appellate court's power to affirm challenged judgments on any ground apparent in the record). Col&#243;n's defense theory was that law enforcement agents planted the firearm and the explosive device that led to the charges against him because they were out to get him for ulterior motives. He did not make any effort to contradict the evidence about the <i>contents</i> of the device. And the uncontradicted evidence about those contents compels the conclusion that the device constituted an \"explosive\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The device consisted of two cylinders containing 5.95 and 5.7 grams of a gray powder. The cylinders were bound together, encrusted with &#190;-inch metal nails, and fitted with an ignitable fuse. Laboratory tests showed the gray powder to be a mixture of potassium perchlorate (an oxidizing agent) and aluminum (a fuel). This mixture is commonly known as \"flash powder.\" Flash powder is an \"explosive\" subject to commercial regulation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. <i>See</i> 27 C.F.R. &#167; 555.11 (2003) (defining \"flash powder\" as \"[a]n explosive material intended to produce an audible report and a flash of light when ignited which includes but is not limited to oxidizers such as potassium chlorate or potassium perchlorate, and fuels such as sulfur or aluminum powder\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial evidence thus established that the device Col&#243;n was carrying contained both an \"explosive\" powder and the means for igniting it. Col&#243;n did not seek expert assistance (from a chemist, for example) to attack these foundational facts; he sought assistance so that his attorney might better understand whether and how the device might operate. But the government was not required to prove the device's operational capacity to a certainty; some possibility of explosion is sufficient under the statute. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(j) (\"For the purposes of subsection[] ... (h), ... `explosive' means ... any chemical compounds, mechanical mixture, or device that contains any oxidizing and combustible units, or other ingredients, in such proportions, quantities, or packing that ignition by fire, by friction, by concussion, by percussion, or by detonation of the compound, mixture, or device or any part thereof <i>may</i> cause an explosion.\") (emphasis supplied). We therefore see no likelihood that Col&#243;n was harmed by the denial of his motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n next argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to have made the elemental determination that he was a convicted felon on the day he was arrested with the firearm and explosive device.

Col&#243;n points out, correctly, that &#167; 3146(a)(1) contains both felony and misdemeanor provisions, and argues that one cannot tell from the face of the judgment whether his prior conviction was a felony or misdemeanor. The government responds that one <i>can</i> tell that Col&#243;n's prior conviction was a felony because the judgment shows that Col&#243;n was sentenced to three years of supervised release, a term that may be imposed only in connection with a felony conviction. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government is surely correct when it says that the certified judgment was sufficient to support an inference that Col&#243;n was a convicted felon on the day of his arrest. But that is not really the problem about which Col&#243;n is complaining. While a jury could have drawn the inference <i>if</i> it had been informed that a three-year supervised release term may be imposed only in connection with a felony conviction, Col&#243;n's jury was <i>not</i> so informed.

Thus, even if we thought that the district court erred in admitting some or all of this evidence, we would not vacate the judgments of conviction on this basis. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
