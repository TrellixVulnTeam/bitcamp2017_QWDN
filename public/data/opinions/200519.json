This appeal arises out of a\n\ndispute between a defunct Maine securities broker-dealer known as\n\nNew Life Brokerage Services, Inc., and its insurance broker, Cal-\n\nSurance Associates, Inc. New Life contends that the district court\n\nerred in awarding Cal-Surance summary judgment on its claims that\n\nCal-Surance should be held liable for failing to provide it with an\n\ninsurance policy that would have covered a series of events that\n\nput it out of business.        We affirm, though on a different basis\n\nthan that relied upon by the district court.\n\n                                       I.\n\n     On   or   about    September     2,   1997,   a   customer   of   New   Life\n\ncomplained to the Securities Division of Maine's Bureau of Banking\n\nthat one of New Life's sales representatives, Cary Butterfield, had\n\nunlawfully sold securities that were not registered with the state.\n\nThe complaint prompted a Securities Division investigation that\n\nrevealed that, in 1996 and 1997, Butterfield had sold some $1.3\n\nmillion worth of securities that were neither registered nor\n\napproved for sale by New Life.         This unlawful practice is known in\n\nthe securities industry as \"selling away.\" The Securities Division\n\nthereafter     sought   to   revoke    New   Life's     license   as   a     Maine\n\nsecurities broker-dealer.           See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, ยง\n\n10313(1)(J) (1999 and 2002 Supp.) (conferring this power upon the\n\nSecurities Division if its administrator determines that such\n\nrevocation is \"in the public interest\" and that the broker-dealer\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f\"failed reasonably to supervise [its] sales representatives\").\n\n           From late 1997 through 1999, New Life attempted to\n\nnegotiate an agreement with the Securities Division that would\n\npermit it to retain its license.              But the Securities Division\n\nconditioned any such agreement on, inter alia, New Life purchasing\n\nback from Butterfield's customers a substantial number of the\n\nunlawfully sold securities. On September 21, 1998, as negotiations\n\nwere ongoing, New Life notified Zurich American, its errors and\n\nomissions insurer, of its representative's selling away and the\n\nSecurities Division's investigation.           The following month, Zurich\n\nAmerican advised New Life that the policy did not provide coverage\n\nfor selling away.    In the absence of insurance coverage, New Life\n\nwas unable to offer to purchase back a sufficient number of\n\nunlawfully    sold   shares   to    satisfy     the   Securities    Division.\n\nEventually, New Life acceded to the revocation of its broker-dealer\n\nlicense, effective December 31, 1999.\n\n             Cal-Surance   had     procured    the    New   Life   errors   and\n\nomissions policies that were in effect annually between January 1,\n\n1996 and January 1, 2000 -- the period during which the events\n\nunderlying this lawsuit occurred.          Following the surrender of its\n\nlicense, New Life brought this diversity action against Cal-\n\nSurance.      The complaint alleged that Cal-Surance had breached\n\nduties owed to New Life to obtain for it errors and omissions\n\ninsurance policies covering the selling away of unregistered and/or\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\funapproved securities. At bottom, New Life's case theory was that,\n\nhad Cal-Surance discharged these duties, New Life would have been\n\nable to purchase back a sufficient number of the unlawfully sold\n\nsecurities to avoid going out of business.\n\n          Following     discovery,    Cal-Surance   moved   for   summary\n\njudgment on a number of grounds.       The district court referred the\n\nmotion to a magistrate judge, who focused on Cal-Surance's argument\n\nthat New Life had failed to provide evidence that there existed in\n\nthe insurance market during the relevant time frame policies that\n\nwould have covered the costs (or some portion thereof) of meeting\n\nthe Securities Division's demands.         The magistrate judge analyzed\n\nseven insurance policies that New Life says Cal-Surance could have\n\nprocured, and concluded that there were applicable exclusions\n\nwithin each disavowing coverage for claims or proceedings brought\n\nby governmental entities.     See New Life Brokerage Servs., Inc. v.\n\nCal-Surance Assocs., 223 F. Supp.2d 264, 271-75 (D. Me. 2002).\n\nAccordingly, the magistrate judge recommended that Cal-Surance's\n\nrequest for summary judgment be granted.          See id. at 275.     The\n\nreferring judge accepted the recommendation, see id. at 266, and\n\nthis appeal followed.    While we do not quarrel with the magistrate\n\njudge's reasoning and conclusions, we conclude that Maine law\n\nprovides another and more direct route to affirmance, as set forth\n\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f                                          II.\n\n            Cal-Surance opens its brief not by responding to New\n\nLife's arguments against the applicability of the exclusions relied\n\nupon by the district court, but by presenting an alternative ground\n\nfor upholding the judgment that it regards as more straightforward.\n\nSee, e.g., Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d\n\n178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999) (appeals court may affirm entry of summary\n\njudgment on \"any ground revealed by the record\").                       Cal-Surance\n\ncontends that each of the seven policies provided only liability\n\ncoverage for \"damages\" or, in the case of one of the policies,\n\n\"loss\" (defined to include \"damages, judgments, settlements, and\n\ndefense costs\" but not \"the cost of complying with any settlement\n\nfor or award of non-monetary relief\") incurred as the result of\n\nlegal proceedings initiated against the insured.                 In Cal-Surance's\n\nview, funds paid by New Life to buy back the securities would not\n\nhave constituted \"damages\" or \"loss\" liability under any reasonable\n\ninterpretation of these terms.               New Life effectively concedes that\n\nthe policies only covered liability of this sort.                     Its responsive\n\nargument    is    that    the       buy-back    costs   would   have     constituted\n\n\"damages\" or \"loss\" under Maine law, because they would have formed\n\nthe basis for the amount of damages to which its customers would\n\nhave been entitled had they sued New Life directly.                     See Me. Rev.\n\nStat.   Ann.     tit.    32,    ยง   10605.      Cal-Surance     has    the   stronger\n\nargument.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f             We give content to the contractual terms in question by\n\nadopting \"the perspective of an average person untrained in either\n\nthe law or the insurance field\" and asking \"what a more than casual\n\nreading of the policy would reveal to [this] ordinarily intelligent\n\ninsured.\"     Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.,\n\n521   A.2d   308,   310   (Me.    1987)    (internal      quotations    omitted).\n\nObviously,    a   standard   as    general    as   this    is   far    from   self-\n\nexecuting, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine has applied it\n\nin circumstances that strongly suggest that New Life's buy-back\n\ncosts would not constitute \"damages\" or \"loss\" liability under\n\nMaine law.\n\n             In Patrons Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marois, 573 A.2d 16\n\n(Me. 1990), the Court was faced with the question whether an\n\ninsurance policy providing liability coverage for amounts the\n\ninsured was \"legally obligated to pay as damages\" would cover\n\nexpenses incurred by an insured responding to a governmental demand\n\nthat it eradicate pollution damage (on its own property and that of\n\nthird parties) caused by its leaking underground gasoline tanks.\n\nSee id. at 16-17.          The Court answered this question in the\n\nnegative,     reasoning    that    there     was   a   material       difference,\n\ndiscernible to the ordinarily intelligent insured, between \"sums\n\nwhich the insured [is] legally obligated to pay as damages\" and the\n\ncosts of conduct undertaken at government direction to restore (to\n\nthe extent practicable) the status quo ante.                See id. at 18.      In\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\freaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledged that such remedial\n\ncosts \"may be substantial and may effectively alleviate or prevent\n\ndamage to others . . . .\"           Id.    But at the same time, the Court\n\nnoted the possibility of \"a substantial difference between these\n\nremedial costs and the amount of damages the [insured] would have\n\nto pay to [affected third parties] for damages,\" and held that it\n\nwas only \"the latter expenditure upon which the parties . . .\n\ncontracted and upon which the premium [was] based.\"              Id. at 18-19.\n\n            Like the equitable remedial costs in Marois, New Life's\n\nequitable remedial buy-back costs, insisted on by the Securities\n\nDivision, are distinguishable from any actual direct damages that\n\nNew Life would have been obligated to pay its customers.                    Under\n\nMarois, the payment of money does not by itself constitute loss or\n\ndamage   as    contemplated        by    the   policy.     If   anything,    the\n\ncircumstances presented in this case are even more dissimilar to an\n\naction seeking to impose damages or loss liability than the Marois\n\nscenario.     After all, unlike the government regulator in Marois,\n\nthe Securities Division had no authority under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\nยง 10313(1) to order New Life to buy back the securities or\n\notherwise     to   spend   money    to    remedy   the   situation.   See    id.\n\n(conferring the power only to deny, suspend, or revoke a broker-\n\ndealer license).      In any event, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\n\nhas concluded that the costs of remedial conduct required by a\n\ngovernment agency to undo the effects of an insured's unlawful\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\factivity, even if the conduct \"alleviate[s] or prevent[s]\" damages\n\nto or losses by third parties, Marois, 573 A.2d at 18, were not\n\ncovered    by   an   insurance   policy    \"damages\"   liability     provision\n\nmaterially indistinguishable from the policy provisions relied upon\n\nby   New   Life.     Having   invoked     the   district   court's   diversity\n\njurisdiction, New Life is not well positioned to argue against our\n\nreaching the same conclusion.           See, e.g., Dryden Oil Co. of New\n\nEngland, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 91 F.3d 278, 289 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

New Life contends that the district court erred in awarding Cal-Surance summary judgment on its claims that Cal-Surance should be held liable for failing to provide it with an insurance policy that would have covered a series of events that put it out of business. We affirm, though on a different basis than that relied upon by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about September 2, 1997, a customer of New Life complained to the Securities Division of Maine's Bureau of Banking that one of New Life's sales representatives, Cary Butterfield, had unlawfully sold securities that were not registered with the state. The complaint prompted a Securities Division investigation that revealed that, in 1996 and 1997, Butterfield had sold some $1.3 million worth of securities that were neither registered nor approved for sale by New Life. This unlawful practice is known in the securities industry as \"selling away.\" The Securities Division thereafter sought to revoke New Life's license as a Maine securities broker-dealer. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 10313(1)(J) (1999 and 2002 Supp.) (conferring this power upon the Securities Division if its administrator determines that such revocation is \"in the public interest\" and that the broker-dealer \"failed reasonably to supervise [its] sales representatives\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From late 1997 through 1999, New Life attempted to negotiate an agreement with the Securities Division that would permit it to retain its license. But the Securities Division conditioned any such agreement on, <i>inter alia,</i> New Life purchasing back from Butterfield's customers a substantial number of the unlawfully sold securities. On September 21, 1998, as negotiations were ongoing, New Life notified Zurich American, its errors and omissions insurer, of its representative's selling away and the Securities Division's investigation. The following month, Zurich American advised New Life that the policy did not provide coverage for selling away. In the absence of insurance coverage, New Life was unable to offer to purchase back a sufficient number of unlawfully sold shares to satisfy the Securities Division. Eventually, New Life acceded to the revocation of its broker-dealer license, effective December 31, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cal-Surance had procured the New Life errors and omissions policies that were in effect annually between January 1, 1996 and January 1, 2000 &#8212; the period during which the events underlying this lawsuit occurred. Following the surrender of its license, New Life brought this diversity action against Cal-Surance. The complaint alleged that Cal-Surance had breached duties owed to New Life to obtain for it errors and omissions insurance policies covering the selling away of unregistered and/or unapproved securities. At bottom, New Life's case theory was that, had Cal-Surance discharged these duties, New Life would have been able to purchase back a sufficient number of the unlawfully sold securities to avoid going out of business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discovery, Cal-Surance moved for summary judgment on a number of grounds. The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who focused on Cal-Surance's argument that New Life had failed to provide evidence that there existed in the insurance market during the relevant time frame policies that would have covered the costs (or some portion thereof) of meeting the Securities Division's demands. The magistrate judge analyzed seven insurance policies that New Life says Cal-Surance could have procured, and concluded that there were applicable exclusions within each disavowing coverage for claims or proceedings brought by governmental entities. <i>See New Life Brokerage Servs., Inc. v. Cal-Surance Assocs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2345339\"><a href=\"/opinion/2345339/new-life-brokerage-services-v-cal-surance-assocs/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 271-75 (D.Me.2002). Accordingly, the magistrate judge recommended that Cal-Surance's request for summary judgment be granted. <i>See id.</i> at 275. The referring judge accepted the recommendation, <i>see id.</i> at 266, and this appeal followed. While we do not quarrel with the magistrate judge's reasoning and conclusions, we conclude that Maine law provides another and more direct route to affirmance, as set forth below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cal-Surance opens its brief not by responding to New Life's arguments against the applicability of the exclusions relied upon by the district court, but by presenting an alternative ground for upholding the judgment that it regards as more straightforward. <i>See, e.g., Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763565\"><a href=\"/opinion/763565/houlton-citizens-coalition-v-town-of-houlton/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 184 (1st Cir.1999) (appeals court may affirm entry of summary judgment on \"any ground revealed by the record\"). Cal-Surance contends that each of the seven policies provided only liability coverage for \"damages\" or, in the case of one of the policies, \"loss\" (defined to include \"damages, judgments, settlements, and defense costs\" but not \"the cost of complying with any settlement for or award of non-monetary relief\") incurred as the result of legal proceedings initiated against the insured. In Cal-Surance's view, funds paid by New Life to buy back the securities would not have constituted \"damages\" or \"loss\" liability under any reasonable interpretation of these terms. New Life effectively concedes that the policies only covered liability of this sort. Its responsive argument is that the buy-back costs would have constituted \"damages\" or \"loss\" under Maine law, because they would have formed the basis for the amount of damages to which its customers would have been entitled had they sued New Life directly. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &#167; 10605. Cal-Surance has the stronger argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We give content to the contractual terms in question by adopting \"the perspective of an average person untrained in either the law or the insurance field\" and asking \"what a more than casual reading of the policy would reveal to [this] ordinarily intelligent insured.\" <i>Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></span>, 310 (Me.1987) (internal quotations omitted). Obviously, a standard as general as this is far from self-executing, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine has applied it in circumstances that strongly suggest that New Life's buy-back costs would not constitute \"damages\" or \"loss\" liability under Maine law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Patrons Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marois,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span> (Me.1990), the Court was faced with the question whether an insurance policy providing liability coverage for amounts the insured was \"legally obligated to pay as damages\" would cover expenses incurred by an insured responding to a governmental demand that it eradicate pollution damage (on its own property and that of third parties) caused by its leaking underground gasoline tanks. <i>See id.</i> at 16-17. The Court answered this question in the negative, reasoning that there was a material difference, discernible to the ordinarily intelligent insured, between \"sums which the insured [is] legally obligated to pay as damages\" and the costs of conduct undertaken at government direction to restore (to the extent practicable) the <i>status quo ante. See id.</i> at 18. In reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledged that such remedial costs \"may be substantial and may effectively alleviate or prevent damage to others....\" <i>Id.</i> But at the same time, the Court noted the possibility of \"a substantial difference between these remedial costs and the amount of damages the [insured] would have to pay to [affected third parties] for damages,\" and held that it was only \"the latter expenditure upon which the parties ... contracted and upon which the premium [was] based.\" <i>Id.</i> at 18-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the equitable remedial costs in <i>Marois,</i> New Life's equitable remedial buy-back costs, insisted on by the Securities Division, are distinguishable from any actual direct damages that New Life would have been obligated to pay its customers. Under <i>Marois,</i> the payment of money does not by itself constitute loss or damage as contemplated by the policy. If anything, the circumstances presented in this case are even more dissimilar to an action seeking to impose damages or loss liability than the <i>Marois</i> scenario. After all, unlike the government regulator in <i>Marois,</i> the Securities Division had no authority under Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 10313(1) to order New Life to buy back the securities or otherwise to spend money to remedy the situation. <i>See id.</i> (conferring the power only to deny, suspend, or revoke a broker-dealer license). In any event, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has concluded that the costs of remedial conduct required by a government agency to undo the effects of an insured's unlawful activity, even if the conduct \"alleviate[s] or prevent[s]\" damages to or losses by third parties, <i>Marois,</i> 573 A.2d at 18, were not covered by an insurance policy \"damages\" liability provision materially indistinguishable from the policy provisions relied upon by New Life. Having invoked the district court's diversity jurisdiction, New Life is not well positioned to argue against our reaching the same conclusion. <i>See, e.g., Dryden Oil Co. of New England, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196910\"><a href=\"/opinion/196910/dryden-oil-company-v-the-travelers/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 289 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
