This appeal requires us to\n\nconsider the claims of two dairy farmers, each convicted of milk\n\nadulteration, who, along with their wives, now assert that the\n\nrelevant Puerto Rico regulatory agency's decision to cancel their\n\nmilk production quotas deprived them of valuable property in\n\nviolation of the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution.                U.S.\n\nConst. amend. V, XIV.       We find no merit to these claims and affirm\n\nthe decision of the district court.\n\n                                  I.    Facts\n\n            Víctor González-Álvarez (\"González\") and his wife Carmen\n\nEchevarría-Vélez (\"Echevarría\") owned a dairy farm in Arecibo,\n\nPuerto    Rico   licensed   by   the   Milk     Industry   Regulation   Office\n\n(\"ORIL,\"    in   Spanish)   through     the     Puerto   Rico   Department   of\n\nAgriculture, pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 5, § 1101, et seq.\n\n(2005).    Luis Alfonso-Delgado (\"Alfonso\") and his wife Lydia Mora-\n\nDelgado (\"Mora\") also owned a dairy farm in Hatillo, Puerto Rico\n\nsubject to the same licensing and regulatory regime.              In separate\n\nincidents, González and Alfonso were convicted of adulterating the\n\nmilk they sold in an attempt to increase the volume they produced.\n\n            After their convictions, appellants González and Alfonso\n\nlost their licenses to produce milk after ORIL administrative\n\nproceedings. They do not now contest this decision. However, ORIL\n\nalso cancelled appellants' milk quotas.                  Under Puerto Rico's\n\nregulations of the dairy industry, dairy farmers' milk production\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fis limited to the total quota which they have purchased from ORIL.\n\nA quota is \"the amount of milk quarts that the Administrator of the\n\nMilk Industry Regulation Office assigns to be produced every\n\nfourteen (14) days by cattlemen, in accordance to the market\n\nneeds.\"   Milk Industry Quota Transaction Registry, Law Number 301\n\nof Sept. 1, 2000, Art. 1(c) (\"Law 301\").    After years of purchasing\n\nmilk quotas through ORIL, by 2002 González and Echevarría had\n\naccumulated quotas authorizing them to produce up to 25,000 liters\n\nof milk every two weeks.   Likewise, Alfonso and Mora had purchased\n\nmilk quotas from ORIL authorizing them to produce up to 18,600\n\nliters of milk every two weeks.        Appellants contend that these\n\nquotas were their personal property and that they could not be\n\ntaken from them without just compensation.\n\n          Appellants assert that the milk quotas are currently sold\n\nat a rate of at least $32.00 per liter.        Therefore, appellants\n\nGonzález and Echevarría estimate that they are owed not less than\n\n$800,000, which they claim to be the fair market value of their\n\nquotas.   Similarly, appellants Alfonso and Mora seek compensation\n\nof not less than $595,000 for their cancelled quotas.\n\n                           II.   Analysis\n\n          The district court did not reach the merits of the\n\nfederal constitutional takings claims raised by either set of\n\nappellants.   In the case of Alfonso and his wife, it found that\n\ntheir claims were time barred with regard to all defendants.      In\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthe case of González and his wife, the district court found that\n\nthe claims against certain defendants were barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations and that the remaining defendants were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.      Thus, appellants now seek review of two main\n\nissues: (1) whether the instant actions were filed within the\n\nrelevant statute of limitations; and (2) whether defendants are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity. Because we agree with the district\n\ncourt that the claims of both sets of plaintiffs-appellants are\n\nprecluded by the statute of limitations or qualified immunity, we\n\naffirm the decisions of the district court.\n\nA.   Statute of Limitations\n\n           Both sets of appellants dispute the district court's\n\nfindings   that   some   or   all   of   their   claims   are   time-barred.\n\nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, we apply the forum state's statute of\n\nlimitations period for personal injury actions.                 See Rivera-\n\nMuriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 352 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nThere is no dispute that in Puerto Rico the statute of limitations\n\nis one year, and that federal law is applied to determine when the\n\nlimitations period begins to accrue.        See id. at 353.     Rather, both\n\nsets of appellants argue that the district court erred in its\n\ndetermination of the date on which the statute of limitations began\n\nto accrue.   In addition, appellants argue that, under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw, the wives involved in these cases also possessed a property\n\ninterest in the milk production quotas, and thus the statute of\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\flimitations could not begin to run until they were notified of the\n\ncancellation of the quotas.\n\n           On April 7, 2000, appellant Alfonso was convicted of milk\n\nadulteration to increase the volume of milk produced, and on\n\nJuly 12, 2000, Carlos Cabán-Nieves (\"Cabán\"), then Administrator of\n\nORIL, issued an administrative ruling that revoked Alfonso's milk\n\nproduction license and quotas. Alfonso did not appeal this ruling,\n\nand on March 23, 2001, defendant Juan R. Pedró-Gordián (\"Pedró\"),\n\nthe new Administrator of ORIL, sent Alfonso a letter informing him\n\nthat the July 2000 ruling would be implemented March 29, 2001.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, Alfonso had mistakenly been granted a new\n\nlicense, and on May 30, 2001, he filed a case with ORIL alleging\n\nthat Pedró had no right to suspend his license, which ORIL denied\n\nin October 2001.     Alfonso also appealed this case to the Puerto\n\nRico Appeals Court, which upheld the ORIL decision.          Alfonso\n\nDelgado v. Pedró-Gordián, No. KLRA20020447 (T.C.A. Aug. 20, 2002).\n\nMeanwhile, on May 14, 2002, Pedró mailed a letter to Alfonso\n\nnotifying him that the cancellation would become effective June 5,\n\n2002.   Alfonso and his wife Mora filed the complaint in the instant\n\ncase on July 7, 2003.\n\n           Appellant González was also convicted in 2000 of milk\n\nadulteration to increase the volume of milk produced, and on\n\nDecember    21,    2001,   ORIL   Administrator   Pedró   issued   an\n\nadministrative ruling revoking González's milk production license\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fand quotas. González appealed this ruling to the Puerto Rico Court\n\nof Appeals, Milk Quality Program of the Milk Industry Regulation\n\nOffice v. González-Álvarez, No. KLRA0200084 (T.C.A. Apr. 26, 2002),\n\nand then to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.       On September 27, 2002\n\nhis request for reconsideration by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nwas denied. Appellants González and Echevarría filed the complaint\n\ncommencing this action on November 5, 2003.        Appellants González\n\nand Echevarría argue that the statute of limitations did not begin\n\nto run until November 6, 2002, the date on which the manufacturing\n\nplant ceased picking up milk from their dairy farm.\n\n           In a § 1983 claim, the statute of limitations generally\n\nbegins to run \"when the plaintiff 'knows or has reason to know of\n\nthe injury which is the basis for the claim.'\" Rodríguez-García v.\n\nMunicipality of Caguas, 354 F.3d 91, 96-97 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting\n\nRodríguez-Nárvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41 n.5 (1st Cir 1990)).\n\nAmong the precedent established by the Supreme Court, we find no\n\nindication that property must be physically seized or that actual\n\neconomic harm must have already been felt before a takings claim\n\naccrues.   In the context of regulatory takings, for instance, the\n\nSupreme Court has held that such claims are ripe when the plaintiff\n\nhas received \"a 'final decision regarding the application of the\n\n[challenged] regulations to the property at issue' from 'the\n\ngovernment entity charged with implementing the regulations,'\" and\n\nthe   plaintiff   has   sought   compensation   through   the   procedure\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fprovided by the state.       Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 520\n\nU.S. 725, 734 (1997) (quoting Williamson County Reg'l Planning\n\nComm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 186 (1985)).\n\nSince in this case, the state has always clearly denied that any\n\ncompensation would be due and there is no state remedy available\n\nfor seeking compensation, the second hurdle falls away.                     See\n\nWilliamson County, 473 U.S. at 194-96.\n\n          Both   sets   of    appellants   argue     that   the   statute   of\n\nlimitations could not begin to run until the date on which the milk\n\nmanufacturing plant actually discontinued picking up appellants'\n\nmilk.1   However,   after      the   quotas   were    cancelled    by   ORIL,\n\n\n1\n   Appellants cite to a number of cases that miss the mark. In\nsupport of their theory, plaintiffs cite to Lawson v. Shelby\nCounty, 211 F.3d 331 (6th Cir. 2000), in which the plaintiffs\nasserted a deprivation of their right to vote. The Sixth Circuit\nheld that plaintiffs \"were not denied the right to vote when they\nwere notified that their registrations had been rejected, they were\ndenied the right to vote when they presented themselves at the\nappropriate polling place and were denied access to the voting\nbooth.\" Id. at 336. In this case, by contrast, the deprivation at\nissue occurred when the plaintiffs' milk quotas were cancelled\n(i.e., when the alleged \"taking\" occurred), not when the milk\ncollection actually was suspended.\n\n    Ramos v. Román, 83 F. Supp. 2d 233 (D.P.R. 2000) is no more\nhelpful to plaintiffs. In Ramos, the issue was not whether the\nstatute of limitations began to run when the plaintiffs' license to\nsell firearms was revoked or when the weapons were actually\nconfiscated (both of which were outside the statute of\nlimitations).   Rather, the question was whether the limitations\nperiod did not commence until much later, when the plaintiffs\nlearned that the license revocation and the confiscation were\nmotivated by political discrimination.         The district court\nconcluded that \"the Plaintiffs['] action accrued the day the police\neffectuated the confiscation of plaintiffs' firearms and ammunition\npursuant to the Department of Treasury's revocation of the\n\n                                     -8-\n\fappellants were simply waiting for the decision to be enforced. In\n\nthis case, a quota is simply the right to sell a given amount of\n\nmilk.    Assuming that that legal right is \"property,\" when ORIL\n\nissued its decision cancelling appellants' quotas, appellants were\n\nalready deprived of the property at issue, and the statute of\n\nlimitations began to run as of that date.            Cf. Suitum, 520 U.S. at\n\n736    n.10    (finding     that    facial   challenges     to   regulation   are\n\ngenerally ripe the moment the challenged regulation is passed, so\n\nlong as the owners can demonstrate that the enactment deprived them\n\nof any economically viable use of the property).                 Because we find\n\nthat Alfonso and his wife \"[knew], or ha[d] reason to know of the\n\ninjury which is the basis for his claim,\" Rodríguez-García, 354\n\nF.3d    at    96-97,   on    July    12,     2000,   when   ORIL    issued    its\n\nadministrative decision revoking Alfonso's license, this action\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' license to sell firearms.\" Id. at 239. Immediately\nafter reaching this conclusion, the court cited a case in which the\nFirst Circuit \"assume[d] arguendo that [the plaintiff's] claim\naccrued at the latest possible date.\"     Id. at 239 n.6 (quoting\nBenítez-Pons v. Commonwealth of P.R., 136 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir.\n1998)).   In short, the Ramos court did not hold that the claim\naccrued when the weapons were confiscated, as opposed to when the\nlicense was revoked; it held that the claim accrued at one of these\nearlier dates (assuming arguendo that it was the latter of the\ntwo), as opposed to two decades later, when the plaintiffs learned\nthe reason for the revocation. Ramos therefore does not stand for\nthe proposition that the plaintiffs' milk quotas were not \"taken\"\nuntil milk collection was actually suspended.\n\n                                       -9-\n\ffiled July 7, 2003 was commenced beyond the one-year statute of\n\nlimitations.2\n\n           For   the   same   reasons,      we   find   that    the   statute   of\n\nlimitations began to run for the claims brought by González and his\n\nwife on December 21, 2001, when ORIL issued its administrative\n\ndecision   revoking     González's     license.3         This     action   filed\n\nNovember 5, 2003 would then clearly be beyond the one-year statute\n\nof limitations. However, in this case, the district court found --\n\nand it is unchallenged by any party                -- that the statute of\n\nlimitations was tolled as to defendant Pedró, in his personal\n\ncapacity, and his wife, Lizet Quiñones, by an action filed by\n\nGonzález in bankruptcy court in the interim.4              Thus, the instant\n\nfederal action was timely filed against them.\n\n\n\n2\n   Appellants' later challenges to the cancellation of the quotas\ndo not toll the statute of limitations. Under Puerto Rico law, in\norder for tolling to occur, the remedies sought in both suits must\nbe identical. See Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893 F.2d\n404, 407 (1st Cir. 1990). In this case, neither set of appellants\nhad previously sought damages, which they are seeking in their\ncurrent § 1983 claims.\n3\n    In the bankruptcy complaint he filed on November 1, 2002,\nGonzález himself admits that in the December 21, 2001 resolution,\n\"ORIL stated that they were to cancel debtor's milk production\nquota.\"     The evidence indicates that upon receipt of the\nDecember 21, 2001 ORIL resolution, González had reason to know, and\ndid in fact subjectively believe, that ORIL was cancelling his milk\nquotas and that he would not be compensated for any portion of\ntheir estimated $800,000 value.\n4\n  The action in bankruptcy court tolled the statute of limitations\nfrom the date of its filing on November 1, 2002, until it was\ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction on November 5, 2003.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            Appellants   argue   that      González's        bankruptcy    court\n\ncomplaint should have also tolled the statute of limitations with\n\nrespect to Secretary of Agriculture Rivero Cubano and his wife. We\n\ndisagree. Appellants argue that because Rivero Cubano was included\n\nin   his   official   capacity   as    a   defendant    in     the   bankruptcy\n\ncomplaint, the statute of limitations was tolled for actions\n\nagainst him in his personal capacity as well. Whereas González and\n\nhis wife named appellee Pedró in his personal capacity, they chose\n\nto name appellee Rivero Cubano only in his official capacity as\n\nSecretary    of   Agriculture.        Furthermore,     the    portion     of   the\n\ncomplaint that alleges possible 42 U.S.C. § 1983 allegations refers\n\nonly to appellee Pedró. In general, \"defendants sued only in their\n\nofficial capacities in the original complaint cannot be expected to\n\nbe on notice of the very different issues raised by claims against\n\nthem in their personal capacities.\"        Rodríguez-García, 354 F.3d at\n\n100 (finding that defendants sued only in their official capacity\n\nwould not be on notice, but that, in this case, defendants waived\n\nany objection to the statute of limitations on that basis).                    We\n\ntherefore affirm the district court's conclusion that the claims\n\nagainst defendants Rivero Cubano and his wife are time barred.\n\n            Another argument implicit in appellants' claims is that,\n\nalthough appellants were aware that the milk quotas were cancelled,\n\nit was not until much later that they discovered that ORIL did not\n\nplan to pay them just compensation. We find this argument entirely\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\funconvincing.        Although there may be cases in which a person could\n\nreasonably be uncertain about whether they were going to receive\n\ncompensation for their taken property, this is not such a case.\n\nAppellants were well aware that the cancellation of their milk\n\nquotas was a direct result of their milk adulteration, and as such,\n\nthey could not have reasonably expected compensation, where no\n\nmention of compensation was made.           Had the government planned on\n\ncompensating appellants for their quotas, it would have said so.\n\nSee Hair v. United States, 350 F.3d 1253, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2003)\n\n(rejecting plaintiff's argument that the government must clearly\n\nannounce its intention not to pay compensation before the statute\n\nof limitations can begin to run, and recognizing that it is\n\ngenerally obvious when the government denies liability for its\n\naction). To accept appellants' argument would allow the government\n\nto prevent a cause of action from accruing simply by failing to\n\nstate explicitly that it does not plan to pay compensation.               See\n\nid.    This cannot be the case.\n\n              Finally, both sets of appellants argue that even if the\n\nstatute of limitations began to run on the dates determined by the\n\ndistrict court with respect to the claims brought by Alfonso and\n\nGonzález, the same cannot be said of their wives' claims, because\n\nthey   were    not    provided   notice   of   the   cancellation   of   their\n\nhusbands' licenses and the milk quotas.              However, we find that,\n\nunder Puerto Rico law, separate notice is not required to both the\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fhusband and wife in a conjugal partnership.           Cf. Blas v. Hospital\n\nGuadalupe, 146 D.P.R. 267, 304 (1998) (finding that each spouse is\n\na co-administrator of the conjugal partnership, and as such, each\n\nordinarily has the capacity to represent it); Pauneto v. Núñez, 115\n\nD.P.R. 591, 594 (1984) (recognizing that jurisdiction may be\n\nacquired over the conjugal partnership by service of one of the co-\n\nadministrators).        We, therefore, find that upon their husbands'\n\nreceipt   of   notice    of   the   quota    cancellation,   the   statute   of\n\nlimitations began to run for actions brought by both the husbands\n\nand their wives.5   Thus, as we concluded above, only González's and\n\nEchevarría's claims against defendant Pedró and his wife were\n\ntimely filed.6\n\nB.   Qualified Immunity\n\n           Having already concluded that all other claims in this\n\nconsolidated appeal are time barred, we now consider appellants\n\nGonzález's and Echevarría's claims against defendants Pedró and his\n\nwife, who assert the defense of qualified immunity.7                   \"For a\n\n\n5\n   We note here that even if these claims were timely filed they\nwould still fail under the qualified immunity analysis described\nbelow.\n6\n  We also consider that it is not entirely clear whether the wives\ncan be said to have a property interest in the quotas.       While\ngenerally in Puerto Rico all marital property is owned by the\nconjugal partnership, only individuals with a license can own milk\nproduction quotas, and, in this case, only González and Alfonso\nhave such a license; their wives do not.\n7\n   The claims against the wives in this case, including Pedró's\nwife Lizet Quiñones, are derivative of the claims against their\n\n                                      -13-\n\fplaintiff to overcome a qualified immunity defense, he must show\n\n[1] that his allegations, if true, establish a constitutional\n\nviolation; [2] that the right was clearly established; and [3] that\n\na reasonable official would have known that his actions violated\n\nthe constitutional right at issue.\"      Mihos v. Swift, 358 F.3d 91,\n\n98-99 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          In   the   opinion   from   which   this    appeal   arises,   the\n\ndistrict court essentially skipped over the first inquiry in order\n\nto reach the subsequent queries, which it found decisive.                The\n\ncourt reasoned that \"even assuming arguendo, that constitutional\n\nrights were violated, . . . it was objecti[vely] reasonable for\n\nPedró to believe that his actions did not violate these clearly\n\nestablished rights.\"8    González-Álvarez v. Rivero Cubano, No. 03-\n\n2193, slip op. at 7 (D.P.R. July 23, 2004).          Although we recognize\n\nthe logic of this approach, the court's election to forego deciding\n\n\n\nhusbands.   The claim against Lizet Quiñones, therefore, cannot\nsurvive once we determine that her husband, who committed the\nalleged violation of appellants' rights, is entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\n8\n  We note that the district court used the same approach to assert\nqualified immunity in Alfonso-Delgado v. Rivero Cubano, No. 03-\n1625, slip op. at 6 (D.P.R. Aug. 5, 2004). In that case, the court\nalso concluded that \"even assuming arguendo, that constitutional\nrights were violated, summary judgment should be granted on\nqualified immunity grounds.\" Id. For the reasons we will explain\nwith regard to the district court's opinion in González-Álvarez,\nNo. 03-2193, slip op. at 7, we reject this approach. However, we\nwill not belabor the point, since none of the claims made by\nAlfonso and his wife were brought within the statute of\nlimitations.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fwhether    the    cancellation     of    the   milk   quotas   constituted    an\n\nunconstitutional taking, and instead to dismiss the claims based on\n\nthe failure to demonstrate that whatever rights may have been\n\nviolated were \"clearly established,\" runs contrary the analysis\n\nrequired by the Supreme Court.\n\n               \"A court required to rule upon the qualified immunity\n\nissue must consider . . . this threshold question: Taken in the\n\nlight most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the\n\nfacts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional\n\nright?    This must be the initial inquiry.\"            Saucier v. Katz, 533\n\nU.S. 194, 201 (2001).       The Court explained the necessity of first\n\ndeciding whether the actions in question constituted a violation of\n\nthe plaintiff's constitutional rights:\n\n               In the course of determining whether a\n               constitutional right was violated on the\n               premises alleged, a court might find it\n               necessary to set forth principles which will\n               become the basis for a holding that a right is\n               clearly established. This is the process for\n               the law's elaboration from case to case, and\n               it is one reason for our insisting upon\n               turning to the existence or nonexistence of a\n               constitutional right as the first inquiry.\n               The law might be deprived of this explanation\n               were a court simply to skip ahead to the\n               question whether the law clearly established\n               that the officer's conduct was unlawful in the\n               circumstances of the case.\n\nId.      The    district   court   --    by    \"assuming   arguendo\"   that    a\n\nconstitutional violation had occurred -- was able to dismiss the\n\ncases without deciding whether the cancellation of appellants' milk\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fquotas did in fact constitute an unconstitutional taking of their\n\nproperty.      The problem with this methodology is that the law will\n\nbe no clearer when future similarly situated plaintiffs bring the\n\nsame claim.         This unending state of ambiguity, which potentially\n\nallows the bad man (in this context, a government official) to walk\n\nthe line time and time again, is precisely what the Supreme Court\n\ninstructs us to avoid.\n\n            Thus,        we   must    now     consider       whether    appellants'\n\nallegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation.                          See\n\nMihos, 358 F.3d at 98.            In this case, the essential facts are\n\nundisputed, and we have no difficulty in concluding that the\n\ncancellation        of   appellants'    milk     production         quota    did     not\n\nconstitute      a    taking    for    which    they    would     be    entitled      to\n\ncompensation. The quota cancellation was a sanction for González's\n\nmilk adulteration; it was not a taking of private property for\n\npublic use for which the federal Constitution requires compensation\n\nto be made.     See U.S. Const. amend. V (\"nor shall private property\n\nbe taken for public use, without just compensation\").                       We fail to\n\nsee how the cancellation of appellants' quotas as a consequence of\n\ntheir   milk    adulteration     is    different      from    any   other     fine   or\n\nforfeiture imposed under state law consequent to engaging in some\n\nharmful activity.\n\n            Appellants' claim is perhaps more aptly described as a\n\nclaim that the Puerto Rican government deprived them of their\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fpersonal property without due process of law.           In this vein,\n\nappellants argue that this sanction was not mandated, or even\n\npermissible, under Puerto Rico law.       Presumably, appellants have\n\navoided describing their argument in these terms because they have\n\nalready raised this argument in the Puerto Rico courts.       They are\n\nnow collaterally estopped from relitigating these issues in federal\n\ncourt.9   The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals rejected appellant\n\nGonzález's claim that ORIL lacked the authority to cancel his milk\n\nquotas, and found no evidence that the cancellation was arbitrary,\n\nillegal   or   an   abuse   of   discretion.    González-Álvarez,   No.\n\nKLRA0200084, Official Translation at 5.10      Thus, even if we were to\n\n\n9\n   \"The [Puerto Rico Supreme] Court has also found Article 1204 to\nencompass the doctrine of collateral estoppel, holding that when a\nfact essential to the prior judgment is actually litigated and\ndetermined by a valid and final judgment, the determination is\nconclusive in subsequent litigation among the parties.\"       Félix\nDavis v. Vieques Air Link, 892 F.2d 1122, 1124-25 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(citing Pereira v. Hernández, 83 P.R.R. 156, 161 (1961)).       The\ndistrict court found that collateral estoppel did not apply to\nappellants' takings claims, because the issue of compensation was\nnever raised in the previous proceedings. González-Álvarez, No.\n03-2193, slip op. at 4. See also Alfonso-Delgado, No. 03-1625,\nslip op at 6. However, we find that the most logical reading of\nthe opinions of the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals is that they\ndecided those cases on the well-founded assumption that appellants\nwould never receive any compensation for the cancelled quotas. See\nGonzález-Álvarez,    No.   KLRA0200084;   Alfonso   Delgado,    No.\nKLRA20020447. Nor does the inclusion of González's wife prevent\ncollateral estoppel, as we have found that her interest was\nadequately represented by her husband in the original Puerto Rico\ncourt action.\n10\n   The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals' decision in Alfonso Delgado,\nNo. KLRA20020447, reinforces our understanding of the court's\nreasoning in González-Álvarez, No. KLRA0200084. After considering\nappellant Alfonso's arguments, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals\n\n                                   -17-\n\fconstrue appellants' arguments in these due process terms, the key\n\nissues have already been litigated in the Puerto Rico courts, and\n\nit has been determined that the appellants' milk quotas were\n\ncancelled in accordance with Puerto Rico law.\n\n          For   these   reasons,   we     find   that   even   assuming   all\n\nallegations by appellants are true, defendant Pedró did not violate\n\nappellants' constitutional rights.          Thus, Pedró is entitled to\n\nqualified immunity, and the district court correctly dismissed\n\nappellants' claims on that basis.\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nheld that \"[t]he cancellation of the quotas . . . is the direct and\nunavoidable consequence of having permanently cancelled the license\nof a cattleman.\"    Alfonso Delgado, No. KLRA20020447, Certified\nTranslation at 9.\n\n                                   -18-\n\f",

U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV. We find no merit to these claims and affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#237;ctor Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez (\"Gonz&#225;lez\") and his wife Carmen Echevarr&#237;a-V&#233;lez (\"Echevarr&#237;a\") owned a dairy farm in Arecibo, Puerto Rico licensed by the Milk Industry Regulation Office (\"ORIL,\" in Spanish) through the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 1101, <i>et seq.</i> (2005). Luis Alfonso-Delgado (\"Alfonso\") and his wife Lydia Mora-Delgado (\"Mora\") also owned a dairy farm in Hatillo, Puerto Rico subject to the same licensing and regulatory regime. In separate incidents, Gonz&#225;lez and Alfonso were convicted of adulterating the milk they sold in an attempt to increase the volume they produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After their convictions, appellants Gonz&#225;lez and Alfonso lost their licenses to produce milk after ORIL administrative proceedings. They do not now contest this decision. However, ORIL also cancelled appellants' milk quotas. Under Puerto Rico's regulations of the dairy industry, dairy farmers' milk production is limited to the total quota which they have purchased from ORIL. A quota is \"the amount of milk quarts that the Administrator of the Milk Industry Regulation Office assigns to be produced every fourteen (14) days by cattlemen, in accordance to the market needs.\" <i>Milk Industry Quota Transaction Registry,</i> Law Number 301 of Sept. 1, 2000, Art. 1(c) (\"Law 301\"). After years of purchasing milk quotas through ORIL, by 2002 Gonz&#225;lez and Echevarr&#237;a had accumulated quotas authorizing them to produce up to 25,000 liters of milk every two weeks. Likewise, Alfonso and Mora had purchased milk quotas from ORIL authorizing them to produce up to 18,600 liters of milk every two weeks. Appellants contend that these quotas were their personal property and that they could not be taken from them without just compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that the milk quotas are currently sold at a rate of at least $32.00 per liter. Therefore, appellants Gonz&#225;lez and Echevarr&#237;a estimate that they are owed not less than $800,000, which they claim to be the fair market value of their quotas. Similarly, appellants Alfonso and Mora seek compensation of not less than $595,000 for their cancelled quotas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not reach the merits of the federal constitutional takings claims raised by either set of appellants. In the case of Alfonso and his wife, it found that their claims were time barred with regard to all defendants. In the case of Gonz&#225;lez and his wife, the district court found that the claims against certain defendants were barred by the statute of limitations and that the remaining defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Thus, appellants now seek review of two main issues: (1) whether the instant actions were filed within the relevant statute of limitations; and (2) whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. Because we agree with the district court that the claims of both sets of plaintiffs-appellants are precluded by the statute of limitations or qualified immunity, we affirm the decisions of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Statute of Limitations</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sets of appellants dispute the district court's findings that some or all of their claims are time-barred. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, we apply the forum state's statute of limitations period for personal injury actions. <i>See Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> 959 F.2d 349, 352 (1st Cir.1992). There is no dispute that in Puerto Rico the statute of limitations is one year, and that federal law is applied to determine when the limitations period begins to accrue. <i>See id.</i> at 353. Rather, both sets of appellants argue that the district court erred in its determination of the date on which the statute of limitations began to accrue. In addition, appellants argue that, under Puerto Rico law, the wives involved in these cases also possessed a property interest in the milk production quotas, and thus the statute of limitations could not begin to run until they were notified of the cancellation of the quotas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 2000, appellant Alfonso was convicted of milk adulteration to increase the volume of milk produced, and on July 12, 2000, Carlos Cab&#225;n-Nieves (\"Cab&#225;n\"), then Administrator of ORIL, issued an administrative ruling that revoked Alfonso's milk production license and quotas. Alfonso did not appeal this ruling, and on March 23, 2001, defendant Juan R. Pedr&#243;-Gordi&#225;n (\"Pedr&#243;\"), the new Administrator of ORIL, sent Alfonso a letter informing him that the July 2000 ruling would be implemented March 29, 2001. However, in the meantime, Alfonso had mistakenly been granted a new license, and on May 30, 2001, he filed a case with ORIL alleging that Pedr&#243; had no right to suspend his license, which ORIL denied in October 2001. Alfonso also appealed this case to the Puerto Rico Appeals Court, which upheld the ORIL decision. <i>Alfonso Delgado v. Pedr&#243;-Gordi&#225;n,</i> No. KLRA20020447 (T.C.A. Aug. 20, 2002). Meanwhile, on May 14, 2002, Pedr&#243; mailed a letter to Alfonso notifying him that the cancellation would become effective June 5, 2002. Alfonso and his wife Mora filed the complaint in the instant case on July 7, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Gonz&#225;lez was also convicted in 2000 of milk adulteration to increase the volume of milk produced, and on December 21, 2001, ORIL Administrator Pedr&#243; issued an administrative ruling revoking Gonz&#225;lez's milk production license and quotas. Gonz&#225;lez appealed this ruling to the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals, <i>Milk Quality Program of the Milk Industry Regulation Office v. Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez,</i> No. KLRA0200084, 2002 WL 1304143 (T.C.A. Apr. 26, 2002), and then to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. On September 27, 2002 his request for reconsideration by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court was denied. Appellants Gonz&#225;lez and Echevarr&#237;a filed the complaint commencing this action on November 5, 2003. Appellants Gonz&#225;lez and Echevarr&#237;a argue that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until November 6, 2002, the date on which the manufacturing plant ceased picking up milk from their dairy farm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a &#167; 1983 claim, the statute of limitations generally begins to run \"when the plaintiff `knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis for the claim.'\" <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Garc&#237;a v.Municipality of Caguas,</i> 354 F.3d 91, 96-97 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Rodr&#237;guez-N&#225;rvaez v. Nazario,</i> 895 F.2d 38, 41 n. 5 (1st Cir.1990)). Among the precedent established by the Supreme Court, we find no indication that property must be physically seized or that actual economic harm must have already been felt before a takings claim accrues. In the context of regulatory takings, for instance, the Supreme Court has held that such claims are ripe when the plaintiff has received \"a `final decision regarding the application of the [challenged] regulations to the property at issue' from `the government entity charged with implementing the regulations,'\" and the plaintiff has sought compensation through the procedure provided by the state. <i>Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency,</i> 520 U.S. 725, 734, 117 S.Ct. 1659, 137 L.Ed.2d 980 (1997) (quoting <i>Williamson County Reg'l Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City,</i> 473 U.S. 172, 186, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985)). Since in this case, the state has always clearly denied that any compensation would be due and there is no state remedy available for seeking compensation, the second hurdle falls away. <i>See Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194-96, 105 S.Ct. 3108.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sets of appellants argue that the statute of limitations could not begin to run until the date on which the milk manufacturing plant actually discontinued picking up appellants' milk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> However, after the quotas were cancelled by ORIL, appellants were simply waiting for the decision to be enforced. In this case, a quota is simply the right to sell a given amount of milk. Assuming that that legal right is \"property,\" when ORIL issued its decision cancelling appellants' quotas, appellants were already deprived of the property at issue, and the statute of limitations began to run as of that date. <i>Cf. Suitum,</i> 520 U.S. at 736 n. 10, 117 S.Ct. 1659 (finding that facial challenges to regulation are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation is passed, so long as the owners can demonstrate that the enactment deprived them of any economically viable use of the property). Because we find that Alfonso and his wife \"[knew], or ha[d] reason to know of the injury which is the basis for his claim,\" <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 354 F.3d at 96-97, on July 12, 2000, when ORIL issued its administrative decision revoking Alfonso's license, this action filed July 7, 2003 was commenced beyond the one-year statute of limitations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons, we find that the statute of limitations began to run for the claims brought by Gonz&#225;lez and his wife on December 21, 2001, when ORIL issued its administrative decision revoking Gonz&#225;lez's license.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This action filed November 5, 2003 would then clearly be beyond the one-year statute of limitations. However, in this case, the district court found &#8212; and it is unchallenged by any party &#8212; that the statute of limitations was tolled as to defendant Pedr&#243;, in his personal capacity, and his wife, Lizet Qui&#241;ones, by an action filed by Gonz&#225;lez in bankruptcy court in the interim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, the instant federal action was timely filed against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that Gonz&#225;lez's bankruptcy court complaint should have also tolled the statute of limitations with respect to Secretary of Agriculture Rivero Cubano and his wife. We disagree. Appellants argue that because Rivero Cubano was included in his official capacity as a defendant in the bankruptcy complaint, the statute of limitations was tolled for actions against him in his personal capacity as well. Whereas Gonz&#225;lez and his wife named appellee Pedr&#243; in his personal capacity, they chose to name appellee Rivero Cubano only in his official capacity as Secretary of Agriculture. Furthermore, the portion of the complaint that alleges possible 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 allegations refers only to appellee Pedr&#243;. In general, \"defendants sued only in their official capacities in the original complaint cannot be expected to be on notice of the very different issues raised by claims against them in their personal capacities.\" <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 354 F.3d at 100 (finding that defendants sued only in their official capacity would not be on notice, but that, in this case, defendants waived any objection to the statute of limitations on that basis). We therefore affirm the district court's conclusion that the claims against defendants Rivero Cubano and his wife are time barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another argument implicit in appellants' claims is that, although appellants were aware that the milk quotas were cancelled, it was not until much later that they discovered that ORIL did not plan to pay them just compensation. We find this argument entirely unconvincing. Although there may be cases in which a person could reasonably be uncertain about whether they were going to receive compensation for their taken property, this is not such a case. Appellants were well aware that the cancellation of their milk quotas was a direct result of their milk adulteration, and as such, they could not have reasonably expected compensation, where no mention of compensation was made. Had the government planned on compensating appellants for their quotas, it would have said so. <i>See Hair v. United States,</i> 350 F.3d 1253, 1261 (Fed.Cir.2003) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that the government must clearly announce its intention not to pay compensation before the statute of limitations can begin to run, and recognizing that it is generally obvious when the government denies liability for its action). To accept appellants' argument would allow the government to prevent a cause of action from accruing simply by failing to state explicitly that it does not plan to pay compensation. <i>See id.</i> This cannot be the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, both sets of appellants argue that even if the statute of limitations began to run on the dates determined by the district court with respect to the claims brought by Alfonso and Gonz&#225;lez, the same cannot be said of their wives' claims, because they were not provided notice of the cancellation of their husbands' licenses and the milk quotas. However, we find that, under Puerto Rico law, separate notice is not required to both the husband and wife in a conjugal partnership. <i>Cf. Blas v. Hospital Guadalupe,</i> 146 D.P.R. 267, 304 (1998) (finding that each spouse is a co-administrator of the conjugal partnership, and as such, each ordinarily has the capacity to represent it); <i>Pauneto v. N&#250;&#241;ez,</i> 115 D.P.R. 591, 594 (1984) (recognizing that jurisdiction may be acquired over the conjugal partnership by service of one of the co-administrators). We, therefore, find that upon their husbands' receipt of notice of the quota cancellation, the statute of limitations began to run for actions brought by both the husbands and their wives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, as we concluded above, only Gonz&#225;lez's and Echevarr&#237;a's claims against defendant Pedr&#243; and his wife were timely filed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Qualified Immunity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having already concluded that all other claims in this consolidated appeal are time barred, we now consider appellants Gonz&#225;lez's and Echevarr&#237;a's claims against defendants Pedr&#243; and his wife, who assert the defense of qualified immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> \"For a plaintiff to overcome a qualified immunity defense, he must show [1] that his allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation; [2] that the right was clearly established; and [3] that a reasonable official would have known that his actions violated the constitutional right at issue.\" <i>Mihos v. Swift,</i> 358 F.3d 91, 98-99 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the opinion from which this appeal arises, the district court essentially skipped over the first inquiry in order to reach the subsequent queries, which it found decisive. The court reasoned that \"even assuming <i>arguendo,</i> that constitutional rights were violated, . . . it was objecti[vely] reasonable for Pedr&#243; to believe that his actions did not violate these clearly established rights.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez v. Rivero Cubano,</i> No. 03-2193, slip op. at 7 (D.P.R. July 23, 2004). Although we recognize the logic of this approach, the court's election to forego deciding whether the cancellation of the milk quotas constituted an unconstitutional taking, and instead to dismiss the claims based on the failure to demonstrate that whatever rights may have been violated were \"clearly established,\" runs contrary the analysis required by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider . . . this threshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right? This must be the initial inquiry.\" <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). The Court explained the necessity of first deciding whether the actions in question constituted a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of determining whether a constitutional right was violated on the premises alleged, a court might find it necessary to set forth principles which will become the basis for a holding that a right is clearly established. This is the process for the law's elaboration from case to case, and it is one reason for our insisting upon turning to the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional right as the first inquiry. The law might be deprived of this explanation were a court simply to skip ahead to the question whether the law clearly established that the officer's conduct was unlawful in the circumstances of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> The district court &#8212; by \"assuming <i>arguendo</i>\" that a constitutional violation had occurred &#8212; was able to dismiss the cases without deciding whether the cancellation of appellants' milk quotas did in fact constitute an unconstitutional taking of their property. The problem with this methodology is that the law will be no clearer when future similarly situated plaintiffs bring the same claim. This unending state of ambiguity, which potentially allows the bad man (in this context, a government official) to walk the line time and time again, is precisely what the Supreme Court instructs us to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we must now consider whether appellants' allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation. <i>See Mihos,</i> 358 F.3d at 98. In this case, the essential facts are undisputed, and we have no difficulty in concluding that the cancellation of appellants' milk production quota did not constitute a taking for which they would be entitled to compensation. The quota cancellation was a sanction for Gonz&#225;lez's milk adulteration; it was not a taking of private property <i>for public use</i> for which the federal Constitution requires compensation to be made. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. V (\"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\"). We fail to see how the cancellation of appellants' quotas as a consequence of their milk adulteration is different from any other fine or forfeiture imposed under state law consequent to engaging in some harmful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' claim is perhaps more aptly described as a claim that the Puerto Rican government deprived them of their personal property without due process of law. In this vein, appellants argue that this sanction was not mandated, or even permissible, under Puerto Rico law. Presumably, appellants have avoided describing their argument in these terms because they have already raised this argument in the Puerto Rico courts. They are now collaterally estopped from relitigating these issues in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals rejected appellant Gonz&#225;lez's claim that ORIL lacked the authority to cancel his milk quotas, and found no evidence that the cancellation was arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion. <i>Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez,</i> No. KLRA0200084, 2002 WL 1304143, Official Translation at 5.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Thus, even if we were to construe appellants' arguments in these due process terms, the key issues have already been litigated in the Puerto Rico courts, and it has been determined that the appellants' milk quotas were cancelled in accordance with Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find that even assuming all allegations by appellants are true, defendant Pedr&#243; did not violate appellants' constitutional rights. Thus, Pedr&#243; is entitled to qualified immunity, and the district court correctly dismissed appellants' claims on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellants cite to a number of cases that miss the mark. In support of their theory, plaintiffs cite to<i>Lawson v. Shelby County,</i> 211 F.3d 331 (6th Cir.2000), in which the plaintiffs asserted a deprivation of their right to vote. The Sixth Circuit held that plaintiffs \"were not denied the right to vote when they were notified that their registrations had been rejected, they were denied the right to vote when they presented themselves at the appropriate polling place and were denied access to the voting booth.\" <i>Id.</i> at 336. In this case, by contrast, the deprivation at issue occurred when the plaintiffs' milk quotas were cancelled (i.e., when the alleged \"taking\" occurred), not when the milk collection actually was suspended.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ramos v. Rom&#225;n,</i> 83 F.Supp.2d 233 (D.P.R.2000) is no more helpful to plaintiffs. In <i>Ramos,</i> the issue was not whether the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiffs' license to sell firearms was revoked or when the weapons were actually confiscated (both of which were outside the statute of limitations). Rather, the question was whether the limitations period did not commence until much later, when the plaintiffs learned that the license revocation and the confiscation were motivated by political discrimination. The district court concluded that \"the Plaintiffs['] action accrued the day the police effectuated the confiscation of plaintiffs' firearms and ammunition pursuant to the Department of Treasury's revocation of the Plaintiffs' license to sell firearms.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239. Immediately after reaching this conclusion, the court cited a case in which the First Circuit \"assume[d] <i>arguendo</i> that [the plaintiff's] claim accrued at the latest possible date.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239 n.6 (quoting <i>Ben&#237;tez-Pons v. Commonwealth of P.R.,</i> 136 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir.1998)). In short, the <i>Ramos</i> court did not hold that the claim accrued when the weapons were confiscated, as opposed to when the license was revoked; it held that the claim accrued at one of these earlier dates (assuming arguendo that it was the latter of the two), as opposed to two decades later, when the plaintiffs learned the reason for the revocation. <i>Ramos</i> therefore does not stand for the proposition that the plaintiffs' milk quotas were not \"taken\" until milk collection was actually suspended.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellants' later challenges to the cancellation of the quotas do not toll the statute of limitations. Under Puerto Rico law, in order for tolling to occur, the remedies sought in both suits must be identical<i>See Torres v. Superintendent of Police,</i> 893 F.2d 404, 407 (1st Cir.1990).

In that case, the court also concluded that \"even assuming <i>arguendo,</i> that constitutional rights were violated, summary judgment should be granted on qualified immunity grounds.\" <i>Id.</i> For the reasons we will explain with regard to the district court's opinion in <i>Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez,</i> No. 03-2193, slip op. at 7, we reject this approach.

U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV. We find no merit to these claims and affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#237;ctor Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez (\"Gonz&#225;lez\") and his wife Carmen Echevarr&#237;a-V&#233;lez (\"Echevarr&#237;a\") owned a dairy farm in Arecibo, Puerto Rico licensed by the Milk Industry Regulation Office (\"ORIL,\" in Spanish) through the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 1101, <i>et seq.</i> (2005). Luis Alfonso-Delgado (\"Alfonso\") and his wife Lydia Mora-Delgado (\"Mora\") also owned a dairy farm in Hatillo, Puerto Rico subject to the same licensing and regulatory regime. In separate incidents, Gonz&#225;lez and Alfonso were convicted of adulterating the milk they sold in an attempt to increase the volume they produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After their convictions, appellants Gonz&#225;lez and Alfonso lost their licenses to produce milk after ORIL administrative proceedings. They do not now contest this decision. However, ORIL also cancelled appellants' milk quotas. Under Puerto Rico's regulations of the dairy industry, dairy farmers' milk production is limited to the total quota which they have purchased from ORIL. A quota is \"the amount of milk quarts that the Administrator of the Milk Industry Regulation Office assigns to be produced every fourteen (14) days by cattlemen, in accordance to the market needs.\" <i>Milk Industry Quota Transaction Registry,</i> Law Number 301 of Sept. 1, 2000, Art. 1(c) (\"Law 301\"). After years of purchasing milk quotas through ORIL, by 2002 Gonz&#225;lez and Echevarr&#237;a had accumulated quotas authorizing them to produce up to 25,000 liters of milk every two weeks. Likewise, Alfonso and Mora had purchased milk quotas from ORIL authorizing them to produce up to 18,600 liters of milk every two weeks. Appellants contend that these quotas were their personal property and that they could not be taken from them without just compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that the milk quotas are currently sold at a rate of at least $32.00 per liter. Therefore, appellants Gonz&#225;lez and Echevarr&#237;a estimate that they are owed not less than $800,000, which they claim to be the fair market value of their quotas. Similarly, appellants Alfonso and Mora seek compensation of not less than $595,000 for their cancelled quotas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not reach the merits of the federal constitutional takings claims raised by either set of appellants. In the case of Alfonso and his wife, it found that their claims were time barred with regard to all defendants. In the case of Gonz&#225;lez and his wife, the district court found that the claims against certain defendants were barred by the statute of limitations and that the remaining defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Thus, appellants now seek review of two main issues: (1) whether the instant actions were filed within the relevant statute of limitations; and (2) whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. Because we agree with the district court that the claims of both sets of plaintiffs-appellants are precluded by the statute of limitations or qualified immunity, we affirm the decisions of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Statute of Limitations</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sets of appellants dispute the district court's findings that some or all of their claims are time-barred. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, we apply the forum state's statute of limitations period for personal injury actions. <i>See Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 352 (1st Cir.1992). There is no dispute that in Puerto Rico the statute of limitations is one year, and that federal law is applied to determine when the limitations period begins to accrue. <i>See id.</i> at 353. Rather, both sets of appellants argue that the district court erred in its determination of the date on which the statute of limitations began to accrue. In addition, appellants argue that, under Puerto Rico law, the wives involved in these cases also possessed a property interest in the milk production quotas, and thus the statute of limitations could not begin to run until they were notified of the cancellation of the quotas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 2000, appellant Alfonso was convicted of milk adulteration to increase the volume of milk produced, and on July 12, 2000, Carlos Cab&#225;n-Nieves (\"Cab&#225;n\"), then Administrator of ORIL, issued an administrative ruling that revoked Alfonso's milk production license and quotas. Alfonso did not appeal this ruling, and on March 23, 2001, defendant Juan R. Pedr&#243;-Gordi&#225;n (\"Pedr&#243;\"), the new Administrator of ORIL, sent Alfonso a letter informing him that the July 2000 ruling would be implemented March 29, 2001. However, in the meantime, Alfonso had mistakenly been granted a new license, and on May 30, 2001, he filed a case with ORIL alleging that Pedr&#243; had no right to suspend his license, which ORIL denied in October 2001. Alfonso also appealed this case to the Puerto Rico Appeals Court, which upheld the ORIL decision. <i>Alfonso Delgado v. Pedr&#243;-Gordi&#225;n,</i> No. KLRA20020447 (T.C.A. Aug. 20, 2002). Meanwhile, on May 14, 2002, Pedr&#243; mailed a letter to Alfonso notifying him that the cancellation would become effective June 5, 2002. Alfonso and his wife Mora filed the complaint in the instant case on July 7, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Gonz&#225;lez was also convicted in 2000 of milk adulteration to increase the volume of milk produced, and on December 21, 2001, ORIL Administrator Pedr&#243; issued an administrative ruling revoking Gonz&#225;lez's milk production license and quotas. Gonz&#225;lez appealed this ruling to the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals, <i>Milk Quality Program of the Milk Industry Regulation Office v.

We disagree. Appellants argue that because Rivero Cubano was included in his official capacity as a defendant in the bankruptcy complaint, the statute of limitations was tolled for actions against him in his personal capacity as well. Whereas Gonz&#225;lez and his wife named appellee Pedr&#243; in his personal capacity, they chose to name appellee Rivero Cubano only in his official capacity as Secretary of Agriculture. Furthermore, the portion of the complaint that alleges possible 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 allegations refers only to appellee Pedr&#243;. In general, \"defendants sued only in their official capacities in the original complaint cannot be expected to be on notice of the very different issues raised by claims against them in their personal capacities.\" <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Garc&#237;a,</i> 354 F.3d at 100 (finding that defendants sued only in their official capacity would not be on notice, but that, in this case, defendants waived any objection to the statute of limitations on that basis).

We find this argument entirely unconvincing. Although there may be cases in which a person could reasonably be uncertain about whether they were going to receive compensation for their taken property, this is not such a case. Appellants were well aware that the cancellation of their milk quotas was a direct result of their milk adulteration, and as such, they could not have reasonably expected compensation, where no mention of compensation was made. Had the government planned on compensating appellants for their quotas, it would have said so. <i>See Hair v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784341\"><a href=\"/opinion/784341/gilbert-m-hair-and-ethel-blaine-millett-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-all/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1253</span></a></span>, 1261 (Fed.Cir.2003) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that the government must clearly announce its intention not to pay compensation before the statute of limitations can begin to run, and recognizing that it is generally obvious when the government denies liability for its action). To accept appellants' argument would allow the government to prevent a cause of action from accruing simply by failing to state explicitly that it does not plan to pay compensation. <i>See id.</i> This cannot be the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, both sets of appellants argue that even if the statute of limitations began to run on the dates determined by the district court with respect to the claims brought by Alfonso and Gonz&#225;lez, the same cannot be said of their wives' claims, because they were not provided notice of the cancellation of their husbands' licenses and the milk quotas. However, we find that, under Puerto Rico law, separate notice is not required to both the husband and wife in a conjugal partnership. <i>Cf. Blas v. Hospital Guadalupe,</i> 146 D.P.R. 267, 304 (1998) (finding that each spouse is a co-administrator of the conjugal partnership, and as such, each ordinarily has the capacity to represent it); <i>Pauneto v.

We, therefore, find that upon their husbands' receipt of notice of the quota cancellation, the statute of limitations began to run for actions brought by both the husbands and their wives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, as we concluded above, only Gonz&#225;lez's and Echevarr&#237;a's claims against defendant Pedr&#243; and his wife were timely filed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Qualified Immunity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having already concluded that all other claims in this consolidated appeal are time barred, we now consider appellants Gonz&#225;lez's and Echevarr&#237;a's claims against defendants Pedr&#243; and his wife, who assert the defense of qualified immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> \"For a plaintiff to overcome a qualified immunity defense, he must show [1] that his allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation; [2] that the right was clearly established; and [3] that a reasonable official would have known that his actions violated the constitutional right at issue.\" <i>Mihos v.

Although we recognize the logic of this approach, the court's election to forego deciding whether the cancellation of the milk quotas constituted an unconstitutional taking, and instead to dismiss the claims based on the failure to demonstrate that whatever rights may have been violated were \"clearly established,\" runs contrary the analysis required by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider . . . this threshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?

This is the process for the law's elaboration from case to case, and it is one reason for our insisting upon turning to the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional right as the first inquiry. The law might be deprived of this explanation were a court simply to skip ahead to the question whether the law clearly established that the officer's conduct was unlawful in the circumstances of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> The district court &#8212; by \"assuming <i>arguendo</i>\" that a constitutional violation had occurred &#8212; was able to dismiss the cases without deciding whether the cancellation of appellants' milk quotas did in fact constitute an unconstitutional taking of their property. The problem with this methodology is that the law will be no clearer when future similarly situated plaintiffs bring the same claim. This unending state of ambiguity, which potentially allows the bad man (in this context, a government official) to walk the line time and time again, is precisely what the Supreme Court instructs us to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we must now consider whether appellants' allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation. <i>See Mihos,</i> 358 F.3d at 98. In this case, the essential facts are undisputed, and we have no difficulty in concluding that the cancellation of appellants' milk production quota did not constitute a taking for which they would be entitled to compensation. The quota cancellation was a sanction for Gonz&#225;lez's milk adulteration; it was not a taking of private property <i>for public use</i> for which the federal Constitution requires compensation to be made. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. V (\"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\"). We fail to see how the cancellation of appellants' quotas as a consequence of their milk adulteration is different from any other fine or forfeiture imposed under state law consequent to engaging in some harmful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' claim is perhaps more aptly described as a claim that the Puerto Rican government deprived them of their personal property without due process of law. In this vein, appellants argue that this sanction was not mandated, or even permissible, under Puerto Rico law. Presumably, appellants have avoided describing their argument in these terms because they have already raised this argument in the Puerto Rico courts. They are now collaterally estopped from relitigating these issues in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals rejected appellant Gonz&#225;lez's claim that ORIL lacked the authority to cancel his milk quotas, and found no evidence that the cancellation was arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion. <i>Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez,</i> No. KLRA0200084, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1304143</span></span>, Official Translation at 5.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Thus, even if we were to construe appellants' arguments in these due process terms, the key issues have already been litigated in the Puerto Rico courts, and it has been determined that the appellants' milk quotas were cancelled in accordance with Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find that even assuming all allegations by appellants are true, defendant Pedr&#243; did not violate appellants' constitutional rights.

The Sixth Circuit held that plaintiffs \"were not denied the right to vote when they were notified that their registrations had been rejected, they were denied the right to vote when they presented themselves at the appropriate polling place and were denied access to the voting booth.\" <i>Id.</i> at 336. In this case, by contrast, the deprivation at issue occurred when the plaintiffs' milk quotas were cancelled (i.e., when the alleged \"taking\" occurred), not when the milk collection actually was suspended.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ramos v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2000) is no more helpful to plaintiffs. In <i>Ramos,</i> the issue was not whether the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiffs' license to sell firearms was revoked or when the weapons were actually confiscated (both of which were outside the statute of limitations). Rather, the question was whether the limitations period did not commence until much later, when the plaintiffs learned that the license revocation and the confiscation were motivated by political discrimination. The district court concluded that \"the Plaintiffs['] action accrued the day the police effectuated the confiscation of plaintiffs' firearms and ammunition pursuant to the Department of Treasury's revocation of the Plaintiffs' license to sell firearms.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239. Immediately after reaching this conclusion, the court cited a case in which the First Circuit \"assume[d] <i>arguendo</i> that [the plaintiff's] claim accrued at the latest possible date.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239 n.6 (quoting <i>Ben&#237;tez-Pons v.

In short, the <i>Ramos</i> court did not hold that the claim accrued when the weapons were confiscated, as opposed to when the license was revoked; it held that the claim accrued at one of these earlier dates (assuming arguendo that it was the latter of the two), as opposed to two decades later, when the plaintiffs learned the reason for the revocation. <i>Ramos</i> therefore does not stand for the proposition that the plaintiffs' milk quotas were not \"taken\" until milk collection was actually suspended.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellants' later challenges to the cancellation of the quotas do not toll the statute of limitations.
