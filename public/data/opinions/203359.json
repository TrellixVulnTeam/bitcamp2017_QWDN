Plaintiffs, lessees of new cars\n\nproduced by defendant manufacturers, appeal the dismissal of their\n\nputative class action lawsuit in which they seek antitrust damages\n\nunder section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and section 4 of\n\nthe Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15.             See In re New Motor Vehicles\n\nCanadian Exp. Antitrust Litig. (Motor Vehicles II), 490 F. Supp. 2d\n\n13 (D. Me. 2007).     Plaintiffs allege that defendant manufacturers\n\nconspired to restrict the flow of cheaper Canadian cars into the\n\nU.S. market (when the U.S. dollar enjoyed a favorable exchange\n\nrate),   resulting    in    artificially      high   rental     payments   under\n\nplaintiffs'   lease   agreements       in    the   United   States.      Because\n\nplaintiffs are indirect purchasers, they lack standing to sue under\n\nsection 4 of the Clayton Act and their suit was correctly dismissed\n\nunder the rule of Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720\n\n(1977), and Kansas v. UtiliCorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199 (1990).\n\n                                       I.\n\n           This    case    arises     out    of    the   same    multi-district\n\nlitigation (\"MDL\") as another case recently before this court. See\n\nIn re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig. (Motor\n\nVehicles   III),   522     F.3d   6   (1st   Cir.    2008),     from   which   the\n\nbackground facts can be gleaned.            See id. at 9-11.\n\n           Briefly, appellants assert that Canadian and U.S. car\n\nmanufacturers conspired to prevent cheaper Canadian cars from\n\nentering the U.S. market during a time when the U.S. dollar was\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fmuch stronger than the Canadian dollar (roughly 2001 to 2003).\n\nThis allegedly allowed the manufacturers and their captive leasing\n\ncompanies, two of which are also named as defendants, to maintain\n\nartificially high prices for new cars in the United States.\n\n          The district court held in an earlier decision that a\n\nputative MDL plaintiff class containing both purchasers and lessees\n\nof new cars could not seek antitrust damages under federal law\n\nbecause they were indirect purchasers under the rule of Illinois\n\nBrick.   In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig.\n\n(Motor Vehicles I), 307 F. Supp. 2d 136, 137 (D. Me. 2004).      At\n\nthat time, the district court noted that future plaintiffs could\n\npotentially avoid the Illinois Brick bar by \"join[ing] as named\n\ndefendants the dealers from whom they purchased or leased and\n\nprov[ing] that those dealers joined in the conspiracy.\"    Id.   In\n\nthe cases now before us (which were more recently transferred from\n\nOhio to the district court), plaintiffs are all lessees, not\n\npurchasers.   They rely on that distinction in an attempt to\n\ncircumvent the Illinois Brick hurdle.    The district court found\n\nthis effort unavailing and dismissed their claim, holding that they\n\nwere also indirect purchasers.   Motor Vehicles II, 490 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 17.\n\n          Our review of dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) is de novo.\n\nMorales-Tañon v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth., 524 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).   We describe the Supreme Court law on indirect purchasers\n\n                                 -4-\n\fbefore turning to the mechanics of automobile leasing arrangements\n\nand their implications for plaintiffs' standing to sue under the\n\nClayton Act. The plaintiffs rely heavily on an inapposite district\n\ncourt opinion and also attempt to recharacterize what they pled in\n\ntheir complaint.    Both efforts fail.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           In Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392\n\nU.S. 481 (1968), a manufacturer sued United Shoe, the lessor of its\n\nmanufacturing equipment, under section 4 of the Clayton Act.\n\nUnited Shoe, in turn, asserted a \"passing-on\" defense, arguing that\n\nHanover Shoe would have passed some of the alleged overcharge on to\n\nits customers and thus should not be allowed to recover the full\n\namount of the antitrust injury.      Id. at 487-88.    The Court rejected\n\nthat argument because of the impracticality of apportioning the\n\ndamages between direct purchasers (like Hanover Shoe) and any\n\nsubsequent, \"indirect\" purchasers (like Hanover Shoe's customers).\n\nId. at 492-93.    The Court also articulated a concern that allowing\n\napportionment would dilute the incentive for any one plaintiff to\n\nbring   suit,   weakening   the   effectiveness   of   private   antitrust\n\nenforcement under section 4.       Id. at 494.\n\n           The Court reaffirmed this rule in Illinois Brick and\n\nexpanded it to cover plaintiffs as well: if defendants could not\n\nrely on passing-on defenses, purchasers could not seek to recover\n\nwhen their injury depended upon passing-on theories.         Ill. Brick,\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f431 U.S. at 735, 737.       In other words, indirect purchasers cannot\n\nrecover damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act.              This bright-\n\nline rule was necessary, the Court reasoned, to prevent multiple\n\nrecoveries (by both direct and indirect purchasers) and to avoid\n\nthe complexity and difficulty of apportioning damages. Id. at 730-\n\n32,     737.      While   recognizing       that   \"these   difficulties   and\n\nuncertainties will be less substantial in some contexts than in\n\nothers,\" the Court refused to create exceptions to the rule for\n\nparticular types of markets.          Id. at 743-44.\n\n               UtiliCorp put teeth into the Court's refusal to carve out\n\nexceptions to the Illinois Brick rule.             Confronted by a situation\n\nwhere plaintiffs alleged that the direct purchaser would pass all\n\nof the illegal overcharge on to its consumers, the Court still\n\nrefused to allow the indirect purchasers to seek antitrust damages.\n\nUtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 208.           The Court determined that assuming a\n\ncomplete passing-on by the direct purchaser was inappropriate\n\nbecause a direct purchaser could potentially have raised prices\n\nirrespective of the overcharge.             Id. at 209-10.     The Court also\n\npointed out other ways in which the direct purchaser could be hurt\n\nby the antitrust activity, such as by a delay in implementing the\n\nprice    increases.       See   id.    at   210.    Further,   the   UtiliCorp\n\nlitigation itself demonstrated that determining when an Illinois\n\nBrick exception is truly justified would generate the type of\n\ncomplicated and costly litigation that the Illinois Brick rule was\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fmeant to avoid.     Id. at 216-17.       For this reason, the Court\n\nconcluded, \"even assuming that any economic assumptions underlying\n\nthe Illinois Brick rule might be disproved in a specific case, we\n\nthink it an unwarranted and counterproductive exercise to litigate\n\na series of exceptions.\"   Id. at 217.\n\n                                III.\n\n           Given this bright-line rule, plaintiffs' case depends on\n\nestablishing that they are direct rather than indirect purchasers.\n\nPlaintiffs assert vigorously that their case is almost identical to\n\nthat of In re Mercedes-Benz Antitrust Litigation, 364 F. Supp. 2d\n\n468 (D.N.J. 2005), in which the district court declined to dismiss\n\na class action brought by lessees against a car manufacturer and\n\nits dealers because the court determined that the lessees were\n\ndirect purchasers under Illinois Brick.      Whether or not we would\n\nreach the same conclusion as was reached in that case, it is easily\n\ndistinguishable.    To understand why, one must understand the\n\nmechanics of automobile leasing arrangements.\n\n           Generally in leasing arrangements, dealers buy the car\n\nfrom the manufacturer, negotiate the purchase price and contract\n\nterms directly with the lessee, and execute the lease.   Id. at 472-\n\n73.   A leasing company then pays the full purchase price of the car\n\nto the dealer in exchange for the lease, and thereafter the lessee\n\nmakes monthly payments to the leasing company.     Id. at 473.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            The lessee does not deal directly with the leasing\n\ncompany until after the lease is executed and the leasing company\n\nhas paid the purchase price to the dealer.        Id. at 473, 481.        While\n\nleasing companies do set certain parameters for lease arrangements\n\ndepending on the brand and model of car, dealers maneuver around\n\nthe effects of those set rates by negotiating lower purchase\n\nprices, adding options at no additional cost, or agreeing to allow\n\nmore than market value for a trade-in vehicle.               Id. at 471-72.\n\nThere is thus \"no substantive difference\" between a negotiation for\n\nthe direct purchase of a car and the negotiation of a lease.               Id.\n\nat 474.\n\n            In Mercedes-Benz, plaintiff-lessees alleged that a car\n\nmanufacturer (Mercedes-Benz) directly conspired with its dealers in\n\nthe greater New York City area to set the price of cars sold to\n\ncustomers.   Id. at 469.     The defendants in that case included both\n\nthe   manufacturer   and    individual     dealers.      Because   plaintiffs\n\nalleged a vertical conspiracy involving both the dealers and the\n\nmanufacturers, the court concluded that the dealers' customers were\n\ndirect purchasers and had standing to sue for antitrust injuries\n\nunder the Clayton Act.      Id. at 482.\n\n            The court's concern in that case was the risk of double\n\nrecovery.      Because     leasing   companies    were    paying    the   full\n\n(inflated) purchase price of the cars to the defendant dealers,\n\nthey, too, could be considered direct purchasers.           Id. at 478.    The\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fMercedes-Benz court concluded, however, that the lessees and the\n\nleasing companies suffered distinct injuries -- higher monthly\n\npayments for the use of the cars for lessees versus higher purchase\n\nprices for the ownership of the cars for the leasing companies --\n\nso that even if both sets of direct purchasers were to sue, they\n\nwould recover different damages.   Id. at 480, 482; see also id. at\n\n479 (discussing Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 475\n\n(1982)).\n\n           There is a significant difference between Mercedes-Benz\n\nand this case: plaintiffs here did not join dealers as defendants,\n\nnor did they plead sufficiently or argue consistently that dealers\n\nwere part of the conspiracy.       Instead, plaintiffs' complaints\n\ndescribe a horizontal conspiracy among the manufacturers that\n\nadversely affected dealers as well as the ultimate consumers.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged in their complaints -- and repeat in their\n\nappellate brief -- that because of the manufacturers' conspiracy,\n\ndealers paid higher prices for their inventory.     Because dealers\n\nnegotiate price and lease terms directly with lessees, any higher\n\nprices paid by dealers to manufacturers would have trickled down\n\ninto the lease terms for plaintiff lessees; the leasing companies,\n\nco-conspirators or not, had limited influence on the amount of the\n\nlessees' monthly payments.1   The dealers in the case before us were\n\n\n     1\n          Thus joining a few leasing companies, even if those\nlessors were alleged to be part of the conspiracy, does not solve\nthe problem.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthe direct purchasers; they were \"the immediate buyers from the\n\nalleged antitrust violators,\" not the lessees. UtiliCorp, 497 U.S.\n\nat 207.\n\n           Before    this    court,     plaintiffs'      arguments   take    on\n\nqualities reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass.\n\nPlaintiffs try to re-frame their allegations as one of \"vertical\n\nconspiracy,\" claiming that \"[t]he dealers did not pay an overcharge\n\nto   manufacturers   and    pass   it   on   to   the   consumers\"   and    that\n\n\"[c]onsumers do not claim that they suffered damage because the\n\ndealers passed-on any anti-competitive pricing or other overcharges\n\nfrom the wholesale to the retail level.\" This approach contradicts\n\ntheir fact-pleading.\n\n           In their complaints, plaintiffs do refer at times to\n\ndealers as members of the conspiracy, but these references were\n\nprimarily to Canadian dealers, not to the U.S. dealers who actually\n\nnegotiated the leases. More importantly, those passing and general\n\nallusions are contradicted and outweighed by plaintiffs' clear\n\nallegations in the complaints that dealers also paid higher prices\n\ndue to the conspiracy. Examples from their complaints include that\n\nthe defendant manufacturers \"charged their dealers in the United\n\nStates 10-30% more for their motor vehicles than they charge[d]\n\ntheir Canadian dealers,\" and, in the very first paragraph of both\n\ncomplaints, that \"dealers were charged noncompetitive prices by the\n\nAutomobile Companies and passed that extra charge to [plaintiffs].\"\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f              Plaintiffs try to distance themselves from their own\n\ncomplaints by explaining that they copied the \"passing-on\" language\n\nfrom the briefs of other MDL plaintiffs, but that explanation\n\ncarries      no   legal   significance.            What    matters   here   is    what\n\nplaintiffs pled in their complaints, and the facts alleged in those\n\ncomplaints contradict the existence of a vertical conspiracy. See,\n\ne.g., Global NAPs, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 336 F.3d 59, 66 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (\"[W]e cannot credit a theory of [recovery] that flatly\n\ncontradicts facts and assertions made explicit in the complaint.\");\n\nCarroll      v.   Xerox   Corp.,     294    F.3d    231,    242   (1st   Cir.    2002)\n\n(similar).2\n\n              Further, even were we to consider this argument, failure\n\nto join the dealers in this case would risk duplicative recovery.\n\nAny finding of a vertical conspiracy between manufacturers and\n\ndealers in this case would not preclude the dealers from initiating\n\ntheir       own   suit    claiming     that       they     were   victims   of     the\n\nmanufacturers' conspiracy and seeking recovery as direct purchasers\n\nunder Illinois Brick.          See P. Areeda et al., IIA Antitrust Law\n\n¶ 346h, at 175-76 (3d ed. 2007); see also Motor Vehicles I, 307 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 141 & n.5.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n          Plaintiffs claim that the district court accepted by\nimplication their motion to amend their complaint, made without any\nfurther elaboration in a footnote in their response to defendants'\nmotion to dismiss. This argument is without merit.\n\n                                           -11-\n\f            In connection with their attempted recasting of their\n\nclaim as one of vertical conspiracy, plaintiffs compare their case\n\nto other cases involving resale price maintenance theories, but to\n\nno avail. Plaintiffs simply did not plead in their complaints that\n\nmanufacturers and dealers conspired to set the prices used in the\n\nlease agreements between dealers and lessees.   See Bell Atl. Corp.\n\nv. Twombly, ___ U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007) (stating a\n\nclaim under section 1 of the Sherman Act, as plaintiffs attempt to\n\ndo here, \"requires a complaint with enough factual matters (taken\n\nas true) to suggest that an agreement was made\"); cf. Leegin\n\nCreative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.\n\nCt. 2705, 2725 (2007) (refusing in a resale price maintenance case\n\nto consider a horizontal conspiracy theory not alleged before the\n\nlower courts).3\n\n            In trying a different tack, plaintiffs put too much\n\nweight on the distinction drawn in Mercedes-Benz between use and\n\npurchase.    First, Mercedes-Benz is not binding authority on this\n\ncourt, and we do not necessarily adopt that distinction.   Second,\n\nthat distinction simply does not matter here.     Both lessees and\n\nlessors are indirect purchasers in this scenario.     Whatever the\n\ndistinction between purchase and use, the cost of both is increased\n\n\n\n     3\n          Plaintiffs appear to confuse what they plead in their\ncomplaints with what they argue in their briefs before this court\nand the court below. As already noted, it is the fact-pleading in\nthe complaints that controls.\n\n                                -12-\n\fwhen the dealer's invoice price is increased, and the overcharge\n\nallegedly suffered by lessees is at least in part due to these\n\nhigher costs imposed on the dealers.4\n\n               In a final effort to salvage their complaints, plaintiffs\n\nargue that there is no risk of double recovery here because the\n\nstatute of limitations has run, barring the dealers from filing\n\ntheir    own    suit   against   the   manufacturers.      There   are   many\n\nproblematic aspects to this assertion, but it suffices here simply\n\nto point out that plaintiffs failed to raise this argument before\n\nthe district court and thus have waived it.5            Teamsters Local No.\n\n59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"[L]egal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be\n\nbroached for the first time on appeal.\").\n\n               In sum, these complaints on their face do not allege a\n\nscenario in which plaintiffs could be direct purchasers.                  See\n\n\n\n     4\n          Similarly, Mercedes-Benz does not suggest that there is\nanything inherent about leasing arrangements that makes lessees'\nalleged injuries distinct from the injuries of the dealers. For\nexample, plaintiffs are adamant that the dealers could not recover\nduplicative damages because the dealers do not pay the overcharges\nin the monthly lease payments, or because the dealers never paid\nfor the \"use\" of the cars. That, however, is equivalent to arguing\nthat a dealer who does not pay a purchaser's monthly car payments\nhas no claim for antitrust damages against the manufacturer that\novercharged the dealer for the car in the first place. These are\nboth indirect purchaser situations.\n     5\n          Plaintiffs did note before the district court that the\nstatute of limitations might have run on the dealers, but they did\nnot argue that its expiration had any legal significance, as they\nattempt to do here.\n\n                                       -13-\n\fMorales-Tañon, 524 F.3d at 18 (to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss, a complaint must plead \"more than labels and conclusions,\"\n\nand its factual allegations must be sufficient to \"raise a right to\n\nrelief above the speculative level\" (quoting Bell Atl., 127 S. Ct.\n\nat 1965) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          Under   the    facts   alleged,   plaintiffs   are   indirect\n\npurchasers under the rule of Illinois Brick.       They have thus not\n\nstated a claim for which relief can be granted.          The order of\n\ndismissal is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f",

Antitrust Litig. (Motor Vehicles II),</i> 490 F.Supp.2d 13 (D.Me.2007). Plaintiffs allege that defendant manufacturers conspired to restrict the flow of cheaper Canadian cars into the U.S. market (when the U.S. dollar enjoyed a favorable exchange rate), resulting in artificially high rental payments under plaintiffs' lease agreements in the United States. Because plaintiffs are indirect purchasers, they lack standing to sue under section 4 of the Clayton Act and their suit was correctly dismissed under the rule of <i>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,</i> 431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977), and <i>Kansas v.

(Motor Vehicles III),</i> 522 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.2008), from which the background facts can be gleaned. <i>See id.</i> at 9-11.</p>\n<p>Briefly, appellants assert that Canadian and U.S. car manufacturers conspired to prevent cheaper Canadian cars from entering the U.S. market during a time when the U.S. dollar was much stronger than the Canadian dollar (roughly 2001 to 2003). This allegedly allowed the manufacturers and their captive leasing companies, two of which are also named as defendants, to maintain artificially high prices for new cars in the United States.</p>\n<p>The district court held in an earlier decision that a putative MDL plaintiff class containing both <i>purchasers and lessees</i> of new cars could not seek antitrust damages under federal law because they were indirect purchasers under the rule of <i>Illinois Brick. </i><i>In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig. (Motor Vehicles I),</i> 307 F.Supp.2d 136, 137 (D.Me.2004). At that time, the district court noted that future plaintiffs could potentially avoid the <i>Illinois Brick</i> bar by \"join[ing] as named defendants the dealers from whom they purchased or leased and prov[ing] that those dealers joined in the conspiracy.\" <i>Id.</i> In the cases now before us (which were more recently transferred from Ohio to the district court), plaintiffs are all lessees, not purchasers. They rely on that distinction in an attempt to circumvent the <i>Illinois Brick</i> hurdle. The district court found <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> this effort unavailing and dismissed their claim, holding that they were also indirect purchasers. <i>Motor Vehicles II,</i> 490 F.Supp.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>Our review of dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) is de novo. <i>Morales-Tañon v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.,</i> 524 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2008). We describe the Supreme Court law on indirect purchasers before turning to the mechanics of automobile leasing arrangements and their implications for plaintiffs' standing to sue under the Clayton Act. The plaintiffs rely heavily on an inapposite district court opinion and also attempt to recharacterize what they pled in their complaint. Both efforts fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In <i>Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.,</i> 392 U.S. 481, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968), a manufacturer sued United Shoe, the lessor of its manufacturing equipment, under section 4 of the Clayton Act. United Shoe, in turn, asserted a \"passing-on\" defense, arguing that Hanover Shoe would have passed some of the alleged overcharge on to its customers and thus should not be allowed to recover the full amount of the antitrust injury. <i>Id.</i> at 487-88, 88 S.Ct. 2224. The Court rejected that argument because of the impracticality of apportioning the damages between direct purchasers (like Hanover Shoe) and any subsequent, \"indirect\" purchasers (like Hanover Shoe's customers). <i>Id.</i> at 492-93, 88 S.Ct. 2224. The Court also articulated a concern that allowing apportionment would dilute the incentive for any one plaintiff to bring suit, weakening the effectiveness of private antitrust enforcement under section 4. <i>Id.</i> at 494, 88 S.Ct. 2224.</p>\n<p>The Court reaffirmed this rule in <i>Illinois Brick</i> and expanded it to cover plaintiffs as well: if defendants could not rely on passing-on defenses, purchasers could not seek to recover when their injury depended upon passing-on theories. <i>Ill. Brick,</i> 431 U.S. at 735, 737, 97 S.Ct. 2061. In other words, indirect purchasers cannot recover damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act. This bright-line rule was necessary, the Court reasoned, to prevent multiple recoveries (by both direct and indirect purchasers) and to avoid the complexity and difficulty of apportioning damages. <i>Id.</i> at 730-32, 737, 97 S.Ct. 2061. While recognizing that \"these difficulties and uncertainties will be less substantial in some contexts than in others,\" the Court refused to create exceptions to the rule for particular types of markets. <i>Id.</i> at 743-44, 97 S.Ct. 2061.</p>\n<p><i>UtiliCorp</i> put teeth into the Court's refusal to carve out exceptions to the <i>Illinois Brick</i> rule. Confronted by a situation where plaintiffs alleged that the direct purchaser would pass <i>all</i> of the illegal overcharge on to its consumers, the Court still refused to allow the indirect purchasers to seek antitrust damages. <i>UtiliCorp,</i> 497 U.S. at 208, 110 S.Ct. 2807. The Court determined that assuming a complete passing-on by the direct purchaser was inappropriate because a direct purchaser could potentially have raised prices irrespective of the overcharge. <i>Id.</i> at 209-10, 110 S.Ct. 2807. The Court also pointed out other ways in which the direct purchaser could be hurt by the antitrust activity, such as by a delay in implementing the price increases. <i>See id.</i> at 210, 110 S.Ct. 2807. Further, the <i>UtiliCorp</i> litigation itself demonstrated that determining when an <i>Illinois Brick</i> exception is truly justified would generate the type of complicated and costly litigation that the <i>Illinois Brick</i> rule was meant to avoid. <i>Id.</i> at 216-17, 110 S.Ct. 2807. For this reason, the Court concluded, \"even assuming that any economic assumptions underlying the <i>Illinois Brick</i> rule might be disproved in a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> specific case, we think it an unwarranted and counterproductive exercise to litigate a series of exceptions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 217, 110 S.Ct. 2807.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Given this bright-line rule, plaintiffs' case depends on establishing that they are direct rather than indirect purchasers. Plaintiffs assert vigorously that their case is almost identical to that of <i>In re Mercedes-Benz Anti-Trust Litigation,</i> 364 F.Supp.2d 468 (D.N.J.2005), in which the district court declined to dismiss a class action brought by lessees against a car manufacturer and its dealers because the court determined that the lessees were direct purchasers under <i>Illinois Brick.</i> Whether or not we would reach the same conclusion as was reached in that case, it is easily distinguishable. To understand why, one must understand the mechanics of automobile leasing arrangements.</p>\n<p>Generally in leasing arrangements, dealers buy the car from the manufacturer, negotiate the purchase price and contract terms directly with the lessee, and execute the lease. <i>Id.</i> at 472-73. A leasing company then pays the full purchase price of the car to the dealer in exchange for the lease, and thereafter the lessee makes monthly payments to the leasing company. <i>Id.</i> at 473.</p>\n<p>The lessee does not deal directly with the leasing company until after the lease is executed and the leasing company has paid the purchase price to the dealer. <i>Id.</i> at 473, 481. While leasing companies do set certain parameters for lease arrangements depending on the brand and model of car, dealers maneuver around the effects of those set rates by negotiating lower purchase prices, adding options at no additional cost, or agreeing to allow more than market value for a trade-in vehicle. <i>Id.</i> at 471-72. There is thus \"no substantive difference\" between a negotiation for the direct purchase of a car and the negotiation of a lease. <i>Id.</i> at 474.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mercedes-Benz,</i> plaintiff-lessees alleged that a car manufacturer (Mercedes-Benz) directly conspired with its dealers in the greater New York City area to set the price of cars sold to customers. <i>Id.</i> at 469. The defendants in that case included both the manufacturer and individual dealers. Because plaintiffs alleged a vertical conspiracy involving both the dealers and the manufacturers, the court concluded that the dealers' customers were direct purchasers and had standing to sue for antitrust injuries under the Clayton Act. <i>Id.</i> at 482.</p>\n<p>The court's concern in that case was the risk of double recovery. Because leasing companies were paying the full (inflated) purchase price of the cars to the defendant dealers, they, too, could be considered direct purchasers. <i>Id.</i> at 478. The <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> court concluded, however, that the lessees and the leasing companies suffered distinct injuries  higher monthly payments for the use of the cars for lessees versus higher purchase prices for the ownership of the cars for the leasing companies  so that even if both sets of direct purchasers were to sue, they would recover different damages. <i>Id.</i> at 480, 482; <i>see also id.</i> at 479 (discussing <i>Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready,</i> 457 U.S. 465, 475, 102 S.Ct. 2540, 73 L.Ed.2d 149 (1982)).</p>\n<p>There is a significant difference between <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> and this case: plaintiffs here did not join dealers as defendants, nor did they plead sufficiently or argue consistently that dealers were part of the conspiracy. Instead, plaintiffs' complaints describe a horizontal conspiracy among the manufacturers that adversely affected dealers as well as the ultimate consumers. Plaintiffs alleged in their complaints  and repeat in their appellate brief  that because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> of the manufacturers' conspiracy, dealers paid higher prices for their inventory. Because dealers negotiate price and lease terms directly with lessees, any higher prices paid by dealers to manufacturers would have trickled down into the lease terms for plaintiff lessees; the leasing companies, co-conspirators or not, had limited influence on the amount of the lessees' monthly payments.<sup>[1]</sup> The dealers in the case before us were the direct purchasers; they were \"the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators,\" not the lessees. <i>UtiliCorp,</i> 497 U.S. at 207, 110 S.Ct. 2807.</p>\n<p>Before this court, plaintiffs' arguments take on qualities reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's <i>Through the Looking Glass.</i> Plaintiffs try to re-frame their allegations as one of \"vertical conspiracy,\" claiming that \"[t]he dealers did not pay an overcharge to manufacturers and pass it on to the consumers\" and that \"[c]onsumers do not claim that they suffered damage because the dealers passed-on any anti-competitive pricing or other overcharges from the wholesale to the retail level.\" This approach contradicts their fact-pleading.</p>\n<p>In their complaints, plaintiffs do refer at times to dealers as members of the conspiracy, but these references were primarily to <i>Canadian</i> dealers, not to the U.S. dealers who actually negotiated the leases. More importantly, those passing and general allusions are contradicted and outweighed by plaintiffs' clear allegations in the complaints that dealers also paid higher prices due to the conspiracy. Examples from their complaints include that the defendant manufacturers \"charged their dealers in the United States 10-30% more for their motor vehicles than they charge[d] their Canadian dealers,\" and, in the very first paragraph of both complaints, that \"dealers were charged noncompetitive prices by the Automobile Companies and passed that extra charge to [plaintiffs].\"</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs try to distance themselves from their own complaints by explaining that they copied the \"passing-on\" language from the briefs of other MDL plaintiffs, but that explanation carries no legal significance. What matters here is what plaintiffs pled in their complaints, and the facts alleged in those complaints contradict the existence of a vertical conspiracy. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Global NAPs, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co.,</i> 336 F.3d 59, 66 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[W]e cannot credit a theory of [recovery] that flatly contradicts facts and assertions made explicit in the complaint.\"); <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 242 (1st Cir.2002) (similar).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Further, even were we to consider this argument, failure to join the dealers in this case would risk duplicative recovery. Any finding of a vertical conspiracy between manufacturers and dealers in this case would not preclude the dealers from initiating their own suit claiming that they were victims of the manufacturers' conspiracy and seeking recovery as direct purchasers under <i>Illinois Brick. See</i> P. Areeda et al., IIA <i>Antitrust Law</i> ¶ 346h, at 175-76 (3d ed.2007); <i>see also Motor Vehicles I,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 141 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p>In connection with their attempted recasting of their claim as one of vertical conspiracy, plaintiffs compare their case to other cases involving resale price maintenance theories, but to no avail. Plaintiffs simply did not plead in their complaints <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> that manufacturers and dealers conspired to set the prices used in the lease agreements between dealers and lessees. <i>See </i><i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (stating a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act, as plaintiffs attempt to do here, \"requires a complaint with enough factual matters (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2705, 2725, 168 L.Ed.2d 623 (2007) (refusing in a resale price maintenance case to consider a horizontal conspiracy theory not alleged before the lower courts).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In trying a different tack, plaintiffs put too much weight on the distinction drawn in <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> between use and purchase. First, <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> is not binding authority on this court, and we do not necessarily adopt that distinction. Second, that distinction simply does not matter here. Both lessees and lessors are indirect purchasers in this scenario. Whatever the distinction between purchase and use, the cost of both is increased when the dealer's invoice price is increased, and the overcharge allegedly suffered by lessees is at least in part due to these higher costs imposed on the dealers.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In a final effort to salvage their complaints, plaintiffs argue that there is no risk of double recovery here because the statute of limitations has run, barring the dealers from filing their own suit against the manufacturers. There are many problematic aspects to this assertion, but it suffices here simply to point out that plaintiffs failed to raise this argument before the district court and thus have waived it.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Teamsters Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[L]egal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").</p>\n<p>In sum, these complaints on their face do not allege a scenario in which plaintiffs could be direct purchasers. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Tañon,</i> 524 F.3d at 18 (to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must plead \"more than labels and conclusions,\" and its factual allegations must be sufficient to \"raise a right to relief above the speculative level\" (quoting <i>Bell Atl.,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1965) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Under the facts alleged, plaintiffs are indirect purchasers under the rule of <i>Illinois Brick.</i> They have thus not stated a claim for which relief can be granted. The order of dismissal is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Thus joining a few leasing companies, even if those lessors were alleged to be part of the conspiracy, does not solve the problem.</p>\n<p>[2]  Plaintiffs claim that the district court accepted by implication their motion to amend their complaint, made without any further elaboration in a footnote in their response to defendants' motion to dismiss. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p>[3]  Plaintiffs appear to confuse what they plead in their complaints with what they argue in their briefs before this court and the court below. As already noted, it is the fact-pleading in the complaints that controls.</p>\n<p>[4]  Similarly, <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> does not suggest that there is anything inherent about leasing arrangements that makes lessees' alleged injuries distinct from the injuries of the dealers. For example, plaintiffs are adamant that the dealers could not recover duplicative damages because the dealers do not pay the overcharges in the monthly lease payments, or because the dealers never paid for the \"use\" of the cars. That, however, is equivalent to arguing that a dealer who does not pay a purchaser's monthly car payments has no claim for antitrust damages against the manufacturer that overcharged the dealer for the car in the first place. These are both indirect purchaser situations.</p>\n<p>[5]  Plaintiffs did note before the district court that the statute of limitations might have run on the dealers, but they did not argue that its expiration had any legal significance, as they attempt to do here.</p>\n\n</div>",

The Court rejected that argument because of the impracticality of apportioning the damages between direct purchasers (like Hanover Shoe) and any subsequent, \"indirect\" purchasers (like Hanover Shoe's customers). <i>Id.</i> at 492-93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107749\"><a href=\"/opinion/107749/hanover-shoe-inc-v-united-shoe-machinery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2224</span></a></span>. The Court also articulated a concern that allowing apportionment would dilute the incentive for any one plaintiff to bring suit, weakening the effectiveness of private antitrust enforcement under section 4. <i>Id.</i> at 494, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107749\"><a href=\"/opinion/107749/hanover-shoe-inc-v-united-shoe-machinery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2224</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court reaffirmed this rule in <i>Illinois Brick</i> and expanded it to cover plaintiffs as well: if defendants could not rely on passing-on defenses, purchasers could not seek to recover when their injury depended upon passing-on theories. <i>Ill. Brick,</i> 431 U.S. at 735, 737, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109680\"><a href=\"/opinion/109680/illinois-brick-co-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2061</span></a></span>. In other words, indirect purchasers cannot recover damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act. This bright-line rule was necessary, the Court reasoned, to prevent multiple recoveries (by both direct and indirect purchasers) and to avoid the complexity and difficulty of apportioning damages. <i>Id.</i> at 730-32, 737, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109680\"><a href=\"/opinion/109680/illinois-brick-co-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2061</span></a></span>. While recognizing that \"these difficulties and uncertainties will be less substantial in some contexts than in others,\" the Court refused to create exceptions to the rule for particular types of markets. <i>Id.</i> at 743-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109680\"><a href=\"/opinion/109680/illinois-brick-co-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2061</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>UtiliCorp</i> put teeth into the Court's refusal to carve out exceptions to the <i>Illinois Brick</i> rule. Confronted by a situation where plaintiffs alleged that the direct purchaser would pass <i>all</i> of the illegal overcharge on to its consumers, the Court still refused to allow the indirect purchasers to seek antitrust damages. <i>UtiliCorp,</i> 497 U.S. at 208, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112476\"><a href=\"/opinion/112476/kansas-v-utilicorp-united-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2807</span></a></span>. The Court determined that assuming a complete passing-on by the direct purchaser was inappropriate because a direct purchaser could potentially have raised prices irrespective of the overcharge. <i>Id.</i> at 209-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112476\"><a href=\"/opinion/112476/kansas-v-utilicorp-united-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2807</span></a></span>. The Court also pointed out other ways in which the direct purchaser could be hurt by the antitrust activity, such as by a delay in implementing the price increases. <i>See id.</i> at 210, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112476\"><a href=\"/opinion/112476/kansas-v-utilicorp-united-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2807</span></a></span>. Further, the <i>UtiliCorp</i> litigation itself demonstrated that determining when an <i>Illinois Brick</i> exception is truly justified would generate the type of complicated and costly litigation that the <i>Illinois Brick</i> rule was meant to avoid. <i>Id.</i> at 216-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112476\"><a href=\"/opinion/112476/kansas-v-utilicorp-united-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2807</span></a></span>. For this reason, the Court concluded, \"even assuming that any economic assumptions underlying the <i>Illinois Brick</i> rule might be disproved in a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> specific case, we think it an unwarranted and counterproductive exercise to litigate a series of exceptions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 217, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112476\"><a href=\"/opinion/112476/kansas-v-utilicorp-united-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2807</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Given this bright-line rule, plaintiffs' case depends on establishing that they are direct rather than indirect purchasers. Plaintiffs assert vigorously that their case is almost identical to that of <i>In re Mercedes-Benz Anti-Trust Litigation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2344371\"><a href=\"/opinion/2344371/in-re-mercedes-benz-anti-trust-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span> (D.N.J.2005), in which the district court declined to dismiss a class action brought by lessees against a car manufacturer and its dealers because the court determined that the lessees were direct purchasers under <i>Illinois Brick.</i> Whether or not we would reach the same conclusion as was reached in that case, it is easily distinguishable. To understand why, one must understand the mechanics of automobile leasing arrangements.</p>\n<p>Generally in leasing arrangements, dealers buy the car from the manufacturer, negotiate the purchase price and contract terms directly with the lessee, and execute the lease. <i>Id.</i> at 472-73. A leasing company then pays the full purchase price of the car to the dealer in exchange for the lease, and thereafter the lessee makes monthly payments to the leasing company. <i>Id.</i> at 473.</p>\n<p>The lessee does not deal directly with the leasing company until after the lease is executed and the leasing company has paid the purchase price to the dealer. <i>Id.</i> at 473, 481. While leasing companies do set certain parameters for lease arrangements depending on the brand and model of car, dealers maneuver around the effects of those set rates by negotiating lower purchase prices, adding options at no additional cost, or agreeing to allow more than market value for a trade-in vehicle. <i>Id.</i> at 471-72. There is thus \"no substantive difference\" between a negotiation for the direct purchase of a car and the negotiation of a lease. <i>Id.</i> at 474.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mercedes-Benz,</i> plaintiff-lessees alleged that a car manufacturer (Mercedes-Benz) directly conspired with its dealers in the greater New York City area to set the price of cars sold to customers. <i>Id.</i> at 469. The defendants in that case included both the manufacturer and individual dealers. Because plaintiffs alleged a vertical conspiracy involving both the dealers and the manufacturers, the court concluded that the dealers' customers were direct purchasers and had standing to sue for antitrust injuries under the Clayton Act. <i>Id.</i> at 482.</p>\n<p>The court's concern in that case was the risk of double recovery. Because leasing companies were paying the full (inflated) purchase price of the cars to the defendant dealers, they, too, could be considered direct purchasers. <i>Id.</i> at 478. The <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> court concluded, however, that the lessees and the leasing companies suffered distinct injuries  higher monthly payments for the use of the cars for lessees versus higher purchase prices for the ownership of the cars for the leasing companies  so that even if both sets of direct purchasers were to sue, they would recover different damages. <i>Id.</i> at 480, 482; <i>see also id.</i> at 479 (discussing <i>Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110752\"><a href=\"/opinion/110752/blue-shield-of-va-v-mccready/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 475, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110752\"><a href=\"/opinion/110752/blue-shield-of-va-v-mccready/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span> (1982)).</p>\n<p>There is a significant difference between <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> and this case: plaintiffs here did not join dealers as defendants, nor did they plead sufficiently or argue consistently that dealers were part of the conspiracy. Instead, plaintiffs' complaints describe a horizontal conspiracy among the manufacturers that adversely affected dealers as well as the ultimate consumers. Plaintiffs alleged in their complaints  and repeat in their appellate brief  that because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> of the manufacturers' conspiracy, dealers paid higher prices for their inventory. Because dealers negotiate price and lease terms directly with lessees, any higher prices paid by dealers to manufacturers would have trickled down into the lease terms for plaintiff lessees; the leasing companies, co-conspirators or not, had limited influence on the amount of the lessees' monthly payments.<sup>[1]</sup> The dealers in the case before us were the direct purchasers; they were \"the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators,\" not the lessees. <i>UtiliCorp,</i> 497 U.S. at 207, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112476\"><a href=\"/opinion/112476/kansas-v-utilicorp-united-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2807</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Before this court, plaintiffs' arguments take on qualities reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's <i>Through the Looking Glass.</i> Plaintiffs try to re-frame their allegations as one of \"vertical conspiracy,\" claiming that \"[t]he dealers did not pay an overcharge to manufacturers and pass it on to the consumers\" and that \"[c]onsumers do not claim that they suffered damage because the dealers passed-on any anti-competitive pricing or other overcharges from the wholesale to the retail level.\" This approach contradicts their fact-pleading.</p>\n<p>In their complaints, plaintiffs do refer at times to dealers as members of the conspiracy, but these references were primarily to <i>Canadian</i> dealers, not to the U.S. dealers who actually negotiated the leases. More importantly, those passing and general allusions are contradicted and outweighed by plaintiffs' clear allegations in the complaints that dealers also paid higher prices due to the conspiracy. Examples from their complaints include that the defendant manufacturers \"charged their dealers in the United States 10-30% more for their motor vehicles than they charge[d] their Canadian dealers,\" and, in the very first paragraph of both complaints, that \"dealers were charged noncompetitive prices by the Automobile Companies and passed that extra charge to [plaintiffs].\"</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs try to distance themselves from their own complaints by explaining that they copied the \"passing-on\" language from the briefs of other MDL plaintiffs, but that explanation carries no legal significance. What matters here is what plaintiffs pled in their complaints, and the facts alleged in those complaints contradict the existence of a vertical conspiracy. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Global NAPs, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200549\"><a href=\"/opinion/200549/global-naps-inc-v-federal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[W]e cannot credit a theory of [recovery] that flatly contradicts facts and assertions made explicit in the complaint.\"); <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200014\"><a href=\"/opinion/200014/carroll-v-xerox/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 242 (1st Cir.2002) (similar).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Further, even were we to consider this argument, failure to join the dealers in this case would risk duplicative recovery. Any finding of a vertical conspiracy between manufacturers and dealers in this case would not preclude the dealers from initiating their own suit claiming that they were victims of the manufacturers' conspiracy and seeking recovery as direct purchasers under <i>Illinois Brick. See</i> P. Areeda et al., IIA <i>Antitrust Law</i> ¶ 346h, at 175-76 (3d ed.2007); <i>see also Motor Vehicles I,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 141 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p>In connection with their attempted recasting of their claim as one of vertical conspiracy, plaintiffs compare their case to other cases involving resale price maintenance theories, but to no avail. Plaintiffs simply did not plead in their complaints <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> that manufacturers and dealers conspired to set the prices used in the lease agreements between dealers and lessees. <i>See </i><i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span> (2007) (stating a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act, as plaintiffs attempt to do here, \"requires a complaint with enough factual matters (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145701\"><a href=\"/opinion/145701/leegin-creative-leather-products-v-psks-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span> (2007) (refusing in a resale price maintenance case to consider a horizontal conspiracy theory not alleged before the lower courts).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In trying a different tack, plaintiffs put too much weight on the distinction drawn in <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> between use and purchase. First, <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> is not binding authority on this court, and we do not necessarily adopt that distinction. Second, that distinction simply does not matter here. Both lessees and lessors are indirect purchasers in this scenario. Whatever the distinction between purchase and use, the cost of both is increased when the dealer's invoice price is increased, and the overcharge allegedly suffered by lessees is at least in part due to these higher costs imposed on the dealers.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In a final effort to salvage their complaints, plaintiffs argue that there is no risk of double recovery here because the statute of limitations has run, barring the dealers from filing their own suit against the manufacturers. There are many problematic aspects to this assertion, but it suffices here simply to point out that plaintiffs failed to raise this argument before the district court and thus have waived it.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Teamsters Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[L]egal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").</p>\n<p>In sum, these complaints on their face do not allege a scenario in which plaintiffs could be direct purchasers. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Tañon,</i> 524 F.3d at 18 (to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must plead \"more than labels and conclusions,\" and its factual allegations must be sufficient to \"raise a right to relief above the speculative level\" (quoting <i>Bell Atl.,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1965) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Under the facts alleged, plaintiffs are indirect purchasers under the rule of <i>Illinois Brick.</i> They have thus not stated a claim for which relief can be granted. The order of dismissal is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Thus joining a few leasing companies, even if those lessors were alleged to be part of the conspiracy, does not solve the problem.</p>\n<p>[2]  Plaintiffs claim that the district court accepted by implication their motion to amend their complaint, made without any further elaboration in a footnote in their response to defendants' motion to dismiss. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p>[3]  Plaintiffs appear to confuse what they plead in their complaints with what they argue in their briefs before this court and the court below. As already noted, it is the fact-pleading in the complaints that controls.</p>\n<p>[4]  Similarly, <i>Mercedes-Benz</i> does not suggest that there is anything inherent about leasing arrangements that makes lessees' alleged injuries distinct from the injuries of the dealers. For example, plaintiffs are adamant that the dealers could not recover duplicative damages because the dealers do not pay the overcharges in the monthly lease payments, or because the dealers never paid for the \"use\" of the cars. That, however, is equivalent to arguing that a dealer who does not pay a purchaser's monthly car payments has no claim for antitrust damages against the manufacturer that overcharged the dealer for the car in the first place. These are both indirect purchaser situations.</p>\n<p>[5]  Plaintiffs did note before the district court that the statute of limitations might have run on the dealers, but they did not argue that its expiration had any legal significance, as they attempt to do here.</p>\n\n</div>",
