The question presented is\n\nwhether 11 U.S.C. § 522(f) permits a debtor to avoid a judicial\n\nlien if the lien existed at the filing of the bankruptcy petition\n\nbut was satisfied after the bankruptcy case closed and before the\n\ndebtor filed a motion to avoid.        The Bankruptcy Court and the\n\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel below concluded that it does not.          We\n\ndisagree and will remand the matter to permit the Bankruptcy Court\n\nto address any equitable defenses that might be available to the\n\ncreditor under these circumstances.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           The bare bones1 factual background is as follows:\n\n           In May 2001, appellee CitiFinancial Consumer Financial\n\nServices   (\"CitiFinancial\")   recorded   a   judicial   lien   on   the\n\nresidence of appellant Donald J. Wilding. Some six months later in\n\nNovember 2001, Wilding filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.          He\n\ndid not identify the CitiFinancial debt of approximately $10,000 as\n\nsecured in his schedules; rather, he listed a debt to CitiFinancial\n\nin roughly that amount as unsecured. Wilding received a discharge,\n\nin what the Bankruptcy Judge termed “a garden variety Chapter 7\n\n\n     1\n       We join the Bankruptcy Court and the Bankruptcy Appellate\nPanel in lamenting the lack of factual detail to be found within\nthe record created by the parties for this case. Nevertheless, we\nfind in the record the information material to our disposition. We\nnote, however, that a full record would have made this case more\neasily comprehensible and might have avoided the unseemly spectacle\nof lawyers asserting inconsistent statements about facts nowhere to\nbe found in the record in briefing and in oral argument before this\ncourt.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fbankruptcy no-asset case” on February 7, 2002, and the case was\n\nclosed on February 15, 2002.\n\n            In   the    course     of   refinancing     the   mortgage     on    his\n\nresidence    nearly    two   years      later   in   2004,    Wilding    found   it\n\nnecessary to address CitiFinancial's lien.2               As a matter of law,\n\nthe lien remained in place because “[a]lthough the unsecured\n\nportion of a secured creditor’s claim may be discharged in a\n\nChapter 7 . . . case, its lien in the collateral normally survives\n\nthe bankruptcy proceeding and the discharge, and is enforceable in\n\naccordance with state law.”         In re Pratt, 462 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   On December 22, 2004, Wilding filed a motion to reopen his\n\nbankruptcy    case     for   the   purpose      of   avoiding   the     previously\n\nunscheduled judicial lien on his property.               Before the motion to\n\nreopen was acted upon, Wilding consummated his refinancing and\n\nsatisfied the lien.      On December 29, 2004 a release of the lien was\n\nrecorded in the Registry of Deeds.\n\n            The Bankruptcy Court granted the motion to reopen on\n\nJanuary 5, 2005.       On January 6, 2005, Wilding filed a motion to\n\n\n\n     2\n       Wilding concedes he did not disclose the related debt as\nbeing secured by the CitiFinancial judicial lien in the schedules\nhe filed when seeking Chapter 7 discharge. Although the record\ndoes not establish whether this omission was inadvertent or\nintentional, his counsel suggested at oral argument that Wilding,\nlike many Chapter 7 debtors, might have been unaware that a\njudicial lien had attached. Since it is not apparent how Wilding\ncould have benefitted by failing to schedule an avoidable lien,\nthere is no reason to assume that he intentionally misrepresented\nthe nature of the debt.\n\n                                        -3-\n\favoid the lien.         In opposition, CitiFinancial, which had not\n\nopposed the motion to reopen, argued that the lien could not be\n\navoided because it had been satisfied.               Both the Bankruptcy Court\n\nand the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel concluded that since the lien\n\nwas no longer in effect, there was no longer a lien which could be\n\navoided.   The Bankruptcy Court stated, “[q]uite simply, there are\n\nno rights or justiciable property interests before the Court, and\n\nit is clearly too late to raise any.”                The Bankruptcy Appellate\n\nPanel held that “because the lien was fully satisfied, it was no\n\nlonger fixed on property of the Debtor at the time he filed his\n\nMotion to Avoid the Lien.           Accordingly, it was too late to employ\n\nthe benefits of § 522(f) of the Code.”                In re Wilding, 332 B.R.\n\n487, 491 (1st Cir. BAP 2005).\n\n                                         II.\n\n           We   think    the    Bankruptcy      Court      and    the   Bankruptcy\n\nAppellate Panel, by essentially embracing a per se rule, took too\n\nnarrow a view of the powers of lien avoidance under 11 U.S.C. §\n\n522(f).    Because      this   is    a    question    of   law,   we    review   the\n\nBankruptcy Court’s determination de novo.              See   In re Lazarus, No.\n\n06-1982, 2007 WL 49640, at *1 (1st Cir. Jan. 9, 2007).\n\n           Section § 522(f)(1) states, in relevant part:\n\n     [T]he debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of\n     the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an\n     exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under\n     subsection (b) of this section, if such lien is --\n\n                 (1) a judicial lien . . .\n\n                                          -4-\n\f11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(1).   Thus, under the statute, a debtor may avoid\n\nthe fixing of a lien if three requirements are met: (1) there was\n\na fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property; (2)\n\nthe lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been\n\nentitled; and (3) the lien is a judicial lien.   See Culver, LLC v.\n\nChiu, 304 F.3d 905, 908 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n          The parties do not dispute that Wilding has met the first\n\nand third requirements; Wilding had an interest in his house before\n\nthe lien attached and the lien was a judicial lien.   See Farrey v.\n\nSanderfoot, 500 U.S. 291, 297-98 (1991) (holding that the debtor\n\nmust have had an interest in the property before the lien attached\n\nto take advantage of § 522(f)); see also Patriot Portfolio LLC v.\n\nWeinstein (In re Weinstein), 164 F.3d 677, 680 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          As for the second requirement, the parties do not dispute\n\nthat Wilding \"would have been entitled to\"3 a homestead exemption.4\n\nThe only matter in dispute is whether Wilding can take advantage of\n\n\n     3\n       In Owen v. Owen, 500 U.S. 305 (1991), the Supreme Court held\nthat the proper question to ask in determining what the debtor\n\"would have been entitled to\" is whether the lien impairs a state\nor federal exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled\nbut for the lien itself. See id. at 310-13.\n     4\n       Wilding contends he failed to value the real property\nproperly on his schedules. He notes in his brief that he listed\nthe property at $60,000 with a first mortgage lien of $58,000.\nConsequently, only a modest sum -- far less than that which was the\nsubject of the judicial lien -- would be covered by the exemption.\nIn his brief before us, Wilding’s counsel contends that “[i]f\nvaluation were truly an issue Debtor would obviously move to amend\nhis exemptions to permit him to exempt up to $150,000 in his\nhomestead” under the Rhode Island exemption.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f§ 522(f) now that he has satisfied the lien, i.e. whether the lien\n\n\"impairs the exemption\" if it no longer exists when the motion to\n\navoid is filed.\n\n          CitiFinancial contends that Wilding cannot avoid a lien\n\nthat does not currently impair the exempt property.               At first\n\nglance,   the   language   of   §    522(f)   might   seem   to    support\n\nCitiFinancial's position, because the requirement that the lien\n\n\"impairs\" the exempt property is worded in the present tense.\n\nLinguistically, the word \"impairs\" suggests that a lien must\n\nactually impair the exempt property at the time the judge renders\n\nthe decision to avoid.\n\n          Wilding, on the other hand, essentially argues that §\n\n522(f) applies as long as the lien impaired his interest in\n\nproperty at the time he filed his bankruptcy petition.            He relies\n\nupon several cases in which courts have held that the debtor need\n\nnot have an interest in the exempt property at the time the debtor\n\nfiles his motion to avoid to take advantage of § 522(f).              See,\n\ne.g., Chiu, 304 F.3d at 908-09; In re Orr, 304 B.R. 875, 877\n\n(Bankr. S.D. Ill. 2004) (following Chiu); In re Mailhot, 301 B.R.\n\n774, 776 (Bankr. D.R.I. 2003) (same); In re Vincent, 260 B.R. 617,\n\n620-21 (Bankr. D. Conn. 2000).       But see In re Sizemore, 177 B.R.\n\n530, 531 (Bankr. E.D. Ky. 1995) (holding that debtor cannot take\n\nadvantage of § 522(f) after debtor has transferred his exempt\n\nproperty); In re Vitullo, 60 B.R. 822, 824 (D.N.J. 1986)(same); In\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fre Riddell, 96 B.R. 816 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 1989) (same); In re\n\nCarilli, 65 B.R. 280, 282 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1986) (same).\n\n          Chiu and similar cases -- including Mailhot, which was\n\ndecided by the Bankruptcy Judge who decided this case -- are\n\ndistinguishable from the case before us. In Chiu, for example, the\n\ndebtor sold the exempt property before filing the motion to avoid.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit reasoned that the appropriate time to determine\n\nwhether a debtor has an exempt interest in property is the filing\n\nof the petition, not the filing of the motion to avoid the lien.\n\nBut the liens in Chiu and Mailhot were still effectively in force\n\nwhen the Bankruptcy Court acted upon the motion to avoid.      Indeed,\n\nin both cases the debtor took care not to satisfy the lien in\n\nquestion when disposing of the exempt property; funds generated by\n\na sale of the property were escrowed pending judicial determination\n\nof the validity of the lien.    See Chiu, 304 F.3d at 907; Mailhot,\n\n301 B.R. at 776.     Thus, the liens in those cases continued to\n\nimpair the equivalent of exempt property at the time the debtor\n\nfiled his motion to avoid.\n\n          For reasons that do not appear on the record, Wilding\n\nfailed to protect himself in that fashion.     Rather, before filing\n\nhis   motion   to   avoid,   Wilding   consummated   the   refinancing\n\ntransaction and satisfied the lien in full without holding the\n\nfunds in escrow pending a determination by the Bankruptcy Court.\n\n        Yet although the Chiu line of cases is distinguishable, we\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fconclude that the lien itself need not exist at the moment the\n\ndebtor     files   a   motion   to   avoid   for   §   522(f)   to   apply.\n\nCitiFinancial's position is based upon a narrow grammatical reading\n\nof § 522(f); a broader consideration of § 522 as a whole yields a\n\ndifferent result.\n\n           The textual touchstone for retrospective relief under §\n\n522(f) is found in the definition of “value” provided for by the\n\nstatute.    Section 522(f)(2)(a) reads:\n\n     For the purposes of this subsection, a lien shall be\n     considered to impair an exemption to the extent that the sum\n     of --\n\n            (i) the lien;\n            (ii) all other liens on the property; and\n            (iii) the amount of the exemption that the debtor could\n            claim if there were no liens on the property;\n\n     exceeds the value that the debtor's interest in the property\n     would have in the absence of any liens.\n\n(emphasis supplied).      In § 522, “‘value’ means fair market value\n\nas of the date of the filing of the petition or, with respect to\n\nproperty that becomes property of the estate after such date, as of\n\nthe date such property becomes property of the estate.”          11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 522(a) (emphasis supplied).        It would be an odd result if the\n\nstatute required the court to measure the value of the property\n\ninterest as of the petition date, but to measure the value of the\n\nlien as of an unrelated point in the future, for example, when the\n\njudge actually addresses a motion to avoid.        We think the petition\n\ndate is the operative date for determining the various § 522(f)\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcalculations.     In order to determine whether a lien impairs an\n\nexemption, the Bankruptcy Court must calculate the value of the\n\nlien as of the filing of the petition.    If the lien “impairs” the\n\nexemption on that date, the court may thereafter address whether\n\nthe lien should be avoided.   Consequently, it is not determinative\n\nthat the lien did not exist (or, in other words, had zero value)\n\nwhen Wilding ultimately filed his motion to avoid.\n\n          This reading comports with the mechanics of § 522(f). As\n\nthe Ninth Circuit in Chiu noted,\n\n          [t]he operation of Section 522(f) is not to avoid a\n          “lien”, per se, although that is its practical\n          effect in most cases.      Rather, by its terms,\n          Section 522(f) provides for the avoidance of the\n          “fixing” of certain liens.      To “fix” means to\n          “fasten a liability upon.” Thus, Section 522(f)\n          operates retrospectively to annul the event of\n          fastening.\n\nChiu, 304 F.3d at 908 quoting In re Vincent, 260 B.R. at 617\n\n(emphasis in original, citations omitted).   We find this reasoning\n\npersuasive.     Section 522(f) seeks to implement the strong public\n\npolicies -- in particular, \"the fresh start policy of the Code\n\nwhich encourages the full application of the Code's exemption\n\nprovisions,\" In re Quackenbos, 71 B.R. 693, 695 (Bankr. E.D. Pa.\n\n1987) -- that are at play when lien avoidance is sought.       As the\n\nSupreme Court has observed, § 522(f) was designed to mitigate the\n\nimpact of judicial liens “because they are a device commonly used\n\nby creditors to defeat the protection bankruptcy law accords exempt\n\nproperty against debts.”      Farrey, 500 U.S. at    297-98.    These\n\n                                 -9-\n\fpolicies support what we conclude is the most reasonable reading of\n\n§ 522: that, for the purpose of retrospective relief, the value of\n\nthe lien is to be calculated as of the filing of the petition.\n\n          Thus, we hold that a debtor may avoid a judicial lien\n\nunder § 522(f) even if he has satisfied the lien prior to filing a\n\nmotion to avoid, so long as the lien in question impaired an\n\nexemption as of the bankruptcy petition date (or the later acquired\n\nproperty date) as reflected in the statutory definition of \"value\"\n\nunder § 522.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          That   a   court   sitting    in   bankruptcy   may deploy its\n\nequitable powers under § 522 to issue an order avoiding a lien,\n\nnunc pro tunc, does not mean that it necessarily should exercise\n\nthose powers to do so.   Although § 522(f) permits a debtor to avoid\n\na lien in cases such as this, CitiFinancial might have available\n\nequitable defenses to oppose the motion to avoid. Defenses such as\n\nlaches, fraud, detrimental reliance, and prejudice are often raised\n\nin opposition to a motion to reopen.         It is well-settled that a\n\nBankruptcy Judge has discretion to determine -- in light of such\n\ndefenses -- whether to reopen a bankruptcy petition at all.         See,\n\ne.g., First National Bank of Park Falls v. Maley, 126 B.R. 563, 567\n\n(E.D. Wis. 1991); In re Procaccianti, 253 B.R. 590 (Bankr. D.R.I.\n\n2000); In re Walters, 113 B.R. 602, 603 (Bankr. D.S.D. 1990); In re\n\nQuackenbos, 71 B.R. at 695-96.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f              In this case, CitiFinancial did not oppose the reopening.\n\nBut the motion to reopen stage is not the only or perhaps even the\n\nbest point at which finality concerns may be addressed and balanced\n\nagainst the policy of the Bankruptcy Code to provide “a fresh\n\nstart” and protect exempt property.                It is at the avoidance motion\n\nstage when the relative interests of the respective parties are\n\nmost fully crystallized.          Thus, although applying essentially the\n\nsame   test    as   that     applicable      for    the    motion      to    reopen,   the\n\nBankruptcy     Court    must    be     prepared      to     exercise        its   informed\n\ndiscretion     with    respect    to    the     motion      to   avoid       filed   after\n\nbankruptcy proceedings are closed.                 Cf. In re Levy, 256 B.R. 563\n\n(Bankr. D.N.J. 2000) (granting a motion to reopen but denying the\n\nmotion to avoid a judicial lien because relief was barred by the\n\ndefense of laches).\n\n              The   courts    below    did    not    address      or    calibrate      the\n\nequities of granting a motion to avoid.                   Rather, they concluded as\n\na matter of law that it was too late to do so.                      Consequently, we\n\nleave to the Bankruptcy Court in the first instance to address any\n\nequitable defenses that might be available. In that connection, we\n\nobserve that the Bankruptcy Judge may establish conditions so as to\n\navoid any demonstrable prejudice to CitiFinancial from belated\n\navoidance of its judicial lien.               See, e.g., In re Dator, 2006 WL\n\n2056678 at *3 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2006) (conditioning reopening on\n\nsatisfaction by debtors of reasonable fees and expenses, including\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fattorneys fees, of judicial lienholders between date of closing\n\nChapter 7 case and date of filing motion to reopen); In re Orr, 304\n\nB.R. at 878 (finding no dispute over value of real estate for\n\npurposes of determining extent of impairment and consequently\n\ncreditor did not need to incur cost of appraisal); but see In re\n\nLevy, 256 B.R. at 566-67 (declining to reopen Chapter 13 proceeding\n\nbecause delay in seeking lien avoidance caused “difficult and\n\ncostly task of hiring appraiser to offer an opinion as to the value\n\nof the debtor’s property” four years earlier).      We leave to the\n\nBankruptcy Court’s informed discretion such issues as how, if at\n\nall, the costs or uncertainty of post hoc appraisal of the property\n\nshould be factored into conditioning the availability of lien\n\navoidance.   We also leave to the Bankruptcy Court's discretion the\n\nproper valuation of any impairment of the homestead exemption. See\n\nNote 4 supra.\n\n           The Bankruptcy Court’s denial of the motion to avoid the\n\nCitiFinancial lien is VACATED.    This case shall be REMANDED to the\n\nBankruptcy Court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.

The Bankruptcy Court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel below concluded that it does not. We disagree and will remand the matter to permit the Bankruptcy Court to address any equitable defenses that might be available to the creditor under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bare bones<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> factual background is as follows: In May 2001, appellee CitiFinancial Consumer Financial Services (\"CitiFinancial\") recorded a judicial lien on the residence of appellant Donald J. Wilding. Some six months later in November 2001, Wilding filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. He did not identify the CitiFinancial debt of approximately $10,000 as secured in his schedules; rather, he listed a debt to CitiFinancial in roughly that amount as unsecured. Wilding received a discharge, in what the Bankruptcy Judge termed \"a garden variety Chapter 7 bankruptcy no-asset case\" on February 7, 2002, and the case was closed on February 15, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of refinancing the mortgage on his residence nearly two years later in 2004, Wilding found it necessary to address CitiFinancial's lien.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As a matter of law, the lien remained in place because \"[a]lthough the unsecured portion of a secured creditor's claim may be discharged in a Chapter 7 . . . case, its lien in the collateral normally survives the bankruptcy proceeding and the discharge, and is enforceable in accordance with state law.\" <i>In re Pratt,</i> 462 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.2006). On December 22, 2004, Wilding filed a motion to reopen his bankruptcy case for the purpose of avoiding the previously unscheduled judicial lien on his property. Before the motion to reopen was acted upon, Wilding consummated his refinancing and satisfied the lien. On December 29, 2004 a release of the lien was recorded in the Registry of Deeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Court granted the motion to reopen on January 5, 2005. On January 6, 2005, Wilding filed a motion to avoid the lien. In opposition, CitiFinancial, which had not opposed the motion to reopen, argued that the lien could not be avoided because it had been satisfied. Both the Bankruptcy Court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel concluded that since the lien was no longer in effect, there was no longer a lien which could be avoided. The Bankruptcy Court stated, \"[q]uite simply, there are no rights or justiciable property interests before the Court, and it is clearly too late to raise any.\" The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel held that \"because the lien was fully satisfied, it was no longer fixed on property of the Debtor at the time he filed his Motion to Avoid the Lien. Accordingly, it was too late to employ the benefits of &#167; 522(f) of the Code.\" <i>In re Wilding,</i> 332 B.R. 487, 491 (1st Cir. BAP2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the Bankruptcy Court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, by essentially embracing a <i>per se</i> rule, took too narrow a view of the powers of lien avoidance under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f). Because this is a question of law, we review the Bankruptcy Court's determination <i>de novo. See In re Lazarus,</i> No. 06-1982, 2007 WL 49640, at *1, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. Jan.9, 2007).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section &#167; 522(f)(1) states, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) of this section, if such lien is&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) a judicial lien ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f)(1). Thus, under the statute, a debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien if three requirements are met: (1) there was a fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property; (2) the lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled; and (3) the lien is a judicial lien. <i>See Culver, LLC v. Chiu,</i> 304 F.3d 905, 908 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that Wilding has met the first and third requirements; Wilding had an interest in his house before the lien attached and the lien was a judicial lien. <i>See Farrey v. Sanderfoot,</i> 500 U.S. 291, 297-98, 111 S.Ct. 1825, 114 L.Ed.2d 337 (1991) (holding that the debtor must have had an interest in the property before the lien attached to take advantage of &#167; 522(f)); <i>see also Patriot Portfolio LLC v. Weinstein (In re Weinstein),</i> 164 F.3d 677, 680 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the second requirement, the parties do not dispute that Wilding \"would have been entitled to\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> a homestead exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The only matter in dispute is whether Wilding can take advantage of &#167; 522(f) now that he has satisfied the lien, i.e. whether the lien \"impairs the exemption\" if it no longer exists when the motion to avoid is filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CitiFinancial contends that Wilding cannot avoid a lien that does not <i>currently</i> impair the exempt property. At first glance, the language of &#167; 522(f) might seem to support CitiFinancial's position, because the requirement that the lien \"impairs\" the exempt property is worded in the present tense. Linguistically, the word \"impairs\" suggests that a lien must actually impair the exempt property at the time the judge renders the decision to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilding, on the other hand, essentially argues that &#167; 522(f) applies as long as the lien impaired his interest in property at the time he filed his bankruptcy petition. He relies upon several cases in which courts have held that the debtor need not have an interest in the exempt property at the time the debtor files his motion to avoid to take advantage of &#167; 522(f). <i>See, e.g., Chiu,</i> 304 F.3d at 908-09; <i>In re Orr,</i> 304 B.R. 875, 877 (Bankr.S.D.Ill.2004) (following <i>Chiu</i>); <i>In re Mailhot,</i> 301 B.R. 774, 776 (Bankr.D.R.I.2003) (same); <i>In re Vincent,</i> 260 B.R. 617, 620-21 (Bankr. D.Conn.2000). <i>But see In re Sizemore,</i> 177 B.R. 530, 531 (Bankr.E.D.Ky.1995) (holding that debtor cannot take advantage of &#167; 522(f) after debtor has transferred his exempt property); <i>In re Vitullo,</i> 60 B.R. 822, 824 (D.N.J.1986)(same); <i>In re Riddell,</i> 96 B.R. 816 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1989) (same); <i>In re Carilli,</i> 65 B.R. 280, 282 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1986) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Chiu</i> and similar cases&#8212;including <i>Mailhot,</i> which was decided by the Bankruptcy Judge who decided this case&#8212;are distinguishable from the case before us. In <i>Chiu,</i> for example, the debtor sold the exempt property before filing the motion to avoid. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that the appropriate time to determine whether a debtor has an exempt interest in property is the filing of the petition, not the filing of the motion to avoid the lien. But the liens in <i>Chiu</i> and <i>Mailhot</i> were still effectively in force when the Bankruptcy Court acted upon the motion to avoid. Indeed, in both cases the debtor took care <i>not</i> to satisfy the lien in question when disposing of the exempt property; funds generated by a sale of the property were escrowed pending judicial determination of the validity of the lien. <i>See Chiu,</i> 304 F.3d at 907; <i>Mailhot,</i> 301 B.R. at 776. Thus, the liens in those cases continued to impair the equivalent of exempt property at the time the debtor filed his motion to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that do not appear on the record, Wilding failed to protect himself in that fashion. Rather, before filing his motion to avoid, Wilding consummated the refinancing transaction and satisfied the lien in full without holding the funds in escrow pending a determination by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet although the <i>Chiu</i> line of cases is distinguishable, we conclude that the lien itself need not exist at the moment the debtor files a motion to avoid for &#167; 522(f) to apply. CitiFinancial's position is based upon a narrow grammatical reading of &#167; 522(f); a broader consideration of &#167; 522 as a whole yields a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The textual touchstone for retrospective relief under &#167; 522(f) is found in the definition of \"value\" provided for by the statute. Section 522(f)(2)(a) reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this subsection, a lien shall be considered to impair an exemption to the extent that the sum of&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) the lien;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) all other liens on the property; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim if there were no liens on the property;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">exceeds the <i>value</i> that the debtor's interest in the property would have in the absence of any liens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis supplied). In &#167; 522, \"`value' means fair market value <i>as of the date of the filing of the petition</i> or, with respect to property that becomes property of the estate after such date, as of the date such property becomes property of the estate.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(a) (emphasis supplied). It would be an odd result if the statute required the court to measure the value of the property interest as of the petition date, but to measure the value of the lien as of an unrelated point in the future, for example, when the judge actually addresses a motion to avoid. We think the petition date is the operative date for determining the various &#167; 522(f) calculations. In order to determine whether a lien impairs an exemption, the Bankruptcy Court must calculate the value of the lien as of the filing of the petition. If the lien \"impairs\" the exemption on that date, the court may thereafter address whether the lien should be avoided. Consequently, it is not determinative that the lien did not exist (or, in other words, had zero value) when Wilding ultimately filed his motion to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reading comports with the mechanics of &#167; 522(f). As the Ninth Circuit in <i>Chiu</i> noted,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he operation of Section 522(f) is not to avoid a \"lien\", <i>per se,</i> although that is its practical effect in most cases. Rather, by its terms, Section 522(f) provides for the avoidance of the \"fixing\" of certain liens. To \"fix\" means to \"fasten a liability upon.\" Thus, Section 522(f) operates retrospectively to annul the <i>event</i> of fastening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Chiu,</i> 304 F.3d at 908 <i>quoting In re Vincent,</i> 260 B.R. at 617 (emphasis in original, citations omitted). We find this reasoning persuasive. Section 522(f) seeks to implement the strong public policies&#8212;in particular, \"the fresh start policy of the Code which encourages the full application of the Code's exemption provisions,\" <i>In re Quackenbos,</i> 71 B.R. 693, 695 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.1987)&#8212;that are at play when lien avoidance is sought. As the Supreme Court has observed, &#167; 522(f) was designed to mitigate the impact of judicial liens \"because they are a device commonly used by creditors to defeat the protection bankruptcy law accords exempt property against debts.\" <i>Farrey,</i> 500 U.S. at 297-98, 111 S.Ct. 1825. These policies support what we conclude is the most reasonable reading of &#167; 522: that, for the purpose of retrospective relief, the value of the lien is to be calculated as of the filing of the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we hold that a debtor may avoid a judicial lien under &#167; 522(f) even if he has satisfied the lien prior to filing a motion to avoid, so long as the lien in question impaired an exemption as of the bankruptcy petition date (or the later acquired property date) as reflected in the statutory definition of \"value\" under &#167; 522.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That a court sitting in bankruptcy may deploy its equitable powers under &#167; 522 to issue an order avoiding a lien, <i>nunc pro tunc,</i> does not mean that it necessarily should exercise those powers to do so. Although &#167; 522(f) permits a debtor to avoid a lien in cases such as this, CitiFinancial might have available equitable defenses to oppose the motion to avoid. Defenses such as laches, fraud, detrimental reliance, and prejudice are often raised in opposition to a motion to reopen. It is well-settled that a Bankruptcy Judge has discretion to determine&#8212;in light of such defenses&#8212;whether to reopen a bankruptcy petition at all. <i>See, e.g., First National Bank of Park Falls v. Maley,</i> 126 B.R. 563, 567 (E.D.Wis.1991); <i>In re Procaccianti,</i> 253 B.R. 590 (Bankr.D.R.I.2000); <i>In re Walters,</i> 113 B.R. 602, 603 (Bankr. D.S.D.1990); <i>In re Quackenbos,</i> 71 B.R. at 695-96.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, CitiFinancial did not oppose the reopening. But the motion to reopen stage is not the only or perhaps even the best point at which finality concerns may be addressed and balanced against the policy of the Bankruptcy Code to provide \"a fresh start\" and protect exempt property. It is at the avoidance motion stage when the relative interests of the respective parties are most fully crystallized. Thus, although applying essentially the same test as that applicable for the motion to reopen, the Bankruptcy Court must be prepared to exercise its informed discretion with respect to the motion to avoid filed after bankruptcy proceedings are closed. <i>Cf. In re Levy,</i> 256 B.R. 563 (Bankr.D.N.J.2000) (granting a motion to reopen but denying the motion to avoid a judicial lien because relief was barred by the defense of laches).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts below did not address or calibrate the equities of granting a motion to avoid. Rather, they concluded as a matter of law that it was too late to do so. Consequently, we leave to the Bankruptcy Court in the first instance to address any equitable defenses that might be available. In that connection, we observe that the Bankruptcy Judge may establish conditions so as to avoid any demonstrable prejudice to CitiFinancial from belated avoidance of its judicial lien. <i>See, e.g., In re</i> <i>Dator,</i> 2006 WL 2056678 at *3 (Bankr. D.Mass.2006) (conditioning reopening on satisfaction by debtors of reasonable fees and expenses, including attorneys fees, of judicial lienholders between date of closing Chapter 7 case and date of filing motion to reopen); <i>In re Orr,</i> 304 B.R. at 878 (finding no dispute over value of real estate for purposes of determining extent of impairment and consequently creditor did not need to incur cost of appraisal); <i>but see In re Levy,</i> 256 B.R. at 566-67 (declining to reopen Chapter 13 proceeding because delay in seeking lien avoidance caused \"difficult and costly task of hiring appraiser to offer an opinion as to the value of the debtor's property\" four years earlier). We leave to the Bankruptcy Court's informed discretion such issues as how, if at all, the costs or uncertainty of <i>post hoc</i> appraisal of the property should be factored into conditioning the availability of lien avoidance. We also leave to the Bankruptcy Court's discretion the proper valuation of any impairment of the homestead exemption. <i>See</i> Note 4 <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Court's denial of the motion to avoid the CitiFinancial lien is VACATED.

Wilding. Some six months later in November 2001, Wilding filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. He did not identify the CitiFinancial debt of approximately $10,000 as secured in his schedules; rather, he listed a debt to CitiFinancial in roughly that amount as unsecured. Wilding received a discharge, in what the Bankruptcy Judge termed \"a garden variety Chapter 7 bankruptcy no-asset case\" on February 7, 2002, and the case was closed on February 15, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of refinancing the mortgage on his residence nearly two years later in 2004, Wilding found it necessary to address CitiFinancial's lien.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As a matter of law, the lien remained in place because \"[a]lthough the unsecured portion of a secured creditor's claim may be discharged in a Chapter 7 . . . case, its lien in the collateral normally survives the bankruptcy proceeding and the discharge, and is enforceable in accordance with state law.\" <i>In re Pratt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202388\"><a href=\"/opinion/202388/pratt-v-general-motors-acc/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2006). On December 22, 2004, Wilding filed a motion to reopen his bankruptcy case for the purpose of avoiding the previously unscheduled judicial lien on his property. Before the motion to reopen was acted upon, Wilding consummated his refinancing and satisfied the lien. On December 29, 2004 a release of the lien was recorded in the Registry of Deeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Court granted the motion to reopen on January 5, 2005. On January 6, 2005, Wilding filed a motion to avoid the lien. In opposition, CitiFinancial, which had not opposed the motion to reopen, argued that the lien could not be avoided because it had been satisfied. Both the Bankruptcy Court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel concluded that since the lien was no longer in effect, there was no longer a lien which could be avoided. The Bankruptcy Court stated, \"[q]uite simply, there are no rights or justiciable property interests before the Court, and it is clearly too late to raise any.\" The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel held that \"because the lien was fully satisfied, it was no longer fixed on property of the Debtor at the time he filed his Motion to Avoid the Lien. Accordingly, it was too late to employ the benefits of &#167; 522(f) of the Code.\" <i>In re Wilding,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1913448\"><a href=\"/opinion/1913448/in-re-wilding/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 491 (1st Cir.

At first glance, the language of &#167; 522(f) might seem to support CitiFinancial's position, because the requirement that the lien \"impairs\" the exempt property is worded in the present tense.

He relies upon several cases in which courts have held that the debtor need not have an interest in the exempt property at the time the debtor files his motion to avoid to take advantage of &#167; 522(f). <i>See, e.g., Chiu,</i> 304 F.3d at 908-09; <i>In re Orr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1963334\"><a href=\"/opinion/1963334/in-re-orr/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span>, 877 (Bankr.S.D.Ill.2004) (following <i>Chiu</i>); <i>In re Mailhot,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1921572\"><a href=\"/opinion/1921572/in-re-mailhot/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 776 (Bankr.D.R.I.2003) (same); <i>In re Vincent,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1998254\"><a href=\"/opinion/1998254/in-re-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 620-21 (Bankr.

In <i>Chiu,</i> for example, the debtor sold the exempt property before filing the motion to avoid. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that the appropriate time to determine whether a debtor has an exempt interest in property is the filing of the petition, not the filing of the motion to avoid the lien. But the liens in <i>Chiu</i> and <i>Mailhot</i> were still effectively in force when the Bankruptcy Court acted upon the motion to avoid. Indeed, in both cases the debtor took care <i>not</i> to satisfy the lien in question when disposing of the exempt property; funds generated by a sale of the property were escrowed pending judicial determination of the validity of the lien. <i>See Chiu,</i> 304 F.3d at 907; <i>Mailhot,</i> 301 B.R. at 776. Thus, the liens in those cases continued to impair the equivalent of exempt property at the time the debtor filed his motion to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that do not appear on the record, Wilding failed to protect himself in that fashion. Rather, before filing his motion to avoid, Wilding consummated the refinancing transaction and satisfied the lien in full without holding the funds in escrow pending a determination by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet although the <i>Chiu</i> line of cases is distinguishable, we conclude that the lien itself need not exist at the moment the debtor files a motion to avoid for &#167; 522(f) to apply. CitiFinancial's position is based upon a narrow grammatical reading of &#167; 522(f); a broader consideration of &#167; 522 as a whole yields a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The textual touchstone for retrospective relief under &#167; 522(f) is found in the definition of \"value\" provided for by the statute. Section 522(f)(2)(a) reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this subsection, a lien shall be considered to impair an exemption to the extent that the sum of&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) the lien;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) all other liens on the property; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim if there were no liens on the property;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">exceeds the <i>value</i> that the debtor's interest in the property would have in the absence of any liens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis supplied). In &#167; 522, \"`value' means fair market value <i>as of the date of the filing of the petition</i> or, with respect to property that becomes property of the estate after such date, as of the date such property becomes property of the estate.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(a) (emphasis supplied). It would be an odd result if the statute required the court to measure the value of the property interest as of the petition date, but to measure the value of the lien as of an unrelated point in the future, for example, when the judge actually addresses a motion to avoid. We think the petition date is the operative date for determining the various &#167; 522(f) calculations. In order to determine whether a lien impairs an exemption, the Bankruptcy Court must calculate the value of the lien as of the filing of the petition. If the lien \"impairs\" the exemption on that date, the court may thereafter address whether the lien should be avoided. Consequently, it is not determinative that the lien did not exist (or, in other words, had zero value) when Wilding ultimately filed his motion to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reading comports with the mechanics of &#167; 522(f). As the Ninth Circuit in <i>Chiu</i> noted,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he operation of Section 522(f) is not to avoid a \"lien\", <i>per se,</i> although that is its practical effect in most cases. Rather, by its terms, Section 522(f) provides for the avoidance of the \"fixing\" of certain liens. To \"fix\" means to \"fasten a liability upon.\" Thus, Section 522(f) operates retrospectively to annul the <i>event</i> of fastening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Chiu,</i> 304 F.3d at 908 <i>quoting In re Vincent,</i> 260 B.R. at 617 (emphasis in original, citations omitted). We find this reasoning persuasive. Section 522(f) seeks to implement the strong public policies&#8212;in particular, \"the fresh start policy of the Code which encourages the full application of the Code's exemption provisions,\" <i>In re Quackenbos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1928090\"><a href=\"/opinion/1928090/in-re-quackenbos/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 695 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.1987)&#8212;that are at play when lien avoidance is sought. As the Supreme Court has observed, &#167; 522(f) was designed to mitigate the impact of judicial liens \"because they are a device commonly used by creditors to defeat the protection bankruptcy law accords exempt property against debts.\" <i>Farrey,</i> 500 U.S. at 297-98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112597\"><a href=\"/opinion/112597/farrey-v-sanderfoot/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1825</span></a></span>. These policies support what we conclude is the most reasonable reading of &#167; 522: that, for the purpose of retrospective relief, the value of the lien is to be calculated as of the filing of the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we hold that a debtor may avoid a judicial lien under &#167; 522(f) even if he has satisfied the lien prior to filing a motion to avoid, so long as the lien in question impaired an exemption as of the bankruptcy petition date (or the later acquired property date) as reflected in the statutory definition of \"value\" under &#167; 522.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That a court sitting in bankruptcy may deploy its equitable powers under &#167; 522 to issue an order avoiding a lien, <i>nunc pro tunc,</i> does not mean that it necessarily should exercise those powers to do so. Although &#167; 522(f) permits a debtor to avoid a lien in cases such as this, CitiFinancial might have available equitable defenses to oppose the motion to avoid. Defenses such as laches, fraud, detrimental reliance, and prejudice are often raised in opposition to a motion to reopen. It is well-settled that a Bankruptcy Judge has discretion to determine&#8212;in light of such defenses&#8212;whether to reopen a bankruptcy petition at all. <i>See, e.g., First National Bank of Park Falls v. Maley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1913993\"><a href=\"/opinion/1913993/first-nat-bank-of-park-falls-v-maley/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 567 (E.D.Wis.1991); <i>In re Procaccianti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1967624\"><a href=\"/opinion/1967624/in-re-procaccianti/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span> (Bankr.D.R.I.2000); <i>In re Walters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1989991\"><a href=\"/opinion/1989991/in-re-walters/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span>, 603 (Bankr.

But the motion to reopen stage is not the only or perhaps even the best point at which finality concerns may be addressed and balanced against the policy of the Bankruptcy Code to provide \"a fresh start\" and protect exempt property. It is at the avoidance motion stage when the relative interests of the respective parties are most fully crystallized. Thus, although applying essentially the same test as that applicable for the motion to reopen, the Bankruptcy Court must be prepared to exercise its informed discretion with respect to the motion to avoid filed after bankruptcy proceedings are closed. <i>Cf. In re Levy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1549869\"><a href=\"/opinion/1549869/in-re-levy/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span> (Bankr.D.N.J.2000) (granting a motion to reopen but denying the motion to avoid a judicial lien because relief was barred by the defense of laches).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts below did not address or calibrate the equities of granting a motion to avoid. Rather, they concluded as a matter of law that it was too late to do so. Consequently, we leave to the Bankruptcy Court in the first instance to address any equitable defenses that might be available. In that connection, we observe that the Bankruptcy Judge may establish conditions so as to avoid any demonstrable prejudice to CitiFinancial from belated avoidance of its judicial lien. <i>See, e.g., In re</i> <i>Dator,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2056678</span></span> at *3 (Bankr.

We leave to the Bankruptcy Court's informed discretion such issues as how, if at all, the costs or uncertainty of <i>post hoc</i> appraisal of the property should be factored into conditioning the availability of lien avoidance.
