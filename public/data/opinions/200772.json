Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Lynch, Lipez, and Howard,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph J.

Defendants Sunrise Medical, Inc.\n\nand Sunrise Medical HHG, Inc. (collectively, “Sunrise”) challenge\n\na jury verdict in favor of two certified nurse assistants who were\n\ninjured    at    a       Massachusetts   nursing    home    while      using   medical\n\nequipment manufactured by Sunrise.                  Sunrise contends that the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying Sunrise’s motions for judgment as\n\na matter of law and for a new trial.               We affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n\n            On July 1, 1999, Miriam Santos and Karen Bridgeforth were\n\ninjured while using a hydraulic Hoyer lift manufactured by Sunrise\n\nto   transfer        a    nursing   home   resident       from   her    bed    to   her\n\nwheelchair.1         While the plaintiffs were transferring the patient,\n\nthe lift began to tip.              The plaintiffs suffered neck and back\n\ninjuries    in       attempting     to   prevent    the    patient,     who    weighed\n\napproximately 210 pounds, from falling to the floor.\n\n            In December 2000, the plaintiffs brought the underlying\n\ndiversity action against Sunrise, asserting claims for negligence,\n\nfailure to warn, breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,\n\nand violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 93A (“Chapter 93A”).                 The case was tried before a\n\njury in July 2002.           At trial, Santos and Bridgeforth described the\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Hoyer lift has a metal frame supported by a U-shaped base\nthat can be positioned under a patient’s bed.       The patient is\nsecured in the lift by a harness attached to a boom at the top of\nthe frame.\n\n                                           -2-\n\faccident and their resulting injuries.   In addition, they called a\n\nmechanical engineer, Richard Montefusco, who testified that the\n\nlift was defective because the locking mechanism of the adjustable\n\nbase had a tendency to get “hung up” or to disengage if the lift\n\nwas moved, allowing the legs of the base to close and the lift to\n\ntip.\n\n           At the close of the plaintiffs’ case, Sunrise moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, alleging, inter alia, that Santos and\n\nBridgeforth had failed to establish a prima facie case against\n\nSunrise under any theory of liability.   The district court granted\n\nthe motion in part, disposing of the failure-to-warn counts.     At\n\nthe close of all the evidence, Sunrise unsuccessfully moved again\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law.         The remaining claims for\n\nnegligence and breach of warranty were submitted to the jury.2   By\n\nspecial verdict, the jury found Sunrise liable on both counts,\n\nawarding $600,000 to Santos and $450,000 to Bridgeforth.   Sunrise\n\nrenewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 50(b), and moved, in the alternative, for a new trial.\n\nThe district court denied the motions.   This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Chapter 93A claims, which were not subject to resolution\nby jury trial, see Wallace Motor Sales, Inc. v. American Motors\nSales Corp., 780 F.2d 1049, 1066-67 (1st Cir. 1985), were dismissed\nin September 2002 on the ground that the demand letter sent to\nSunrise provided inadequate notice of the plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n                               -3-\n\f                                   II.\n\n             Sunrise contends that the plaintiffs failed to prove a\n\nprima facie case of negligence or breach of warranty.             Challenging\n\nthe district court’s failure to enter judgment as a matter of law,\n\nSunrise argues that no reasonable jury could have reached a verdict\n\nfor the plaintiffs on the evidence presented.                  Alternatively,\n\nSunrise claims that the district court committed reversible error\n\nin (1) excluding relevant evidence providing an alternate theory of\n\ncausation, and (2) permitting the plaintiffs’ counsel to make\n\nimproper and inflammatory remarks during closing arguments.\n\n                                       A.\n\n             We review the district court’s denial of Sunrise’s motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law de novo, considering the evidence\n\nin   the   light    most   favorable    to   Santos   and     Bridgeforth   as\n\nnonmovants.     Star Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Aastar Mortgage Corp., 89\n\nF.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1996).       In so doing, we do not “consider the\n\ncredibility    of   witnesses,   resolve     conflicts   in    testimony,   or\n\nevaluate the weight of the evidence.”          Id. (quoting Wagenmann v.\n\nAdams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir. 1987)).        We reverse “only if the\n\nfacts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor\n\nof the movant that a reasonable jury could not have reached a\n\nverdict against that party.”      Id. (quoting Golden Rule Ins. Co. v.\n\nAtallah, 45 F.3d 512, 516 (1st Cir. 1995)(internal quotation\n\nomitted)).\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f              Sunrise contends first that the plaintiffs failed to\n\nestablish a causal connection between any purported design defect\n\nand   their    injuries.   Sunrise    identifies     numerous   evidentiary\n\nweaknesses in the plaintiffs’ case on causation, including the\n\nabsence of eyewitness testimony that the base of the lift actually\n\nclosed; a contemporaneous report based on the plaintiffs’ account\n\nof the accident that does not state that the base closed; and some\n\nunexplained events at the time the lift tipped (such as screws or\n\nmetal pieces hitting the floor and the handle of the lift becoming\n\ndetached).       Sunrise also questions the utility of Montefusco’s\n\ntestimony, characterizing the testimony as too speculative.              It\n\nnotes that Montefusco never conducted an accident reconstruction\n\nnor determined the amount of force necessary to tip the lift.\n\nSunrise downplays Montefusco’s testimony that the alleged design\n\ndefect caused the accident as “an out of context answer on cross-\n\nexamination.”\n\n              In denying Sunrise’s renewed motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law, the district court found that “[t]he testimony\n\nadequately conveyed that the base of the lift ‘closed up,’ causing\n\nthe instability and the accident.          The expert testimony adequately\n\ntied the ‘closing up’ to a simple design defect.                 While the\n\nevidence was not overwhelming, it was sufficient.”          We agree.\n\n              Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, a reasonable jury could have credited Santos’ testimony\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthat the base of the lift was not open to its widest position\n\nbecause of the configuration of the beds in the patient’s room;\n\nthat upon securing the patient in the harness and lifting her,\n\nSantos began to pull the lift out from under the bed and turn the\n\nlift slightly to adjust the base to its widest position; that when\n\nSantos attempted to widen the lift, it “closed” and “started\n\ntipping”; and that the plaintiffs were injured in attempting to\n\nkeep the patient from falling.\n\n          The jury could have also credited Montefusco’s testimony\n\nthat the pin and the engaging mechanism that were designed to keep\n\nthe adjustable base of the lift in a locked position could get\n\n“hung up,” or fail to engage; that moving the lift while this\n\nmechanism was disengaged and the lift was loaded could cause the\n\npin to slide into the narrowest setting; that the lift was likely\n\nto tip if the base was in its narrowest setting; that slight\n\nalterations to the shape of the pin and the engaging mechanism\n\nwould have allowed the pin to catch on the next setting, instead of\n\nslipping into the narrowest setting; that a slight lengthening of\n\nthe pin would have kept the pin from becoming disengaged; and that,\n\nas Montefusco testified on cross-examination, the accident was\n\ncaused by this design problem.\n\n          On appeal, Sunrise attacks the credibility, weight, and\n\nvalue of the plaintiffs’ evidence of causation.   But it is not the\n\nprovince of this Court to reevaluate the evidence presented at\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ftrial.   Star Financial Services, 89 F.3d at 8.         We determine only\n\nif the evidence was minimally sufficient to support the verdict.\n\nConsidering the evidence as a whole and in the light most favorable\n\nto the plaintiffs, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have\n\nfound that a design defect in the lift caused the accident that\n\ninjured Santos and Bridgeforth.\n\n           Sunrise also contends that the plaintiffs failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the lift had been properly maintained in the six\n\nyears following its manufacture.          Implicit in this argument is a\n\nmisunderstanding of the evidentiary burden imposed on a plaintiff\n\nalleging a design defect under Massachusetts law.             See Smith v.\n\nAriens Co., 375 Mass. 620, 626 (1978).        In such cases, a plaintiff\n\nneed only show that the defect existed when it left the control of\n\nthe   manufacturer.    Id.   (“No   negating     of   the   possibility   of\n\nmishandling by intermediaries is necessary.”).\n\n           At trial, Montefusco testified that, based on his review\n\nof the lift’s manuals and parts list, the lift arrived from Sunrise\n\nin three pieces, but the base of the lift (which included the\n\nlocking mechanism) came fully assembled.        The jury also heard from\n\nthe executive director of the nursing home where the accident\n\noccurred, who testified that he looked for maintenance records on\n\nthe lift and, based on the few records he located, found no\n\nevidence of any changes made to the lift other than the replacement\n\nof a hydraulic pump.    This evidence, taken together, could have\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fsupported an inference that the defect in the lift existed at the\n\ntime it left Sunrise’s control.             See, e.g. id. at 627 (finding\n\nreasonable inference that sharp metal protrusions on brakes of\n\nsnowmobile were present when product left factory when testimony\n\nestablished that although snowmobile arrived partially assembled,\n\nbrake clamps arrived riveted to handle bar); Collins v. Sears,\n\nRoebuck   &    Co.,   31   Mass.   App.    Ct.   961,   962   (1992)   (finding\n\nreasonable inference that a clothes dryer was in same condition at\n\ntime of sale as it was at time of accident when jury heard no\n\nevidence that electrical system had been repaired after purchase).\n\nAs set forth above, no more is required to sustain a design defect\n\nclaim under Massachusetts law.\n\n                                      B.\n\n              Sunrise contends that even if we reject its arguments for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, it is entitled to a new trial on the\n\nbasis of an erroneous evidentiary ruling and improper closing\n\nargument by the plaintiffs' counsel.               We review the district\n\ncourt’s evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion, a standard that\n\nallows the court “considerable latitude in determining whether to\n\nadmit or exclude evidence” under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence.      Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., Inc., 43 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 1994). “Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling\n\ncircumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate\n\nrecord, reverse a district court’s on-the-spot judgment concerning\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.”                      Id.\n\n           Sunrise      argues    that    the     district     court     committed\n\nreversible error in excluding a January 2000 letter from the\n\nplaintiffs’     counsel    to    the     Occupational      Safety      and   Health\n\nAdministration (“OSHA”).          In the letter, counsel requested an\n\ninspection of the nursing home where the plaintiffs worked “for the\n\nfailure to maintain its Hoyer Lifts resulting in personal injury to\n\nKaren Bridgeport [sic] and Miriam Santos.”                 Counsel also opined\n\nthat   “OSHA    rules   and    regulations      have   been    violated      by   the\n\nemployer.”      During its cross-examination of Bridgeforth, Sunrise\n\nsought to introduce the letter as an admission of the plaintiffs\n\nthat the cause of the occurrence was lack of maintenance of the\n\nlift, rather than any design defect.               Sunrise alleges that the\n\nletter was a critically important admission as to an alternative\n\ntheory of causation.\n\n           We    find   that     the   district    court      acted    within     its\n\ndiscretion in excluding the letter to OSHA.             Contrary to Sunrise’s\n\nassertions on appeal, the district court explained the bases for\n\nits ruling.      The court stated that the letter was cumulative of\n\ntestimony of an accident report and a complaint made by Santos, and\n\nthat it would open up an area of potential confusion for the jury,\n\nnamely OSHA’s investigation and findings with respect to the lift.\n\nThe district court also found the letter cumulative, confusing, and\n\nperhaps unfairly prejudicial to the extent that it was a statement\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fby counsel, but not necessarily by the plaintiffs.\n\n           Sunrise argued below that counsel was acting as the\n\nplaintiffs' agent when the letter was sent, and alluded to case law\n\nsupporting the letter’s admission.              The court invited Sunrise to\n\nidentify the authority to which it was referring, but ruled that in\n\nthe meantime, Sunrise could ask Bridgeforth if she recognized the\n\nletter and     question     her   about   the    source   of   the   information\n\ncontained therein if she did.         When asked, Bridgeforth stated that\n\nshe had never seen the letter before, and it was not admitted.\n\nSunrise did not raise the issue again until its motion for new\n\ntrial.    Under these facts, we cannot say the admissibility ruling\n\nconstituted reversible error.\n\n           Sunrise also contends that plaintiffs’ counsel made three\n\n“inflammatory”    statements      during     closing   argument      that   caused\n\nprejudicial error.      First, counsel argued that a small object on\n\nthe floor could have obstructed the casters on the base and caused\n\ninstability.     According to Sunrise, this argument had no basis in\n\nfact, and was an improper reference to the failure-to-warn theory\n\nof liability, which was foreclosed by the district court’s earlier\n\ndisposition of the failure-to-warn claims.                But Sunrise did not\n\nobject to this line of argument.           Thus we review it only for plain\n\nerror.    Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nWe ask whether this constituted a plain error affecting substantial\n\nrights,   and,   if   so,   whether    review     is   necessary     to   avoid   a\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fmiscarriage of justice.         Id. at 26 (“Plain error is a rare species\n\nin civil litigation, encompassing only those errors that reach the\n\npinnacle of fault envisioned by the standard set forth above.”\n\n(internal quotation omitted)).             Here, counsel’s reference to a\n\npossible obstruction had some basis in the record, including\n\ntestimony that pieces of metal, possibly screws, were found on the\n\nfloor after the accident.              Further, counsel did not suggest a\n\nfailure to warn by Sunrise; to the contrary, counsel noted that a\n\ntraining videotape that accompanied the lift in fact warned against\n\nrolling the lift over an obstruction.               We find no error, plain or\n\notherwise.\n\n           Second, Sunrise alleges that counsel made references to\n\nthe removability of the handle of the lift that were improper in\n\nlight of a pretrial ruling that certain evidence relating to the\n\nhandle   would   not    be    admitted    because     of   an   untimely   expert\n\ndisclosure.      But Sunrise’s only objection came after counsel’s\n\nstatement that the handle had been altered.                 The district court\n\nsustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard this\n\nremark. Sunrise did not object when counsel argued that the handle\n\nwas   designed   to    be    removed    when   transporting     the    lift.    We\n\ntherefore ask whether this portion of the closing argument was\n\nplainly erroneous.           See id.     Even if we assume arguendo that\n\ncounsel should     not      have   referred    to   the    handle,    Sunrise   has\n\ndemonstrated no prejudice to its substantial rights.\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f           Finally,    according    to    Sunrise,    counsel     improperly\n\nreferred to a duty to test the lift that Sunrise failed to meet.\n\nIn discussing the locking mechanism of the base, counsel stated\n\n“They didn’t test it under a dynamic load I submit,” and Sunrise\n\nobjected. The    court   asked   counsel    about    the    purpose   of   this\n\nargument and whether he was going to talk about testing.              Counsel\n\nstated that he was not going to talk about testing, and the court\n\ninstructed him to move on.       Counsel then turned to the subject of\n\nthe manufacturer’s obligation to foresee the way the product would\n\nbe used.   We assume without deciding that Sunrise’s objection was\n\nsufficient to preserve the issue for review.          But Sunrise bears a\n\nheavy burden on appeal -- it must show that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in denying Sunrise's motion for new trial\n\nbased on counsel's comment, and that prejudice has resulted.\n\nPuerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Constructora Lluch, Inc., 169\n\nF.3d 68, 81-82 (1st Cir. 1999). Considering the isolated nature of\n\nthe statement, its irrelevance to the core issues considered by the\n\njury, and the prompt limitation of the line of argument by the\n\ndistrict court, we find no error.          Id. at 82 (“In assessing the\n\neffect of improper conduct by counsel, the Court must examine the\n\ntotality   of   the   circumstances,     including    the    nature   of    the\n\ncomments, their frequency, their possible relevancy to the real\n\nissues before the jury, the manner in which the parties and the\n\ncourt treated the comments, the strength of the case, and the\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fverdict itself.”).\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\n\ndenial of Sunrise’s motions for judgment as a matter of law and new\n\ntrial.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

Sunrise also questions the utility of Montefusco's testimony, characterizing the testimony as too speculative. It notes that Montefusco never conducted an accident reconstruction nor determined the amount of force necessary to tip the lift.

But it is not the province of this Court to reevaluate the evidence presented at trial. <i>Star Financial Services,</i> 89 F.3d at 8. We determine only if the evidence was minimally sufficient to support the verdict. Considering the evidence as a whole and in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found that a design defect in the lift caused the accident that injured Santos and Bridgeforth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise also contends that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the lift had been properly maintained in the six years following its manufacture. Implicit in this argument is a misunderstanding of the evidentiary burden imposed on a plaintiff alleging a design defect under Massachusetts law. <i>See Smith v. Ariens Co.,</i> 375 Mass. 620, 626, 377 N.E.2d 954 (1978). In such cases, a plaintiff need only show that the defect existed when it left the control of the manufacturer. <i>Id.</i> (\"No negating of the possibility of mishandling by intermediaries is necessary.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Montefusco testified that, based on his review of the lift's manuals and parts list, the lift arrived from Sunrise in three pieces, but the base of the lift (which included the locking mechanism) came fully assembled. The jury also heard from the executive director of the nursing home where the accident occurred, who testified that he looked for maintenance records on the lift and, based on the few records he located, found no evidence of any changes made to the lift other than the replacement of a hydraulic pump. This evidence, taken together, could have supported an inference that the defect in the lift existed at the time it left Sunrise's control. <i>See, e.g. id.</i> at 627, 377 N.E.2d 954 (finding reasonable inference that sharp metal protrusions on brakes of snowmobile were present when product left factory when testimony established that although snowmobile arrived partially assembled, brake clamps arrived riveted to handle bar); <i>Collins v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 31 Mass.App.Ct. 961, 962, 583 N.E.2d 873 (1992) (finding reasonable inference that a clothes dryer was in same condition at time of sale as it was at time of accident when jury heard no evidence that electrical system had been repaired after purchase). As set forth above, no more is required to sustain a design defect claim under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise contends that even if we reject its arguments for judgment as a matter of law, it is entitled to a new trial on the basis of an erroneous evidentiary ruling and improper closing argument by the plaintiffs' counsel. We review the district court's evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion, a standard that allows the court \"considerable latitude in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence\" under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. <i>Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., Inc.,</i> 43 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1994). \"Only rarely&#8212;and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances&#8212;will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise argues that the district court committed reversible error in excluding a January 2000 letter from the plaintiffs' counsel to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"). In the letter, counsel requested an inspection of the nursing home where the plaintiffs worked \"for the failure to maintain its Hoyer Lifts resulting in personal injury to Karen Bridgeport [sic] and Miriam Santos.\" Counsel also opined that \"OSHA rules and regulations have been violated by the employer.\" During its cross-examination of Bridgeforth, Sunrise sought to introduce the letter as an admission of the plaintiffs that the cause of the occurrence was lack of maintenance of the lift, rather than any design defect. Sunrise alleges that the letter was a critically important admission as to an alternative theory of causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court acted within its discretion in excluding the letter to OSHA. Contrary to Sunrise's assertions on appeal, the district court explained the bases for its ruling. The court stated that the letter was cumulative of testimony of an accident report and a complaint made by Santos, and that it would open up an area of potential confusion for the jury, namely OSHA's investigation and findings with respect to the lift. The district court also found the letter cumulative, confusing, and perhaps unfairly prejudicial to the extent that it was a statement by counsel, but not necessarily by the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise argued below that counsel was acting as the plaintiffs' agent when the letter was sent, and alluded to case law supporting the letter's admission. The court invited Sunrise to identify the authority to which it was referring, but ruled that in the meantime, Sunrise could ask Bridgeforth if she recognized the letter and question her about the source of the information contained therein if she did. When asked, Bridgeforth stated that she had never seen the letter before, and it was not admitted. Sunrise did not raise the issue again until its motion for new trial. Under these facts, we cannot say the admissibility ruling constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise also contends that plaintiffs' counsel made three \"inflammatory\" statements during closing argument that caused prejudicial error. First, counsel argued that a small object on the floor could have obstructed the casters on the base and caused instability. According to Sunrise, this argument had no basis in fact, and was an improper reference to the failure-to-warn theory of liability, which was foreclosed by the district court's earlier disposition of the failure-to-warn claims. But Sunrise did not object to this line of argument. Thus we review it only for plain error. <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 25-26 (1st Cir.1999). We ask whether this constituted a plain error affecting substantial rights, and, if so, whether review is necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice. <i>Id.</i> at 26 (\"Plain error is a rare species in civil litigation, encompassing only those errors that reach the pinnacle of fault envisioned by the standard set forth above.\" (internal quotation omitted)). Here, counsel's reference to a possible obstruction had some basis in the record, including testimony that pieces of metal, possibly screws, were found on the floor after the accident. Further, counsel did not suggest a failure to warn by Sunrise; to the contrary, counsel noted that a training videotape that accompanied the lift in fact warned against rolling the lift over an obstruction. We find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Sunrise alleges that counsel made references to the removability of the handle of the lift that were improper in light of a pretrial ruling that certain evidence relating to the handle would not be admitted because of an untimely expert disclosure. But Sunrise's only objection came after counsel's statement that the handle had been <i>altered.</i> The district court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard this remark. Sunrise did not object when counsel argued that the handle was designed to be removed when transporting the lift. We therefore ask whether this portion of the closing argument was plainly erroneous. <i>See id.</i> Even if we assume <i>arguendo</i> that counsel should not have referred to the handle, Sunrise has demonstrated no prejudice to its substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, according to Sunrise, counsel improperly referred to a duty to test the lift that Sunrise failed to meet. In discussing the locking mechanism of the base, counsel stated \"They didn't test it under a dynamic load I submit,\" and Sunrise objected. The court asked counsel about the purpose of this argument and whether he was going to talk about testing. Counsel stated that he was not going to talk about testing, and the court instructed him to move on. Counsel then turned to the subject of the manufacturer's obligation to foresee the way the product would be used. We assume without deciding that Sunrise's objection was sufficient to preserve the issue for review. But Sunrise bears a heavy burden on appeal &#8212; it must show that the district court abused its discretion in denying Sunrise's motion for new trial based on counsel's comment, and that prejudice has resulted. <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Constructora Lluch, Inc.,</i> 169 F.3d 68, 81-82 (1st Cir.1999). Considering the isolated nature of the statement, its irrelevance to the core issues considered by the jury, and the prompt limitation of the line of argument by the district court, we find no error. <i>Id.</i> at 82 (\"In assessing the effect of improper conduct by counsel, the Court must examine the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the comments, their frequency, their possible relevancy to the real issues before the jury, the manner in which the parties and the court treated the comments, the strength of the case, and the verdict itself.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Sunrise's motions for judgment as a matter of law and new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Hoyer lift has a metal frame supported by a U-shaped base that can be positioned under a patient's bed.

This evidence, taken together, could have supported an inference that the defect in the lift existed at the time it left Sunrise's control. <i>See, e.g. id.</i> at 627, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2072756\"><a href=\"/opinion/2072756/smith-v-ariens-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span> (finding reasonable inference that sharp metal protrusions on brakes of snowmobile were present when product left factory when testimony established that although snowmobile arrived partially assembled, brake clamps arrived riveted to handle bar); <i>Collins v.

As set forth above, no more is required to sustain a design defect claim under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise contends that even if we reject its arguments for judgment as a matter of law, it is entitled to a new trial on the basis of an erroneous evidentiary ruling and improper closing argument by the plaintiffs' counsel. We review the district court's evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion, a standard that allows the court \"considerable latitude in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence\" under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. <i>Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685127\"><a href=\"/opinion/685127/41-fed-r-evid-serv-94-prodliabrep-cch-p-14121-william-and-rita/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1994). \"Only rarely&#8212;and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances&#8212;will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise argues that the district court committed reversible error in excluding a January 2000 letter from the plaintiffs' counsel to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"). In the letter, counsel requested an inspection of the nursing home where the plaintiffs worked \"for the failure to maintain its Hoyer Lifts resulting in personal injury to Karen Bridgeport [sic] and Miriam Santos.\" Counsel also opined that \"OSHA rules and regulations have been violated by the employer.\" During its cross-examination of Bridgeforth, Sunrise sought to introduce the letter as an admission of the plaintiffs that the cause of the occurrence was lack of maintenance of the lift, rather than any design defect. Sunrise alleges that the letter was a critically important admission as to an alternative theory of causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court acted within its discretion in excluding the letter to OSHA. Contrary to Sunrise's assertions on appeal, the district court explained the bases for its ruling. The court stated that the letter was cumulative of testimony of an accident report and a complaint made by Santos, and that it would open up an area of potential confusion for the jury, namely OSHA's investigation and findings with respect to the lift. The district court also found the letter cumulative, confusing, and perhaps unfairly prejudicial to the extent that it was a statement by counsel, but not necessarily by the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise argued below that counsel was acting as the plaintiffs' agent when the letter was sent, and alluded to case law supporting the letter's admission. The court invited Sunrise to identify the authority to which it was referring, but ruled that in the meantime, Sunrise could ask Bridgeforth if she recognized the letter and question her about the source of the information contained therein if she did. When asked, Bridgeforth stated that she had never seen the letter before, and it was not admitted. Sunrise did not raise the issue again until its motion for new trial. Under these facts, we cannot say the admissibility ruling constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunrise also contends that plaintiffs' counsel made three \"inflammatory\" statements during closing argument that caused prejudicial error. First, counsel argued that a small object on the floor could have obstructed the casters on the base and caused instability. According to Sunrise, this argument had no basis in fact, and was an improper reference to the failure-to-warn theory of liability, which was foreclosed by the district court's earlier disposition of the failure-to-warn claims. But Sunrise did not object to this line of argument. Thus we review it only for plain error. <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198473\"><a href=\"/opinion/198473/smith-v-k-mart-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25-26 (1st Cir.1999). We ask whether this constituted a plain error affecting substantial rights, and, if so, whether review is necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice. <i>Id.</i> at 26 (\"Plain error is a rare species in civil litigation, encompassing only those errors that reach the pinnacle of fault envisioned by the standard set forth above.\" (internal quotation omitted)). Here, counsel's reference to a possible obstruction had some basis in the record, including testimony that pieces of metal, possibly screws, were found on the floor after the accident. Further, counsel did not suggest a failure to warn by Sunrise; to the contrary, counsel noted that a training videotape that accompanied the lift in fact warned against rolling the lift over an obstruction. We find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Sunrise alleges that counsel made references to the removability of the handle of the lift that were improper in light of a pretrial ruling that certain evidence relating to the handle would not be admitted because of an untimely expert disclosure. But Sunrise's only objection came after counsel's statement that the handle had been <i>altered.</i> The district court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard this remark. Sunrise did not object when counsel argued that the handle was designed to be removed when transporting the lift. We therefore ask whether this portion of the closing argument was plainly erroneous. <i>See id.</i> Even if we assume <i>arguendo</i> that counsel should not have referred to the handle, Sunrise has demonstrated no prejudice to its substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, according to Sunrise, counsel improperly referred to a duty to test the lift that Sunrise failed to meet. In discussing the locking mechanism of the base, counsel stated \"They didn't test it under a dynamic load I submit,\" and Sunrise objected. The court asked counsel about the purpose of this argument and whether he was going to talk about testing. Counsel stated that he was not going to talk about testing, and the court instructed him to move on. Counsel then turned to the subject of the manufacturer's obligation to foresee the way the product would be used. We assume without deciding that Sunrise's objection was sufficient to preserve the issue for review. But Sunrise bears a heavy burden on appeal &#8212; it must show that the district court abused its discretion in denying Sunrise's motion for new trial based on counsel's comment, and that prejudice has resulted. <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v.
