Leo T. Sorokin, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Terry Klein, with whom Henshon Parker Vyadro P.C. was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     James G. Grillo, with whom Patrick J. Sullivan and Heaftiz &\nSullivan were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 19, 2007\n\f            STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.          This diversity case arises\n\nout of a common situation in commercial dealings: the failure of\n\nnegotiations and the resulting bad blood between the parties.\n\nHere, after a protracted -- and ultimately failed -- nine-month\n\nnegotiation    between    a     general       contractor    and     a   potential\n\nsubcontractor, the general contractor brought suit against the\n\nsubcontractor for breach of contract, claiming that at some point\n\nduring the negotiations a binding contract had been formed.                After\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment on the question of contract\n\nformation,    the   district    court    ruled    in   favor   of   the   general\n\ncontractor.      Because we hold that no contract was formed, we\n\nreverse.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            TLT Construction Corp. (\"TLT\"), a Massachusetts company,\n\nwas the general contractor on renovation and expansion projects for\n\nReading    Memorial   High     School    in    Reading,    Massachusetts    (the\n\n\"Reading Project\"), and Wachusett Regional High School in Holden,\n\nMassachusetts (the \"Wachusett Project\"). In April 2004, as TLT was\n\npreparing its bid for the Reading Project, RI Inc., d/b/a Seating\n\nSolutions (\"Seating\"), a New York company specializing in selling\n\nand installing spectator seating for athletic facilities, submitted\n\na bid to TLT to install bleachers for the Reading Project as a\n\nsubcontractor.      In its proposal, Seating stated, \"We have worked\n\nvery closely with this architect and have helped them design this\n\n                                        -2-\n\fbleacher from the very first steps.\"          On the record before us, it\n\ndoes not appear that Seating's bid was a filed sub-bid, nor does\n\nTLT makes such a claim.        See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, ยง 44F.\n\n           On May 10, 2004, TLT, having been awarded both the\n\nReading and the Wachusett Projects, requested that Seating submit\n\na new quote that would include both projects.            On May 12, Seating\n\nquoted a price of nearly $568,000 for both.         TLT responded that the\n\nprice was too high, and Seating replied on May 17 with a revised\n\nquote of $480,000.      Seating said that the price was \"contingent on\n\na letter of intent being received [May 18] and an AIA contract\n\nbeing   executed   by   Friday.\"       TLT   responded   that   day,   seeking\n\nclarification of a few terms, including whether or not bonding was\n\nincluded in the quote, since a bond was required and had been\n\nincluded   in   the   quotes    from   Seating's   competitors.        Seating\n\nresponded later that day that bonding was not included in the\n\nquote, and that it did not feel bonding was necessary, since it\n\nwould be paid in progress payments.          TLT replied, \"We have a deal\n\nif we can split the bond\" and if TLT could have retainage of 5%\n\n(Seating had originally proposed no retainage). TLT also said that\n\nit would not be able to draft a contract in Seating's time frame,\n\nbut that it could provide a letter of intent.             Seating agreed to\n\naccept a letter of intent, and granted TLT two weeks to draft and\n\nexecute a final contract, but said that it could not hold the price\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fany longer than that.   On the record before us, it appears that no\n\nletter of intent was ever sent.\n\n            Rather, four days later, on May 21, 2004, TLT sent\n\nSeating a draft contract,1 along with manuals and specifications,\n\nand asked that the contract be signed and returned within five\n\ndays, along with payment and performance bonds and certificates of\n\ninsurance.    The contract package included standard bond forms.\n\n            The record becomes more opaque at this point. It appears\n\nthat a revised draft contract may have been sent on June 7, but\n\nthat draft does not appear in the record.2   A handwritten notation\n\non the cover letter to the May 21 draft contract shows that the\n\nsame cover letter may have been resent on June 7, with the only\n\nchange being that a previous line asking for return of the payment\n\nand performance bonds had been excised.      The record contains no\n\nresponse from Seating with respect to either contract until TLT\n\ncontacted Seating on June 21 to request return of the signed\n\ncontract.\n\n            On June 22, Seating wrote to TLT to say that it had\n\nseveral issues with the draft contract.    First, Seating said that\n\nit had understood that no bonding would be required, and that there\n\n\n\n     1\n      TLT actually sent two contracts, one for each project.\nBecause the differences between the contracts are not relevant to\nthis appeal, we treat them as one contract for simplicity.\n     2\n      We are assuming that the draft contract in the record dated\nMay 21 is the May 21 draft contract, not the June 7 revised draft.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fwould be a 10% retainage in lieu of bonding.        Second, Seating\n\nwanted to clarify the timing for submission of shop drawings.\n\nThird, Seating said that its quote was made using prevailing wages,\n\nnot union labor, and if TLT were to require union labor (as the May\n\n21 draft contract did), then there would be a price increase.\n\nFourth, Seating noted that the quote was exclusive of taxes,\n\npermits, and fees.   This letter was apparently returned to Seating\n\nwith notations by TLT, but that response is not in the record.\n\n          On June 28, Seating wrote to TLT, responding to TLT's\n\nnotations to Seating's June 22 letter, saying that after \"only a\n\nfew comments\" it could \"get this thing executed.\"    First, Seating\n\nsaid that its insurance company would not make a certain change to\n\nthe language on the certificates that TLT had presumably requested.\n\nSecond, it said that an umbrella policy was cost-prohibitive.\n\nThird, it requested a six-week time frame for return of engineered\n\nshop drawings.   On June 29, TLT accepted the first two changes, but\n\ndid not reply to the third.   TLT also requested that Seating mark\n\nup the original contract with these changes and return it to TLT.\n\n          On July 5, Seating returned a marked-up version of the\n\nMay 21 draft contract.    The changes covered five areas.    First,\n\nSeating struck all language related to payment and performance\n\nbonds and struck out the bonding forms that had been attached.\n\nSecond, Seating struck the language requiring union labor.   Third,\n\nSeating struck the language requiring that insurance coverage be\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f\"in the same Limits as required by the Owner's contract of the\n\ngeneral contractor,\" and inserted language that Seating's \"standard\n\ninsurance limits to apply to this contract.\"       Fourth, Seating\n\nstruck the language making it responsible for permits and fees\n\n(though it kept the language making it responsible for taxes).\n\nFifth, Seating added language saying that it would provide shop\n\ndrawings within six weeks of receiving the executed contract. With\n\nthese changes, Seating signed the draft contract and returned it to\n\nTLT. TLT neither signed nor returned this version of the contract.\n\n          The next writing in the record, perhaps after some verbal\n\ncommunication between the parties, is a July 12 letter from Seating\n\nto TLT.   The letter provided a break-down of additional cost if\n\nunion labor was to be required.    Then the letter continued:\n\n          Regarding the bonding, it was agreed that 10%\n          retainage would be held in lew [sic] of\n          bonding. We will bond this and pass the cost\n          along to you as an add-on to the contract.\n          When bonding is required we reserve the right,\n          depending on our current bonding capacity at\n          that time[,] to have our factory supply the\n          required bonds.\n\n          The letter closed, \"If all is acceptable please forward\n\nnew contracts for us to execute.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            On July 21, TLT sent a new draft contract to Seating.3\n\nThe draft no longer required union labor, but it was otherwise\n\nunchanged with respect to Seating's July 5 edits.\n\n            On July 29, TLT wrote to Seating to request the return of\n\nthe signed contracts.     On August 13, Seating wrote to say that its\n\nprice would have to increase by $19,236 to account for an I-beam\n\nthat it had not realized was in the plans.\n\n            On   August   18,   Seating   provided      a   certification    of\n\ninsurance from Outdoor Aluminum, an affiliated company that ran\n\nSeating's factory, asking if it was \"acceptable.\" In addition, the\n\nletter said, \"Per our conversation, bonding will not be an issue.\n\nThey [Outdoor Aluminum] bond many projects [for] us and unless\n\nthere is something out of the ordinary all will be done.\"\n\n            On August 19, TLT wrote back to challenge the price\n\nincrease, saying that Seating had the specifications showing the I-\n\nbeam when it made the bid.      At that point, relations deteriorated.\n\nOver the next few months, the parties continued to try to reach\n\nagreement,   but   with   decreasing      levels   of   cooperation.        TLT\n\nultimately had the work performed by another company, at a cost of\n\n$514,160.\n\n            In December 2004, TLT brought suit in Massachusetts state\n\ncourt for breach of contract and violation of the Massachusetts\n\n\n     3\n      Only the contract for the Wachusett Project is in the record,\nso we assume that its terms mirror the July 21 draft contract for\nthe Reading Project.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fconsumer protection law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, ยง 11.                       Seating\n\nremoved the case to the United State District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts on February 3, 2005.                   The parties agreed\n\nto have the case tried by a magistrate judge.                     The parties then\n\ncross-moved       for   summary    judgment       on   the      issue   of   contract\n\nformation.     The district court held that a contract existed and\n\nthat Seating had breached.4            The court awarded damages of $34,160.5\n\nSeating now appeals.\n\n                                  II. Discussion\n\n            We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, with all reasonable inferences resolved in favor of\n\nSeating.    See Fenton v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 400 F.3d\n\n83,   87   (1st    Cir.   2005).        Although    the    question     of   contract\n\nformation is typically a question for the factfinder, and would\n\nthus be subject to clear error review, see Crellin Tech., Inc. v\n\nEquipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1994), where \"the\n\nevidentiary       foundation     for    determining       the    formation    of   the\n\nparties'     contract     [is]     either       undisputed      or   consist[s]     of\n\nwritings,\" contract formation is instead a question of law for the\n\ncourt, Lambert v. Kysar, 983 F.2d 1110, 1114 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\n\n      4\n      The court also denied summary judgment on the 93A claim.\nFollowing a bench trial, the court found that Seating had not\nviolated 93A. That claim is not relevant to this appeal.\n      5\n      We note that, including the original 93A claims, the amount\nin controversy originally pleaded satisfied the jurisdictional\nrequirement. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fsee Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 412\n\nF.3d 215, 229 (1st Cir. 2005); Jewelers Mut. Ins. Co. v. N.\n\nBarquet, Inc., 410 F.3d 2, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2005).           Here, both\n\nparties moved for summary judgment on the basis of undisputed\n\nfacts.6\n\n          Under   Massachusetts    law   of   contract,   it   is   well\n\nestablished that \"the fact that parties contemplate the execution\n\nof a final written agreement effects a strong inference that the\n\nparties do not intend to be bound by earlier negotiations or\n\nagreements until the final terms are settled.\"     Rosenfield v. U.S.\n\nTrust Co., 290 Mass. 210, 195 N.E. 323, 325 (1935); see McCarthy v.\n\n\n\n     6\n      TLT argues, in so many words, that the fact of cross-motions\nfor summary judgment meant that the parties had submitted the case\nas a \"case stated,\" and thus that clear error review should apply.\nSee Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 643\n(1st Cir. 2000). In a case stated, the parties waive trial and\npresent the case to the court on the undisputed facts in the pre-\ntrial record. The court is then entitled to \"engage in a certain\namount of factfinding, including the drawing of inferences.\"\nUnited Paperworkers Int'l Union Local 14 v. Int'l Paper Co., 64\nF.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1995). Such findings would then be subject\nto clear error review. Id. at 32. However, in cases where the\nparties have not explicitly presented their case to the court as a\ncase stated, we must \"inquire into the intentions of the parties\nand the district court judge.\"     Garcia-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 644.\nSuch an inquiry should be done \"quite carefully,\" id. at 644 n.44,\nfor such cases are \"somewhat unusual,\" United Paperworkers, 64 F.3d\nat 31. The fact that cross-motions were filed is not dispositive.\nJewelers, 410 F.3d at 10. Here, we see no indications beyond the\nfiling of cross-motions that the parties intended this to be a case\nstated.   Indeed, a bench trial on the 93A claim followed the\nresolution of the contract claim. Furthermore, it's not clear that\na different standard of review would apply here, since the question\nwe face is a legal one, see id. at 9-10, and thus still subject to\nde novo review, United Paperworkers, 64 F.3d at 32.\n\n                                  -9-\n\fTobin, 429 Mass. 84, 706 N.E.2d 629, 632 (1999).        \"If, however, the\n\nparties orally agree to the essential terms of the transaction, it\n\nmay be inferred that they intended to bind themselves at that time\n\nand that the 'writing to be drafted and delivered is a mere\n\nmemorial of the contract, which is already final by the earlier\n\nmutual assent of the parties to those terms.'\"          Novel Iron Works,\n\nInc. v. Wexler Constr. Co., 26 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 528 N.E.2d 142,\n\n146 (1988) (quoting Rosenfield, 195 N.E. at 325); see McCarthy, 706\n\nN.E.2d at 632.     \"It is not required that all terms of the agreement\n\nbe   precisely    specified,   and     the   presence   of   undefined    or\n\nunspecified terms will not necessarily preclude the formation of a\n\nbinding contract.\" Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. Malouf, Inc., 430\n\nMass. 875, 724 N.E.2d 699, 703 (2000). \"The parties must, however,\n\nhave progressed beyond the stage of 'imperfect negotiation.'\"            Id.\n\n(quoting Lafayette Place Assocs. v. Boston Redev. Auth., 427 Mass.\n\n509, 694 N.E.2d 820, 826 (1998)); see Rosenfield, 195 N.E. at 326.\n\n          In a case such as this, with faxes, phone discussions,\n\nand multiple draft contracts going back and forth over nearly eight\n\nmonths, it is worth taking a step back to recall that \"[t]here is\n\nno surer way to find out what parties meant, than to see what they\n\nhave done.\"      Pittsfield & N. Adams R.R. Corp. v. Boston & Albany\n\nR.R. Co., 260 Mass. 390, 157 N.E. 611, 614 (1927) (quoting Brooklyn\n\nLife Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Dutcher, 95 U.S. 269, 273 (1877))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see T.F. v. B.L., 442 Mass.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f522, 813 N.E.2d 1244, 1248 (2004).      With this in mind, we note two\n\nthings about the instant case.\n\n          First, at no point did either party behave as if it had\n\na contract.     Indeed, negotiations continued for nearly six months\n\nafter the date TLT claims a contract was formed.         TLT does not\n\nappear to have taken any action in reliance on a contract having\n\nbeen formed.     See Novel Iron Works, 528 N.E.2d at 146-47 (party\n\nsuccessfully asserting contract formation was told it was the\n\ngeneral contractor, came up with drawings and specifications,\n\nsolicited bids from subcontractors, was authorized to purchase\n\nmaterials, obtained a building permit, etc.).     TLT appears to have\n\nfirst approached litigation from a theory of a general contractor's\n\nreliance on a subcontractor's bid.       See Loranger Constr. Co. v.\n\nE.F. Hauserman Co., 376 Mass. 757, 384 N.E.2d 176, 179 (1978).     It\n\nultimately pursued the contract theory after it became clear that\n\nLoranger did not apply.\n\n          Second, the record shows that obtaining signed contracts\n\nwas important to TLT.    TLT repeatedly pressed Seating for executed\n\ncontracts, stating that it would not proceed with the project\n\nwithout them.    This suggests that the parties did not intend to be\n\nbound before executing a final written agreement.     See Rosenfield,\n\n195 N.E. at 325; see also Salem Laundry Co. v. N.E. Teamsters &\n\nTrucking Indus. Pension Fund, 829 F.2d 278, 280 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(\"Parties can agree on every term in a contract, yet not be bound\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\funtil they sign a written agreement, if they so indicate.\"); Bates\n\nv. Southgate, 308 Mass. 170, 31 N.E.2d 551, 553 (1941) (\"Even\n\nthough previous oral conversations would be enough in themselves to\n\nestablish an oral contract the parties may, nevertheless, by mutual\n\nunderstanding postpone the culmination of their negotiations into\n\na contract to the later preparation and delivery of a written\n\ninstrument.\"); Tull v. Mister Donut Dev. Corp., 7 Mass. App. Ct.\n\n626, 389 N.E.2d 447, 451 (1979) (\"Businessmen would be undesirably\n\ninhibited in their dealings if expressions of intent and the\n\nexchange of drafts were taken as legally binding agreements.\").\n\n          Neither of these points necessarily precludes a holding\n\nthat a contract had formed. But neither will a failed negotiation,\n\neven one that causes damage to one or both parties, be necessarily\n\na breach of contract.\n\n          Both parties acknowledge that the negotiations were drawn\n\nout and involved a series of offers and counteroffers.      Seating\n\nargues that this is all it was, and that no offer was ever\n\naccepted, because each response was only a counteroffer.    The May\n\n21 draft contract was an offer, and Seating's return of it on July\n\n5 with excisions was a counteroffer.   This was followed by the July\n\n21 draft contract from TLT, which, since it embodied different\n\nterms from the edited July 5 draft, was yet another counteroffer.\n\n          TLT argues that the July 5 edited draft that Seating\n\nreturned actually embodied terms already agreed to in faxes and\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fdiscussions, and the draft was thus an acceptance of TLT's offer.\n\nBut we do not see from the record how this could be, since there is\n\nno record evidence that any of the five issues raised by the July\n\n5 edits had previously been agreed upon.             Seating had raised the\n\nissues of permits and fees, bonding, union labor, and timing of\n\nshop drawings prior to returning the draft contract on July 5, but\n\nthe record shows no response from TLT on these issues before July\n\n5.   Furthermore, the issue of insurance limits had not been raised\n\npreviously at all.        The issues of permits and fees, insurance\n\nlimits, and timing of shop drawings went completely unaddressed\n\nbetween July 5 and July 21, and the original terms remained in the\n\nsupposedly \"clean\" July 21 draft contract that TLT sent to Seating,\n\ndespite Seating's excision of those terms on July 5.\n\n            On the issue of bonding, TLT itself argues (contrary to\n\nits assertion that the July 5 agreement is binding), that the\n\nbonding issue was not agreed upon until July 12.            In a letter sent\n\nby   fax   on   that   day,   Seating,   according    to   TLT,   dropped   its\n\ninsistence on having progress payments with 10% retainage in lieu\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fof bonding, and instead agreed to bond the project.7               We see it\n\ndifferently.\n\n           It   is   a   reasonable   inference   --   and    we   take   all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of Seating -- that this was still\n\njust a step in the negotiation, rather than a final acquiescence.\n\nSeating notes that it understood that \"it was agreed that 10%\n\nretainage would be held in [lieu] of bonding,\" thus acknowledging\n\na continuing dispute on the issue.        Furthermore, the letter also\n\nstates that \"[w]hen bonding is required we reserve the right . . .\n\nto have our factory supply the required bonds.\"              With this last\n\nsentence Seating seems to acknowledge that bonding may or may not\n\nbe required.    The letter also brings up, for the first time in the\n\nrecord, a request that the bonding be done through Seating's\n\nfactory.   Given the importance of bonding in the construction\n\nindustry, such a request could be a material change in terms,\n\nmaking the July 12 letter just another counteroffer.            There is no\n\n\n     7\n      The district court viewed the July 12 letter as consistent\nwith the July 5 excisions.     The court stated that \"in lieu of\nbonding, TLT would hold 10% retainage, which Seating would then\nbond through its factory, Outdoor Aluminum.\" First, we note that\nthis is not consistent with the fact that the bonding language\nremained in the July 21 draft contract; either the language is in,\nor it is out -- it cannot be both. Second, we believe that the\ndistrict court's finding is internally inconsistent. One cannot\nsay that there is both bonding, and retainage \"in lieu of bonding.\"\nIt does not make sense to say that a party will bond a retainage.\nTherefore, we believe that the most that can be said of the July 12\nletter is that it represented Seating's acquiescence on the issue\nof retainage and agreement to bond the project instead. TLT takes\nessentially this position, in contrast to the district court's\nfinding.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fevidence of this issue being discussed further between the parties\n\nuntil August 18.\n\n            TLT claims that \"it is [the July 5] contract[] which TLT\n\nseeks to enforce.        All of the Parties' subsequent communications\n\nmerely entailed hammering out minor details.\"               While \"[a] written\n\ncontract, signed by only one party, may be binding and enforceable\n\neven   without    the    other    party's    signature     if   the   other   party\n\nmanifests acceptance,\" Haufler v. Zotos, 446 Mass. 489, 845 N.E.2d\n\n322, 331 (2006), we see no manifestation of acceptance here.                   The\n\nonly communication in the record from TLT following the receipt of\n\nthe July 5 draft contract is the July 21 draft contract, which on\n\nits face does not accept all of the terms of the July 5 draft\n\ncontract.   In addition, there is no evidence in the record that TLT\n\ntook any actions that could be construed as manifesting acceptance.\n\nFurthermore, TLT's position that the July 5 draft contract should\n\nbe binding is contrary to TLT's assertion that the inclusion of the\n\nbonding language in the July 21 agreement reflected the agreement\n\nof the parties, an agreement purportedly made after July 5.                     The\n\nposition that the July 5 draft was binding and the position that\n\nbonding was required cannot be reconciled.\n\n            The   only    issue    that     appears   to   have   actually     been\n\nresolved during this period was the issue of union labor.                 Seating\n\nsaid that its bid was calculated using non-union wages, and that a\n\nunion requirement would raise the price of the project.                         TLT\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fremoved the union labor requirement from the July 21 draft contract\n\n-- the only one of Seating's five requested changes that TLT made.\n\nBut because there is nothing in the record showing an agreement on\n\nthis issue prior to July 5, it is a reasonable inference that the\n\nJuly 5 excision of union terms was an offer, with the July 21 draft\n\nbeing TLT's acceptance (of that term alone).8\n\n          Thus, summary judgment in favor of TLT should not have\n\nbeen granted.   Furthermore, even taking all reasonable inferences\n\nin favor of TLT, we hold that no contract was formed.9       As we\n\ndiscussed above, there is no evidence in the record that the\n\nparties came to an agreement prior to July 5 on any of the issues\n\nraised by Seating in the July 5 draft contract.   The later removal\n\nof the union language may lead to an inference that an agreement on\n\nthat issue had been reached earlier, but there was still no\n\nagreement on bonding until July 12 at the earliest. Therefore, the\n\nJuly 5 draft cannot be viewed as an acceptance of an offer.\n\nFurthermore, by July 12, the issues of insurance limits, permits\n\nand fees, and timing of shop drawings were still unresolved.\n\nIndeed, their inclusion in the July 21 draft can only lead to the\n\n\n\n     8\n      The affidavit of Thomas V. Kostinden, the president of TLT,\ndoes not indicate when TLT agreed not to require union labor.\n     9\n      The parties agree that there are no material facts in\ndispute. Seating moved for summary judgment below and argued on\nappeal that it was entitled to an entry of judgment because the\nevidence could only lead to the conclusion that there was no\ncontract. We agree.\n\n                               -16-\n\fconclusion that the issues had not been agreed upon.   While we do\n\nnot hold that each of these terms individually was necessarily\n\nmaterial, the fact that four out of five requested changes to the\n\ncontract were not made, coupled with the fact that having a signed,\n\nwritten contract was clearly important to both parties, leads us to\n\nhold that there was no meeting of the minds before Seating changed\n\nits offer price on August 13.\n\n           Our decision today is in part a result of the complexity\n\nof the negotiations, which is reflected in some inconsistencies in\n\nthe district court's opinion. For example, the district court said\n\nat various points that: there was \"an agreement in principle\" on\n\nMay 17, 2004; that the parties were beyond \"imperfect negotiation\"\n\nand that \"[t]he essential terms of the agreement had been reached\"\n\nas of July 5; and that the parties agreed to bonding terms on July\n\n12.   These three findings show the confusion of the process and in\n\na sense are contradictory.    Because the district court does not\n\npinpoint with precision the point at which the contract was formed,\n\nwe are inclined to view with some skepticism its conclusion.\n\n           Furthermore, the district court found that the insurance\n\nissue had been agreed to prior to July 5.     But the evidence for\n\nthis, a June 28 letter, does not deal with insurance limits at all.\n\nThe parties only discuss the language in the certificates and the\n\nnecessity of umbrella insurance.       Finally, the district court\n\nexplains the non-inclusion in the July 21 draft of Seating's\n\n\n                                -17-\n\frequested language on permits and fees, insurance limits, and\n\ntiming of shop drawings as \"apparent mistakes in editing.\"          This\n\ndespite the fact that, on the record before us, none of these three\n\nissues was ever discussed.\n\n                           III. Conclusion\n\n          For   the   foregoing   reasons,   we   reverse   the   summary\n\njudgment order of the district court and remand with instructions\n\nthat summary judgment be entered in favor of Seating.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.     Each side to bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f",

Here, after a protracted &#8212; and ultimately failed &#8212; nine-month negotiation between a general contractor and a potential subcontractor, the general contractor brought suit against the subcontractor for breach of contract, claiming that at some point during the negotiations a binding contract had been formed. After cross-motions for summary judgment on the question of contract formation, the district court ruled in favor of the general contractor. Because we hold that no contract was formed, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TLT Construction Corp. (\"TLT\"), a Massachusetts company, was the general contractor on renovation and expansion projects for Reading Memorial High School in Reading, Massachusetts (the \"Reading Project\"), and Wachusett Regional High School in Holden, Massachusetts (the \"Wachusett Project\"). In April 2004, as TLT was preparing its bid for the Reading Project, RI Inc., d/b/a Seating Solutions (\"Seating\"), a New York company specializing in selling and installing spectator seating for athletic facilities, submitted a bid to TLT to install bleachers for the Reading Project as a subcontractor. In its proposal, Seating stated, \"We have worked very closely with this architect and have helped them design this bleacher from the very first steps.\" On the record before us, it does not appear that Seating's bid was a filed sub-bid, nor does TLT makes such a claim. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 44F.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 2004, TLT, having been awarded both the Reading and the Wachusett Projects, requested that Seating submit a new quote that would include both projects. On May 12, Seating quoted a price of nearly $568,000 for both. TLT responded that the price was too high, and Seating replied on May 17 with a revised quote of $480,000. Seating said that the price was \"contingent on a letter of intent being received [May 18] and an AIA contract being executed by Friday.\" TLT responded that day, seeking clarification of a few terms, including whether or not bonding was included in the quote, since a bond was required and had been included in the quotes from Seating's competitors. Seating responded later that day that bonding was not included in the quote, and that it did not feel bonding was necessary, since it would be paid in progress payments. TLT replied, \"We have a deal if we can split the bond\" and if TLT could have retainage of 5% (Seating had originally proposed no retainage). TLT also said that it would not be able to draft a contract in Seating's time frame, but that it could provide a letter of intent. Seating agreed to accept a letter of intent, and granted TLT two weeks to draft and execute a final contract, but said that it could not hold the price any longer than that. On the record before us, it appears that no letter of intent was ever sent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, four days later, on May 21, 2004, TLT sent Seating a draft contract,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> along with manuals and specifications, and asked that the contract be signed and returned within five days, along with payment and performance bonds and certificates of insurance. The contract package included standard bond forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record becomes more opaque at this point. It appears that a revised draft contract may have been sent on June 7, but that draft does not appear in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A handwritten notation on the cover letter to the May 21 draft contract shows that the same cover letter may have been resent on June 7, with the only change being that a previous line asking for return of the payment and performance bonds had been excised. The record contains no response from Seating with respect to either contract until TLT contacted Seating on June 21 to request return of the signed contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, Seating wrote to TLT to say that it had several issues with the draft contract. First, Seating said that it had understood that no bonding would be required, and that there would be a 10% retainage in lieu of bonding. Second, Seating wanted to clarify the timing for submission of shop drawings. Third, Seating said that its quote was made using prevailing wages, not union labor, and if TLT were to require union labor (as the May 21 draft contract did), then there would be a price increase. Fourth, Seating noted that the quote was exclusive of taxes, permits, and fees. This letter was apparently returned to Seating with notations by TLT, but that response is not in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, Seating wrote to TLT, responding to TLT's notations to Seating's June 22 letter, saying that after \"only a few comments\" it could \"get this thing executed.\" First, Seating said that its insurance company would not make a certain change to the language on the certificates that TLT had presumably requested. Second, it said that an umbrella policy was cost-prohibitive. Third, it requested a six-week time frame for return of engineered shop drawings. On June 29, TLT accepted the first two changes, but did not reply to the third. TLT also requested that Seating mark up the original contract with these changes and return it to TLT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 5, Seating returned a marked-up version of the May 21 draft contract. The changes covered five areas. First, Seating struck all language related to payment and performance bonds and struck out the bonding forms that had been attached. Second, Seating struck the language requiring union labor. Third, Seating struck the language requiring that insurance coverage be \"in the same Limits as required by the Owner's contract of the general contractor,\" and inserted language that Seating's \"standard insurance limits to apply to this contract.\" Fourth, Seating struck the language making it responsible for permits and fees (though it kept the language making it responsible for taxes). Fifth, Seating added language saying that it would provide shop drawings within six weeks of receiving the executed contract. With these changes, Seating signed the draft contract and returned it to TLT. TLT neither signed nor returned this version of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next writing in the record, perhaps after some verbal communication between the parties, is a July 12 letter from Seating to TLT. The letter provided a break-down of additional cost if union labor was to be required. Then the letter continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the bonding, it was agreed that 10% retainage would be held in lew [sic] of bonding. We will bond this and pass the cost along to you as an add-on to the contract. When bonding is required we reserve the right, depending on our current bonding capacity at that time[,] to have our factory supply the required bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter closed, \"If all is acceptable please forward new contracts for us to execute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 21, TLT sent a new draft contract to Seating.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The draft no longer required union labor, but it was otherwise unchanged with respect to Seating's July 5 edits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 29, TLT wrote to Seating to request the return of the signed contracts. On August 13, Seating wrote to say that its price would have to increase by $19,236 to account for an I-beam that it had not realized was in the plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 18, Seating provided a certification of insurance from Outdoor Aluminum, an affiliated company that ran Seating's factory, asking if it was \"acceptable.\" In addition, the letter said, \"Per our conversation, bonding will not be an issue. They [Outdoor Aluminum] bond many projects [for] us and unless there is something out of the ordinary all will be done.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, TLT wrote back to challenge the price increase, saying that Seating had the specifications showing the I-beam when it made the bid. At that point, relations deteriorated. Over the next few months, the parties continued to try to reach agreement, but with decreasing levels of cooperation. TLT ultimately had the work performed by another company, at a cost of $514,160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2004, TLT brought suit in Massachusetts state court for breach of contract and violation of the Massachusetts consumer protection law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 11. Seating removed the case to the United State District Court for the District of Massachusetts on February 3, 2005. The parties agreed to have the case tried by a magistrate judge. The parties then cross-moved for summary judgment on the issue of contract formation. The district court held that a contract existed and that Seating had breached.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court awarded damages of $34,160.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Seating now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> with all reasonable inferences resolved in favor of Seating. <i>See Fenton v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 400 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir.2005). Although the question of contract formation is typically a question for the factfinder, and would thus be subject to clear error review, <i>see Crellin Tech., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp.,</i> 18 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994), where \"the evidentiary foundation for determining the formation of the parties' contract [is] either undisputed or consist[s] of writings,\" contract formation is instead a question of law for the court, <i>Lambert v. Kysar,</i> 983 F.2d 1110, 1114 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see Mass. Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc.,</i> 412 F.3d 215, 229 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Jewelers Mut. Ins. Co. v. N. Barquet, Inc.,</i> 410 F.3d 2, 9-10 (1st Cir.2005). Here, both parties moved for summary judgment on the basis of undisputed facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law of contract, it is well established that \"the fact that parties contemplate the execution of a final written agreement effects a strong inference that the parties do not intend to be bound by earlier negotiations or agreements until the final terms are settled.\" <i>Rosenfield v. U.S. Trust Co.,</i> 290 Mass. 210, 195 N.E. 323, 325 (1935); <i>see McCarthy v. Tobin,</i> 429 Mass. 84, 706 N.E.2d 629, 632 (1999). \"If, however, the parties orally agree to the essential terms of the transaction, it may be inferred that they intended to bind themselves at that time and that the `writing to be drafted and delivered is a mere memorial of the contract, which is already final by the earlier mutual assent of the parties to those terms.'\" <i>Novel Iron Works, Inc. v. Wexler Constr. Co.,</i> 26 Mass.App.Ct. 401, 528 N.E.2d 142, 146 (1988) (quoting <i>Rosenfield,</i> 195 N.E. at 325); <i>see McCarthy,</i> 706 N.E.2d at 632. \"It is not required that all terms of the agreement be precisely specified, and the presence of undefined or unspecified terms will not necessarily preclude the formation of a binding contract.\" <i>Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. Malouf, Inc.,</i> 430 Mass. 875, 724 N.E.2d 699, 703 (2000). \"The parties must, however, have progressed beyond the stage of `imperfect negotiation.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lafayette Place Assocs. v. Boston Redev. Auth.,</i> 427 Mass. 509, 694 N.E.2d 820, 826 (1998)); <i>see Rosenfield,</i> 195 N.E. at 326.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case such as this, with faxes, phone discussions, and multiple draft contracts going back and forth over nearly eight months, it is worth taking a step back to recall that \"[t]here is no surer way to find out what parties meant, than to see what they have done.\" <i>Pittsfield &amp; N. Adams R.R. Corp. v. Boston &amp; Albany R.R. Co.,</i> 260 Mass. 390, 157 N.E. 611, 614 (1927) (quoting <i>Brooklyn Life Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Dutcher,</i> 95 U.S. 269, 273, 24 L.Ed. 410 (1877)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see T.F. v. B.L.,</i> 442 Mass. 522, 813 N.E.2d 1244, 1248 (2004). With this in mind, we note two things about the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, at no point did either party behave as if it had a contract. Indeed, negotiations continued for nearly six months after the date TLT claims a contract was formed. TLT does not appear to have taken any action in reliance on a contract having been formed. <i>See Novel Iron Works,</i> 528 N.E.2d at 146-47 (party successfully asserting contract formation was told it was the general contractor, came up with drawings and specifications, solicited bids from subcontractors, was authorized to purchase materials, obtained a building permit, etc.). TLT appears to have first approached litigation from a theory of a general contractor's reliance on a subcontractor's bid. <i>See Loranger Constr. Co. v. E.F. Hauserman Co.,</i> 376 Mass. 757, 384 N.E.2d 176, 179 (1978). It ultimately pursued the contract theory after it became clear that <i>Loranger</i> did not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the record shows that obtaining signed contracts was important to TLT. TLT repeatedly pressed Seating for executed contracts, stating that it would not proceed with the project without them. This suggests that the parties did not intend to be bound before executing a final written agreement. <i>See Rosenfield,</i> 195 N.E. at 325; <i>see also Salem Laundry Co. v. N.E. Teamsters &amp; Trucking Indus. Pension Fund,</i> 829 F.2d 278, 280 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Parties can agree on every term in a contract, yet not be bound until they sign a written agreement, if they so indicate.\"); <i>Bates v. Southgate,</i> 308 Mass. 170, 31 N.E.2d 551, 553 (1941) (\"Even though previous oral conversations would be enough in themselves to establish an oral contract the parties may, nevertheless, by mutual understanding postpone the culmination of their negotiations into a contract to the later preparation and delivery of a written instrument.\"); <i>Tull v. Mister Donut Dev. Corp.,</i> 7 Mass.App.Ct. 626, 389 N.E.2d 447, 451 (1979) (\"Businessmen would be undesirably inhibited in their dealings if expressions of intent and the exchange of drafts were taken as legally binding agreements.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these points necessarily precludes a holding that a contract had formed. But neither will a failed negotiation, even one that causes damage to one or both parties, be necessarily a breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties acknowledge that the negotiations were drawn out and involved a series of offers and counteroffers. Seating argues that this is all it was, and that no offer was ever accepted, because each response was only a counteroffer. The May 21 draft contract was an offer, and Seating's return of it on July 5 with excisions was a counteroffer. This was followed by the July 21 draft contract from TLT, which, since it embodied different terms from the edited July 5 draft, was yet another counteroffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TLT argues that the July 5 edited draft that Seating returned actually embodied terms already agreed to in faxes and discussions, and the draft was thus an acceptance of TLT's offer. But we do not see from the record how this could be, since there is no record evidence that any of the five issues raised by the July 5 edits had previously been agreed upon. Seating had raised the issues of permits and fees, bonding, union labor, and timing of shop drawings prior to returning the draft contract on July 5, but the record shows no response from TLT on these issues before July 5. Furthermore, the issue of insurance limits had not been raised previously at all. The issues of permits and fees, insurance limits, and timing of shop drawings went completely unaddressed between July 5 and July 21, and the original terms remained in the supposedly \"clean\" July 21 draft contract that TLT sent to Seating, despite Seating's excision of those terms on July 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the issue of bonding, TLT itself argues (contrary to its assertion that the July 5 agreement is binding), that the bonding issue was not agreed upon until July 12. In a letter sent by fax on that day, Seating, according to TLT, dropped its insistence on having progress payments with 10% retainage in lieu of bonding, and instead agreed to bond the project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We see it differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a reasonable inference &#8212; and we take all reasonable inferences in favor of Seating &#8212; that this was still just a step in the negotiation, rather than a final acquiescence. Seating notes that it understood that \"it was agreed that 10% retainage would be held in [lieu] of bonding,\" thus acknowledging a continuing dispute on the issue. Furthermore, the letter also states that \"[w]hen bonding is required we reserve the right . . . to have our factory supply the required bonds.\" With this last sentence Seating seems to acknowledge that bonding may or may not be required. The letter also brings up, for the first time in the record, a request that the bonding be done through Seating's factory. Given the importance of bonding in the construction industry, such a request could be a material change in terms, making the July 12 letter just another counteroffer. There is no evidence of this issue being discussed further between the parties until August 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TLT claims that \"it is [the July 5] contract[ ] which TLT seeks to enforce. All of the Parties' subsequent communications merely entailed hammering out minor details.\" While \"[a] written contract, signed by only one party, may be binding and enforceable even without the other party's signature if the other party manifests acceptance,\" <i>Haufler v. Zotos,</i> 446 Mass. 489, 845 N.E.2d 322, 331 (2006), we see no manifestation of acceptance here. The only communication in the record from TLT following the receipt of the July 5 draft contract is the July 21 draft contract, which on its face does not accept all of the terms of the July 5 draft contract. In addition, there is no evidence in the record that TLT took any actions that could be construed as manifesting acceptance. Furthermore, TLT's position that the July 5 draft contract should be binding is contrary to TLT's assertion that the <i>inclusion</i> of the bonding language in the July 21 agreement reflected the agreement of the parties, an agreement purportedly made <i>after</i> July 5. The position that the July 5 draft was binding and the position that bonding was required cannot be reconciled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only issue that appears to have actually been resolved during this period was the issue of union labor. Seating said that its bid was calculated using non-union wages, and that a union requirement would raise the price of the project. TLT removed the union labor requirement from the July 21 draft contract &#8212; the only one of Seating's five requested changes that TLT made. But because there is nothing in the record showing an agreement on this issue prior to July 5, it is a reasonable inference that the July 5 excision of union terms was an offer, with the July 21 draft being TLT's acceptance (of that term alone).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, summary judgment in favor of TLT should not have been granted. Furthermore, even taking all reasonable inferences in favor of TLT, we hold that no contract was formed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> As we discussed above, there is no evidence in the record that the parties came to an agreement prior to July 5 on any of the issues raised by Seating in the July 5 draft contract. The later removal of the union language may lead to an inference that an agreement on that issue had been reached earlier, but there was still no agreement on bonding until July 12 at the earliest. Therefore, the July 5 draft cannot be viewed as an acceptance of an offer. Furthermore, by July 12, the issues of insurance limits, permits and fees, and timing of shop drawings were still unresolved. Indeed, their inclusion in the July 21 draft can only lead to the conclusion that the issues had not been agreed upon. While we do not hold that each of these terms individually was necessarily material, the fact that four out of five requested changes to the contract were not made, coupled with the fact that having a signed, written contract was clearly important to both parties, leads us to hold that there was no meeting of the minds before Seating changed its offer price on August 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision today is in part a result of the complexity of the negotiations, which is reflected in some inconsistencies in the district court's opinion. For example, the district court said at various points that: there was \"an agreement in principle\" on May 17, 2004; that the parties were beyond \"imperfect negotiation\" and that \"[t]he essential terms of the agreement had been reached\" as of July 5; and that the parties agreed to bonding terms on July 12. These three findings show the confusion of the process and in a sense are contradictory. Because the district court does not pinpoint with precision the point at which the contract was formed, we are inclined to view with some skepticism its conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court found that the insurance issue had been agreed to prior to July 5. But the evidence for this, a June 28 letter, does not deal with insurance limits at all. The parties only discuss the language in the certificates and the necessity of umbrella insurance. Finally, the district court explains the non-inclusion in the July 21 draft of Seating's requested language on permits and fees, insurance limits, and timing of shop drawings as \"apparent mistakes in editing.\" This despite the fact that, on the record before us, none of these three issues was ever discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the summary judgment order of the district court and remand with instructions that summary judgment be entered in favor of Seating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Reversed and remanded.</i> Each side to bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> TLT actually sent two contracts, one for each project.

Lederle Parenterals, Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 638, 643 (1st Cir.2000). In a case stated, the parties waive trial and present the case to the court on the undisputed facts in the pre-trial record. The court is then entitled to \"engage in a certain amount of factfinding, including the drawing of inferences.\" <i>United Paperworkers Int'l Union Local 14 v. Int'l Paper Co.,</i> 64 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1995). Such findings would then be subject to clear error review. <i>Id.</i> at 32. However, in cases where the parties have not explicitly presented their case to the court as a case stated, we must \"inquire into the intentions of the parties and the district court judge.\" <i>Garcia-Ayala,</i> 212 F.3d at 644. Such an inquiry should be done \"quite carefully,\" <i>id.</i> at 644 n. 44, for such cases are \"somewhat unusual,\" <i>United Paperworkers,</i> 64 F.3d at 31. The fact that cross-motions were filed is not dispositive. <i>Jewelers,</i> 410 F.3d at 10. Here, we see no indications beyond the filing of cross-motions that the parties intended this to be a case stated. Indeed, a bench trial on the 93A claim followed the resolution of the contract claim. Furthermore, it's not clear that a different standard of review would apply here, since the question we face is a legal one, <i>see id.</i> at 9-10, and thus still subject to <i>de novo</i> review, <i>United Paperworkers,</i> 64 F.3d at 32.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The district court viewed the July 12 letter as consistent with the July 5 excisions. The court stated that \"in lieu of bonding, TLT would hold 10% retainage, which Seating would then bond through its factory, Outdoor Aluminum.\" First, we note that this is not consistent with the fact that the bonding language remained in the July 21 draft contract; either the language is in, or it is out &#8212; it cannot be both. Second, we believe that the district court's finding is internally inconsistent. One cannot say that there is both bonding, and retainage \"in lieu of bonding.\" It does not make sense to say that a party will bond a retainage. Therefore, we believe that the most that can be said of the July 12 letter is that it represented Seating's acquiescence on the issue of retainage and agreement to bond the project instead. TLT takes essentially this position, in contrast to the district court's finding</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The affidavit of Thomas V.

Here, after a protracted &#8212; and ultimately failed &#8212; nine-month negotiation between a general contractor and a potential subcontractor, the general contractor brought suit against the subcontractor for breach of contract, claiming that at some point during the negotiations a binding contract had been formed. After cross-motions for summary judgment on the question of contract formation, the district court ruled in favor of the general contractor. Because we hold that no contract was formed, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TLT Construction Corp. (\"TLT\"), a Massachusetts company, was the general contractor on renovation and expansion projects for Reading Memorial High School in Reading, Massachusetts (the \"Reading Project\"), and Wachusett Regional High School in Holden, Massachusetts (the \"Wachusett Project\"). In April 2004, as TLT was preparing its bid for the Reading Project, RI Inc., d/b/a Seating Solutions (\"Seating\"), a New York company specializing in selling and installing spectator seating for athletic facilities, submitted a bid to TLT to install bleachers for the Reading Project as a subcontractor. In its proposal, Seating stated, \"We have worked very closely with this architect and have helped them design this bleacher from the very first steps.\" On the record before us, it does not appear that Seating's bid was a filed sub-bid, nor does TLT makes such a claim. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 44F.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 2004, TLT, having been awarded both the Reading and the Wachusett Projects, requested that Seating submit a new quote that would include both projects. On May 12, Seating quoted a price of nearly $568,000 for both. TLT responded that the price was too high, and Seating replied on May 17 with a revised quote of $480,000. Seating said that the price was \"contingent on a letter of intent being received [May 18] and an AIA contract being executed by Friday.\" TLT responded that day, seeking clarification of a few terms, including whether or not bonding was included in the quote, since a bond was required and had been included in the quotes from Seating's competitors. Seating responded later that day that bonding was not included in the quote, and that it did not feel bonding was necessary, since it would be paid in progress payments. TLT replied, \"We have a deal if we can split the bond\" and if TLT could have retainage of 5% (Seating had originally proposed no retainage). TLT also said that it would not be able to draft a contract in Seating's time frame, but that it could provide a letter of intent. Seating agreed to accept a letter of intent, and granted TLT two weeks to draft and execute a final contract, but said that it could not hold the price any longer than that. On the record before us, it appears that no letter of intent was ever sent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, four days later, on May 21, 2004, TLT sent Seating a draft contract,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> along with manuals and specifications, and asked that the contract be signed and returned within five days, along with payment and performance bonds and certificates of insurance. The contract package included standard bond forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record becomes more opaque at this point. It appears that a revised draft contract may have been sent on June 7, but that draft does not appear in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A handwritten notation on the cover letter to the May 21 draft contract shows that the same cover letter may have been resent on June 7, with the only change being that a previous line asking for return of the payment and performance bonds had been excised. The record contains no response from Seating with respect to either contract until TLT contacted Seating on June 21 to request return of the signed contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, Seating wrote to TLT to say that it had several issues with the draft contract. First, Seating said that it had understood that no bonding would be required, and that there would be a 10% retainage in lieu of bonding. Second, Seating wanted to clarify the timing for submission of shop drawings. Third, Seating said that its quote was made using prevailing wages, not union labor, and if TLT were to require union labor (as the May 21 draft contract did), then there would be a price increase. Fourth, Seating noted that the quote was exclusive of taxes, permits, and fees. This letter was apparently returned to Seating with notations by TLT, but that response is not in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, Seating wrote to TLT, responding to TLT's notations to Seating's June 22 letter, saying that after \"only a few comments\" it could \"get this thing executed.\" First, Seating said that its insurance company would not make a certain change to the language on the certificates that TLT had presumably requested. Second, it said that an umbrella policy was cost-prohibitive. Third, it requested a six-week time frame for return of engineered shop drawings. On June 29, TLT accepted the first two changes, but did not reply to the third. TLT also requested that Seating mark up the original contract with these changes and return it to TLT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 5, Seating returned a marked-up version of the May 21 draft contract. The changes covered five areas. First, Seating struck all language related to payment and performance bonds and struck out the bonding forms that had been attached. Second, Seating struck the language requiring union labor. Third, Seating struck the language requiring that insurance coverage be \"in the same Limits as required by the Owner's contract of the general contractor,\" and inserted language that Seating's \"standard insurance limits to apply to this contract.\" Fourth, Seating struck the language making it responsible for permits and fees (though it kept the language making it responsible for taxes). Fifth, Seating added language saying that it would provide shop drawings within six weeks of receiving the executed contract. With these changes, Seating signed the draft contract and returned it to TLT. TLT neither signed nor returned this version of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next writing in the record, perhaps after some verbal communication between the parties, is a July 12 letter from Seating to TLT. The letter provided a break-down of additional cost if union labor was to be required. Then the letter continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the bonding, it was agreed that 10% retainage would be held in lew [sic] of bonding. We will bond this and pass the cost along to you as an add-on to the contract. When bonding is required we reserve the right, depending on our current bonding capacity at that time[,] to have our factory supply the required bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter closed, \"If all is acceptable please forward new contracts for us to execute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 21, TLT sent a new draft contract to Seating.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The draft no longer required union labor, but it was otherwise unchanged with respect to Seating's July 5 edits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 29, TLT wrote to Seating to request the return of the signed contracts. On August 13, Seating wrote to say that its price would have to increase by $19,236 to account for an I-beam that it had not realized was in the plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 18, Seating provided a certification of insurance from Outdoor Aluminum, an affiliated company that ran Seating's factory, asking if it was \"acceptable.\" In addition, the letter said, \"Per our conversation, bonding will not be an issue. They [Outdoor Aluminum] bond many projects [for] us and unless there is something out of the ordinary all will be done.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, TLT wrote back to challenge the price increase, saying that Seating had the specifications showing the I-beam when it made the bid. At that point, relations deteriorated. Over the next few months, the parties continued to try to reach agreement, but with decreasing levels of cooperation. TLT ultimately had the work performed by another company, at a cost of $514,160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2004, TLT brought suit in Massachusetts state court for breach of contract and violation of the Massachusetts consumer protection law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 11. Seating removed the case to the United State District Court for the District of Massachusetts on February 3, 2005. The parties agreed to have the case tried by a magistrate judge. The parties then cross-moved for summary judgment on the issue of contract formation. The district court held that a contract existed and that Seating had breached.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court awarded damages of $34,160.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Seating now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.

Indeed, negotiations continued for nearly six months after the date TLT claims a contract was formed. TLT does not appear to have taken any action in reliance on a contract having been formed. <i>See Novel Iron Works,</i> 528 N.E.2d at 146-47 (party successfully asserting contract formation was told it was the general contractor, came up with drawings and specifications, solicited bids from subcontractors, was authorized to purchase materials, obtained a building permit, etc.). TLT appears to have first approached litigation from a theory of a general contractor's reliance on a subcontractor's bid. <i>See Loranger Constr. Co. v. E.F. Hauserman Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2025573\"><a href=\"/opinion/2025573/loranger-construction-corp-v-ef-hauserman-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2025573\"><a href=\"/opinion/2025573/loranger-construction-corp-v-ef-hauserman-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 179 (1978).

TLT repeatedly pressed Seating for executed contracts, stating that it would not proceed with the project without them. This suggests that the parties did not intend to be bound before executing a final written agreement. <i>See Rosenfield,</i> 195 N.E. at 325; <i>see also Salem Laundry Co. v. N.E. Teamsters &amp; Trucking Indus. Pension Fund,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494595\"><a href=\"/opinion/494595/salem-laundry-company-v-new-england-teamsters-and-trucking-industry/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 280 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Parties can agree on every term in a contract, yet not be bound until they sign a written agreement, if they so indicate.\"); <i>Bates v.

But neither will a failed negotiation, even one that causes damage to one or both parties, be necessarily a breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties acknowledge that the negotiations were drawn out and involved a series of offers and counteroffers. Seating argues that this is all it was, and that no offer was ever accepted, because each response was only a counteroffer. The May 21 draft contract was an offer, and Seating's return of it on July 5 with excisions was a counteroffer. This was followed by the July 21 draft contract from TLT, which, since it embodied different terms from the edited July 5 draft, was yet another counteroffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TLT argues that the July 5 edited draft that Seating returned actually embodied terms already agreed to in faxes and discussions, and the draft was thus an acceptance of TLT's offer. But we do not see from the record how this could be, since there is no record evidence that any of the five issues raised by the July 5 edits had previously been agreed upon. Seating had raised the issues of permits and fees, bonding, union labor, and timing of shop drawings prior to returning the draft contract on July 5, but the record shows no response from TLT on these issues before July 5. Furthermore, the issue of insurance limits had not been raised previously at all. The issues of permits and fees, insurance limits, and timing of shop drawings went completely unaddressed between July 5 and July 21, and the original terms remained in the supposedly \"clean\" July 21 draft contract that TLT sent to Seating, despite Seating's excision of those terms on July 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the issue of bonding, TLT itself argues (contrary to its assertion that the July 5 agreement is binding), that the bonding issue was not agreed upon until July 12. In a letter sent by fax on that day, Seating, according to TLT, dropped its insistence on having progress payments with 10% retainage in lieu of bonding, and instead agreed to bond the project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We see it differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a reasonable inference &#8212; and we take all reasonable inferences in favor of Seating &#8212; that this was still just a step in the negotiation, rather than a final acquiescence. Seating notes that it understood that \"it was agreed that 10% retainage would be held in [lieu] of bonding,\" thus acknowledging a continuing dispute on the issue. Furthermore, the letter also states that \"[w]hen bonding is required we reserve the right . . . to have our factory supply the required bonds.\" With this last sentence Seating seems to acknowledge that bonding may or may not be required. The letter also brings up, for the first time in the record, a request that the bonding be done through Seating's factory. Given the importance of bonding in the construction industry, such a request could be a material change in terms, making the July 12 letter just another counteroffer. There is no evidence of this issue being discussed further between the parties until August 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TLT claims that \"it is [the July 5] contract[ ] which TLT seeks to enforce. All of the Parties' subsequent communications merely entailed hammering out minor details.\" While \"[a] written contract, signed by only one party, may be binding and enforceable even without the other party's signature if the other party manifests acceptance,\" <i>Haufler v. Zotos,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></span>, 331 (2006), we see no manifestation of acceptance here. The only communication in the record from TLT following the receipt of the July 5 draft contract is the July 21 draft contract, which on its face does not accept all of the terms of the July 5 draft contract. In addition, there is no evidence in the record that TLT took any actions that could be construed as manifesting acceptance. Furthermore, TLT's position that the July 5 draft contract should be binding is contrary to TLT's assertion that the <i>inclusion</i> of the bonding language in the July 21 agreement reflected the agreement of the parties, an agreement purportedly made <i>after</i> July 5. The position that the July 5 draft was binding and the position that bonding was required cannot be reconciled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only issue that appears to have actually been resolved during this period was the issue of union labor. Seating said that its bid was calculated using non-union wages, and that a union requirement would raise the price of the project. TLT removed the union labor requirement from the July 21 draft contract &#8212; the only one of Seating's five requested changes that TLT made. But because there is nothing in the record showing an agreement on this issue prior to July 5, it is a reasonable inference that the July 5 excision of union terms was an offer, with the July 21 draft being TLT's acceptance (of that term alone).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, summary judgment in favor of TLT should not have been granted. Furthermore, even taking all reasonable inferences in favor of TLT, we hold that no contract was formed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> As we discussed above, there is no evidence in the record that the parties came to an agreement prior to July 5 on any of the issues raised by Seating in the July 5 draft contract. The later removal of the union language may lead to an inference that an agreement on that issue had been reached earlier, but there was still no agreement on bonding until July 12 at the earliest. Therefore, the July 5 draft cannot be viewed as an acceptance of an offer. Furthermore, by July 12, the issues of insurance limits, permits and fees, and timing of shop drawings were still unresolved. Indeed, their inclusion in the July 21 draft can only lead to the conclusion that the issues had not been agreed upon. While we do not hold that each of these terms individually was necessarily material, the fact that four out of five requested changes to the contract were not made, coupled with the fact that having a signed, written contract was clearly important to both parties, leads us to hold that there was no meeting of the minds before Seating changed its offer price on August 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision today is in part a result of the complexity of the negotiations, which is reflected in some inconsistencies in the district court's opinion. For example, the district court said at various points that: there was \"an agreement in principle\" on May 17, 2004; that the parties were beyond \"imperfect negotiation\" and that \"[t]he essential terms of the agreement had been reached\" as of July 5; and that the parties agreed to bonding terms on July 12. These three findings show the confusion of the process and in a sense are contradictory. Because the district court does not pinpoint with precision the point at which the contract was formed, we are inclined to view with some skepticism its conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court found that the insurance issue had been agreed to prior to July 5. But the evidence for this, a June 28 letter, does not deal with insurance limits at all. The parties only discuss the language in the certificates and the necessity of umbrella insurance. Finally, the district court explains the non-inclusion in the July 21 draft of Seating's requested language on permits and fees, insurance limits, and timing of shop drawings as \"apparent mistakes in editing.\" This despite the fact that, on the record before us, none of these three issues was ever discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the summary judgment order of the district court and remand with instructions that summary judgment be entered in favor of Seating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Reversed and remanded.</i> Each side to bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> TLT actually sent two contracts, one for each project.

In a case stated, the parties waive trial and present the case to the court on the undisputed facts in the pre-trial record. The court is then entitled to \"engage in a certain amount of factfinding, including the drawing of inferences.\" <i>United Paperworkers Int'l Union Local 14 v.

Such findings would then be subject to clear error review. <i>Id.</i> at 32. However, in cases where the parties have not explicitly presented their case to the court as a case stated, we must \"inquire into the intentions of the parties and the district court judge.\" <i>Garcia-Ayala,</i> 212 F.3d at 644. Such an inquiry should be done \"quite carefully,\" <i>id.</i> at 644 n. 44, for such cases are \"somewhat unusual,\" <i>United Paperworkers,</i> 64 F.3d at 31. The fact that cross-motions were filed is not dispositive. <i>Jewelers,</i> 410 F.3d at 10. Here, we see no indications beyond the filing of cross-motions that the parties intended this to be a case stated. Indeed, a bench trial on the 93A claim followed the resolution of the contract claim. Furthermore, it's not clear that a different standard of review would apply here, since the question we face is a legal one, <i>see id.</i> at 9-10, and thus still subject to <i>de novo</i> review, <i>United Paperworkers,</i> 64 F.3d at 32.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The district court viewed the July 12 letter as consistent with the July 5 excisions. The court stated that \"in lieu of bonding, TLT would hold 10% retainage, which Seating would then bond through its factory, Outdoor Aluminum.\" First, we note that this is not consistent with the fact that the bonding language remained in the July 21 draft contract; either the language is in, or it is out &#8212; it cannot be both. Second, we believe that the district court's finding is internally inconsistent. One cannot say that there is both bonding, and retainage \"in lieu of bonding.\" It does not make sense to say that a party will bond a retainage. Therefore, we believe that the most that can be said of the July 12 letter is that it represented Seating's acquiescence on the issue of retainage and agreement to bond the project instead. TLT takes essentially this position, in contrast to the district court's finding</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The affidavit of Thomas V.
