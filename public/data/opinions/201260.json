R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-2168\n\n                            SYDNEY A. ROSE,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n         FREDERICK LASKEY, as Commissioner of Revenue,\n      Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Revenue,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Sydney A. Rose on brief pro se.\n     Matthew Q. Berge, Assistant Attorney General, and Thomas F.\nReilly, Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 29, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam.      We affirm the judgment substantially for the\n\nreasons enumerated by the district court in its opinion dated July\n\n10, 2003, adding only the following comments.\n\n     First.     We decline to consider the non-record \"evidence\"\n\nproffered by plaintiff on appeal.              See, e.g., United States v.\n\nRosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d 48, 56 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"It is elementary\n\nthat evidence cannot be submitted for the first time on appeal.\").\n\nPlaintiff's    contention       that   he    was   deprived    of    an   adequate\n\nopportunity to develop the record below is mistaken.                  Defendant's\n\nsummary judgment motion was filed within the time prescribed by the\n\nscheduling order, after discovery had closed.                       And plaintiff\n\nneither moved for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) nor voiced any\n\nsuch complaint in his summary judgment opposition.                  (He sought an\n\nextension to file his opposition only because he was \"in the\n\nprocess   of   moving\";    no    mention     was   made   of   difficulties    in\n\nobtaining his medical records.)              That plaintiff may have been\n\nunfamiliar with his evidentiary burden at the summary judgment\n\nstage provides no basis for appellate relief.              See, e.g., FDIC v.\n\nAnchor Properties, 13 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that\n\nlitigant's pro se status does not absolve him from compliance with\n\nthe federal rules).       We might add that the outcome of this appeal\n\nwould be the same even if the newly proffered materials were\n\nconsidered.\n\n     Second.    Plaintiff contends that a genuine issue of material\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffact remained as to whether a true threat of violence was involved\n\nhere.    Yet he acknowledges making the reference to the Wakefield\n\ntragedy at the end of a heated exchange with his supervisor.\n\nWhatever    plaintiff's        ultimate    intention,     defendant    cannot   be\n\nfaulted for taking this threat at face value.                      In analogous\n\ncontexts, courts have not hesitated to reject claims under the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act.                See, e.g., Sullivan v. River\n\nValley School Dist., 197 F.3d 804, 813 (6th Cir. 1999) (\"threatening\n\nother employees disqualifies one from a job\") (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted); Chapa v. Adams, 168 F.3d 1036,\n\n1039 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"people who threaten to kill their supervisors\n\nare not <qualified' for [employment] even if their threats are\n\nhollow\").       As this court has recently stated: \"Put simply, the ADA\n\ndoes not require that an employee whose unacceptable behavior\n\nthreatens the safety of others be retained, even if the behavior\n\nstems    from     a   mental   disability.        Such    an   employee   is    not\n\nqualified.\" Calef v. Gillette Co., 322 F.3d 75, 87 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nSuch a conclusion is dictated here whether plaintiff is viewed as\n\nhaving the burden of showing he posed no threat to safety in order\n\nto establish he was otherwise qualified for the job, see, e.g., id.\n\nat 87 n.10; EEOC v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 142-44 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), or whether defendant is viewed as having the burden of\n\nestablishing a \"direct threat\" as an affirmative defense under 42\n\nU.S.C.     §§    12111(3),     12113(b)     and   29     C.F.R.   §§   1630.2(r),\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f1630.15(b)(2), see, e.g., Hutton v. Elf Atochem N.A., Inc., 273\n\nF.3d 884, 893 & n.5 (9th Cir. 2001).        The case on which plaintiff\n\nmainly relies in arguing that factual disputes remained, Whitney v.\n\nBd. of Educ. of Grand County, 292 F.3d 1280, 1286 (10th Cir. 2002),\n\ndid    not      involve   threatened     violence      and     is   otherwise\n\ndistinguishable on its facts.\n\n       Third.    Plaintiff likewise asserts that a trialworthy issue\n\nremained as to whether any such threat could be eliminated through\n\nreasonable accommodation.      Even if such an inquiry were pertinent\n\nin this context, but cf. Calef, 322 F.3d at 87 n.11, it would not\n\navail plaintiff.      It was his burden to show, inter alia, that he\n\nmade a specific request for an accommodation that would have\n\nenabled him to perform the essential functions of his job.                 See,\n\ne.g., Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 259, 261 (1st\n\nCir.   2001).      Plaintiff   mainly    points   in    this    regard    to   a\n\ntherapist's letter, delivered to defendant after the incident in\n\nquestion (and introduced for the first time on appeal), indicating\n\nthat he would benefit from a leave of absence of unspecified\n\nlength.      In Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 443-44 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), we did hold that a leave of absence was a reasonable\n\naccommodation for an employee suffering from depression.                 But no\n\nthreatening behavior was there involved. And unlike in the case at\n\nbar, that employee had \"offered evidence tending to show that her\n\nleave would be temporary and would allow her physician to design an\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\feffective treatment program.\"    Id. at 444.   In turn, the proposal\n\nmentioned by plaintiff below–-that he be subjected to regular\n\nsecurity screening–-not only was untimely but was properly rejected\n\nas unreasonable.   See, e.g., Chapa, 168 F.3d at 1039.\n\n     Fourth.    Plaintiff has also failed to sustain his burden of\n\nproof on the two remaining elements of his ADA claim: that he was\n\ndisabled within the meaning of the Act; and that he was discharged\n\nas a result thereof.    See, e.g., Criado, 145 F.3d at 441.    \"This\n\ncircuit has recognized depression as a mental impairment that may\n\nconstitute, at least in some circumstances, a disability under\n\nfederal law.\"   Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6,\n\n20 (1st Cir. 2004).    Yet the evidence submitted below failed to\n\nsubstantiate such a diagnosis. And even when the appellate filings\n\nare considered, plaintiff has not shown that a major life activity\n\nwas substantially limited.    See, e.g., Calef, 322 F.3d at 83-86\n\n(discussing this requirement).    His main complaint in this regard\n\nis about suffering unspecified side-effects from his medication and\n\nneeding to take sick and vacation leave.\n\n     By the same token, there is no genuine dispute about the fact\n\nthat plaintiff was discharged because of his unacceptable behavior\n\nrather than because of any mental impairment.   See, e.g., id. at 87\n\n(noting that employee \"whose unacceptable behavior threatens the\n\nsafety of others\" need not be retained \"even if the behavior stems\n\nfrom a mental disability\"); Hamilton v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co.,\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f136 F.3d 1047, 1052 (5th Cir. 1998) (\"The cause of Hamilton's\n\ndischarge was not discrimination based on [his mental impairment]\n\nbut was rather his failure to recognize the acceptable limits of\n\nbehavior in a workplace environment.\"); Palmer v. Circuit Court of\n\nCook County, 117 F.3d 351, 352 (7th Cir. 1997) (similar).\n\n     Fifth.   We decline to address plaintiff's First Amendment and\n\ndue process arguments as they were not properly raised below.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
