This appeal confronts\n\nus with a series of unfortunate events arising out of Pramco, LLC’s\n\n(Pramco) efforts to collect the unpaid balance of a $500,000\n\npromissory note from defendants, collectively San Juan Bay Marina,\n\nInc. (San Juan).    Those efforts left the parties in a procedural\n\ntangle, which they seek to have us sort out.    Being unable to do so\n\non the present record, we vacate the magistrate judge’s ruling and\n\nremand.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            We begin by summarizing briefly the essential background\n\nfacts. In December 1999, Pramco brought this action to collect the\n\nunpaid balance of a promissory note issued by San Juan and for\n\nforeclosure of the mortgage securing the note.         The complaint\n\nalleged that San Juan owed some $471,000 in principal and $18,000\n\nin accrued interest.     In June 2001, the parties entered into a\n\nsettlement agreement.     The agreement remains under seal in the\n\ndistrict court and is not a part of the appendix, but the parties’\n\nbriefs refer to some of its terms.     The agreement provided that\n\nPramco would foreclose on the property securing the note to recover\n\na portion of the total amount owed.     The remainder of the amount\n\ndue would be paid by San Juan, and the agreement included a payment\n\nschedule.    The agreement also provided that failure to make the\n\npayments would constitute an instant default and the full amount\n\nwould be due immediately.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f             On June 20, 2001, Magistrate Judge Castellanos, on the\n\nmotion of the parties, issued an order approving the agreement and\n\nincorporating its terms and conditions by reference.                          While the\n\nterms of the agreement called for the magistrate to enter judgment\n\nin   favor   of    Pramco,     the    magistrate     judge     entered   a     judgment\n\ndismissing     the    case     with    prejudice.        The    judgment       did    not\n\nincorporate the terms of the settlement or otherwise specify any\n\nobligation owed by San Juan.\n\n             The foreclosure on the property securing the note was\n\nlater authorized by the magistrate judge, and the property was sold\n\nat a judicial sale, although not without opposition from San Juan.\n\nHowever,     the   propriety     of     the    foreclosure      and    sale     is    not\n\nchallenged    on     appeal.      Instead,     the    critical       events    for    the\n\npurposes of this appeal relate to San Juan's failure to follow the\n\npayment schedule in the settlement agreement.\n\n             Sometime in early 2002, the parties appear to have\n\nentered into negotiations about the possible liquidation of the\n\ndebt.   For a time, San Juan did not make payments when due.                           In\n\nJuly 2002, Pramco gave notice that San Juan was in default.                           San\n\nJuan quickly paid the past-due amounts to Pramco, and resumed\n\nmaking the regularly scheduled payments.                 Pramco took no further\n\naction regarding this potential default by San Juan.\n\n             Later     in    2002,      the    parties       again    entered        into\n\nnegotiations to liquidate the entire debt and, during this time,\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fSan Juan again failed to make payments.              In April 2003, Pramco\n\nagain gave notice that San Juan was in default.           San Juan paid the\n\npast-due amounts, and again resumed making the scheduled payments.\n\nHowever, from August until the last-scheduled payment in November,\n\nSan Juan deposited the payments with the court rather than making\n\nthem directly to Pramco.     In November, Pramco moved for execution\n\nof the judgment, arguing that because of the April 2003 default,\n\nSan Juan owed additional amounts.\n\n             On January 16, 2004, the magistrate judge heard Pramco’s\n\nmotion for execution of judgment and San Juan’s opposition.              San\n\nJuan argued that all sums due under the settlement agreement had\n\nbeen received by Pramco except for a small amount remaining on\n\ndeposit with the court.     Pramco in turn argued that the failure to\n\nmake the payments on time resulted in an automatic default, making\n\nSan Juan liable for the default amount of $661,762.60.                   The\n\nmagistrate judge ruled informally after hearing argument, finding\n\nthat   the   settlement   agreement   had    been    modified   by   Pramco’s\n\nacceptance of payment.     He ordered Pramco to return the promissory\n\nnote, permitted it to withdraw the remaining funds on deposit with\n\nthe court, and declared that “this case is closed.”          No findings of\n\nfact or conclusions of law were entered.            This appeal followed.\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\nI.     APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n             Pramco appeals from the magistrate judge's denial of its\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fmotion to enforce the settlement agreement.           No separate judgment\n\nor order was entered.    Thus, we must ask whether the appeal is from\n\na “final decision” as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (2000);1 and\n\nwhether there has been compliance with Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 58, requiring each judgment to be entered as a separate\n\ndocument.\n\n            We consider the magistrate judge’s January 2004 ruling,\n\nalbeit lacking formality, to be a final decision.                   No further\n\nproceedings   are   pending   in    the    district   court   and   none   were\n\ncontemplated.    See, e.g., Negron Gaztambide v. Hernandez Torres,\n\n145 F.3d 410, 414-15 (1st Cir. 1998).            Moreover, the ruling below\n\nsatisfied the purpose of the Rule 58 separate judgment requirement\n\nto \"communicate an unambiguous message of finality.\"                 Fiore v.\n\nWash. County Cmty. Mental Health Ctr., 960 F.2d 229, 235 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).    Given that the instant appeal was timely, it would not\n\nserve the purposes of the rule to remand merely for entry of a\n\nseparate document.     See de Jesus-Mangual v. Rodriguez, 383 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2004); Fiore, 960 F.2d at 236 n.10.\n\nII.   SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\n\n            Although   neither     party   has   addressed    subject   matter\n\njurisdiction, we are obliged to do so at the threshold.                 Negron\n\n\n      1\n      The parties consented to proceed before the magistrate judge,\nwhich thereby authorized appeal from a final judgment directly to\nthe courts of appeals \"in the same manner as an appeal from any\nother judgment of a district court.\" 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(3) (2000).\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fGaztambide, 145 F.3d at 414; Florio v. Olson, 129 F.3d 678, 680\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            The proceedings in the district court were directed to\n\nenforcing    the   settlement   agreement.   The   district   court   had\n\nancillary enforcement jurisdiction because it “incorporat[ed] the\n\nterms of the settlement agreement in the order [of dismissal].”\n\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 381 (1994).\n\nHowever, whether diversity jurisdiction existed over the underlying\n\naction presents us with a knotty problem, which we examine next.\n\n            Pramco brought this action “on behalf of CFSC Consortium,\n\nLLC,” which purchased the underlying loan from the Small Business\n\nAdministration.      In its complaint, Pramco is identified as a\n\nlimited liability company, organized under the laws of Delaware,\n\nwith its principal place of business in New York. CFSC Consortium,\n\nLLC (CFSC) is also identified as a limited liability company,\n\norganized in Delaware, with its principal place of business in\n\nMinnesota.    The complaint identified the defendants as citizens of\n\nPuerto Rico, and alleged that there was complete diversity of\n\nparties.\n\n            The jurisdictional facts alleged in the complaint are\n\ninsufficient to establish the existence of complete diversity.\n\nLimited liability companies are unincorporated entities.              The\n\ncitizenship of an unincorporated entity, such as a partnership, is\n\ndetermined by the citizenship of all of its members.           Carden v.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fArkoma Assoc., 494 U.S. 185, 195-96 (1990) (limited partnership).\n\nNeither    the    Supreme   Court      nor   this   circuit    has   yet   directly\n\naddressed whether that rule also applies to limited liability\n\ncompanies.       However, every circuit to consider this issue has held\n\nthat the citizenship of a limited liability company is determined\n\nby   the   citizenship      of   all   of    its    members.    See    Gen.   Tech.\n\nApplications, Inc. v. Exro Ltda, 388 F.3d 114, 121 (4th Cir. 2004);\n\nGMAC Commercial Credit LLC v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 357 F.3d\n\n827, 829 (8th Cir. 2004); Rolling Greens MHP, L.P. v. Comcast SCH\n\nHoldings L.L.C., 374 F.3d 1020, 1022 (11th Cir. 2004); Provident\n\nEnergy Assocs. of Mont. v. Bullington, 77 F. Appx. 427, 428 (9th\n\nCir. 2003); Homfeld II, L.L.C. v. Comair Holdings, Inc., 53 F. Appx.\n\n731, 732-33 (6th Cir. 2002); Handelsman v. Bedford Vill. Assocs.\n\nLtd. P'ship, 213 F.3d 48, 51-52 (2d Cir. 2000); Cosgrove                         v.\n\nBartolotta, 150 F.3d 729, 731 (7th Cir. 1998); see also 13B Charles\n\nAlan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure: Juris. 2d § 3630\n\n(Supp. 2005). We see no reason to depart from this well-established\n\nrule.\n\n            In its Rule 26.1 disclosure statement filed on appeal,\n\nPramco stated that it has two members and CFSC has three. According\n\nto the complaint, Pramco held a power of attorney to collect loans\n\npurchased by CFSC.          The record, however, does not disclose the\n\ncitizenship of the members of either Pramco or CFSC.                  It also does\n\nnot fully disclose the nature of the arrangement between CFSC and\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fPramco,   which   could     be   relevant    to   a   decision   as   to   whose\n\ncitizenship–the members of CFSC or the members of Pramco–should be\n\nconsidered in the diversity calculus.\n\n           In addition, there may be a circuit split on the issue of\n\nwhether   the   sort   of   arrangement     entered    into   here–whether   it\n\ninvolved an assignment of the debt itself or merely the granting of\n\na power of attorney to litigate the case–would suffice to make\n\nPramco, rather than CFSC, the party whose citizenship matters for\n\ndiversity purposes.       Some circuits have held that \"the citizenship\n\nof an agent who merely sues on behalf of the real parties must be\n\nignored\" for diversity purposes.            Associated Ins. Mgmt. Corp. v.\n\nArk. Gen. Agency, Inc., 149 F.3d 794, 796 (8th Cir. 1998); see also\n\nAirlines Reporting Corp. v. S & N Travel, Inc., 58 F.3d 857, 862 (2d\n\nCir. 1995).     In the Second Circuit, for example, the court asks\n\nwhether the named plaintiff is more than \"a mere conduit for a\n\nremedy owing to others, advancing no specific interests of its own.\"\n\nAirlines Reporting Corp., 58 F.3d at 862.\n\n           The Third Circuit, by contrast, has adopted a rule that\n\naccepts the citizenship of the named plaintiff as the relevant\n\ncitizenship for diversity jurisdiction purposes in any case where\n\nthat plaintiff has \"capacity to sue\" under state law. See Fallat v.\n\nGouran, 220 F.2d 325, 236-27 (3d Cir. 1955); see also 6A Charles\n\nAlan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 1556,\n\nat 426-28 (1990).      It subsequently qualified its rule by holding\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthat   any   attempt        to   \"manufacture\"       diversity         jurisdiction,     by\n\nappointing        a     representative         \"solely         to     create    diversity\n\njurisdiction,\" offends 28 U.S.C. § 1359 (2000) and so is ineffective\n\nto create federal jurisdiction.                See McSparran v. Weist, 402 F.2d\n\n867, 875-76 (3d Cir. 1968); cf. Pallazola v. Rucker, 797 F.2d 1116,\n\n1126-27 (1st Cir. 1986).               Yet even with this qualification, one\n\ncould still see how the Third Circuit's approach could result in\n\ncontrary results in cases such as Airlines Reporting Corp.\n\n             Because        we   cannot   on   this      record       determine    whether\n\ncomplete diversity exists, we remand to the district court.                             The\n\ndistrict court shall determine whether all of Pramco’s and CFSC’s\n\nmembers are diverse from San Juan, in which case diversity exists;\n\nif either Pramco or CFSC has members who are not diverse, the court\n\nmust determine whether the nondiverse party’s citizenship matters\n\nfor jurisdictional purposes; to that end, the court will need to\n\nmake appropriate findings of fact concerning the relationship of\n\nPramco and CFSC and entertain briefs from the parties.                          So far as\n\nwe can tell, the problem is a matter of first impression in this\n\ncircuit.\n\nIII. MERITS\n\n             If       the    district     court      determines         that    diversity\n\njurisdiction          exists,     it    will     need     to        conduct    appropriate\n\nproceedings       to    decide     whether     San      Juan    defaulted       under   the\n\nsettlement agreement; if it did, whether under the facts of the case\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fand applicable law, Pramco’s acceptance of late payments modified\n\nSan Juan’s obligation under the settlement agreement; and what, if\n\nany, amounts (whether of principal or interest) remain owing.    We\n\nexpect that the resolution of these issues will require the making\n\nof findings of fact and the entry of conclusions of law.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we      vacate the magistrate\n\njudge’s ruling and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.   Each side shall bear their own costs on this appeal.\n\n          Vacated and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

(San Juan). Those efforts left the parties in a procedural tangle, which they seek to have us sort out. Being unable to do so on the present record, we vacate the magistrate judge's ruling and remand.</p>\n      <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by summarizing briefly the essential background facts. In December 1999, Pramco brought this action to collect the unpaid balance of a promissory note issued by San Juan and for foreclosure of the mortgage securing the note. The complaint alleged that San Juan owed some $471,000 in principal and $18,000 in accrued interest. In June 2001, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. The agreement remains under seal in the district court and is not a part of the appendix, but the parties' briefs refer to some of its terms. The agreement provided that Pramco would foreclose on the property securing the note to recover a portion of the total amount owed. The remainder of the amount due would be paid by San Juan, and the agreement included a payment schedule. The agreement also provided that failure to make the payments would constitute an instant default and the full amount would be due immediately.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 2001, Magistrate Judge Castellanos, on the motion of the parties, issued an order approving the agreement and incorporating its terms and conditions by reference. While the terms of the agreement called for the magistrate to enter judgment in favor of Pramco, the magistrate judge entered a judgment dismissing the case with prejudice. The judgment did not incorporate the terms of the settlement or otherwise specify any obligation owed by San Juan.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foreclosure on the property securing the note was later authorized by the magistrate judge, and the property was sold at a judicial sale, although not without opposition from San Juan. However, the propriety of the foreclosure and sale is not challenged on appeal. Instead, the critical events for the purposes of this appeal relate to San Juan's failure to follow the payment schedule in the settlement agreement.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in early 2002, the parties appear to have entered into negotiations about the possible liquidation of the debt. For a time, San Juan did not make payments when due. In July 2002, Pramco gave notice that San Juan was in default. San Juan quickly paid the past-due amounts to Pramco, and resumed making the regularly scheduled payments. Pramco took no further action regarding this potential default by San Juan.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in 2002, the parties again entered into negotiations to liquidate the entire debt and, during this time, San Juan again failed to make payments. In April 2003, Pramco again gave notice that San Juan was in default. San Juan paid the past-due amounts, and again resumed making the scheduled payments. However, from August until the last-scheduled payment in November, San Juan deposited the payments with the court rather than making them directly to Pramco.

APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pramco appeals from the magistrate judge's denial of its motion to enforce the settlement agreement. No separate judgment or order was entered. Thus, we must ask whether the appeal is from a \"final decision\" as required by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (2000);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and whether there has been compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, requiring each judgment to be entered as a separate document.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the magistrate judge's January 2004 ruling, albeit lacking formality, to be a final decision. No further proceedings are pending in the district court and none were contemplated. <i>See, e.g., Negron Gaztambide v. Hernandez Torres,</i> 145 F.3d 410, 414-15 (1st Cir.1998). Moreover, the ruling below satisfied the purpose of the Rule 58 separate judgment requirement to \"communicate an unambiguous message of finality.\" <i>Fiore v. Wash. County Cmty. Mental Health Ctr.,</i> 960 F.2d 229, 235 (1st Cir.1992). Given that the instant appeal was timely, it would not serve the purposes of the rule to remand merely for entry of a separate document. <i>See de Jesus-Mangual v. Rodriguez,</i> 383 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Fiore,</i> 960 F.2d at 236 n. 10.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although neither party has addressed subject matter jurisdiction, we are obliged to do so at the threshold. <i>Negron Gaztambide,</i> 145 F.3d at 414; <i>Florio v. Olson,</i> 129 F.3d 678, 680 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proceedings in the district court were directed to enforcing the settlement agreement. The district court had ancillary enforcement jurisdiction because it \"incorporat[ed] the terms of the settlement agreement in the order [of dismissal].\" <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co.,</i> 511 U.S. 375, 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). However, whether diversity jurisdiction existed over the underlying action presents us with a knotty problem, which we examine next.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pramco brought this action \"on behalf of CFSC Consortium, LLC,\" which purchased the underlying loan from the Small Business Administration. In its complaint, Pramco is identified as a limited liability company, organized under the laws of Delaware, with its principal place of business in New York. CFSC Consortium, LLC (CFSC) is also identified as a limited liability company, organized in Delaware, with its principal place of business in Minnesota. The complaint identified the defendants as citizens of Puerto Rico, and alleged that there was complete diversity of parties.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurisdictional facts alleged in the complaint are insufficient to establish the existence of complete diversity. Limited liability companies are unincorporated entities. The citizenship of an unincorporated entity, such as a partnership, is determined by the citizenship of all of its members. <i>Carden v. Arkoma Assoc.,</i> 494 U.S. 185, 195-96, 110 S.Ct. 1015, 108 L.Ed.2d 157 (1990) (limited partnership). Neither the Supreme Court nor this circuit has yet directly addressed whether that rule also applies to limited liability companies. However, every circuit to consider this issue has held that the citizenship of a limited liability company is determined by the citizenship of all of its members. <i>See Gen. Tech. Applications, Inc. v. Exro Ltda,</i> 388 F.3d 114, 121 (4th Cir.2004); <i>GMAC Commercial Credit LLC v.

Cooper, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Juris.2d</i> &#167; 3630 (Supp.2005). We see no reason to depart from this well-established rule.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its Rule 26.1 disclosure statement filed on appeal, Pramco stated that it has two members and CFSC has three. According to the complaint, Pramco held a power of attorney to collect loans purchased by CFSC. The record, however, does not disclose the citizenship of the members of either Pramco or CFSC. It also does not fully disclose the nature of the arrangement between CFSC and Pramco, which could be relevant to a decision as to whose citizenship-the members of CFSC or the members of Pramco-should be considered in the diversity calculus.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, there may be a circuit split on the issue of whether the sort of arrangement entered into here-whether it involved an assignment of the debt itself or merely the granting of a power of attorney to litigate the case-would suffice to make Pramco, rather than CFSC, the party whose citizenship matters for diversity purposes. Some circuits have held that \"the citizenship of an agent who merely sues on behalf of the real parties must be ignored\" for diversity purposes. <i>Associated Ins. Mgmt. Corp. v. Ark. Gen. Agency, Inc.,</i> 149 F.3d 794, 796 (8th Cir.1998); <i>see also Airlines Reporting Corp. v. S &amp; N Travel, Inc.,</i> 58 F.3d 857, 862 (2d Cir.1995). In the Second Circuit, for example, the court asks whether the named plaintiff is more than \"a mere conduit for a remedy owing to others, advancing no specific interests of its own.\" <i>Airlines Reporting Corp.,</i> 58 F.3d at 862.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third Circuit, by contrast, has adopted a rule that accepts the citizenship of the named plaintiff as the relevant citizenship for diversity jurisdiction purposes in any case where that plaintiff has \"capacity to sue\" under state law. <i>See Fallat v. Gouran,</i> 220 F.2d 325, 336-27 (3d Cir.1955); <i>see also</i> 6A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d</i> &#167; 1556, at 426-28 (1990). It subsequently qualified its rule by holding that any attempt to \"manufacture\" diversity jurisdiction, by appointing a representative \"solely to create diversity jurisdiction,\" offends 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1359 (2000) and so is ineffective to create federal jurisdiction. <i>See McSparran v. Weist,</i> 402 F.2d 867, 875-76 (3d Cir.1968); <i>cf. Pallazola v. Rucker,</i> 797 F.2d 1116, 1126-27 (1st Cir.1986). Yet even with this qualification, one could still see how the Third Circuit's approach could result in contrary results in cases such as <i>Airlines Reporting Corp.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we cannot on this record determine whether complete diversity exists, we remand to the district court. The district court shall determine whether all of Pramco's and CFSC's members are diverse from San Juan, in which case diversity exists; if either Pramco or CFSC has members who are not diverse, the court must determine whether the nondiverse party's citizenship matters for jurisdictional purposes; to that end, the court will need to make appropriate findings of fact concerning the relationship of Pramco and CFSC and entertain briefs from the parties. So far as we can tell, the problem is a matter of first impression in this circuit.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. MERITS</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court determines that diversity jurisdiction exists, it will need to conduct appropriate proceedings to decide whether San Juan defaulted under the settlement agreement; if it did, whether under the facts of the case and applicable law, Pramco's acceptance of late payments modified San Juan's obligation under the settlement agreement; and what, if any, amounts (whether of principal or interest) remain owing. We expect that the resolution of these issues will require the making of findings of fact and the entry of conclusions of law.</p>\n      <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the magistrate judge's ruling and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

(San Juan). Those efforts left the parties in a procedural tangle, which they seek to have us sort out. Being unable to do so on the present record, we vacate the magistrate judge's ruling and remand.</p>\n      <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by summarizing briefly the essential background facts. In December 1999, Pramco brought this action to collect the unpaid balance of a promissory note issued by San Juan and for foreclosure of the mortgage securing the note. The complaint alleged that San Juan owed some $471,000 in principal and $18,000 in accrued interest. In June 2001, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. The agreement remains under seal in the district court and is not a part of the appendix, but the parties' briefs refer to some of its terms. The agreement provided that Pramco would foreclose on the property securing the note to recover a portion of the total amount owed. The remainder of the amount due would be paid by San Juan, and the agreement included a payment schedule. The agreement also provided that failure to make the payments would constitute an instant default and the full amount would be due immediately.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 20, 2001, Magistrate Judge Castellanos, on the motion of the parties, issued an order approving the agreement and incorporating its terms and conditions by reference. While the terms of the agreement called for the magistrate to enter judgment in favor of Pramco, the magistrate judge entered a judgment dismissing the case with prejudice. The judgment did not incorporate the terms of the settlement or otherwise specify any obligation owed by San Juan.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foreclosure on the property securing the note was later authorized by the magistrate judge, and the property was sold at a judicial sale, although not without opposition from San Juan. However, the propriety of the foreclosure and sale is not challenged on appeal. Instead, the critical events for the purposes of this appeal relate to San Juan's failure to follow the payment schedule in the settlement agreement.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in early 2002, the parties appear to have entered into negotiations about the possible liquidation of the debt. For a time, San Juan did not make payments when due. In July 2002, Pramco gave notice that San Juan was in default. San Juan quickly paid the past-due amounts to Pramco, and resumed making the regularly scheduled payments. Pramco took no further action regarding this potential default by San Juan.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in 2002, the parties again entered into negotiations to liquidate the entire debt and, during this time, San Juan again failed to make payments. In April 2003, Pramco again gave notice that San Juan was in default. San Juan paid the past-due amounts, and again resumed making the scheduled payments. However, from August until the last-scheduled payment in November, San Juan deposited the payments with the court rather than making them directly to Pramco. In November, Pramco moved for execution of the judgment, arguing that because of the April 2003 default, San Juan owed additional amounts.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 2004, the magistrate judge heard Pramco's motion for execution of judgment and San Juan's opposition. San Juan argued that all sums due under the settlement agreement had been received by Pramco except for a small amount remaining on deposit with the court. Pramco in turn argued that the failure to make the payments on time resulted in an automatic default, making San Juan liable for the default amount of $661,762.60. The magistrate judge ruled informally after hearing argument, finding that the settlement agreement had been modified by Pramco's acceptance of payment. He ordered Pramco to return the promissory note, permitted it to withdraw the remaining funds on deposit with the court, and declared that \"this case is closed.\" No findings of fact or conclusions of law were entered. This appeal followed.</p>\n      <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pramco appeals from the magistrate judge's denial of its motion to enforce the settlement agreement. No separate judgment or order was entered. Thus, we must ask whether the appeal is from a \"final decision\" as required by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (2000);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and whether there has been compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, requiring each judgment to be entered as a separate document.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the magistrate judge's January 2004 ruling, albeit lacking formality, to be a final decision. No further proceedings are pending in the district court and none were contemplated. <i>See, e.g., Negron Gaztambide v.

In its complaint, Pramco is identified as a limited liability company, organized under the laws of Delaware, with its principal place of business in New York. CFSC Consortium, LLC (CFSC) is also identified as a limited liability company, organized in Delaware, with its principal place of business in Minnesota. The complaint identified the defendants as citizens of Puerto Rico, and alleged that there was complete diversity of parties.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurisdictional facts alleged in the complaint are insufficient to establish the existence of complete diversity. Limited liability companies are unincorporated entities. The citizenship of an unincorporated entity, such as a partnership, is determined by the citizenship of all of its members. <i>Carden v.

So far as we can tell, the problem is a matter of first impression in this circuit.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. MERITS</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court determines that diversity jurisdiction exists, it will need to conduct appropriate proceedings to decide whether San Juan defaulted under the settlement agreement; if it did, whether under the facts of the case and applicable law, Pramco's acceptance of late payments modified San Juan's obligation under the settlement agreement; and what, if any, amounts (whether of principal or interest) remain owing. We expect that the resolution of these issues will require the making of findings of fact and the entry of conclusions of law.</p>\n      <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the magistrate judge's ruling and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each side shall bear their own costs on this appeal.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and Remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties consented to proceed before the magistrate judge, which thereby authorized appeal from a final judgment directly to the courts of appeals \"in the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a district court.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c)(3) (2000)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
