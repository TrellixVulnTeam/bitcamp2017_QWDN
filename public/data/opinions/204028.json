This appeal directly challenges\n\nthe denial of an attempt at post-settlement intervention and\n\nindirectly challenges the propriety of a sealing order.1   The stage\n\nis easily set.    After the settlement of a sealed lawsuit to which\n\nit was not a party, Doral Bank (Doral) sought to intervene.      The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion as untimely and refused to conduct\n\na hearing anent the propriety of the sealing order.        The court\n\nlater declined to reconsider its order.\n\n           Doral now appeals, asseverating that it should have been\n\npermitted (i) to intervene as of right or (ii) to intervene\n\npermissively to challenge the sealing order.     Discerning no abuse\n\nof discretion in the district court's rulings, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We set forth the largely undisputed facts as found by the\n\ndistrict court, consistent with record support.\n\n           This case rises from the ashes of the once vibrant market\n\nin mortgage-backed securities. The plaintiff is a mortgage lending\n\nand servicing conglomerate.2       The defendant, Federal Home Loan\n\n\n\n     1\n       We use the term \"post-settlement\" in lieu of the more\nfamiliar term \"post-judgment\" because the district court approved\nthe final settlement agreement before the putative intervenor moved\nfor leave to intervene, but did not enter judgment on the docket\nuntil several days later. Inasmuch as the parties have attached no\nsignificance to this chronological curiosity, we make no further\nmention of it.\n      2\n       Although both R&G Mortgage Corp. and R-G Premier Bank of\nPuerto Rico are plaintiffs, we refer to them collectively as R&G.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fMortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), is (or, more accurately, was in\n\nearlier halcyon days) a prodigious purchaser of mortgages needed to\n\nfeed its appetite for a steady stream of offerings of mortgage-\n\nbacked securities. Freddie Mac does not itself collect and process\n\nloan payments or work out defaults on the mortgage loans that it\n\nbuys.        Instead, it outsources those tasks to qualified servicers.\n\n                   R&G and Freddie Mac had a business relationship reaching\n\nback        over    three   decades.    In     the   ordinary   course      of   that\n\nrelationship,          Freddie   Mac   contracted     with   R&G    to    service   a\n\nsubstantial portfolio of Puerto Rican mortgages. In 2008, however,\n\nthe relationship soured.\n\n                   On July 11, 2008,3 Freddie Mac informed R&G that it was\n\nbeing terminated as a qualified servicer (and, thus, could no\n\nlonger service Freddie Mac's loan portfolio).                      To pick up the\n\nslack, Freddie Mac contracted on the same date with Doral to take\n\nover the servicing of the loans on an interim basis.                     Doral noted\n\nthis arrangement in a so-called 8-K report that it filed with the\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n                   On July 14, R&G brought suit against Freddie Mac in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.                     Its\n\ncomplaint alleged breach of contract and prayed for a declaratory\n\njudgment to vindicate its status as a qualified servicer of Freddie\n\nMac mortgage loans (at least until a contractual appeals process\n\n\n        3\n            All dates are in 2008 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fhad run its course), along with injunctive relief designed to keep\n\nthe Freddie Mac mortgage portfolio under R&G's control pendente\n\nlite.   Concerned    that   its   confidential   business    information\n\notherwise would wind up in the public domain, R&G asked that the\n\ncase be placed under seal.\n\n            On the same day that the action was commenced, the\n\ndistrict court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nthat, among other things, blocked both the termination of R&G's\n\nstatus as a qualified servicer and the planned transfer of the\n\nservicing rights to Doral.    The court simultaneously granted R&G's\n\nancillary request, placing the docket and all papers in the case\n\nunder seal.\n\n            Doral received notice on several occasions that this\n\nlitigation impeded its interim servicing contract.          We cite some\n\nexamples.\n\n            !      Freddie Mac's associate general counsel\n            initiated a conference call with Doral's\n            president and in-house lawyer on July 15,\n            during which the caller informed the Doral\n            hierarchs that the TRO had issued and that it\n            blocked Freddie Mac from shifting servicing of\n            the portfolio to Doral.\n\n            !      On July 16, R&G filed an 8-K report\n            stating that R&G had obtained the TRO and\n            describing its effect. That SEC report was a\n            matter of public record.\n\n            !      On the following day, Freddie Mac sent\n            a letter to Doral formally notifying Doral\n            that the TRO, issued by the federal court in\n            Puerto Rico, put the planned transfer of the\n            mortgage portfolio \"on hold.\"\n\n                                  -5-\n\f           !      On July 18, R&G's general counsel wrote\n           to his counterpart at Doral, by mail and e-\n           mail. That communique notified Doral of the\n           issuance of the TRO and admonished that the\n           TRO \"precluded\" the implementation of Doral's\n           agreement with Freddie Mac. Although a glitch\n           in the address caused a delay in delivery of\n           the hard copy of this letter, Doral's general\n           counsel acknowledged that he received it no\n           later than August 11.    In any event, Doral\n           never denied receiving the e-mail, so it\n           presumably received that version on the day of\n           transmission.\n\n           !      Doral     responded       to      these\n           developments on August 14. On that date, it\n           wrote to R&G, advising that it would move to\n           intervene in the pending action unless it was\n           given a copy of the TRO.     R&G refused this\n           ultimatum via e-mail on the following day,\n           noting that all the paperwork in the case was\n           under seal. The e-mail advised that Doral's\n           interim servicing agreement was not directly\n           at issue in the litigation but that, insofar\n           as that agreement pertained to R&G's portfolio\n           of Freddie Mac mortgages, the TRO rendered\n           Doral \"unable to perform.\"\n\n           At this point, we return to the travel of the case.\n\nRather than holding a hearing on preliminary injunction, see Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 65(b)(2)-(3), the district court extended the TRO\n\nseveral times by consent while settlement discussions percolated\n\nbetween R&G and Freddie Mac.            On September 18, those parties\n\njointly   moved   under   seal   for    court   approval   of   a   negotiated\n\nsettlement that allowed R&G to continue to service Freddie Mac\n\nmortgages until it could sell its servicing rights to a qualified\n\nthird party.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           On   the   same    day,   Freddie    Mac   advised   Doral    of   the\n\nsettlement.     It offered to provide a copy of the sealed settlement\n\nagreement, contingent upon Doral's execution of a confidentiality\n\nagreement.    Although Freddie Mac and Doral subsequently agreed to\n\nthe terms of the confidentiality agreement, Doral never signed it.\n\n           The district court approved the settlement on September\n\n25.   A week later (on October 2), Doral moved to intervene either\n\nas of right or permissively.            Invoking our decision in Banco\n\nPopular v. Greenblatt, 964 F.2d 1227 (1st Cir. 1992), the district\n\ncourt denied the motion as untimely.              The court later eschewed\n\nreconsideration.       This    seasonable      appeal   followed.       We    have\n\njurisdiction because an order denying a motion to intervene is\n\nimmediately appealable.       Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Patch, 136 F.3d\n\n197, 204 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n           We first examine Doral's contention that it should have\n\nbeen granted leave to intervene as of right.             We then turn to its\n\nalternative contention that it should have been granted leave to\n\nintervene permissively.\n\n                      A.   Intervention as of Right.\n\n           To succeed on a motion to intervene as of right, a\n\nputative intervenor must establish (i) the timeliness of its motion\n\nto intervene; (ii) the existence of an interest relating to the\n\nproperty or transaction that forms the basis of the pending action;\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f(iii) a realistic threat that the disposition of the action will\n\nimpede its ability to protect that interest; and (iv) the lack of\n\nadequate representation of its position by any existing party. See\n\nNegrón-Almeda v. Santiago, 528 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2008); B.\n\nFernández & Hnos., Inc. v. Kellogg USA, Inc., 440 F.3d 541, 544-45\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a).            The movant must\n\nfulfill each of these preconditions.           \"The failure to satisfy any\n\none of them dooms intervention.\"         Patch, 136 F.3d at 204.\n\n              The court below recognized that when intervention is at\n\nissue, timeliness is the \"prevenient question.\"             Greenblatt, 964\n\nF.2d at 1230 (explaining that \"timeliness stands as a sentinel at\n\nthe   gates    whenever   intervention    is    requested   and   opposed\").\n\nConsequently, the court started with the timeliness requirement.\n\nWe emulate that approach.\n\n              The timeliness inquiry is inherently fact-sensitive and\n\ndepends on the totality of the circumstances.          Id. at 1230-31.   In\n\nevaluating that mosaic, the status of the litigation at the time of\n\nthe request for intervention is \"highly relevant.\"            Id. at 1231.\n\nAs a case progresses toward its ultimate conclusion, the scrutiny\n\nattached to a request for intervention necessarily intensifies.\n\nId.\n\n              As a general matter, the case law reflects four factors\n\nthat inform the timeliness inquiry: (i) the length of time that the\n\nputative intervenor knew or reasonably should have known that his\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\finterests were at risk before he moved to intervene; (ii) the\n\nprejudice to existing parties should intervention be allowed; (iii)\n\nthe prejudice to the putative intervenor should intervention be\n\ndenied; and (iv) any special circumstances militating for or\n\nagainst intervention. Id. Each of these factors must be appraised\n\nin light of the posture of the case at the time the motion is made.\n\nGeiger v. Foley Hoag LLP Ret. Plan, 521 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).     Under this approach, motions to intervene that will have\n\nthe effect of reopening settled cases are regarded with particular\n\nskepticism because such motions tend to prejudice the rights of the\n\nsettling parties. See, e.g., In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig., 570\n\nF.3d 244, 250 (5th Cir. 2009); Heartwood, Inc. v. U.S. Forest\n\nServ., 316 F.3d 694, 700-01 (7th Cir. 2003); Greenblatt, 964 F.2d\n\nat 1231.\n\n              We review the grant or denial of a motion to intervene\n\nfor abuse of discretion.              Negrón-Almeda, 528 F.3d at 21.           We\n\ncaution, however, that the abuse of discretion standard is not one-\n\ndimensional.         Within    that    rubric,   a   material    error   of   law\n\nconstitutes a per se abuse of discretion, id. at 22, and a trial\n\ncourt's answers to abstract legal questions are reviewed de novo,\n\nDaggett v. Comm'n on Governmental Ethics & Election Practices, 172\n\nF.3d   104,    109   (1st     Cir.    1999).     Moreover,   a   trial   court's\n\nsubsidiary findings as to raw facts are reviewed for clear error.\n\nEwers v. Heron, 419 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f            The Civil Rules contemplate two types of motions to\n\nintervene: intervention as of right, Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a), and\n\npermissive intervention, Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).                 The differences\n\nare significant.       We mention two particulars.            First, in the case\n\nof   a   motion   to   intervene   as    of    right,   the    district   court's\n\ndiscretion is somewhat more constrained than in the case of a\n\nmotion for permissive intervention.             See Patch, 136 F.3d at 204.\n\nSecond, the timeliness requirement is often applied less strictly\n\nwith respect to intervention as of right.                See, e.g., Navieros\n\nInter-Americanos, S.A. v. M/V Vasilia Express, 120 F.3d 304, 320\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).       But we hasten to add a caveat: even in the case\n\nof   a   motion   to   intervene   as    of    right,   the    district   court's\n\ndiscretion is appreciable, and the timeliness requirement retains\n\nconsiderable bite.\n\n            In this instance, Doral claims that it was entitled to\n\nintervene as of right because its contractual rights under the\n\ninterim servicing agreement were directly impacted by R&G's suit\n\nand that, in its absence, no other party                      would protect its\n\ninterests.        The lower court did not reach the merits of these\n\nclaims.     Rather, it concluded as a threshold matter that Doral\n\ncould not vault the timeliness hurdle and, accordingly, denied the\n\nmotion.     We examine that rationale.\n\n            A motion to intervene is timely if it is filed promptly\n\nafter a person obtains actual or constructive notice that a\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fpending case threatens to jeopardize his rights.                   Greenblatt, 964\n\nF.2d at 1231; Caterino v. Barry, 922 F.2d 37, 40-41 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    Perfect     knowledge      of    the   particulars      of     the   pending\n\nlitigation is not essential to start the clock running; knowledge\n\nof a measurable risk to one's rights is enough.                    See Greenblatt,\n\n964 F.2d at 1231; Culbreath v. Dukakis, 630 F.2d 15, 20-21 (1st\n\nCir. 1980).\n\n           In conducting a timeliness inquiry, there are no ironclad\n\nrules about just how celeritously, in terms of days or months, a\n\nperson must move to protect himself after he has acquired the\n\nrequisite quantum of knowledge.              The passage of time is measured\n\nin relative, not absolute, terms.                 Thus, what may constitute\n\nreasonably prompt action in one situation may be unreasonably\n\ndilatory in another.      Compare, e.g., Geiger, 521 F.3d at 65 (nine-\n\nmonth    delay   in   moving    to   intervene        reasonable    in    particular\n\ncircumstances),       with,    e.g.,      Greenblatt,       964   F.2d    at   1231-32\n\n(three-month      delay       unreasonable       in     a     different        set   of\n\ncircumstances).        In the last analysis, the timeliness inquiry\n\ncenters on how diligently the putative intervenor has acted once\n\nhe has received actual or constructive notice of the impending\n\nthreat.\n\n           The district court supportably found that Doral learned\n\nabout the suit and the consequent jeopardy to its servicing rights\n\nduring the July 15 conference call.               Doral received confirmation\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthat the TRO was in place in the form of an e-mail from R&G, which\n\nwas transmitted on July 18.            That communication made it pellucid\n\nthat the TRO adversely affected Doral's contractual rights. Doral\n\nobviously      appreciated      that   fact;   on   August    14    —    armed   with\n\nessentially the same information that it had on July 18 — Doral\n\nthreatened to intervene in the pending action in order to protect\n\nits rights.        But despite this bluster, Doral inexplicably waited\n\nuntil October 2 before moving to intervene.\n\n              The district court determined that a delay of two and\n\none-half months after Doral knew of the incipient problem (that\n\nis, a delay from July 18 to October 2) was inexcusable.                          That\n\ndetermination was well within the realm of the court's discretion.\n\nAs struthious as Doral may have been, it is simply implausible\n\nthat       Doral   did   not   know    by   mid-July   that   its       rights   were\n\nimperilled.4       Doral's failure to act until October amply supported\n\nthe district court's ruling that its motion to intervene was\n\nunreasonably late. See Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1231-32; Caterino,\n\n922 F.2d at 40-41; cf. United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (explaining that, as a general proposition, \"the\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       Even if we were to assume that August 11, rather than July\n18, was the date on which Doral's knowledge crystallized, that\nassumption would not assist Doral. The district court explicitly\nand supportably found that, if August 11 was the date on which\nDoral acquired knowledge of a measurable risk, it nonetheless\nfailed to act in a timeous fashion.\n\n                                        -12-\n\flaw ministers to the vigilant, not to those               who sleep upon\n\nperceptible rights\").\n\n          The district court did not directly address the other\n\nelements of the timeliness inquiry, but those elements weaken\n\nDoral's position even further.        The second and third elements,\n\nwhich together involve the balance of harms, cut sharply against\n\nDoral.   By the time that Doral moved to intervene, the original\n\nparties had forged a settlement of their dispute.         Because Doral's\n\nproposed intervention was aimed at disrupting that settlement, the\n\nharm that intervention would have worked to the original parties\n\nwas manifest.5   See Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1232.        One of the core\n\npurposes of the timeliness requirement is to prevent disruptive,\n\nlate-stage   intervention   that   could    have   been   avoided   by   the\n\nexercise of reasonable diligence.          See United Nuclear Corp. v.\n\nCannon, 696 F.2d 141, 143 (1st Cir. 1982); see also Heartwood, 316\n\nF.3d at 701 (stating that attempted post-settlement intervention\n\n\"strongly suggests\" a tactical attempt to thwart the settlement\n\nrather than to participate in the litigation).\n\n          Doral argues that both R&G and Freddie Mac knew of its\n\npotential claim and that knowledge of another party's potential\n\nclaim vitiates any prejudice caused by the latter's tardiness in\n\n\n\n     5\n       The district court apparently recognized this fact.     Its\norder denying intervention stated that Doral should not be allowed\nto intervene at \"a crucial and decisive stage\" following the\n\"months of time and effort\" leading to the settlement.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fseeking intervention.        That overstates the point.        Acting in the\n\nface of knowledge about a            potential claim may make it more\n\ndifficult to show prejudice, but it does not excuse the claimant\n\nfrom its obligation to proceed with reasonable dispatch to protect\n\nits interests.\n\n            Doral's claim of prejudice arising out of the denial of\n\nits motion to intervene is unconvincing.               It asserts that the\n\nsettlement \"substantially affects\" its ability to obtain specific\n\nperformance as a remedy for Freddie Mac's alleged breach of the\n\ninterim servicing agreement.6          Appellant's Br. at 10.         But any\n\ndisadvantage at which Doral now finds itself amounts to a self-\n\nimposed wound.     Had Doral acted with due diligence in pursuing\n\nintervention, the perceived hardship would not exist. For obvious\n\nreasons, a preventable hardship weighs less heavily in the balance\n\nof harms.    See Larson v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 530 F.3d 578, 583-\n\n84 (7th Cir. 2009); United States v. British Am. Tobacco Austl.\n\nServs., Ltd., 437 F.3d 1235, 1239 (D.C. Cir. 2006).\n\n            In any event, the denial of intervention will not cause\n\nDoral significant prejudice.         Doral still has an adequate remedy.\n\nIt may bring a separate action against R&G and/or Freddie Mac for\n\nmoney damages.        See, e.g., New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v.\n\nSprintCom,    Inc.,    287    F.3d    1,    9   (1st   Cir.   2002)   (noting\n\n\n\n    6\n       The record contains evidence that, in late 2008,                   R&G\ncompleted the sale of its servicing rights to a third party.\n\n                                     -14-\n\favailability of damages for tortious interference with contract\n\nunder local law); Soggs v. Crocco, 668 N.Y.S.2d 796, 797-98 (N.Y.\n\nApp. Div. 1998) (affirming damages award in lieu of specific\n\nperformance      when        performance     had   become    impossible).    The\n\navailability     of     an    adequate     alternative    remedy   softens    any\n\nplausible claim of prejudice.              N.Y. Chinese TV Programs, Inc. v.\n\nU.E. Enters., Inc., 153 F.R.D. 69, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (explaining\n\nthat the existence of alternative remedies \"is another commonly\n\naccepted basis for denying intervention\").\n\n             The fourth element of the timeliness inquiry requires an\n\nassessment      of      whether     any      special   circumstances     exist.\n\nGreenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1231.             There are none here, save that the\n\nposture of the case colors the circumstances.               Requests for post-\n\nsettlement intervention are rarely granted.                 See Heartwood, 316\n\nF.3d at 701; cf. Chase Manhattan Bank v. Corporacion Hotelera de\n\nP.R., 516 F.2d 1047, 1050 (1st Cir. 1975) (describing proposed\n\npost-judgment intervention as \"unusual\").\n\n             In this case, the four timeliness factors all point the\n\nsame way.      Nevertheless, Doral attempts to blunt their combined\n\nforce   by    arguing    that     it   was   impossible     to   intervene   more\n\nexpeditiously because it did not know the civil action number, the\n\nidentity of the judge, or certain other particulars concerning the\n\npending case.        This argument is jejune.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f            Doral    knew     the     identity     of    the    parties    and,\n\nnotwithstanding its suggestion to the contrary, it clearly knew\n\nthe court in which the case was pending.                It also knew that its\n\nprized contract had been derailed and that its servicing rights\n\nthereunder were in grave danger.         It had no reason to believe that\n\nthe existing parties would sacrifice their own parochial interests\n\nin order to safeguard its interests.             Last but not least, it knew\n\nthat temporary restraining orders have a short shelf life, see\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2)-(3), and that, therefore, time was of the\n\nessence.\n\n            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — we note\n\nthat Doral had the same basic information available to it in mid-\n\nJuly as on October 2 (when Doral's decision to intervene came to\n\nfruition).     At that juncture, it had no difficulty in tracking\n\ndown the case.      It could have taken exactly the same steps in mid-\n\nJuly.\n\n            To recapitulate, the record reflects undue delay by a\n\nputative    intervenor      with    knowledge    that    its   rights   were   in\n\njeopardy.     The record also reflects an unfavorable balance of\n\nharms and an absence of ameliorating circumstances.               Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude, without serious question, that the lower court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in holding that Doral — a sophisticated\n\nfinancial institution with lawyers on staff — waited too long to\n\nseek intervention as of right.               See, e.g., In re Lease Oil\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fAntitrust Litig., 570 F.3d at 250; Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1231-\n\n32; see also Heartwood, 316 F.3d at 701 (\"Prompt [intervention]\n\nafter settlement does not indicate timeliness, particularly where\n\nthere is evidence that the intervenor should have known the suit\n\ncould    impact     its       interest       for   some    time     prior    to     the\n\nsettlement.\").\n\n                         B.     Permissive Intervention.\n\n           Permissive intervention is governed by the provisions of\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b).               In this instance, we need\n\nnot rehearse the elements needed to succeed under that rule.                         It\n\nsuffices   to     say    that    when    a   putative     intervenor      seeks    both\n\nintervention as of right and permissive intervention, a finding of\n\nuntimeliness with respect to the former normally applies to the\n\nlatter (and, therefore, dooms the movant's quest for permissive\n\nintervention).          See Lucas v. McKeithen, 102 F.3d 171, 173 (5th\n\nCir. 1996); Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1230 n.2; Orange County v. Air\n\nCal., 799 F.2d 535, 538-39 (9th Cir. 1986).\n\n           One might think at first blush that a somewhat different\n\nrule    should    apply       because    Doral's     motion       seeks   permissive\n\nintervention not for the purpose of being heard on the merits of\n\nthe dispute (although that may be its hidden agenda) but, rather,\n\nfor the stated purpose of challenging the sealing order.                          In an\n\nappropriate case, that altered focus might make a difference.                       But\n\nthis is not such a case.\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f           We begin with the basics.                When a third party essays a\n\nchallenge to a sealing order, permissive intervention is the\n\nprocedurally correct vehicle.              See Pub. Citizen v. Liggett Group,\n\nInc.,   858    F.2d     775,   783    (1st    Cir.       1988).     The     timeliness\n\nrequirement still pertains, but with a wrinkle: the time of\n\nacquisition of knowledge of the sealing order itself, if different\n\nfrom the time of acquisition of knowledge of the suit, must be\n\nfactored into the equation.            See, e.g., id. at 785.\n\n           The district court did not separately address this aspect\n\nof Doral's motion.             This omission is understandable for two\n\nreasons.      First, Doral did not file a proposed complaint when\n\nmoving for intervention, though required to do so.                        See Fed. R.\n\nCiv P. 24(c) (stating that a motion for intervention must \"be\n\naccompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for\n\nwhich intervention is sought\").               Second, Doral neither filed two\n\nseparate      motions    nor   made    two    separate      formulations       of    the\n\ncalculus   of    timeliness.          It    suggested      instead,    at    least   by\n\nimplication,      that    exactly      the        same   temporal     considerations\n\npertained to both branches of its motion to intervene.\n\n           Doral's briefs on appeal follow this pattern.                      They do\n\nnot separately discuss the timeliness of the two branches of its\n\nmotion.    The absence of developed argumentation on an issue is\n\ntantamount to abandonment of that issue.                  See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).                       Doral has failed\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\ftwice — once in the court below and again in this court — to offer\n\nany argument that timeliness should be measured differently vis-à-\n\nvis its request for permissive intervention.            Consequently, we\n\ntreat the district court's finding of untimeliness with respect to\n\nDoral's   request   to   intervene   as   of   right   as   applying   with\n\nundiminished force to Doral's request for permissive intervention.\n\n          That finding remains unimpugnable.       As we explain below,\n\nDoral's challenge to the sealing order, as framed, is inextricably\n\nintertwined with its claim of an entitlement to intervene as of\n\nright.\n\n          According to Doral's briefs, it sought access to the\n\nsealed materials through permissive intervention for the sole\n\npurpose of \"know[ing] precisely what happened\" so that it might\n\n\"secure a remedy\" for itself.         Appellant's Br. at 7.            These\n\nassertions fit tongue and groove with Doral's attempts to excuse\n\nits tardiness in moving to intervene as of right because the\n\nsealing order prevented it from acquiring precise knowledge about\n\nthe particulars of the litigation.        We rejected that argument in\n\nthe Rule 24(a) context, see supra Part II(A), and it is no more\n\nhardy in the Rule 24(b) context.\n\n          The discretion afforded to the district court under Rule\n\n24, substantial in any event, is even broader when the issue is\n\none of permissive intervention.       See Navieros Inter-Americanos,\n\n120 F.3d at 320.    Because it is readily apparent why the district\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fcourt treated the two branches of Doral's motion to intervene as\n\na unit, we can proceed with appellate review.              See Negrón-Almeda,\n\n528 F.3d at 23 (explaining that when a trial court's order is\n\nimprecise, the court of appeals frequently \"can comb relevant\n\nparts of the record to discern the authoring court's intention\").\n\n             That review need not detain us. We think it follows from\n\nwhat   we    have   said    that   our    analysis   of   Doral's      attempt   to\n\nchallenge the sealing order is enmeshed with our analysis of the\n\ntimeliness factors discussed above.             See supra Part II(A).       Doral\n\nknew of the sealing order virtually from the moment that it\n\nlearned of the case itself, yet it delayed any challenge for some\n\ntwo and one-half months.           In practical terms, Doral postponed any\n\naction      until   after    the    original    parties    had    negotiated     a\n\nsettlement; this is particularly important with respect to the\n\nsealing order because confidentiality was something for which the\n\nparties had bargained.\n\n             In addition, this aspect of Doral's motion exacerbates\n\nthe prejudicial effect of its attempt to intervene on the merits.\n\nThe purpose behind a motion to intervene is a relevant datum in\n\nthe timeliness analysis.           Greenblatt, 964 F.2d at 1230-34; Pub.\n\nCitizen,     858    F.2d    at   786.     Doral's    request     for   permissive\n\nintervention sought to reopen a settled case and reverse a sealing\n\norder exclusively for its own benefit, not to vindicate a right of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fpublic access.              Thus, the two prongs of Doral's attempt to waylay\n\nthe parties' confidential settlement merge into one.\n\n              In all events, Doral was not prejudiced by a lack of\n\naccess to the district court record.                      It had an opportunity to\n\nobtain      the    documents        it   needed     to   evaluate    its    position   by\n\nexecuting          a    confidentiality        agreement.            Even    though    it\n\nsuccessfully negotiated the terms of that agreement, it refrained\n\nfrom signing the document.                The record contains no satisfactory\n\nexplanation as              to why this sort of exchange would not have\n\nsatisfied Doral's need to see the relevant papers.7\n\n              We add a coda.             Doral's motion to intervene for the\n\npurpose of challenging the sealing order touches upon an issue of\n\ntransparency           in    the   federal   judicial      system.      Placing      court\n\nrecords out of public sight is a serious step, which should be\n\nundertaken only rarely and for good cause.                   Sealing orders are not\n\nlike       party       favors,     available      upon    request     or    as   a    mere\n\naccommodation.              See Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589,\n\n597-99 (1978); In re Gitto Global Corp., 422 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). In the first instance, however, decisions about whether or\n\n\n\n       7\n       We note that this avenue still remains open to Doral. The\ndistrict court expressly provided in its order that it was \"not\npreclud[ing] the parties and Doral from making any disclosure\nagreements through good faith out-of-court negotiations.\" Freddie\nMac has offered to reveal the contents of the TRO and the\nsettlement agreement pursuant to a confidentiality agreement\n(already negotiated between Doral and Freddie Mac), and Doral has\nnever requested any other documents from Freddie Mac.\n\n                                             -21-\n\fnot to seal are committed to the sound discretion of the district\n\ncourt.   Nixon, 435 U.S. at 597-99; In re Globe Newsp. Co., 920\n\nF.2d 88, 96 (1st Cir. 1990).        Here, the absence of a timely\n\nchallenge to the sealing order precludes any full-blown inquiry\n\ninto the propriety of that order.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial\n\nof Doral's untimely motion to intervene.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f",

After the settlement of a sealed lawsuit to which it was not a party, Doral Bank (Doral) sought to intervene. The district court denied the motion as untimely and refused to conduct a hearing anent the propriety of the sealing order. The court later declined to reconsider its order.</p>\n<p>Doral now appeals, asseverating that it should have been permitted (i) to intervene as of right or (ii) to intervene permissively to challenge the sealing order. Discerning no abuse of discretion in the district court's rulings, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We set forth the largely undisputed facts as found by the district court, consistent with record support.</p>\n<p>This case rises from the ashes of the once vibrant market in mortgage-backed securities. The plaintiff is a mortgage lending and servicing conglomerate.<sup>[2]</sup> The defendant, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), is (or, more accurately, was in earlier halcyon days) a prodigious purchaser of mortgages needed to feed its appetite for a steady stream of offerings of mortgage-backed securities. Freddie Mac does not itself collect and process loan payments or work out defaults on the mortgage loans that it buys. Instead, it outsources those tasks to qualified servicers.</p>\n<p>R &amp; G and Freddie Mac had a business relationship reaching back over three decades. In the ordinary course of that relationship, Freddie Mac contracted with R &amp; G to service a substantial portfolio of Puerto Rican mortgages. In 2008, however, the relationship soured.</p>\n<p>On July 11, 2008,<sup>[3]</sup> Freddie Mac informed R &amp; G that it was being terminated as a qualified servicer (and, thus, could no longer service Freddie Mac's loan portfolio). To pick up the slack, Freddie Mac contracted on the same date with Doral to take over the servicing of the loans on an interim basis. Doral noted this arrangement in a so-called 8-K report that it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>\n<p>On July 14, R &amp; G brought suit against Freddie Mac in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Its complaint alleged breach of contract and prayed for a declaratory judgment to vindicate its status as a qualified servicer of Freddie Mac mortgage loans (at least until a contractual appeals process had run its course), along with injunctive relief designed to keep the Freddie Mac mortgage portfolio under R &amp; G's control <i>pendente lite.</i> Concerned that its confidential business <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> information otherwise would wind up in the public domain, R &amp; G asked that the case be placed under seal.</p>\n<p>On the same day that the action was commenced, the district court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO) that, among other things, blocked both the termination of R &amp; G's status as a qualified servicer and the planned transfer of the servicing rights to Doral. The court simultaneously granted R &amp; G's ancillary request, placing the docket and all papers in the case under seal.</p>\n<p>Doral received notice on several occasions that this litigation impeded its interim servicing contract. We cite some examples.</p>\n<blockquote> Freddie Mac's associate general counsel initiated a conference call with Doral's president and in-house lawyer on July 15, during which the caller informed the Doral hierarchs that the TRO had issued and that it blocked Freddie Mac from shifting servicing of the portfolio to Doral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On July 16, R &amp; G filed an 8-K report stating that R &amp; G had obtained the TRO and describing its effect. That SEC report was a matter of public record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On the following day, Freddie Mac sent a letter to Doral formally notifying Doral that the TRO, issued by the federal court in Puerto Rico, put the planned transfer of the mortgage portfolio \"on hold.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On July 18, R &amp; G's general counsel wrote to his counterpart at Doral, by mail and e-mail. That communique notified Doral of the issuance of the TRO and admonished that the TRO \"precluded\" the implementation of Doral's agreement with Freddie Mac. Although a glitch in the address caused a delay in delivery of the hard copy of this letter, Doral's general counsel acknowledged that he received it no later than August 11. In any event, Doral never denied receiving the e-mail, so it presumably received that version on the day of transmission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Doral responded to these developments on August 14. On that date, it wrote to R &amp; G, advising that it would move to intervene in the pending action unless it was given a copy of the TRO. R &amp; G refused this ultimatum via e-mail on the following day, noting that all the paperwork in the case was under seal. The e-mail advised that Doral's interim servicing agreement was not directly at issue in the litigation but that, insofar as that agreement pertained to R &amp; G's portfolio of Freddie Mac mortgages, the TRO rendered Doral \"unable to perform.\"</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, we return to the travel of the case. Rather than holding a hearing on preliminary injunction, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b)(2)-(3), the district court extended the TRO several times by consent while settlement discussions percolated between R &amp; G and Freddie Mac. On September 18, those parties jointly moved under seal for court approval of a negotiated settlement that allowed R &amp; G to continue to service Freddie Mac mortgages until it could sell its servicing rights to a qualified third party.</p>\n<p>On the same day, Freddie Mac advised Doral of the settlement. It offered to provide a copy of the sealed settlement agreement, contingent upon Doral's execution of a confidentiality agreement. Although Freddie Mac and Doral subsequently agreed to the terms of the confidentiality agreement, Doral never signed it.</p>\n<p>The district court approved the settlement on September 25. A week later (on October 2), Doral moved to intervene <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> either as of right or permissively. Invoking our decision in <i>Banco Popular v. Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d 1227 (1st Cir.1992), the district court denied the motion as untimely. The court later eschewed reconsideration. This seasonable appeal followed. We have jurisdiction because an order denying a motion to intervene is immediately appealable. <i>Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Patch,</i> 136 F.3d 197, 204 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>We first examine Doral's contention that it should have been granted leave to intervene as of right. We then turn to its alternative contention that it should have been granted leave to intervene permissively.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Intervention as of Right.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>To succeed on a motion to intervene as of right, a putative intervenor must establish (i) the timeliness of its motion to intervene; (ii) the existence of an interest relating to the property or transaction that forms the basis of the pending action; (iii) a realistic threat that the disposition of the action will impede its ability to protect that interest; and (iv) the lack of adequate representation of its position by any existing party. <i>See </i><i>Negrón-Almeda v. Santiago,</i> 528 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2008); <i>B. Fernández &amp; Hnos., Inc. v. Kellogg USA, Inc.,</i> 440 F.3d 541, 544-45 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a). The movant must fulfill each of these preconditions. \"The failure to satisfy any one of them dooms intervention.\" <i>Patch,</i> 136 F.3d at 204.</p>\n<p>The court below recognized that when intervention is at issue, timeliness is the \"prevenient question.\" <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1230 (explaining that \"timeliness stands as a sentinel at the gates whenever intervention is requested and opposed\"). Consequently, the court started with the timeliness requirement. We emulate that approach.</p>\n<p>The timeliness inquiry is inherently fact-sensitive and depends on the totality of the circumstances. <i>Id.</i> at 1230-31. In evaluating that mosaic, the status of the litigation at the time of the request for intervention is \"highly relevant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1231. As a case progresses toward its ultimate conclusion, the scrutiny attached to a request for intervention necessarily intensifies. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>As a general matter, the case law reflects four factors that inform the timeliness inquiry: (i) the length of time that the putative intervenor knew or reasonably should have known that his interests were at risk before he moved to intervene; (ii) the prejudice to existing parties should intervention be allowed; (iii) the prejudice to the putative intervenor should intervention be denied; and (iv) any special circumstances militating for or against intervention. <i>Id.</i> Each of these factors must be appraised in light of the posture of the case at the time the motion is made. <i>Geiger v. Foley Hoag LLP Ret. Plan,</i> 521 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2008). Under this approach, motions to intervene that will have the effect of reopening settled cases are regarded with particular skepticism because such motions tend to prejudice the rights of the settling parties. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig.,</i> 570 F.3d 244, 250 (5th Cir.2009); <i>Heartwood, Inc. v. U.S. Forest Serv.,</i> 316 F.3d 694, 700-01 (7th Cir.2003); <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231.</p>\n<p>We review the grant or denial of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion. <i>Negrón-Almeda,</i> 528 F.3d at 21. We caution, however, that the abuse of discretion standard is not one-dimensional. Within that rubric, a material error of law constitutes a per se abuse of discretion, <i>id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> at 22, and a trial court's answers to abstract legal questions are reviewed de novo, <i>Daggett v. Comm'n on Governmental Ethics &amp; Election Practices,</i> 172 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.1999). Moreover, a trial court's subsidiary findings as to raw facts are reviewed for clear error. <i>Ewers v. Heron,</i> 419 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The Civil Rules contemplate two types of motions to intervene: intervention as of right, Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a), and permissive intervention, Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b). The differences are significant. We mention two particulars. First, in the case of a motion to intervene as of right, the district court's discretion is somewhat more constrained than in the case of a motion for permissive intervention. <i>See </i><i>Patch,</i> 136 F.3d at 204. Second, the timeliness requirement is often applied less strictly with respect to intervention as of right. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Navieros Inter-Americanos, S.A. v. M/V Vasilia Express,</i> 120 F.3d 304, 320 (1st Cir.1997). But we hasten to add a caveat: even in the case of a motion to intervene as of right, the district court's discretion is appreciable, and the timeliness requirement retains considerable bite.</p>\n<p>In this instance, Doral claims that it was entitled to intervene as of right because its contractual rights under the interim servicing agreement were directly impacted by R &amp; G's suit and that, in its absence, no other party would protect its interests. The lower court did not reach the merits of these claims. Rather, it concluded as a threshold matter that Doral could not vault the timeliness hurdle and, accordingly, denied the motion. We examine that rationale.</p>\n<p>A motion to intervene is timely if it is filed promptly after a person obtains actual or constructive notice that a pending case threatens to jeopardize his rights. <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231; <i>Caterino v. Barry,</i> 922 F.2d 37, 40-41 (1st Cir.1990). Perfect knowledge of the particulars of the pending litigation is not essential to start the clock running; knowledge of a measurable risk to one's rights is enough. <i>See </i><i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231; <i>Culbreath v. Dukakis,</i> 630 F.2d 15, 20-21 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n<p>In conducting a timeliness inquiry, there are no ironclad rules about just how celeritously, in terms of days or months, a person must move to protect himself after he has acquired the requisite quantum of knowledge. The passage of time is measured in relative, not absolute, terms. Thus, what may constitute reasonably prompt action in one situation may be unreasonably dilatory in another. <i>Compare, e.g., </i><i>Geiger,</i> 521 F.3d at 65 (nine-month delay in moving to intervene reasonable in particular circumstances), <i>with, e.g., </i><i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231-32 (three-month delay unreasonable in a different set of circumstances). In the last analysis, the timeliness inquiry centers on how diligently the putative intervenor has acted once he has received actual or constructive notice of the impending threat.</p>\n<p>The district court supportably found that Doral learned about the suit and the consequent jeopardy to its servicing rights during the July 15 conference call. Doral received confirmation that the TRO was in place in the form of an e-mail from R &amp; G, which was transmitted on July 18. That communication made it pellucid that the TRO adversely affected Doral's contractual rights. Doral obviously appreciated that fact; on August 14  armed with essentially the same information that it had on July 18  Doral threatened to intervene in the pending action in order to protect its rights. But despite this bluster, Doral inexplicably waited until October 2 before moving to intervene.</p>\n<p>The district court determined that a delay of two and one-half months after Doral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> knew of the incipient problem (that is, a delay from July 18 to October 2) was inexcusable. That determination was well within the realm of the court's discretion. As struthious as Doral may have been, it is simply implausible that Doral did not know by mid-July that its rights were imperilled.<sup>[4]</sup> Doral's failure to act until October amply supported the district court's ruling that its motion to intervene was unreasonably late. <i>See </i><i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231-32; <i>Caterino,</i> 922 F.2d at 40-41; <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir.1995) (explaining that, as a general proposition, \"the law ministers to the vigilant, not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights\").</p>\n<p>The district court did not directly address the other elements of the timeliness inquiry, but those elements weaken Doral's position even further. The second and third elements, which together involve the balance of harms, cut sharply against Doral. By the time that Doral moved to intervene, the original parties had forged a settlement of their dispute. Because Doral's proposed intervention was aimed at disrupting that settlement, the harm that intervention would have worked to the original parties was manifest.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1232. One of the core purposes of the timeliness requirement is to prevent disruptive, late-stage intervention that could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable diligence. <i>See </i><i>United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon,</i> 696 F.2d 141, 143 (1st Cir.1982); <i>see also </i><i>Heartwood,</i> 316 F.3d at 701 (stating that attempted post-settlement intervention \"strongly suggests\" a tactical attempt to thwart the settlement rather than to participate in the litigation).</p>\n<p>Doral argues that both R &amp; G and Freddie Mac knew of its potential claim and that knowledge of another party's potential claim vitiates any prejudice caused by the latter's tardiness in seeking intervention. That overstates the point. Acting in the face of knowledge about a potential claim may make it more difficult to show prejudice, but it does not excuse the claimant from its obligation to proceed with reasonable dispatch to protect its interests.</p>\n<p>Doral's claim of prejudice arising out of the denial of its motion to intervene is unconvincing. It asserts that the settlement \"substantially affects\" its ability to obtain specific performance as a remedy for Freddie Mac's alleged breach of the interim servicing agreement.<sup>[6]</sup> Appellant's Br. at 10. But any disadvantage at which Doral now finds itself amounts to a self-imposed wound. Had Doral acted with due diligence in pursuing intervention, the perceived hardship would not exist. For obvious reasons, a preventable hardship weighs less heavily in the balance of harms. <i>See </i><i>Larson v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.,</i> 530 F.3d 578, 583-84 (7th Cir.2008); <i>United States v. British Am. Tobacco Austl. Servs., Ltd.,</i> 437 F.3d 1235, 1239 (D.C.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> In any event, the denial of intervention will not cause Doral significant prejudice. Doral still has an adequate remedy. It may bring a separate action against R &amp; G and/or Freddie Mac for money damages. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc.,</i> 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2002) (noting availability of damages for tortious interference with contract under local law); <i>Soggs v. Crocco,</i> 247 A.D.2d 887, 668 N.Y.S.2d 796, 797-98 (N.Y.App.Div.1998) (affirming damages award in lieu of specific performance when performance had become impossible). The availability of an adequate alternative remedy softens any plausible claim of prejudice. <i>N.Y. Chinese TV Programs, Inc. v. U.E. Enters., Inc.,</i> 153 F.R.D. 69, 72 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (explaining that the existence of alternative remedies \"is another commonly accepted basis for denying intervention\").</p>\n<p>The fourth element of the timeliness inquiry requires an assessment of whether any special circumstances exist. <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231. There are none here, save that the posture of the case colors the circumstances. Requests for post-settlement intervention are rarely granted. <i>See </i><i>Heartwood,</i> 316 F.3d at 701; <i>cf. </i><i>Chase Manhattan Bank v. Corporacion Hotelera De P.R.,</i> 516 F.2d 1047, 1050 (1st Cir.1975) (describing proposed post-judgment intervention as \"unusual\").</p>\n<p>In this case, the four timeliness factors all point the same way. Nevertheless, Doral attempts to blunt their combined force by arguing that it was impossible to intervene more expeditiously because it did not know the civil action number, the identity of the judge, or certain other particulars concerning the pending case. This argument is jejune.</p>\n<p>Doral knew the identity of the parties and, notwithstanding its suggestion to the contrary, it clearly knew the court in which the case was pending. It also knew that its prized contract had been derailed and that its servicing rights thereunder were in grave danger. It had no reason to believe that the existing parties would sacrifice their own parochial interests in order to safeguard its interests. Last but not least, it knew that temporary restraining orders have a short shelf life, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 65(b)(2)-(3), and that, therefore, time was of the essence.</p>\n<p>If more were needed  and we doubt that it is  we note that Doral had the same basic information available to it in mid-July as on October 2 (when Doral's decision to intervene came to fruition). At that juncture, it had no difficulty in tracking down the case. It could have taken exactly the same steps in mid-July.</p>\n<p>To recapitulate, the record reflects undue delay by a putative intervenor with knowledge that its rights were in jeopardy. The record also reflects an unfavorable balance of harms and an absence of ameliorating circumstances. Accordingly, we conclude, without serious question, that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Doral  a sophisticated financial institution with lawyers on staff  waited too long to seek intervention as of right. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig.,</i> 570 F.3d at 250; <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231-32; <i>see also </i><i>Heartwood,</i> 316 F.3d at 701 (\"Prompt [intervention] after settlement does not indicate timeliness, particularly where there is evidence that the intervenor should have known the suit could impact its interest for some time prior to the settlement.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Permissive Intervention.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Permissive intervention is governed by the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b). In this instance, we need not rehearse the elements needed to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> succeed under that rule. It suffices to say that when a putative intervenor seeks both intervention as of right and permissive intervention, a finding of untimeliness with respect to the former normally applies to the latter (and, therefore, dooms the movant's quest for permissive intervention). <i>See </i><i>Lucas v. McKeithen,</i> 102 F.3d 171, 173 (5th Cir.1996); <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1230 n. 2; <i>Orange County v. Air Cal.,</i> 799 F.2d 535, 538-39 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p>One might think at first blush that a somewhat different rule should apply because Doral's motion seeks permissive intervention not for the purpose of being heard on the merits of the dispute (although that may be its hidden agenda) but, rather, for the stated purpose of challenging the sealing order. In an appropriate case, that altered focus might make a difference. But this is not such a case.</p>\n<p>We begin with the basics. When a third party essays a challenge to a sealing order, permissive intervention is the procedurally correct vehicle. <i>See </i><i>Pub. Citizen v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> 858 F.2d 775, 783 (1st Cir.1988). The timeliness requirement still pertains, but with a wrinkle: the time of acquisition of knowledge of the sealing order itself, if different from the time of acquisition of knowledge of the suit, must be factored into the equation. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 785.</p>\n<p>The district court did not separately address this aspect of Doral's motion. This omission is understandable for two reasons. First, Doral did not file a proposed complaint when moving for intervention, though required to do so. <i>See</i> Fed. R. Civ P. 24(c) (stating that a motion for intervention must \"be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought\"). Second, Doral neither filed two separate motions nor made two separate formulations of the calculus of timeliness. It suggested instead, at least by implication, that exactly the same temporal considerations pertained to both branches of its motion to intervene.</p>\n<p>Doral's briefs on appeal follow this pattern. They do not separately discuss the timeliness of the two branches of its motion. The absence of developed argumentation on an issue is tantamount to abandonment of that issue. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). Doral has failed twice  once in the court below and again in this court  to offer any argument that timeliness should be measured differently vis-à-vis its request for permissive intervention. Consequently, we treat the district court's finding of untimeliness with respect to Doral's request to intervene as of right as applying with undiminished force to Doral's request for permissive intervention.</p>\n<p>That finding remains unimpugnable. As we explain below, Doral's challenge to the sealing order, as framed, is inextricably intertwined with its claim of an entitlement to intervene as of right.</p>\n<p>According to Doral's briefs, it sought access to the sealed materials through permissive intervention for the sole purpose of \"know[ing] precisely what happened\" so that it might \"secure a remedy\" for itself. Appellant's Br. at 7. These assertions fit tongue and groove with Doral's attempts to excuse its tardiness in moving to intervene as of right because the sealing order prevented it from acquiring precise knowledge about the particulars of the litigation. We rejected that argument in the Rule 24(a) context, <i>see supra</i> Part II(A), and it is no more hardy in the Rule 24(b) context.</p>\n<p>The discretion afforded to the district court under Rule 24, substantial in any event, is even broader when the issue is one of permissive intervention. <i>See </i><i>Navieros</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> <i>Inter-Americanos,</i> 120 F.3d at 320. Because it is readily apparent why the district court treated the two branches of Doral's motion to intervene as a unit, we can proceed with appellate review. <i>See </i><i>Negrón-Almeda,</i> 528 F.3d at 23 (explaining that when a trial court's order is imprecise, the court of appeals frequently \"can comb relevant parts of the record to discern the authoring court's intention\").</p>\n<p>That review need not detain us. We think it follows from what we have said that our analysis of Doral's attempt to challenge the sealing order is enmeshed with our analysis of the timeliness factors discussed above. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Doral knew of the sealing order virtually from the moment that it learned of the case itself, yet it delayed any challenge for some two and one-half months. In practical terms, Doral postponed any action until after the original parties had negotiated a settlement; this is particularly important with respect to the sealing order because confidentiality was something for which the parties had bargained.</p>\n<p>In addition, this aspect of Doral's motion exacerbates the prejudicial effect of its attempt to intervene on the merits. The purpose behind a motion to intervene is a relevant datum in the timeliness analysis. <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1230-34; <i>Pub. Citizen,</i> 858 F.2d at 786. Doral's request for permissive intervention sought to reopen a settled case and reverse a sealing order exclusively for its own benefit, not to vindicate a right of public access. Thus, the two prongs of Doral's attempt to waylay the parties' confidential settlement merge into one.</p>\n<p>In all events, Doral was not prejudiced by a lack of access to the district court record. It had an opportunity to obtain the documents it needed to evaluate its position by executing a confidentiality agreement. Even though it successfully negotiated the terms of that agreement, it refrained from signing the document. The record contains no satisfactory explanation as to why this sort of exchange would not have satisfied Doral's need to see the relevant papers.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>We add a coda. Doral's motion to intervene for the purpose of challenging the sealing order touches upon an issue of transparency in the federal judicial system. Placing court records out of public sight is a serious step, which should be undertaken only rarely and for good cause. Sealing orders are not like party favors, available upon request or as a mere accommodation. <i>See </i><i>Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc.,</i> 435 U.S. 589, 597-99, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978); <i>In re Gitto Global Corp.,</i> 422 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005). In the first instance, however, decisions about whether or not to seal are committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <i>Nixon,</i> 435 U.S. at 597-99, 98 S.Ct. 1306; <i>In re Globe Newsp. Co.,</i> 920 F.2d 88, 96 (1st Cir.1990). Here, the absence of a timely challenge to the sealing order precludes any full-blown inquiry into the propriety of that order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we discern no abuse of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> discretion in the district court's denial of Doral's untimely motion to intervene.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We use the term \"post-settlement\" in lieu of the more familiar term \"post-judgment\" because the district court approved the final settlement agreement before the putative intervenor moved for leave to intervene, but did not enter judgment on the docket until several days later. Inasmuch as the parties have attached no significance to this chronological curiosity, we make no further mention of it.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although both R &amp; G Mortgage Corp. and R-G Premier Bank of Puerto Rico are plaintiffs, we refer to them collectively as R &amp; G.</p>\n<p>[3]  All dates are in 2008 unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p>[4]  Even if we were to assume that August 11, rather than July 18, was the date on which Doral's knowledge crystallized, that assumption would not assist Doral. The district court explicitly and supportably found that, if August 11 was the date on which Doral acquired knowledge of a measurable risk, it nonetheless failed to act in a timeous fashion.</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court apparently recognized this fact. Its order denying intervention stated that Doral should not be allowed to intervene at \"a crucial and decisive stage\" following the \"months of time and effort\" leading to the settlement.</p>\n<p>[6]  The record contains evidence that, in late 2008, R &amp; G completed the sale of its servicing rights to a third party.</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that this avenue still remains open to Doral. The district court expressly provided in its order that it was \"not preclud[ing] the parties and Doral from making any disclosure agreements through good faith out-of-court negotiations.\" Freddie Mac has offered to reveal the contents of the TRO and the settlement agreement pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (already negotiated between Doral and Freddie Mac), and Doral has never requested any other documents from Freddie Mac.</p>\n\n</div>",

After the settlement of a sealed lawsuit to which it was not a party, Doral Bank (Doral) sought to intervene. The district court denied the motion as untimely and refused to conduct a hearing anent the propriety of the sealing order. The court later declined to reconsider its order.</p>\n<p>Doral now appeals, asseverating that it should have been permitted (i) to intervene as of right or (ii) to intervene permissively to challenge the sealing order. Discerning no abuse of discretion in the district court's rulings, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We set forth the largely undisputed facts as found by the district court, consistent with record support.</p>\n<p>This case rises from the ashes of the once vibrant market in mortgage-backed securities. The plaintiff is a mortgage lending and servicing conglomerate.<sup>[2]</sup> The defendant, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), is (or, more accurately, was in earlier halcyon days) a prodigious purchaser of mortgages needed to feed its appetite for a steady stream of offerings of mortgage-backed securities. Freddie Mac does not itself collect and process loan payments or work out defaults on the mortgage loans that it buys. Instead, it outsources those tasks to qualified servicers.</p>\n<p>R &amp; G and Freddie Mac had a business relationship reaching back over three decades. In the ordinary course of that relationship, Freddie Mac contracted with R &amp; G to service a substantial portfolio of Puerto Rican mortgages. In 2008, however, the relationship soured.</p>\n<p>On July 11, 2008,<sup>[3]</sup> Freddie Mac informed R &amp; G that it was being terminated as a qualified servicer (and, thus, could no longer service Freddie Mac's loan portfolio). To pick up the slack, Freddie Mac contracted on the same date with Doral to take over the servicing of the loans on an interim basis. Doral noted this arrangement in a so-called 8-K report that it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>\n<p>On July 14, R &amp; G brought suit against Freddie Mac in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Its complaint alleged breach of contract and prayed for a declaratory judgment to vindicate its status as a qualified servicer of Freddie Mac mortgage loans (at least until a contractual appeals process had run its course), along with injunctive relief designed to keep the Freddie Mac mortgage portfolio under R &amp; G's control <i>pendente lite.</i> Concerned that its confidential business <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> information otherwise would wind up in the public domain, R &amp; G asked that the case be placed under seal.</p>\n<p>On the same day that the action was commenced, the district court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO) that, among other things, blocked both the termination of R &amp; G's status as a qualified servicer and the planned transfer of the servicing rights to Doral. The court simultaneously granted R &amp; G's ancillary request, placing the docket and all papers in the case under seal.</p>\n<p>Doral received notice on several occasions that this litigation impeded its interim servicing contract. We cite some examples.</p>\n<blockquote> Freddie Mac's associate general counsel initiated a conference call with Doral's president and in-house lawyer on July 15, during which the caller informed the Doral hierarchs that the TRO had issued and that it blocked Freddie Mac from shifting servicing of the portfolio to Doral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On July 16, R &amp; G filed an 8-K report stating that R &amp; G had obtained the TRO and describing its effect. That SEC report was a matter of public record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On the following day, Freddie Mac sent a letter to Doral formally notifying Doral that the TRO, issued by the federal court in Puerto Rico, put the planned transfer of the mortgage portfolio \"on hold.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On July 18, R &amp; G's general counsel wrote to his counterpart at Doral, by mail and e-mail. That communique notified Doral of the issuance of the TRO and admonished that the TRO \"precluded\" the implementation of Doral's agreement with Freddie Mac. Although a glitch in the address caused a delay in delivery of the hard copy of this letter, Doral's general counsel acknowledged that he received it no later than August 11. In any event, Doral never denied receiving the e-mail, so it presumably received that version on the day of transmission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Doral responded to these developments on August 14. On that date, it wrote to R &amp; G, advising that it would move to intervene in the pending action unless it was given a copy of the TRO. R &amp; G refused this ultimatum via e-mail on the following day, noting that all the paperwork in the case was under seal. The e-mail advised that Doral's interim servicing agreement was not directly at issue in the litigation but that, insofar as that agreement pertained to R &amp; G's portfolio of Freddie Mac mortgages, the TRO rendered Doral \"unable to perform.\"</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, we return to the travel of the case. Rather than holding a hearing on preliminary injunction, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b)(2)-(3), the district court extended the TRO several times by consent while settlement discussions percolated between R &amp; G and Freddie Mac. On September 18, those parties jointly moved under seal for court approval of a negotiated settlement that allowed R &amp; G to continue to service Freddie Mac mortgages until it could sell its servicing rights to a qualified third party.</p>\n<p>On the same day, Freddie Mac advised Doral of the settlement. It offered to provide a copy of the sealed settlement agreement, contingent upon Doral's execution of a confidentiality agreement. Although Freddie Mac and Doral subsequently agreed to the terms of the confidentiality agreement, Doral never signed it.</p>\n<p>The district court approved the settlement on September 25. A week later (on October 2), Doral moved to intervene <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> either as of right or permissively. Invoking our decision in <i>Banco Popular v. Greenblatt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583859\"><a href=\"/opinion/583859/banco-popular-de-puerto-rico-v-david-greenblatt-the-official-secured/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992), the district court denied the motion as untimely. The court later eschewed reconsideration. This seasonable appeal followed. We have jurisdiction because an order denying a motion to intervene is immediately appealable. <i>Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v.

DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>We first examine Doral's contention that it should have been granted leave to intervene as of right. We then turn to its alternative contention that it should have been granted leave to intervene permissively.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Intervention as of Right.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>To succeed on a motion to intervene as of right, a putative intervenor must establish (i) the timeliness of its motion to intervene; (ii) the existence of an interest relating to the property or transaction that forms the basis of the pending action; (iii) a realistic threat that the disposition of the action will impede its ability to protect that interest; and (iv) the lack of adequate representation of its position by any existing party. <i>See </i><i>Negrón-Almeda v. Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203315\"><a href=\"/opinion/203315/negron-almeda-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 2008); <i>B.

The movant must fulfill each of these preconditions. \"The failure to satisfy any one of them dooms intervention.\" <i>Patch,</i> 136 F.3d at 204.</p>\n<p>The court below recognized that when intervention is at issue, timeliness is the \"prevenient question.\" <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1230 (explaining that \"timeliness stands as a sentinel at the gates whenever intervention is requested and opposed\"). Consequently, the court started with the timeliness requirement. We emulate that approach.</p>\n<p>The timeliness inquiry is inherently fact-sensitive and depends on the totality of the circumstances. <i>Id.</i> at 1230-31. In evaluating that mosaic, the status of the litigation at the time of the request for intervention is \"highly relevant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1231. As a case progresses toward its ultimate conclusion, the scrutiny attached to a request for intervention necessarily intensifies. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>As a general matter, the case law reflects four factors that inform the timeliness inquiry: (i) the length of time that the putative intervenor knew or reasonably should have known that his interests were at risk before he moved to intervene; (ii) the prejudice to existing parties should intervention be allowed; (iii) the prejudice to the putative intervenor should intervention be denied; and (iv) any special circumstances militating for or against intervention. <i>Id.</i> Each of these factors must be appraised in light of the posture of the case at the time the motion is made. <i>Geiger v. Foley Hoag LLP Ret. Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203209\"><a href=\"/opinion/203209/geiger-v-foley-hoag-llp-retirement-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2008). Under this approach, motions to intervene that will have the effect of reopening settled cases are regarded with particular skepticism because such motions tend to prejudice the rights of the settling parties. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"65811\"><a href=\"/opinion/65811/in-re-lease-oil-antitrust-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 250 (5th Cir.2009); <i>Heartwood, Inc. v.

We caution, however, that the abuse of discretion standard is not one-dimensional. Within that rubric, a material error of law constitutes a per se abuse of discretion, <i>id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> at 22, and a trial court's answers to abstract legal questions are reviewed de novo, <i>Daggett v. Comm'n on Governmental Ethics &amp; Election Practices,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198424\"><a href=\"/opinion/198424/daggett-v-commission-on-govt/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1999). Moreover, a trial court's subsidiary findings as to raw facts are reviewed for clear error. <i>Ewers v. Heron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201759\"><a href=\"/opinion/201759/ewers-v-liner/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The Civil Rules contemplate two types of motions to intervene: intervention as of right, Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a), and permissive intervention, Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b). The differences are significant. We mention two particulars. First, in the case of a motion to intervene as of right, the district court's discretion is somewhat more constrained than in the case of a motion for permissive intervention. <i>See </i><i>Patch,</i> 136 F.3d at 204. Second, the timeliness requirement is often applied less strictly with respect to intervention as of right. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Navieros Inter-Americanos, S.A. v. M/V Vasilia Express,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197477\"><a href=\"/opinion/197477/navieros-v-jeftimiades/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 320 (1st Cir.1997). But we hasten to add a caveat: even in the case of a motion to intervene as of right, the district court's discretion is appreciable, and the timeliness requirement retains considerable bite.</p>\n<p>In this instance, Doral claims that it was entitled to intervene as of right because its contractual rights under the interim servicing agreement were directly impacted by R &amp; G's suit and that, in its absence, no other party would protect its interests. The lower court did not reach the merits of these claims. Rather, it concluded as a threshold matter that Doral could not vault the timeliness hurdle and, accordingly, denied the motion. We examine that rationale.</p>\n<p>A motion to intervene is timely if it is filed promptly after a person obtains actual or constructive notice that a pending case threatens to jeopardize his rights. <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231; <i>Caterino v. Barry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553332\"><a href=\"/opinion/553332/ronald-w-caterino-v-j-leo-barry-etc-teamsters-local-union-no-122/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir.1990). Perfect knowledge of the particulars of the pending litigation is not essential to start the clock running; knowledge of a measurable risk to one's rights is enough. <i>See </i><i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231; <i>Culbreath v. Dukakis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382058\"><a href=\"/opinion/382058/23-fair-emplpraccas-1588-24-empl-prac-dec-p-31235-barbara-culbreath/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 20-21 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n<p>In conducting a timeliness inquiry, there are no ironclad rules about just how celeritously, in terms of days or months, a person must move to protect himself after he has acquired the requisite quantum of knowledge. The passage of time is measured in relative, not absolute, terms. Thus, what may constitute reasonably prompt action in one situation may be unreasonably dilatory in another. <i>Compare, e.g., </i><i>Geiger,</i> 521 F.3d at 65 (nine-month delay in moving to intervene reasonable in particular circumstances), <i>with, e.g., </i><i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231-32 (three-month delay unreasonable in a different set of circumstances). In the last analysis, the timeliness inquiry centers on how diligently the putative intervenor has acted once he has received actual or constructive notice of the impending threat.</p>\n<p>The district court supportably found that Doral learned about the suit and the consequent jeopardy to its servicing rights during the July 15 conference call. Doral received confirmation that the TRO was in place in the form of an e-mail from R &amp; G, which was transmitted on July 18. That communication made it pellucid that the TRO adversely affected Doral's contractual rights. Doral obviously appreciated that fact; on August 14  armed with essentially the same information that it had on July 18  Doral threatened to intervene in the pending action in order to protect its rights. But despite this bluster, Doral inexplicably waited until October 2 before moving to intervene.</p>\n<p>The district court determined that a delay of two and one-half months after Doral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> knew of the incipient problem (that is, a delay from July 18 to October 2) was inexcusable. That determination was well within the realm of the court's discretion. As struthious as Doral may have been, it is simply implausible that Doral did not know by mid-July that its rights were imperilled.<sup>[4]</sup> Doral's failure to act until October amply supported the district court's ruling that its motion to intervene was unreasonably late. <i>See </i><i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231-32; <i>Caterino,</i> 922 F.2d at 40-41; <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 972 (1st Cir.1995) (explaining that, as a general proposition, \"the law ministers to the vigilant, not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights\").</p>\n<p>The district court did not directly address the other elements of the timeliness inquiry, but those elements weaken Doral's position even further. The second and third elements, which together involve the balance of harms, cut sharply against Doral. By the time that Doral moved to intervene, the original parties had forged a settlement of their dispute. Because Doral's proposed intervention was aimed at disrupting that settlement, the harm that intervention would have worked to the original parties was manifest.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1232. One of the core purposes of the timeliness requirement is to prevent disruptive, late-stage intervention that could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable diligence. <i>See </i><i>United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"412017\"><a href=\"/opinion/412017/united-nuclear-corporation-v-joseph-e-cannon-md-etc-conservation/\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 143 (1st Cir.1982); <i>see also </i><i>Heartwood,</i> 316 F.3d at 701 (stating that attempted post-settlement intervention \"strongly suggests\" a tactical attempt to thwart the settlement rather than to participate in the litigation).</p>\n<p>Doral argues that both R &amp; G and Freddie Mac knew of its potential claim and that knowledge of another party's potential claim vitiates any prejudice caused by the latter's tardiness in seeking intervention. That overstates the point. Acting in the face of knowledge about a potential claim may make it more difficult to show prejudice, but it does not excuse the claimant from its obligation to proceed with reasonable dispatch to protect its interests.</p>\n<p>Doral's claim of prejudice arising out of the denial of its motion to intervene is unconvincing. It asserts that the settlement \"substantially affects\" its ability to obtain specific performance as a remedy for Freddie Mac's alleged breach of the interim servicing agreement.<sup>[6]</sup> Appellant's Br. at 10. But any disadvantage at which Doral now finds itself amounts to a self-imposed wound. Had Doral acted with due diligence in pursuing intervention, the perceived hardship would not exist. For obvious reasons, a preventable hardship weighs less heavily in the balance of harms. <i>See </i><i>Larson v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189668\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189668/larson-v-jpmorgan-chase-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span>, 583-84 (7th Cir.2008); <i>United States v.

Doral still has an adequate remedy. It may bring a separate action against R &amp; G and/or Freddie Mac for money damages. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199913\"><a href=\"/opinion/199913/new-comm-wireless-v-sprint/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2002) (noting availability of damages for tortious interference with contract under local law); <i>Soggs v.

The availability of an adequate alternative remedy softens any plausible claim of prejudice. <i>N.Y. Chinese TV Programs, Inc. v. U.E. Enters., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span>, 72 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (explaining that the existence of alternative remedies \"is another commonly accepted basis for denying intervention\").</p>\n<p>The fourth element of the timeliness inquiry requires an assessment of whether any special circumstances exist. <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231. There are none here, save that the posture of the case colors the circumstances. Requests for post-settlement intervention are rarely granted. <i>See </i><i>Heartwood,</i> 316 F.3d at 701; <i>cf. </i><i>Chase Manhattan Bank v. Corporacion Hotelera De P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"327941\"><a href=\"/opinion/327941/the-chase-manhattan-bank-national-association-v-corporacion-hotelera-de/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span>, 1050 (1st Cir.1975) (describing proposed post-judgment intervention as \"unusual\").</p>\n<p>In this case, the four timeliness factors all point the same way. Nevertheless, Doral attempts to blunt their combined force by arguing that it was impossible to intervene more expeditiously because it did not know the civil action number, the identity of the judge, or certain other particulars concerning the pending case. This argument is jejune.</p>\n<p>Doral knew the identity of the parties and, notwithstanding its suggestion to the contrary, it clearly knew the court in which the case was pending. It also knew that its prized contract had been derailed and that its servicing rights thereunder were in grave danger. It had no reason to believe that the existing parties would sacrifice their own parochial interests in order to safeguard its interests. Last but not least, it knew that temporary restraining orders have a short shelf life, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 65(b)(2)-(3), and that, therefore, time was of the essence.</p>\n<p>If more were needed  and we doubt that it is  we note that Doral had the same basic information available to it in mid-July as on October 2 (when Doral's decision to intervene came to fruition). At that juncture, it had no difficulty in tracking down the case. It could have taken exactly the same steps in mid-July.</p>\n<p>To recapitulate, the record reflects undue delay by a putative intervenor with knowledge that its rights were in jeopardy. The record also reflects an unfavorable balance of harms and an absence of ameliorating circumstances. Accordingly, we conclude, without serious question, that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Doral  a sophisticated financial institution with lawyers on staff  waited too long to seek intervention as of right. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig.,</i> 570 F.3d at 250; <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1231-32; <i>see also </i><i>Heartwood,</i> 316 F.3d at 701 (\"Prompt [intervention] after settlement does not indicate timeliness, particularly where there is evidence that the intervenor should have known the suit could impact its interest for some time prior to the settlement.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Permissive Intervention.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Permissive intervention is governed by the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b). In this instance, we need not rehearse the elements needed to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> succeed under that rule. It suffices to say that when a putative intervenor seeks both intervention as of right and permissive intervention, a finding of untimeliness with respect to the former normally applies to the latter (and, therefore, dooms the movant's quest for permissive intervention). <i>See </i><i>Lucas v. McKeithen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"10960\"><a href=\"/opinion/10960/lucas-v-mckeithen/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 173 (5th Cir.1996); <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1230 n. 2; <i>Orange County v. Air Cal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475322\"><a href=\"/opinion/475322/county-of-orange-v-air-california-american-airlines-america-west-airlines/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, 538-39 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p>One might think at first blush that a somewhat different rule should apply because Doral's motion seeks permissive intervention not for the purpose of being heard on the merits of the dispute (although that may be its hidden agenda) but, rather, for the stated purpose of challenging the sealing order. In an appropriate case, that altered focus might make a difference. But this is not such a case.</p>\n<p>We begin with the basics. When a third party essays a challenge to a sealing order, permissive intervention is the procedurally correct vehicle. <i>See </i><i>Pub. Citizen v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512575\"><a href=\"/opinion/512575/public-citizen-v-liggett-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 783 (1st Cir.1988). The timeliness requirement still pertains, but with a wrinkle: the time of acquisition of knowledge of the sealing order itself, if different from the time of acquisition of knowledge of the suit, must be factored into the equation. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 785.</p>\n<p>The district court did not separately address this aspect of Doral's motion. This omission is understandable for two reasons. First, Doral did not file a proposed complaint when moving for intervention, though required to do so. <i>See</i> Fed. R. Civ P. 24(c) (stating that a motion for intervention must \"be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought\"). Second, Doral neither filed two separate motions nor made two separate formulations of the calculus of timeliness. It suggested instead, at least by implication, that exactly the same temporal considerations pertained to both branches of its motion to intervene.</p>\n<p>Doral's briefs on appeal follow this pattern. They do not separately discuss the timeliness of the two branches of its motion. The absence of developed argumentation on an issue is tantamount to abandonment of that issue. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). Doral has failed twice  once in the court below and again in this court  to offer any argument that timeliness should be measured differently vis-à-vis its request for permissive intervention. Consequently, we treat the district court's finding of untimeliness with respect to Doral's request to intervene as of right as applying with undiminished force to Doral's request for permissive intervention.</p>\n<p>That finding remains unimpugnable. As we explain below, Doral's challenge to the sealing order, as framed, is inextricably intertwined with its claim of an entitlement to intervene as of right.</p>\n<p>According to Doral's briefs, it sought access to the sealed materials through permissive intervention for the sole purpose of \"know[ing] precisely what happened\" so that it might \"secure a remedy\" for itself. Appellant's Br. at 7. These assertions fit tongue and groove with Doral's attempts to excuse its tardiness in moving to intervene as of right because the sealing order prevented it from acquiring precise knowledge about the particulars of the litigation. We rejected that argument in the Rule 24(a) context, <i>see supra</i> Part II(A), and it is no more hardy in the Rule 24(b) context.</p>\n<p>The discretion afforded to the district court under Rule 24, substantial in any event, is even broader when the issue is one of permissive intervention. <i>See </i><i>Navieros</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> <i>Inter-Americanos,</i> 120 F.3d at 320. Because it is readily apparent why the district court treated the two branches of Doral's motion to intervene as a unit, we can proceed with appellate review. <i>See </i><i>Negrón-Almeda,</i> 528 F.3d at 23 (explaining that when a trial court's order is imprecise, the court of appeals frequently \"can comb relevant parts of the record to discern the authoring court's intention\").</p>\n<p>That review need not detain us. We think it follows from what we have said that our analysis of Doral's attempt to challenge the sealing order is enmeshed with our analysis of the timeliness factors discussed above. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Doral knew of the sealing order virtually from the moment that it learned of the case itself, yet it delayed any challenge for some two and one-half months. In practical terms, Doral postponed any action until after the original parties had negotiated a settlement; this is particularly important with respect to the sealing order because confidentiality was something for which the parties had bargained.</p>\n<p>In addition, this aspect of Doral's motion exacerbates the prejudicial effect of its attempt to intervene on the merits. The purpose behind a motion to intervene is a relevant datum in the timeliness analysis. <i>Greenblatt,</i> 964 F.2d at 1230-34; <i>Pub. Citizen,</i> 858 F.2d at 786. Doral's request for permissive intervention sought to reopen a settled case and reverse a sealing order exclusively for its own benefit, not to vindicate a right of public access. Thus, the two prongs of Doral's attempt to waylay the parties' confidential settlement merge into one.</p>\n<p>In all events, Doral was not prejudiced by a lack of access to the district court record. It had an opportunity to obtain the documents it needed to evaluate its position by executing a confidentiality agreement. Even though it successfully negotiated the terms of that agreement, it refrained from signing the document. The record contains no satisfactory explanation as to why this sort of exchange would not have satisfied Doral's need to see the relevant papers.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>We add a coda. Doral's motion to intervene for the purpose of challenging the sealing order touches upon an issue of transparency in the federal judicial system. Placing court records out of public sight is a serious step, which should be undertaken only rarely and for good cause. Sealing orders are not like party favors, available upon request or as a mere accommodation. <i>See </i><i>Nixon v.

In the first instance, however, decisions about whether or not to seal are committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <i>Nixon,</i> 435 U.S. at 597-99, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109830\"><a href=\"/opinion/109830/nixon-v-warner-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, the absence of a timely challenge to the sealing order precludes any full-blown inquiry into the propriety of that order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we discern no abuse of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> discretion in the district court's denial of Doral's untimely motion to intervene.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We use the term \"post-settlement\" in lieu of the more familiar term \"post-judgment\" because the district court approved the final settlement agreement before the putative intervenor moved for leave to intervene, but did not enter judgment on the docket until several days later. Inasmuch as the parties have attached no significance to this chronological curiosity, we make no further mention of it.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although both R &amp; G Mortgage Corp. and R-G Premier Bank of Puerto Rico are plaintiffs, we refer to them collectively as R &amp; G.</p>\n<p>[3]  All dates are in 2008 unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p>[4]  Even if we were to assume that August 11, rather than July 18, was the date on which Doral's knowledge crystallized, that assumption would not assist Doral. The district court explicitly and supportably found that, if August 11 was the date on which Doral acquired knowledge of a measurable risk, it nonetheless failed to act in a timeous fashion.</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court apparently recognized this fact. Its order denying intervention stated that Doral should not be allowed to intervene at \"a crucial and decisive stage\" following the \"months of time and effort\" leading to the settlement.</p>\n<p>[6]  The record contains evidence that, in late 2008, R &amp; G completed the sale of its servicing rights to a third party.</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that this avenue still remains open to Doral. The district court expressly provided in its order that it was \"not preclud[ing] the parties and Doral from making any disclosure agreements through good faith out-of-court negotiations.\" Freddie Mac has offered to reveal the contents of the TRO and the settlement agreement pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (already negotiated between Doral and Freddie Mac), and Doral has never requested any other documents from Freddie Mac.</p>\n\n</div>",
