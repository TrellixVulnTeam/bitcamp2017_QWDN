Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f             JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.                    Felix Donnat\n\nappeals from his conviction for bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344\n\n(2000) and possession of a United States Treasury check bearing a\n\nforged endorsement under 18 U.S.C. § 510(b) (2000).                      Donnat argues\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence of his intent to defraud to\n\nsupport a conviction under § 1344 and that he should not have been\n\nconvicted     under    §    510(b)      because     he    did   not    know   that   the\n\nendorsement on the Treasury check in his possession had been\n\nforged.     He also contends that he is entitled to a new trial on the\n\ngrounds that the prosecutor violated Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610\n\n(1976), by asking him why he did not contact the Secret Service\n\nwith   an   exculpatory         story    he   first      told   at    trial   that   was\n\ninconsistent with a story he told the Secret Service after his\n\narrest.     We reject these arguments and affirm his conviction.\n\n                                          I.\n\n             Felix Donnat is a Haitian citizen who had been living in\n\nthe United States for twelve years.                 On January 27, 2001, Donnat\n\ndeposited a United States Treasury check payable to the Lewis\n\nAustin Weeks Trust in the amount of $888,023.78 into his own\n\nchecking     account       at   the     Citizen's     Bank      in    Manchester,    New\n\nHampshire. The Lewis Austin Weeks Trust is a private trust managed\n\nby Citibank for the benefit of, among others, Lewis Austin Weeks,\n\nwho is also its co-trustee.               At no time did Donnat know anyone\n\nnamed Lewis Austin Weeks, nor did he have any connection to the\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fLewis Austin Weeks trust.    The manager of the trust testified that\n\nat this time the trust was expecting a tax refund in this amount.\n\n\n\n          On the reverse side of the check, two lines were printed\n\nin handwritten manuscript:\n\n                Pay to the order of Donnat Felix\n\n                             Lewis Austin\n\nJust below this, Donnat signed his name.\n\n          There is no dispute that the printed name \"Lewis Austin\"\n\nwas a forgery and was not the endorsement of anyone authorized to\n\nnegotiate the check.   The payee named on the check was the Lewis\n\nAustin Weeks Trust, not \"Lewis Austin.\"      The trust manager also\n\ntestified that Lewis Austin Weeks always signed his name \"L. Austin\n\nWeeks.\"\n\n          Citizen's Bank refused to accept Donnat's deposit.    The\n\nbank's branch manager froze both Donnat's checking and savings\n\naccounts at the bank, refused to conduct any further business with\n\nDonnat, and on January 30, 2001, contacted the Secret Service,\n\nwhich commenced an investigation.\n\n          A grand jury indicted Donnat on one count of bank fraud\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1344 and one count of possession of a United\n\nStates Treasury check bearing a falsely made or forged endorsement\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 509(b).\n\n          Two days later, a Secret Service agent arrested Donnat.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fDonnat was informed of his Miranda rights and signed a waiver\n\nconsenting to speak to the agent without counsel.       The agent\n\nquestioned Donnat in the agent's vehicle while traveling to the\n\nMerrimack County Jail.     After arriving at the jail, the agent\n\nprepared a written statement from Donnat's answers, which Donnat\n\nreviewed, acknowledged, and signed.     Donnat stated that he had\n\nreceived the check in December, 2000 from an individual named\n\n\"Patrick,\" whom he had met one night at a Manchester nightclub\n\nwhere Donnat worked as a cook and a disc jockey.    Patrick asked\n\nDonnat to deposit the treasury check in Donnat's bank account.\n\nPatrick told Donnat that he would be able to keep five thousand\n\ndollars, so long as he sent Patrick the remainder of the proceeds\n\nin periodic installments of ten or twenty thousand dollars. Donnat\n\ntold the agent that he saw Patrick print the name \"Lewis Austin\"\n\nacross the back of the check and write \"pay to the order of Donnat\n\nFelix\" above this endorsement.\n\n          Donnat did not object to either the admission of this\n\nwritten statement or the agent's testimony about the interview.\n\nHowever, Donnat testified that he was given the check not by\n\nPatrick but by a different individual named \"Carlos,\" whose real\n\nname was Pegui Loubens and whom he identified as a business\n\nassociate of his brothers.       He said that Carlos asked him to\n\ndeposit the check in his account and that \"as a friend, I thought\n\nI would do him a favor.\"    He stated that the endorsement \"Lewis\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fAustin\" was already printed on the check when he received it and he\n\ndid not see Carlos write anything on the check.               He also testified\n\nthat he himself printed the phrase \"Pay to the order of Donnat\n\nFelix\" on the back of the check, above \"Lewis Austin,\" before\n\nattempting to deposit the check.          He claimed both that he was not\n\naware that the signature \"Lewis Austin\" on the back of the check\n\nwas a forgery and that he believed that Carlos was entitled to the\n\ncheck.   In all other respects, however, Donnat admitted that the\n\nstatement covered everything he said to the agent after his arrest.\n\n            The   jury   found   Donnat    guilty   on    both   counts.      The\n\ndistrict court sentenced Donnat to twenty-four months imprisonment.\n\nDonnat appeals.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            Donnat argues that the evidence presented at trial was\n\ninsufficient to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1344 and 18\n\nU.S.C. § 510(b). We will affirm Donnat's conviction if we conclude\n\nthat after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, \"any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United\n\nStates v.    Blasini-Lluberas,     169     F.3d   57,    62   (1st   Cir.   1999)\n\n(quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)).\n\n                                     A.\n\n            In order to obtain a conviction for bank fraud under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1344, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthat the defendant \"(1) engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud,\n\nor made false statements or misrepresentations to obtain money\n\nfrom; (2) a federally insured financial institution; (3) and did so\n\nknowingly.\"1    See United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).    Donnat challenges only the jury's finding that he had\n\nthe criminal intent required under § 1344, which we have held is\n\nthe specific \"intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it\n\nmoney or other property.\"    United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19,\n\n29 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 961 (2000); United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez-Alvorado, 952 F.2d 586, 589 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          We conclude that a rational jury could have found that\n\nDonnat executed some scheme or made a misrepresentation to the\n\nCitizen's Bank with the intent to deceive the bank in order to\n\nobtain money.     The jury saw Donnat's statement to the Secret\n\nService agent, in which Donnat said that the treasury check had\n\nbeen given to him by \"Patrick,\" whom Donnat had seen write the\n\nendorsement \"Lewis Austin\" on the back of the check.      From this\n\nevidence, the jury could have found that Donnat knew that this\n\nendorsement was a forgery. It could have reasonably concluded that\n\n\n     1\n      18 U.S.C. §1344 provides: \"Whoever knowingly executes, or\nattempts to execute, a scheme or artifice -\n     (1) to defraud a financial institution; or\n     (2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets,\nsecurities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or\ncontrol of, a financial institution, by means of false or\nfraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises; shall be fined\nnot more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or\nboth.\"\n\n                                 -6-\n\fby depositing this forged check into his own account, he intended\n\nto deceive the Citizen's Bank into believing that the check had\n\nbeen duly negotiated to him and that he was entitled to its\n\nproceeds.\n\n             At trial Donnat testified that when he received the check\n\nfrom \"Carlos,\" it already bore the endorsement \"Lewis Austin\" and\n\nthat he had no idea that this endorsement was a forgery.             However,\n\nthe jury was free to believe the statement he gave to the Secret\n\nService agent and dismiss his trial testimony as unworthy of\n\nbelief, and we may not reassess the credibility of a witness on\n\nappeal. Rodriquez-Alvorado, 952 F.2d at 589.             But even if the jury\n\nbelieved Donnat's claim that he did not see anyone forge the\n\nendorsement, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for it to\n\ninfer that Donnat participated in a scheme with the intent to\n\ndefraud the Citizen's Bank.         See Brandon, 17 F.3d at 425 (stating\n\nthat   fraudulent    intent   may    be    established    by   circumstantial\n\nevidence).     Donnat was aware of the extraordinary amount of the\n\ncheck and that the check was not payable to the person from whom he\n\nhad received it.    Furthermore, upon receiving the check, he agreed\n\nwith another person on a plan to distribute and allocate the\n\nproceeds of the check.\n\n                                      B.\n\n             Donnat also contends that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto convict him of knowingly possessing a United States Treasury\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fcheck bearing a forged endorsement under 18 U.S.C. 510(b).                    18\n\nU.S.C. 510(b) provides:\n\n     Whoever, with knowledge that such Treasury check or bond\n     or security of the United States is stolen or bears a\n     falsely made or forged endorsement or signature buys,\n     sells, exchanges, receives, delivers, retains, or\n     conceals any such Treasury check or bond or security of\n     the United States shall be fined under this title or\n     imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n\n            Donnat does not challenge the jury's findings that he\n\npossessed    a   United   States    Treasury   check     and   that   the   check\n\ncontained a forged endorsement.         Rather, he disputes only whether\n\nhe knew that this endorsement was a forgery.             However, as we have\n\ndiscussed above, Donnat admitted to the Secret Service agent that\n\nhe saw \"Patrick\" write someone else's name on the back of the\n\ncheck.      This   supports   the    jury's    finding    that   he   knew    the\n\nendorsement was forged.       The jury could have reasonably believed\n\nthis account over his later denial of any knowledge of the forgery.\n\nTherefore, we must uphold his conviction under 510(b).\n\n                                     III.\n\n            Donnat argues that the prosecutor violated Doyle v. Ohio,\n\n426 U.S. 610 (1975), by commenting on his post-arrest silence and\n\nthat he is therefore entitled to a new trial.             Towards the end of\n\ncross-examination of Donnat, the prosecutor asked Donnat:\n\n          Q: And there's no such person as Patrick. He never\n     existed.\n          A: No, sir.\n          Q: And at no time did you ever contact the Secret\n     Service after you first gave them a statement and say,\n     you know, I want to tell you about Carlos?\n\n                                      -8-\n\f          Donnat's counsel made a general objection to this last\n\nquestion, which the court sustained.            Donnat's counsel did not\n\nrequest a curative instruction regarding this question.\n\n          Donnat argues that this question violates Doyle because\n\nit was designed to impeach his testimony with his decision to\n\nremain silent after his arrest.        His argument has been foreclosed\n\nby the Supreme Court's decision in Anderson v. Charles, 447 U.S.\n\n404 (1979).     Doyle forbids a prosecutor from using a criminal\n\ndefendant's decision to remain silent at the time of arrest and\n\nafter   receiving   the   Miranda     warnings   to   impeach   his   trial\n\ntestimony, since the defendant's exercise of his Miranda rights\n\nwould effectively be penalized.            Doyle, 426 U.S. at 618.          In\n\nCharles, however, the Court held that when a defendant has given a\n\npost-arrest   statement   to   the    police,    Doyle   does   not   bar    a\n\nprosecutor from inquiring about the defendant's failure to tell the\n\npolice the exculpatory story he presented at trial, if that story\n\nis inconsistent with the post-arrest statement.          Charles, 447 U.S.\n\nat 408-09.    Where the defendant elects to speak to the police and\n\ngives statements that he later contradicts at trial, a prosecutor's\n\ninquiry into the defendant's failure to give the exculpatory\n\naccount before trial does not draw a negative inference from the\n\ndefendant's decision to remain silent but rather from his prior\n\ninconsistent statement.     See Charles, 447 U.S. at 409.         We noted\n\nin Grieco v. Hall, 641 F.2d 1029, 1034 (1st Cir. 1981), that\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\falthough Charles does not allow full cross-examination about the\n\ndefendant's failure to come forward with an exculpatory story\n\nwhenever he has made any post-arrest statement, it nevertheless\n\nestablished that \"Doyle will not protect a defendant who chose not\n\nto   remain    silent     after    arrest    about    the     subject   matter    of\n\nstatements he later contradicts at trial.\"\n\n              This case clearly falls within the scope of Charles.\n\nDonnat's      testimony    at     trial     contradicted      the   statement     he\n\npreviously gave to the Secret Service agent.                The prosecutor then\n\nquestioned Donnat about why he did not tell the police about Carlos\n\nbefore   trial.     Under       Charles,     the   question    in   this   case   is\n\npermissible because it does not draw meaning from Donnat’s reliance\n\non his right to remain silent but instead seeks an explanation for\n\nhis prior inconsistent statement to the Secret Service agent.                     See\n\n447 U.S. at 409.\n\n              Donnat argues that Charles only allows a prosecutor to\n\nask this question in order to establish that the defendant made a\n\nprior inconsistent statement.             Since he had already admitted that\n\nhe made a prior inconsistent statement, he argues that the final\n\nquestion was designed to impeach his trial testimony only through\n\nhis post-arrest silence.          We reject this argument, since Charles\n\nspecifically allows the prosecutor \"to elicit an explanation for a\n\nprior inconsistent statement.\"             Charles, 447 U.S. at 409.\n\n              Finally, Donnat argues that the prosecutor's question\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fviolated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel by\n\nimproperly suggesting that Donnat had an obligation to contact\n\neither the Secret Service or the police without the assistance of\n\ncounsel.   This claim is without merit.   The prosecutor's question\n\nhad nothing to do with whether Donnat should or should not have\n\ncommunicated through counsel.     It was not designed to draw a\n\nnegative inference from Donnat's exercise of his Sixth Amendment\n\nright to rely on counsel as a medium between him and the State and\n\nthus did not unfairly burden Donnat's Sixth Amendment right to\n\ncounsel.\n\n                                IV.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Donnat's conviction\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1344 and 18 U.S.C. §510(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

The jury saw Donnat's statement to the Secret Service agent, in which Donnat said that the treasury check had been given to him by \"Patrick,\" whom Donnat had seen write the endorsement \"Lewis Austin\" on the back of the check. From this evidence, the jury could have found that Donnat knew that this endorsement was a forgery. It could have reasonably concluded that by depositing this forged check into his own account, he intended to deceive the Citizen's Bank into believing that the check had been duly negotiated to him and that he was entitled to its proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Donnat testified that when he received the check from \"Carlos,\" it already bore the endorsement \"Lewis Austin\" and that he had no idea that this endorsement was a forgery. However, the jury was free to believe the statement he gave to the Secret Service agent and dismiss his trial testimony as unworthy of belief, and we may not reassess the credibility of a witness on appeal. <i>Rodriguez-Alvarado,</i> 952 F.2d at 589. But even if the jury believed Donnat's claim that he did not see anyone forge the endorsement, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for it to infer that Donnat participated in a scheme with the intent to defraud the Citizen's Bank. <i>See Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 425 (stating that fraudulent intent may be established by circumstantial evidence). Donnat was aware of the extraordinary amount of the check and that the check was not payable to the person from whom he had received it. Furthermore, upon receiving the check, he agreed with another person on a plan to distribute and allocate the proceeds of the check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat also contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of knowingly possessing a United States Treasury check bearing a forged endorsement under 18 U.S.C. 510(b). 18 U.S.C. 510(b) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever, with knowledge that such Treasury check or bond or security of the United States is stolen or bears a falsely made or forged endorsement or signature buys, sells, exchanges, receives, delivers, retains, or conceals any such Treasury check or bond or security of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat does not challenge the jury's findings that he possessed a United States Treasury check and that the check contained a forged endorsement. Rather, he disputes only whether he knew that this endorsement was a forgery. However, as we have discussed above, Donnat admitted to the Secret Service agent that he saw \"Patrick\" write someone else's name on the back of the check. This supports the jury's finding that he knew the endorsement was forged. The jury could have reasonably believed this account over his later denial of any knowledge of the forgery. Therefore, we must uphold his conviction under 510(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat argues that the prosecutor violated <i>Doyle v. Ohio,</i> 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), by commenting on his post-arrest silence and that he is therefore entitled to a new trial. Towards the end of cross-examination of Donnat, the prosecutor asked Donnat:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And there's no such person as Patrick. He never existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And at no time did you ever contact the Secret Service after you first gave them a statement and say, you know, I want to tell you about Carlos?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat's counsel made a general objection to this last question, which the court sustained. Donnat's counsel did not request a curative instruction regarding this question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat argues that this question violates <i>Doyle</i> because it was designed to impeach his testimony with his decision to remain silent after his arrest. His argument has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Anderson v. Charles,</i> 447 U.S. 404, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980). <i>Doyle</i> forbids a prosecutor from using a criminal defendant's decision to remain silent at the time of arrest and after receiving the <i>Miranda</i> warnings to impeach his trial testimony, since the defendant's exercise of his <i>Miranda</i> rights would effectively be penalized. <i>Doyle,</i> 426 U.S. at 618, 96 S.Ct. 2240. In <i>Charles,</i> however, the Court held that when a defendant has given a post-arrest statement to the police, <i>Doyle</i> does not bar a prosecutor from inquiring about the defendant's failure to tell the police the exculpatory story he presented at trial, if that story is inconsistent with the post-arrest statement. <i>Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 408-09, 100 S.Ct. 2180. Where the defendant elects to speak to the police and gives statements that he later contradicts at trial, a prosecutor's inquiry into the defendant's failure to give the exculpatory account before trial does not draw a negative inference from the defendant's decision to remain silent but rather from his prior inconsistent statement. <i>See Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 409, 100 S.Ct. 2180. We noted in <i>Grieco v. Hall,</i> 641 F.2d 1029, 1034 (1st Cir.1981), that although <i>Charles</i> does not allow full cross-examination about the defendant's failure to come forward with an exculpatory story whenever he has made any post-arrest statement, it nevertheless established that \"<i>Doyle</i> will not protect a defendant who chose not to remain silent after arrest about the subject matter of statements he later contradicts at trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case clearly falls within the scope of <i>Charles.</i> Donnat's testimony at trial contradicted the statement he previously gave to the Secret Service agent. The prosecutor then questioned Donnat about why he did not tell the police about Carlos before trial. Under <i>Charles,</i> the question in this case is permissible because it does not draw meaning from Donnat's reliance on his right to remain silent but instead seeks an explanation for his prior inconsistent statement to the Secret Service agent. <i>See</i> 447 U.S. at 409, 100 S.Ct. 2180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat argues that <i>Charles</i> only allows a prosecutor to ask this question in order to establish that the defendant made a prior inconsistent statement. Since he had already admitted that he made a prior inconsistent statement, he argues that the final question was designed to impeach his trial testimony only through his post-arrest silence. We reject this argument, since <i>Charles</i> specifically allows the prosecutor \"to elicit an explanation for a prior inconsistent statement.\" <i>Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 409, 100 S.Ct. 2180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Donnat argues that the prosecutor's question violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel by improperly suggesting that Donnat had an obligation to contact either the Secret Service or the police without the assistance of counsel. This claim is without merit. The prosecutor's question had nothing to do with whether Donnat should or should not have communicated through counsel. It was not designed to draw a negative inference from Donnat's exercise of his Sixth Amendment right to rely on counsel as a medium between him and the State and thus did not unfairly burden Donnat's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Donnat's conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 510(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

Rodriguez-Alvarado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574881\"><a href=\"/opinion/574881/united-states-v-ismael-rodriguez-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 589 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that a rational jury could have found that Donnat executed some scheme or made a misrepresentation to the Citizen's Bank with the intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain money. The jury saw Donnat's statement to the Secret Service agent, in which Donnat said that the treasury check had been given to him by \"Patrick,\" whom Donnat had seen write the endorsement \"Lewis Austin\" on the back of the check. From this evidence, the jury could have found that Donnat knew that this endorsement was a forgery. It could have reasonably concluded that by depositing this forged check into his own account, he intended to deceive the Citizen's Bank into believing that the check had been duly negotiated to him and that he was entitled to its proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Donnat testified that when he received the check from \"Carlos,\" it already bore the endorsement \"Lewis Austin\" and that he had no idea that this endorsement was a forgery. However, the jury was free to believe the statement he gave to the Secret Service agent and dismiss his trial testimony as unworthy of belief, and we may not reassess the credibility of a witness on appeal. <i>Rodriguez-Alvarado,</i> 952 F.2d at 589. But even if the jury believed Donnat's claim that he did not see anyone forge the endorsement, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for it to infer that Donnat participated in a scheme with the intent to defraud the Citizen's Bank. <i>See Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d at 425 (stating that fraudulent intent may be established by circumstantial evidence). Donnat was aware of the extraordinary amount of the check and that the check was not payable to the person from whom he had received it. Furthermore, upon receiving the check, he agreed with another person on a plan to distribute and allocate the proceeds of the check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat also contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of knowingly possessing a United States Treasury check bearing a forged endorsement under 18 U.S.C. 510(b). 18 U.S.C. 510(b) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever, with knowledge that such Treasury check or bond or security of the United States is stolen or bears a falsely made or forged endorsement or signature buys, sells, exchanges, receives, delivers, retains, or conceals any such Treasury check or bond or security of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat does not challenge the jury's findings that he possessed a United States Treasury check and that the check contained a forged endorsement. Rather, he disputes only whether he knew that this endorsement was a forgery. However, as we have discussed above, Donnat admitted to the Secret Service agent that he saw \"Patrick\" write someone else's name on the back of the check. This supports the jury's finding that he knew the endorsement was forged. The jury could have reasonably believed this account over his later denial of any knowledge of the forgery. Therefore, we must uphold his conviction under 510(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat argues that the prosecutor violated <i>Doyle v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span> (1976), by commenting on his post-arrest silence and that he is therefore entitled to a new trial. Towards the end of cross-examination of Donnat, the prosecutor asked Donnat:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And there's no such person as Patrick. He never existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And at no time did you ever contact the Secret Service after you first gave them a statement and say, you know, I want to tell you about Carlos?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat's counsel made a general objection to this last question, which the court sustained. Donnat's counsel did not request a curative instruction regarding this question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat argues that this question violates <i>Doyle</i> because it was designed to impeach his testimony with his decision to remain silent after his arrest. His argument has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Anderson v. Charles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2180</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1980). <i>Doyle</i> forbids a prosecutor from using a criminal defendant's decision to remain silent at the time of arrest and after receiving the <i>Miranda</i> warnings to impeach his trial testimony, since the defendant's exercise of his <i>Miranda</i> rights would effectively be penalized. <i>Doyle,</i> 426 U.S. at 618, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2240</span></a></span>. In <i>Charles,</i> however, the Court held that when a defendant has given a post-arrest statement to the police, <i>Doyle</i> does not bar a prosecutor from inquiring about the defendant's failure to tell the police the exculpatory story he presented at trial, if that story is inconsistent with the post-arrest statement. <i>Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 408-09, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2180</span></a></span>. Where the defendant elects to speak to the police and gives statements that he later contradicts at trial, a prosecutor's inquiry into the defendant's failure to give the exculpatory account before trial does not draw a negative inference from the defendant's decision to remain silent but rather from his prior inconsistent statement. <i>See Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 409, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2180</span></a></span>. We noted in <i>Grieco v. Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387369\"><a href=\"/opinion/387369/louis-grieco-v-frank-a-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span>, 1034 (1st Cir.1981), that although <i>Charles</i> does not allow full cross-examination about the defendant's failure to come forward with an exculpatory story whenever he has made any post-arrest statement, it nevertheless established that \"<i>Doyle</i> will not protect a defendant who chose not to remain silent after arrest about the subject matter of statements he later contradicts at trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case clearly falls within the scope of <i>Charles.</i> Donnat's testimony at trial contradicted the statement he previously gave to the Secret Service agent. The prosecutor then questioned Donnat about why he did not tell the police about Carlos before trial. Under <i>Charles,</i> the question in this case is permissible because it does not draw meaning from Donnat's reliance on his right to remain silent but instead seeks an explanation for his prior inconsistent statement to the Secret Service agent. <i>See</i> 447 U.S. at 409, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2180</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnat argues that <i>Charles</i> only allows a prosecutor to ask this question in order to establish that the defendant made a prior inconsistent statement. Since he had already admitted that he made a prior inconsistent statement, he argues that the final question was designed to impeach his trial testimony only through his post-arrest silence. We reject this argument, since <i>Charles</i> specifically allows the prosecutor \"to elicit an explanation for a prior inconsistent statement.\" <i>Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 409, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This claim is without merit. The prosecutor's question had nothing to do with whether Donnat should or should not have communicated through counsel. It was not designed to draw a negative inference from Donnat's exercise of his Sixth Amendment right to rely on counsel as a medium between him and the State and thus did not unfairly burden Donnat's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Donnat's conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 510(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.
