William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                 Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n              and Stafford, Jr.,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     J.

Levenson, with whom Leonard H. Kesten, Deidre Brennan\nRegan, and Brody, Hardoon, Perkins & Kesten, LLP were on brief, for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                            June 22, 2007\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of Northern Florida, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. This case asks us to determine\n\nwhether a plaintiff in a land-use dispute must prove that a\n\ndefendant engaged in behavior that \"shocks the conscience\" in order\n\nto prevail on a substantive due process claim related to that\n\ndispute.   Eugene Mongeau, a landowner, brought suit against the\n\nCity of Marlborough (the \"City\") and Stephen Reid, the Commissioner\n\nof Inspectional Services for the City of Marlborough (collectively,\n\n\"Defendants\"), after Reid denied him a building permit.                 Mongeau\n\nalleged, inter alia, that Reid, in his official capacity, violated\n\nMongeau's Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights. The\n\ndistrict court granted judgment in favor of Reid, holding that\n\nMongeau failed to allege that Reid engaged in behavior that shocked\n\nthe conscience.      We reaffirm our earlier holdings1 that a plaintiff\n\nmay   prevail   on   a   substantive    due    process   claim   only   if   the\n\ndefendant has engaged in behavior that \"shocks the conscience,\" and\n\naffirm the judgment in favor of Reid.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n           In 1991, the City commenced eminent domain proceedings\n\nagainst various parcels of land.              Mongeau owned three of those\n\nparcels as part of a larger tract of land.           Mongeau agreed to sell\n\nthe parcels to the City in exchange for $450,000 and a promise by\n\n\n1\n   See, e.g., Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir. 2006);\nSFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodríguez, 415 F.3d 135, 141 (1st Cir. 2005);\nNéstor Colón Medina & Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 45\n(1st Cir. 1992) (quoting PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rodríguez, 928\nF.2d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthe City that Mongeau would be able to construct a \"60 ft. by 80\n\nft. building\" on the remaining tract \"in full compliance with the\n\nbuilding code and ordinance[s] of the City of Marlborough.\"\n\n            In 2003, Mongeau submitted an application to the City of\n\nMarlborough Building Department to construct a 35 ft. by 40 ft.\n\nbuilding on the tract covered by the prior settlement. Reid denied\n\nthe application, citing a lack of proper frontage and access as\n\nreasons for the denial.       Later in 2003, Mongeau submitted an\n\napplication to build a 60 ft. by 110 ft. building on the site.\n\nReid again rejected the application, giving as reasons the proposed\n\nbuilding's lack of frontage and location on a former railway\n\nright-of-way, and Mongeau's failure to submit the plan to the Site\n\nPlan Review Committee.      Mongeau appealed the rejection of the\n\nbuilding permit to the Marlborough Zoning Board of Appeals (\"ZBA\").\n\nReid wrote a memo to the ZBA urging them to reject Mongeau's\n\nappeal.     On June 16, 2003, the ZBA granted Mongeau's appeal,\n\nallowing him to build a 60 ft. by 80 ft. structure, waiving the\n\nfrontage,     \"sideyard   planting,\"   and    \"minimum   centerline\"\n\nrequirements, and granting a right-of-way.       The ZBA's decision\n\nrequired Mongeau to submit his plans for approval by the Site Plan\n\nReview Committee and the Conservation Commission and stated that\n\nthe variances granted to Mongeau would expire in one year.\n\n            Mongeau and the Site Plan Review Committee, of which Reid\n\nis a member, embarked on a long series of negotiations for the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fCommittee's approval which required various revisions to Mongeau's\n\nbuilding plans. Because of the delays, Mongeau sought and received\n\nextensions of his variances from the ZBA.          In December 2004, Reid\n\nallegedly   informed   Mongeau   that   he   had   insufficient   time   to\n\nconsider the revised site plan and suggested that Mongeau request\n\nanother extension of the ZBA variance.             On December 14, 2004,\n\nMongeau applied for and received an extension until June 15, 2005.\n\nMongeau alleges that the following day, Reid threatened to appeal\n\nthe extension and told Mongeau that he would not issue a building\n\npermit for the structure.\n\n            Nevertheless, on May 23, 2005, the Site Plan Review\n\nCommittee approved Mongeau's site plan. Likewise, the Conservation\n\nCommission also approved Mongeau's site plan, subject to certain\n\nconditions. A citizens committee filed an appeal of the conditions\n\nentered by the Conservation Commission.             Mongeau alleges \"on\n\ninformation and belief\" that Reid \"orchestrated\" this appeal.\n\nMongeau's variance lapsed on June 15, 2005, and the ZBA refused to\n\ngrant another extension.\n\n            On September 6, 2005, the Massachusetts Department of\n\nEnvironmental Protection rejected the citizens committee's appeal\n\nand affirmed the order of the Conservation Commission.            Mongeau\n\nthen applied for a building permit.          On October 19, 2005, Reid\n\ndenied the permit application, stating that the ZBA variance had\n\nexpired and that the \"property is deficient in many ways.\"           Reid\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\falso stated that Mongeau could apply for another variance with the\n\nZBA.   Mongeau alleges that Reid's recalcitrance in refusing to\n\nissue the building permit was due to the fact that Mongeau had\n\nnever offered to make an unspecified \"mitigation payment\" to the\n\nCity of Marlborough.\n\n          On December 22, 2005, Mongeau filed suit in the Superior\n\nCourt of Middlesex, Massachusetts against Defendants, seeking a\n\ndeclaratory   judgment   that   he    was   entitled   to    construct   his\n\nbuilding, injunctive relief ordering the City of Marlborough to\n\nissue him a building permit, and damages arising from violations of\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Massachusetts state law.          Defendants removed\n\nthe case to the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts and moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).       The district court granted\n\njudgment in favor of Defendants on all of Mongeau's federal claims\n\nand remanded the remaining state law claims to state court.               In\n\nparticular, the district court said that to state a substantive due\n\nprocess violation, a plaintiff needed to allege that defendants\n\nacted in a manner that shocked the conscience.              The court ruled\n\nthat most of Reid's alleged behavior was not so outrageous that it\n\nshocked the conscience.   The court stated the allegation that Reid\n\ndemanded \"mitigation payments\" before issuing the permit might\n\nshock the conscience, but that it was not alleged to be a common\n\npractice of the City, and as such, could not be imputed to Reid in\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhis official capacity.      As such, the court decided that Mongeau's\n\nallegations, taken as true, did not state a substantive due process\n\nclaim against Reid in his individual capacity.2                 Mongeau now\n\nappeals.\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\n                         A. Standard of Review\n\n           We review a district court's grant of judgment on the\n\npleadings de novo.   Mass. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Adams Reg'l Hosp., 467\n\nF.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2006).    We \"accept all the well-pleaded facts\n\nas true, draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant\n\n. . . , and grant the motion only if it appears that the nonmovant\n\ncould prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief.\"              Id.\n\n     B. The Requirements for a Substantive Due Process Claim\n\n           We have stated with \"a regularity bordering on the\n\nmonotonous\" that to be liable for a violation of substantive due\n\nprocess rights, a defendant must have engaged in behavior that is\n\n\"conscience-shocking\": \"the substantive due process doctrine may\n\nnot, in the ordinary course, be invoked to challenge discretionary\n\npermitting   or   licensing    determinations      of   state     or     local\n\ndecisionmakers,   whether    those    decisions   are   right   or     wrong.\"\n\nPagán, 448 F.3d at 33.    We have repeatedly affirmed the use of this\n\n\n2\n  The court also granted judgment in favor of Reid on a procedural\ndue process claim and found that Reid was entitled to qualified\nimmunity on claims against him in his personal capacity. Mongeau\ndoes not appeal these decisions.     The court then remanded the\nstate-law claims to the Massachusetts Superior Court.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fstandard in the context of challenges to land use decisions.         See,\n\ne.g., PFZ Properties, Inc., 928 F.2d at 31 (\"[R]ejections of\n\ndevelopment projects and refusals to issue building permits do not\n\nordinarily implicate substantive due process. Even where state\n\nofficials have allegedly violated state law or administrative\n\nprocedures, such violations do not ordinarily rise to the level of\n\na constitutional deprivation.\" (internal citations omitted)); see\n\nalso SFW Arecibo, 415 F.3d at 141; Néstor Colón, 964 F.2d at 46.\n\n           Nevertheless,   Mongeau     argues   that   the    shocks-the-\n\nconscience test is inappropriate when analyzing a substantive due\n\nprocess claim in the land use context, and that instead, we should\n\nuse an \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard.       Mongeau contends that\n\nthe   shocks-the-conscience   standard    is    appropriate   only   when\n\naddressing a claim where state officials have made split-second\n\njudgments, i.e., when they have not had time to deliberate before\n\ncoming to a decision to engage in the behavior that is the basis of\n\nthe claim.   Mongeau points to case law from other circuits which\n\nsuggests that the application of the shocks-the-conscience standard\n\nto deliberate decisions by state officials is problematic.           See,\n\ne.g., Khan v. Gallitano, 180 F.3d 829, 836 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"[T]he\n\nCourt [in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833 (1998),] made\n\nclear that its shocks-the-conscience analysis was not generally\n\napplicable to all substantive-due-process claims.\"); Moreland v.\n\nLas Vegas Metro. Police Dep't, 159 F.3d 365, 372 (9th Cir. 1998)\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f(\"[T]he critical consideration [in determining whether to apply the\n\n'shocks the conscience test'] [i]s whether the circumstances are\n\nsuch that 'actual deliberation is practical.'\" (quoting Lewis, 523\n\nU.S. at 851)).        However, a closer examination of Lewis -- the\n\nprincipal case relied upon by Khan and Moreland – belies Mongeau's\n\nassertion.      In    Lewis,    the   Supreme   Court    did     not   reject   the\n\napplication     of    the   shocks-the-conscience        test     to   deliberate\n\ndecisions, but instead stated that its application would vary with\n\nthe circumstances.       523 U.S. at 851 (\"[A]ttention to the markedly\n\ndifferent circumstances of normal pretrial custody and high-speed\n\nlaw enforcement chases shows why the deliberate indifference that\n\nshocks in the one case is less egregious in the other.\").                 We have\n\nnever precluded a plaintiff from arguing that conduct that is the\n\nproduct    of   a    deliberate   and    premeditated     decision      might   be\n\nconscience-shocking whereas the same conduct might not be if it was\n\nundertaken in the heat of the moment.           Ultimately such an argument\n\nwould not affect our conclusion that only conscience-shocking\n\nbehavior will constitute a substantive due process violation.\n\n            Mongeau also contends that our use of the shocks-the-\n\nconscience standard is justified only by a footnote in Creative\n\nEnvironments, Inc. v. Estabrook, 680 F.2d 822 (1st Cir. 1982).                   In\n\nthat case, we stated that \"[w]here a state has provided reasonable\n\nremedies   to   rectify     a   legal   error   by   a   local    administrative\n\nbody . . . current authority indicates that due process has been\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fprovided, and that section 1983 is not a means for litigating the\n\ncorrectness of the state or local administrative decision in a\n\nfederal forum.\"       Id. at 832 n.9.         Mongeau contends that this means\n\nthat a substantive due process claim turns on the adequacy of state\n\nremedies, i.e., if state remedies were adequate, a substantive due\n\nprocess claim could only be brought when the defendant's conduct\n\nshocked the conscience.\n\n            This    is    a    flawed    reading    of     Creative    Environments.\n\nFirst, it is more likely that footnote 9 was referring to the\n\nplaintiff's procedural due process rights; throughout the opinion,\n\nwe referred to \"due process\" without distinguishing its procedural\n\nand substantive components.              See id. at 831-32.         Second, Creative\n\nEnvironments has not been subsequently cited by any First Circuit\n\ncase for the proposition that a substantive due process claim is\n\ndependent    on    procedural       remedies.       Cf.    Chongris     v.   Board   of\n\nAppeals,    811    F.2d       36,   40   (1st    Cir.     1987)    (citing   Creative\n\nEnvironments for the proposition that \"[w]here state procedures --\n\nthough     arguably      imperfect       --     provide     a     suitable   form    of\n\npredeprivation hearing coupled with the availability of meaningful\n\njudicial review, the fourteenth amendment guarantee of procedural\n\ndue process is not embarrassed\" (emphasis added)).                       Finally, we\n\nexpressly rejected this proposition in Amsden v. Moran when we\n\nstated: \"As distinguished from its procedural cousin, then, a\n\nsubstantive due process inquiry focuses on 'what' the government\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fhas done, as opposed to 'how and when' the government did it.\"         904\n\nF.2d 748, 754 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           In any case, Mongeau's arguments suffer from a more fatal\n\ndefect: we recently decided that the shocks-the-conscience test\n\napplied to a substantive due process claim in the land use context,\n\nsee SFW Arecibo, 415 F.3d at 141, and we are bound by the prior\n\npanel decisions of this Court.    It is true that we have recognized\n\nat least two exceptions to the rule that we must follow the\n\nprecedent of this Circuit.    First, we may depart from the holding\n\nof a prior panel decision if \"a preexisting panel opinion is\n\nundermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as\n\na decision of the Supreme Court, a decision of the en banc court,\n\nor a statutory overruling.\"   Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d\n\n344, 349 (1st Cir. 2004).      Second, we may deviate from a prior\n\nholding of this Circuit in \"those relatively rare instances in\n\nwhich authority that postdates the original decision, although not\n\ndirectly   controlling,   nevertheless   offers   a   sound   reason   for\n\nbelieving that the former panel, in light of fresh developments,\n\nwould change its collective mind.\"      Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,\n\n45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995), abrogated on other grounds by\n\nCarpenters Local Union No. 26 v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.,\n\n215 F.3d 136, 145 (1st Cir. 2000).         We do not find, nor does\n\nMongeau offer, any reason why either of these exceptions to the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdoctrine of stare decisis should apply, and as such, we are bound\n\nby our decision in SFW Arecibo.\n\n           Mongeau rejoins that our precedent on this issue has been\n\ninconsistent,    resulting     in    standards   ranging   from   \"clearly\n\narbitrary and unreasonable,\" Roberts v. City of Woonsocket, 575\n\nF.2d 339, 341 (1st Cir. 1978) (quoting Village Euclid v. Ambler\n\nRealty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 395 (1926)), to \"when some basic and\n\nfundamental     principle      has    been   transgressed     that   'the\n\nconstitutional line has been crossed,'\" Amsden, 904 F.2d 748, 754\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d\n\nCir. 1973)), to a \"truly horrendous situation[],\" Néstor Colón, 964\n\nF.2d at 45.     While we have used various incantations to describe\n\nthe standard for prevailing on a substantive due process claim, we\n\nhave \"decline[d] the invitation to sort out so wide a variety of\n\nlabels.\"   Amsden, 904 F.2d at 754.          \"[A]lthough the yardstick\n\nagainst which substantive due process violations are measured has\n\nbeen characterized in various ways, we are satisfied that, before\n\na constitutional infringement occurs, state action must in and of\n\nitself     be     egregiously        unacceptable,     outrageous,     or\n\nconscience-shocking.\"    Id.\n\n           Thus, our precedent on this issue is both clear and\n\nbinding on this case: in order to state a substantive due process\n\nclaim of any ilk, a plaintiff must allege behavior on the part of\n\nthe defendant that is so outrageous that it shocks the conscience.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f                             C. Mongeau's Claim\n\n              Having reaffirmed the proper standard for a substantive\n\ndue process claim, we must now examine Mongeau's allegations to\n\ndetermine whether Reid's behavior shocks the conscience.                       The\n\ndistrict court determined that nearly all of Mongeau's allegations\n\n-- that Reid had denied his building permit and interfered in the\n\nzoning    process    for   improper    reasons   --    failed    to   shock    the\n\nconscience.      We agree.    We rejected a similar claim in Licari v.\n\nFerruzzi, where the plaintiffs alleged that \"hostility and animus\"\n\nmotivated the revocation of a building permit and the issuance of\n\ncertain enforcement orders.       22 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir. 1994).             In\n\nthe   past,    we   have   indicated    that   one    of   the   problems     with\n\nadjudicating claims of \"bias\" or \"animus\" in the zoning context is\n\nthat \"[e]very appeal by a disappointed developer from an adverse\n\nruling by a local . . . planning board necessarily involves some\n\nclaim that the board exceeded, abused or 'distorted' its legal\n\nauthority in some manner, often for some allegedly perverse (from\n\nthe developer's point of view) reason.\"          Creative Env'ts, 680 F.2d\n\nat 833.       For that reason, we have generally been hesitant \"to\n\ninvolve federal courts in the rights and wrongs of local planning\n\ndisputes\" unless there is a \"truly horrendous situation[].\" Néstor\n\nColón, 964 F.2d at 45.         Taking all of Mongeau's allegations as\n\ntrue, we do not see such a conscience-shocking situation; we can\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fdiscern nothing more than a run-of-the-mill dispute between a\n\ndeveloper and a town official.\n\n          The district court hinted that Mongeau might have stated\n\na substantive due process claim inasmuch as he alleged that his\n\npermit was denied because he had failed to offer a \"mitigation\n\npayment\" to the City of Marlborough. In Néstor Colón, we suggested\n\nthat it was possible that bribery or threats could constitute a\n\nsubstantive due process violation.      Id. at 47.

Eugene Mongeau, a landowner, brought suit against the City of Marlborough (the \"City\") and Stephen Reid, the Commissioner of Inspectional Services for the City of Marlborough (collectively, \"Defendants\"), after Reid denied him a building permit. Mongeau alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> that Reid, in his official capacity, violated Mongeau's Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights. The district court granted judgment in favor of Reid, holding that Mongeau failed to allege that Reid engaged in behavior that shocked the conscience. We reaffirm our earlier holdings<sup>[1]</sup> that a plaintiff may prevail on a substantive due process claim only if the defendant has engaged in behavior that \"shocks the conscience,\" and affirm the judgment in favor of Reid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 1991, the City commenced eminent domain proceedings against various parcels of land. Mongeau owned three of those parcels as part of a larger tract of land. Mongeau agreed to sell the parcels to the City in exchange for $450,000 and a promise by the City that Mongeau would be able to construct a \"60 ft. by 80 ft. building\" on the remaining tract \"in full compliance with the building code and ordinance[s] of the City of Marlborough.\"</p>\n<p>In 2003, Mongeau submitted an application to the City of Marlborough Building Department to construct a 35 ft. by 40 ft. building on the tract covered by the prior settlement. Reid denied the application, citing a lack of proper frontage and access as reasons for the denial. Later in 2003, Mongeau submitted an application to build a 60 ft. by 110 ft. building on the site. Reid again rejected the application, giving as reasons the proposed building's lack of frontage and location on a former railway right-of-way, and Mongeau's failure to submit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> the plan to the Site Plan Review Committee. Mongeau appealed the rejection of the building permit to the Marlborough Zoning Board of Appeals (\"ZBA\"). Reid wrote a memo to the ZBA urging them to reject Mongeau's appeal. On June 16, 2003, the ZBA granted Mongeau's appeal, allowing him to build a 60 ft. by 80 ft. structure, waiving the frontage, \"sideyard planting,\" and \"minimum centerline\" requirements, and granting a right-of-way. The ZBA's decision required Mongeau to submit his plans for approval by the Site Plan Review Committee and the Conservation Commission and stated that the variances granted to Mongeau would expire in one year.</p>\n<p>Mongeau and the Site Plan Review Committee, of which Reid is a member, embarked on a long series of negotiations for the Committee's approval which required various revisions to Mongeau's building plans. Because of the delays, Mongeau sought and received extensions of his variances from the ZBA. In December 2004, Reid allegedly informed Mongeau that he had insufficient time to consider the revised site plan and suggested that Mongeau request another extension of the ZBA variance. On December 14, 2004, Mongeau applied for and received an extension until June 15, 2005. Mongeau alleges that the following day, Reid threatened to appeal the extension and told Mongeau that he would not issue a building permit for the structure.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, on May 23, 2005, the Site Plan Review Committee approved Mongeau's site plan. Likewise, the Conservation Commission also approved Mongeau's site plan, subject to certain conditions. A citizens committee filed an appeal of the conditions entered by the Conservation Commission. Mongeau alleges \"on information and belief\" that Reid \"orchestrated\" this appeal. Mongeau's variance lapsed on June 15, 2005, and the ZBA refused to grant another extension.</p>\n<p>On September 6, 2005, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection rejected the citizens committee's appeal and affirmed the order of the Conservation Commission. Mongeau then applied for a building permit. On October 19, 2005, Reid denied the permit application, stating that the ZBA variance had expired and that the \"property is deficient in many ways.\" Reid also stated that Mongeau could apply for another variance with the ZBA. Mongeau alleges that Reid's recalcitrance in refusing to issue the building permit was due to the fact that Mongeau had never offered to make an unspecified \"mitigation payment\" to the City of Marlborough.</p>\n<p>On December 22, 2005, Mongeau filed suit in the Superior Court of Middlesex, Massachusetts against Defendants, seeking a declaratory judgment that he was entitled to construct his building, injunctive relief ordering the City of Marlborough to issue him a building permit, and damages arising from violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Massachusetts state law. Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). The district court granted judgment in favor of Defendants on all of Mongeau's federal claims and remanded the remaining state law claims to state court. In particular, the district court said that to state a substantive due process violation, a plaintiff needed to allege that defendants acted in a manner that shocked the conscience. The court ruled that most of Reid's alleged behavior was not so outrageous that it shocked the conscience. The court stated the allegation that Reid demanded \"mitigation payments\" before issuing the permit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> might shock the conscience, but that it was not alleged to be a common practice of the City, and as such, could not be imputed to Reid in his official capacity. As such, the court decided that Mongeau's allegations, taken as true, did not state a substantive due process claim against Reid in his individual capacity.<sup>[2]</sup> Mongeau now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Standard of Review</i></h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of judgment on the pleadings <i>de novo. </i><i>Mass. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Adams Reg'l Hosp.,</i> 467 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2006). We \"accept all the well-pleaded facts as true, draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant . . ., and grant the motion only if it appears that the nonmovant could prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. The Requirements for a Substantive Due Process Claim</i></h2>\n<p>We have stated with \"a regularity bordering on the monotonous\" that to be liable for a violation of substantive due process rights, a defendant must have engaged in behavior that is \"conscience-shocking\": \"the substantive due process doctrine may not, in the ordinary course, be invoked to challenge discretionary permitting or licensing determinations of state or local decisionmakers, whether those decisions are right or wrong.\" <i>Pagán,</i> 448 F.3d at 33. We have repeatedly affirmed the use of this standard in the context of challenges to land use decisions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>PFZ Properties, Inc.,</i> 928 F.2d at 31 (\"[R]ejections of development projects and refusals to issue building permits do not ordinarily implicate substantive due process. Even where state officials have allegedly violated state law or administrative procedures, such violations do not ordinarily rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation.\" (internal citations omitted)); <i>see also </i><i>SFW Arecibo,</i> 415 F.3d at 141; <i>Néstor Colón,</i> 964 F.2d at 46.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Mongeau argues that the shocks-the-conscience test is inappropriate when analyzing a substantive due process claim in the land use context, and that instead, we should use an \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard. Mongeau contends that the shocks-the-conscience standard is appropriate only when addressing a claim where state officials have made split-second judgments, <i>i.e.,</i> when they have not had time to deliberate before coming to a decision to engage in the behavior that is the basis of the claim. Mongeau points to case law from other circuits which suggests that the application of the shocks-the-conscience standard to deliberate decisions by state officials is problematic. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Khan v. Gallitano,</i> 180 F.3d 829, 836 (7th Cir.1999) (\"[T]he Court [in <i>County of Sacramento v. Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998),] made clear that its shocks-the-conscience analysis was not generally applicable to all substantive-due-process claims.\"); <i>Moreland v. Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep't,</i> 159 F.3d 365, 372 (9th Cir. 1998) (\"[T]he critical consideration [in determining whether to apply the `shocks the conscience test'] [i]s whether the circumstances are such that `actual deliberation is practical.'\" (quoting <i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 851, 118 S.Ct. 1708)). However, a closer examination of <i>Lewis</i>  the principal case relied upon by <i>Khan</i> and <i>Moreland</i>  belies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> Mongeau's assertion. In <i>Lewis,</i> the Supreme Court did not reject the application of the shocks-the-conscience test to deliberate decisions, but instead stated that its application would vary with the circumstances. 523 U.S. at 851, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (\"[A]ttention to the markedly different circumstances of normal pretrial custody and high-speed law enforcement chases shows why the deliberate indifference that shocks in the one case is less egregious in the other.\"). We have never precluded a plaintiff from arguing that conduct that is the product of a deliberate and premeditated decision might be conscience-shocking whereas the same conduct might not be if it was undertaken in the heat of the moment. Ultimately such an argument would not affect our conclusion that only conscience-shocking behavior will constitute a substantive due process violation.</p>\n<p>Mongeau also contends that our use of the shocks-the-conscience standard is justified only by a footnote in <i>Creative Environments, Inc. v. Estabrook,</i> 680 F.2d 822 (1st Cir.1982). In that case, we stated that \"[w]here a state has provided reasonable remedies to rectify a legal error by a local administrative body . . . current authority indicates that due process has been provided, and that section 1983 is not a means for litigating the correctness of the state or local administrative decision in a federal forum.\" <i>Id.</i> at 832 n. 9. Mongeau contends that this means that a substantive due process claim turns on the adequacy of state remedies, <i>i.e.,</i> if state remedies were adequate, a substantive due process claim could only be brought when the defendant's conduct shocked the conscience.</p>\n<p>This is a flawed reading of <i>Creative Environments.</i> First, it is more likely that footnote 9 was referring to the plaintiff's procedural due process rights; throughout the opinion, we referred to \"due process\" without distinguishing its procedural and substantive components. <i>See id.</i> at 831-32. Second, <i>Creative Environments</i> has not been subsequently cited by any First Circuit case for the proposition that a <i>substantive</i> due process claim is dependent on procedural remedies. <i>Cf. </i><i>Chongris v. Board of Appeals,</i> 811 F.2d 36, 40 (1st Cir.1987) (citing <i>Creative Environments</i> for the proposition that \"[w]here state procedures  though arguably imperfect  provide a suitable form of predeprivation hearing coupled with the availability of meaningful judicial review, the fourteenth amendment guarantee of <i>procedural</i> due process is not embarrassed\" (emphasis added)). Finally, we expressly rejected this proposition in <i>Amsden v. Moran</i> when we stated: \"As distinguished from its procedural cousin, then, a substantive due process inquiry focuses on `what' the government has done, as opposed to `how and when' the government did it.\" 904 F.2d 748, 754 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>In any case, Mongeau's arguments suffer from a more fatal defect: we recently decided that the shocks-the-conscience test applied to a substantive due process claim in the land use context, <i>see </i><i>SFW Arecibo,</i> 415 F.3d at 141, and we are bound by the prior panel decisions of this Court. It is true that we have recognized at least two exceptions to the rule that we must follow the precedent of this Circuit. First, we may depart from the holding of a prior panel decision if \"a preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court, a decision of the en banc court, or a statutory overruling.\" <i>Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.2004). Second, we may deviate from a prior holding of this Circuit in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind.\" <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir.1995), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 215 F.3d 136, 145 (1st Cir.2000). We do not find, nor does Mongeau offer, any reason why either of these exceptions to the doctrine of stare decisis should apply, and as such, we are bound by our decision in <i>SFW Arecibo.</i></p>\n<p>Mongeau rejoins that our precedent on this issue has been inconsistent, resulting in standards ranging from \"clearly arbitrary and unreasonable,\" <i>Roberts v. City of Woonsocket,</i> 575 F.2d 339, 341 (1st Cir. 1978) (quoting <i>Village Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.,</i> 272 U.S. 365, 395, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926)), to \"when some basic and fundamental principle has been transgressed that `the constitutional line has been crossed,'\" <i>Amsden,</i> 904 F.2d 748, 754 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting <i>Johnson v. Glick,</i> 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir.1973)), to a \"truly horrendous situation[ ],\" <i>Néstor Colón,</i> 964 F.2d at 45. While we have used various incantations to describe the standard for prevailing on a substantive due process claim, we have \"decline[d] the invitation to sort out so wide a variety of labels.\" <i>Amsden,</i> 904 F.2d at 754. \"[A]lthough the yardstick against which substantive due process violations are measured has been characterized in various ways, we are satisfied that, before a constitutional infringement occurs, state action must in and of itself be egregiously unacceptable, outrageous, or conscience-shocking.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Thus, our precedent on this issue is both clear and binding on this case: in order to state a substantive due process claim of any ilk, a plaintiff must allege behavior on the part of the defendant that is so outrageous that it shocks the conscience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Mongeau's Claim</i></h2>\n<p>Having reaffirmed the proper standard for a substantive due process claim, we must now examine Mongeau's allegations to determine whether Reid's behavior shocks the conscience. The district court determined that nearly all of Mongeau's allegations  that Reid had denied his building permit and interfered in the zoning process for improper reasons  failed to shock the conscience. We agree. We rejected a similar claim in <i>Licari v. Ferruzzi,</i> where the plaintiffs alleged that \"hostility and animus\" motivated the revocation of a building permit and the issuance of certain enforcement orders. 22 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.1994). In the past, we have indicated that one of the problems with adjudicating claims of \"bias\" or \"animus\" in the zoning context is that \"[e]very appeal by a disappointed developer from an adverse ruling by a local . . . planning board necessarily involves some claim that the board exceeded, abused or `distorted' its legal authority in some manner, often for some allegedly perverse (from the developer's point of view) reason.\" <i>Creative Env'ts,</i> 680 F.2d at 833. For that reason, we have generally been hesitant \"to involve federal courts in the rights and wrongs of local planning disputes\" unless there is a \"truly horrendous situation[ ].\" <i>Néstor Colón,</i> 964 F.2d at 45. Taking all of Mongeau's allegations as true, we do not see such a conscience-shocking situation; we can discern nothing more than a run-of-the-mill dispute between a developer and a town official.</p>\n<p>The district court hinted that Mongeau might have stated a substantive due process claim inasmuch as he alleged that his permit was denied because he had failed to offer a \"mitigation payment\" to the City of Marlborough. In <i>Néstor Colón,</i> we suggested that it was possible that bribery or threats could constitute a substantive due <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> process violation. <i>Id.</i> at 47. However, at oral argument, counsel for Mongeau made it clear that he was not alleging that the City or Reid was seeking a \"bribe.\"<sup>[3]</sup> If Mongeau believes that the City or Reid has wrongly charged or demanded too much for his building permit, he may find recourse in other laws, but not in the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such conduct, without more, cannot be said to transgress \"some basic and fundamental principle . . . [such] that `the constitutional line has been crossed'\" and our conscience is shocked. <i>Amsden,</i> 904 F.2d at 754.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Northern Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pagán v. Calderón,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir.2006); <i>SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodríguez,</i> 415 F.3d 135, 141 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Néstor Colón Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting <i>PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rodríguez,</i> 928 F.2d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p>[2]  The court also granted judgment in favor of Reid on a procedural due process claim and found that Reid was entitled to qualified immunity on claims against him in his personal capacity. Mongeau does not appeal these decisions. The court then remanded the state-law claims to the Massachusetts Superior Court.</p>\n<p>[3]  In a particularly confusing exchange at oral argument, Mongeau's counsel stated that while Reid did not demand a bribe of any sort, the permit was not approved because Mongeau did not offer a \"mitigation payment,\" which counsel insinuated was improperly demanded by the city. We still do not understand what Mongeau's purported \"mitigation payment\" is, but we take counsel at his word that it would not constitute a \"bribe\" within the meaning of <i>Néstor Colón.</i> Accordingly, we see no need to address the argument advanced by the district court that Reid's conduct did not form part of a pattern or common practice of the City.</p>\n\n</div>",

Even where state officials have allegedly violated state law or administrative procedures, such violations do not ordinarily rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation.\" (internal citations omitted)); <i>see also </i><i>SFW Arecibo,</i> 415 F.3d at 141; <i>Néstor Colón,</i> 964 F.2d at 46.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Mongeau argues that the shocks-the-conscience test is inappropriate when analyzing a substantive due process claim in the land use context, and that instead, we should use an \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard. Mongeau contends that the shocks-the-conscience standard is appropriate only when addressing a claim where state officials have made split-second judgments, <i>i.e.,</i> when they have not had time to deliberate before coming to a decision to engage in the behavior that is the basis of the claim. Mongeau points to case law from other circuits which suggests that the application of the shocks-the-conscience standard to deliberate decisions by state officials is problematic. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Khan v. Gallitano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764850\"><a href=\"/opinion/764850/lynda-j-khan-cross-appellee-v-dennis-j-gallitano-nancy-j-czarnik/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span>, 836 (7th Cir.1999) (\"[T]he Court [in <i>County of Sacramento v.

Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758771\"><a href=\"/opinion/758771/98-cal-daily-op-serv-7387-98-daily-journal-dar-10270-98-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 372 (9th Cir. 1998) (\"[T]he critical consideration [in determining whether to apply the `shocks the conscience test'] [i]s whether the circumstances are such that `actual deliberation is practical.'\" (quoting <i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 851, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1708</span></a></span>)). However, a closer examination of <i>Lewis</i>  the principal case relied upon by <i>Khan</i> and <i>Moreland</i>  belies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> Mongeau's assertion. In <i>Lewis,</i> the Supreme Court did not reject the application of the shocks-the-conscience test to deliberate decisions, but instead stated that its application would vary with the circumstances. 523 U.S. at 851, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1708</span></a></span> (\"[A]ttention to the markedly different circumstances of normal pretrial custody and high-speed law enforcement chases shows why the deliberate indifference that shocks in the one case is less egregious in the other.\"). We have never precluded a plaintiff from arguing that conduct that is the product of a deliberate and premeditated decision might be conscience-shocking whereas the same conduct might not be if it was undertaken in the heat of the moment. Ultimately such an argument would not affect our conclusion that only conscience-shocking behavior will constitute a substantive due process violation.</p>\n<p>Mongeau also contends that our use of the shocks-the-conscience standard is justified only by a footnote in <i>Creative Environments, Inc. v. Estabrook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405155\"><a href=\"/opinion/405155/creative-environments-inc-v-robert-estabrook/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1982). In that case, we stated that \"[w]here a state has provided reasonable remedies to rectify a legal error by a local administrative body . . . current authority indicates that due process has been provided, and that section 1983 is not a means for litigating the correctness of the state or local administrative decision in a federal forum.\" <i>Id.</i> at 832 n. 9. Mongeau contends that this means that a substantive due process claim turns on the adequacy of state remedies, <i>i.e.,</i> if state remedies were adequate, a substantive due process claim could only be brought when the defendant's conduct shocked the conscience.</p>\n<p>This is a flawed reading of <i>Creative Environments.</i> First, it is more likely that footnote 9 was referring to the plaintiff's procedural due process rights; throughout the opinion, we referred to \"due process\" without distinguishing its procedural and substantive components. <i>See id.</i> at 831-32. Second, <i>Creative Environments</i> has not been subsequently cited by any First Circuit case for the proposition that a <i>substantive</i> due process claim is dependent on procedural remedies. <i>Cf. </i><i>Chongris v. Board of Appeals,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482848\"><a href=\"/opinion/482848/james-chongris-and-george-chongris-v-board-of-appeals-of-the-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1987) (citing <i>Creative Environments</i> for the proposition that \"[w]here state procedures  though arguably imperfect  provide a suitable form of predeprivation hearing coupled with the availability of meaningful judicial review, the fourteenth amendment guarantee of <i>procedural</i> due process is not embarrassed\" (emphasis added)). Finally, we expressly rejected this proposition in <i>Amsden v. Moran</i> when we stated: \"As distinguished from its procedural cousin, then, a substantive due process inquiry focuses on `what' the government has done, as opposed to `how and when' the government did it.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542853\"><a href=\"/opinion/542853/henry-h-amsden-v-thomas-f-moran-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 754 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>In any case, Mongeau's arguments suffer from a more fatal defect: we recently decided that the shocks-the-conscience test applied to a substantive due process claim in the land use context, <i>see </i><i>SFW Arecibo,</i> 415 F.3d at 141, and we are bound by the prior panel decisions of this Court. It is true that we have recognized at least two exceptions to the rule that we must follow the precedent of this Circuit. First, we may depart from the holding of a prior panel decision if \"a preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court, a decision of the en banc court, or a statutory overruling.\" <i>Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201301\"><a href=\"/opinion/201301/eulitt-v-me-dept-of-edu/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 349 (1st Cir.2004). Second, we may deviate from a prior holding of this Circuit in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind.\" <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 592 (1st Cir.1995), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v.

We do not find, nor does Mongeau offer, any reason why either of these exceptions to the doctrine of stare decisis should apply, and as such, we are bound by our decision in <i>SFW Arecibo.</i></p>\n<p>Mongeau rejoins that our precedent on this issue has been inconsistent, resulting in standards ranging from \"clearly arbitrary and unreasonable,\" <i>Roberts v. City of Woonsocket,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355497\"><a href=\"/opinion/355497/david-k-roberts-v-city-of-woonsocket/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, 341 (1st Cir. 1978) (quoting <i>Village Euclid v.

While we have used various incantations to describe the standard for prevailing on a substantive due process claim, we have \"decline[d] the invitation to sort out so wide a variety of labels.\" <i>Amsden,</i> 904 F.2d at 754. \"[A]lthough the yardstick against which substantive due process violations are measured has been characterized in various ways, we are satisfied that, before a constitutional infringement occurs, state action must in and of itself be egregiously unacceptable, outrageous, or conscience-shocking.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Thus, our precedent on this issue is both clear and binding on this case: in order to state a substantive due process claim of any ilk, a plaintiff must allege behavior on the part of the defendant that is so outrageous that it shocks the conscience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Mongeau's Claim</i></h2>\n<p>Having reaffirmed the proper standard for a substantive due process claim, we must now examine Mongeau's allegations to determine whether Reid's behavior shocks the conscience. The district court determined that nearly all of Mongeau's allegations  that Reid had denied his building permit and interfered in the zoning process for improper reasons  failed to shock the conscience. We agree. We rejected a similar claim in <i>Licari v. Ferruzzi,</i> where the plaintiffs alleged that \"hostility and animus\" motivated the revocation of a building permit and the issuance of certain enforcement orders. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195323\"><a href=\"/opinion/195323/licari-v-ferruzzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 349 (1st Cir.1994). In the past, we have indicated that one of the problems with adjudicating claims of \"bias\" or \"animus\" in the zoning context is that \"[e]very appeal by a disappointed developer from an adverse ruling by a local . . . planning board necessarily involves some claim that the board exceeded, abused or `distorted' its legal authority in some manner, often for some allegedly perverse (from the developer's point of view) reason.\" <i>Creative Env'ts,</i> 680 F.2d at 833. For that reason, we have generally been hesitant \"to involve federal courts in the rights and wrongs of local planning disputes\" unless there is a \"truly horrendous situation[ ].\" <i>Néstor Colón,</i> 964 F.2d at 45. Taking all of Mongeau's allegations as true, we do not see such a conscience-shocking situation; we can discern nothing more than a run-of-the-mill dispute between a developer and a town official.</p>\n<p>The district court hinted that Mongeau might have stated a substantive due process claim inasmuch as he alleged that his permit was denied because he had failed to offer a \"mitigation payment\" to the City of Marlborough. In <i>Néstor Colón,</i> we suggested that it was possible that bribery or threats could constitute a substantive due <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> process violation. <i>Id.</i> at 47. However, at oral argument, counsel for Mongeau made it clear that he was not alleging that the City or Reid was seeking a \"bribe.\"<sup>[3]</sup> If Mongeau believes that the City or Reid has wrongly charged or demanded too much for his building permit, he may find recourse in other laws, but not in the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such conduct, without more, cannot be said to transgress \"some basic and fundamental principle . . . [such] that `the constitutional line has been crossed'\" and our conscience is shocked. <i>Amsden,</i> 904 F.2d at 754.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Northern Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pagán v.

Mongeau does not appeal these decisions. The court then remanded the state-law claims to the Massachusetts Superior Court.</p>\n<p>[3]  In a particularly confusing exchange at oral argument, Mongeau's counsel stated that while Reid did not demand a bribe of any sort, the permit was not approved because Mongeau did not offer a \"mitigation payment,\" which counsel insinuated was improperly demanded by the city. We still do not understand what Mongeau's purported \"mitigation payment\" is, but we take counsel at his word that it would not constitute a \"bribe\" within the meaning of <i>Néstor Colón.</i> Accordingly, we see no need to address the argument advanced by the district court that Reid's conduct did not form part of a pattern or common practice of the City.</p>\n\n</div>",
