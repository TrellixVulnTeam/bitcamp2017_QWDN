In an appeal brought by the\n\ngovernment, we must decide whether the district court erred when it\n\ngranted Daniel Carpenter a new trial because the government's use\n\nof inflammatory language during its closing and rebuttal arguments\n\nprejudiced the jury and denied Carpenter a fair trial.   In a cross-\n\nappeal, Carpenter asserts that the district court erred in failing\n\nto grant his motion for judgment of acquittal.    We affirm the new\n\ntrial ruling.    We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to hear\n\nCarpenter's cross-appeal.\n\n                                 I.\n\nA.   Factual Background\n\n           We briefly rehearse the relevant facts, which are largely\n\nundisputed.   In October 1998, Daniel Carpenter and Martin Paley\n\nformed Benistar Property Exchange Trust Company, Inc. (\"Benistar\")\n\nfor the purpose of performing property exchanges pursuant to\n\nsection 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1031.\n\n§ 1031(a)(1) allows a seller of \"property held for productive use\n\nin a trade or business or for investment\" to avoid capital gains on\n\nthe sales proceeds if they are used to purchase a replacement\n\nproperty meeting the same criteria.      In order to qualify, the\n\nseller must complete the exchange within 180 days of the original\n\nsale and must not take control of the proceeds in the interim,\n\n§ 1031(a)(3). Accordingly, property owners typically entrust their\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fsales proceeds to a qualified intermediary until they purchase\n\nreplacement property; Benistar was created to play this role.\n\n            Benistar's   clients   signed    standard    form   agreements\n\nproviding that property sale proceeds be transmitted by wire or\n\ncheck directly from the closing attorney into a Benistar account.\n\nClients chose between a Merrill Lynch Ready Asset Money Market\n\nAccount, yielding a 3% return on investment per annum (which\n\nallowed clients to access their funds upon 48 hours' notice), and\n\na Merrill Lynch Investment Account, yielding 6% interest (which\n\nrequired 30 days' notice before funds could be accessed).\n\n            According to the agreement between Paley and Carpenter,\n\nPaley marketed Benistar's services to clients while Carpenter\n\nmaintained   sole   authority   over   the   financial   aspects   of   the\n\nbusiness.     Carpenter opened two accounts at Merrill Lynch in\n\nOctober 1998: the \"B01 account,\" into which client funds were\n\ndeposited; and the \"B10 account,\" into which Carpenter transferred\n\nclient funds which he then invested.           When he opened the B10\n\naccount, Carpenter characterized his risk tolerance as \"aggressive\"\n\nand he informed Merrill Lynch that he intended to engage in options\n\ntrading.    As is their practice, Merrill Lynch counseled Carpenter\n\non the riskiness of these investments and required him to sign a\n\nform acknowledging his understanding of those risks.\n\n            From October 1998 until late September 2000, Carpenter\n\ntransferred funds from the B01 account to the B10 account and\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ftraded extensively in stock options.          While his trading strategy\n\nwas successful at first,1 Carpenter lost significant sums when the\n\nstock market began to decline in March 2000.                 As the market\n\ncontinued       to   decline   thereafter,   his   Merrill   Lynch   brokers\n\nrepeatedly counseled Carpenter to adopt a more conservative trading\n\nstrategy.      After Carpenter sustained roughly $4 million in losses,\n\nMerrill Lynch suspended his trading privileges.\n\n               Carpenter then moved his trading activity to PaineWebber,\n\nwhere he again opened linked accounts: client funds were deposited\n\nby mail or wire into one account and he engaged in stock option\n\ntrading from the other account.        As had Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber\n\ncounseled Carpenter on the risks inherent in options trading;\n\nCarpenter acknowledged these risks and continued his aggressive\n\ninvestment strategy.       Carpenter continued to sustain heavy trading\n\nlosses at PaineWebber and, despite his broker's urging that he\n\nadopt a more conservative investment strategy, Carpenter increased\n\nthe size and riskiness of his trades as his fortunes declined.\n\nPaineWebber discontinued Carpenter's trading privileges in December\n\n2000.       Although Benistar had been losing client funds since March\n\n2000, incoming funds had covered the losses.          However, by January\n\n2001, Benistar was forced to tell its clients that their money was\n\n\n\n\n        1\n       Indeed, testimony indicated that, in the fourth quarter of\n1999, Carpenter was \"up\" roughly $800,000.00, providing Carpenter\nwith slightly more than $600,000.00 in profit.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fgone. Benistar subsequently ceased operations, having lost roughly\n\n$9 million in client funds.\n\nB.   Carpenter's Trial\n\n           Carpenter was indicted in February 2004 by a federal\n\ngrand jury in the District of Massachusetts on fourteen counts of\n\nwire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and five counts of\n\nmail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341.                In particular,\n\nCarpenter was charged with having devised and implemented a scheme\n\nto defraud investors by representing that their money would be\n\ninvested   prudently    in   conformity   with    the   property    exchange\n\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code while he intended to\n\npursue an investment strategy at odds with such representations.\n\nCritically, clients transferred funds to Carpenter and Benistar by\n\nmail and wire in response to the investment scheme.            Because both\n\nmail and wire fraud require an intent to defraud, the trial focused\n\nlargely on Carpenter's state of mind when he obtained the funds of\n\nBenistar's clients through the representations made to them.\n\n           In   his    defense,   Carpenter      portrayed    his   lack   of\n\ninteraction with clients and his lack of knowledge about Benistar's\n\npromotional materials.       He contended that any assurances made to\n\nclients about the risks to their funds were made by Paley alone and\n\nwithout his knowledge.2 In addition, Carpenter emphasized that the\n\n\n     2\n      Paley provided extensive documentary evidence and deposition\ntestimony to the government as it built its case.         He also\ntestified as a witness against Carpenter at trial. No criminal\n\n                                   -5-\n\fclient agreements placed no restrictions on how funds would be\n\nmanaged in order to produce the 3% or 6% return selected by the\n\nclients.      Carpenter argued that he never misled clients into\n\nbelieving their funds would be safe.        Rather, he insisted that he\n\nacted with the good faith belief that he had unfettered discretion\n\nto invest client funds.      He attributed Benistar's losses not to an\n\nunwise trading strategy but to a generalized stock market crash\n\nwell beyond his control.\n\n            The government focused on the incongruity between the\n\nnature of a § 1031 property exchange (a transaction structured to\n\navoid capital gains while allowing investors to use the proceeds of\n\none property sale to purchase a replacement property within a short\n\nperiod of time) and the aggressive nature of Carpenter's investment\n\nbehavior.      It   contended   that     this   incongruity   demonstrated\n\nCarpenter's intent to mislead Benistar's clients into depositing\n\ntheir real estate proceeds with a supposedly safe intermediary so\n\nthat he could leverage the funds into a substantial profit for\n\nhimself through risky options trading.          To prove this agenda, the\n\nprosecution    sought   to   introduce    extensive   evidence   regarding\n\nCarpenter's investment behavior, relying chiefly on testimony from\n\nhis brokers at Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber.\n\n\n\n\ncharges were brought against Paley in connection with this wire and\nmail fraud scheme.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f                 Carpenter's counsel objected to such evidence before its\n\nintroduction and throughout the trial, arguing that testimony\n\nregarding         Carpenter's       trading    strategy     and    losses     was    both\n\nirrelevant to establishing his state of mind at the time he\n\nobtained client funds and also highly prejudicial.                            The court\n\ndenied counsel's motions in limine and his repeated objections,\n\nruling that the brokers could testify as to factual matters for the\n\nlimited purpose of allowing the jury to \"consider[] the historical\n\nfact        of   the   kind    of   trading   that    was   done   so   the   jury    can\n\ndecide . . . whether [Carpenter] had the requisite criminal state\n\nof mind\" when investors were assured that their funds would be kept\n\nsafe.        The court also determined that, because no foundation had\n\nbeen laid to treat them as experts, these witnesses could not\n\nprovide opinion testimony.                In addition, the court repeatedly\n\nexpressed its concern that such evidence not be used to distract\n\nthe jurors from the elements of the charged offenses of mail and\n\nwire fraud. These witnesses's testimony dominated three of the ten\n\ndays of Carpenter's trial.\n\n                 During       its   closing     and   rebuttal      arguments,3       the\n\ngovernment emphasized that the riskiness of Carpenter's trading\n\nstrategy conflicted with the purposes for which Benistar's clients\n\nentrusted their money to Carpenter's management.                        In making this\n\n\n\n        3\n       The closing and rebuttal arguments will be referred to\nhereinafter as \"the closing arguments.\"\n\n                                              -7-\n\fargument, the government embellished its description of Carpenter's\n\ntrading strategy with gambling metaphors and terminology intended\n\nto show Carpenter's recklessness.\n\n          A jury convicted Carpenter on all counts.        Shortly\n\nthereafter, Carpenter filed motions for a new trial under the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure 33(b)(2) and for judgment of\n\nacquittal under Rule 29(c), each raising several grounds.      The\n\ndistrict court granted the motion for a new trial, ruling that the\n\ngovernment's repeated use of gambling metaphors during its closing\n\narguments \"may [] have induced a verdict based on the jury's moral\n\ndisapproval of the 'gambling'\" rather than on the jury's conclusion\n\nthat Carpenter had committed mail and wire fraud. United States v.\n\nCarpenter, 405 F. Supp. 2d 85, 102 (D. Mass. 2005).      The court\n\ndenied the motion for acquittal and subsequently denied Carpenter's\n\nmotion for reconsideration.   The government appealed the new trial\n\nruling pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 37314 and Carpenter filed a cross-\n\nappeal, arguing that the court wrongly decided his motion for\n\nacquittal.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      We note that the government's ability to appeal the district\ncourt's grant of a motion for a new trial is a relatively recent\nphenomenon, arising from the 1984 amendments to § 3731.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f                                       II.\n\nA.   The Motion for a New Trial\n\n            The government contends that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in granting the motion for a new trial because: (1)\n\nit did not apply plain error review despite Carpenter's failure to\n\nobject to the government's use of gambling metaphors until after\n\nthe jury delivered its verdict; (2) the government's references to\n\ngambling were not improper under any standard; and (3) even if the\n\ngambling    references   were   improper,       they   did   not   amount   to   a\n\n\"miscarriage of justice,\" warranting a new trial.                   England v.\n\nReinauer Transp. Cos., 194 F.3d 265, 270 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing\n\nConway v. Electro Switch Corp., 825 F.2d 593, 598-99 (1st Cir.\n\n1987)).    We consider these arguments in turn.\n\n            1.   Preservation of Carpenter's Objection\n\n            The government argues that because Carpenter did not\n\ncontemporaneously     object    to    the    government's    use   of   gambling\n\nmetaphors during its closing arguments, the district court should\n\nhave reviewed the motion for a new trial based on those arguments\n\nfor plain error.5     Although the government pressed this same plain\n\nerror    argument   before   the     district   court,   the   court    did   not\n\nexpressly address the argument in its opinion ordering a new trial.\n\nNevertheless, as we shall explain, the court's opinion can only be\n\n\n     5\n       The parties agree that the court did not apply plain error\nreview.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fread as an implicit determination that Carpenter preserved his\n\nobjection to the closing arguments.\n\n           The government concedes that Carpenter moved in limine\n\nand made several trial objections to the introduction of testimony\n\nrelated to Carpenter's investment strategy and losses.            However,\n\nthe government argues that these objections were insufficiently\n\nspecific, and that they addressed only the admission of evidence\n\nand not the manner in which the government could argue from that\n\nevidence during its closing and rebuttal.\n\n           Historically, when a party's motion in limine to exclude\n\nevidence   had   been   denied,   the   party's   failure   to   renew   the\n\nobjection at trial was considered \"fatal.\"        E.g., United States v.\n\nVest, 842 F.2d 1319, 1325 (1st Cir. 1988).         However, Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 103(a) was amended in 2000 to read, in pertinent part:\n\n\"[o]nce the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting\n\nor excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not\n\nrenew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error\n\nfor appeal.\" The accompanying commentary explains that \"[w]hen the\n\nruling is definitive, a renewed objection or offer of proof at the\n\ntime the evidence is to be offered is more a formalism than a\n\nnecessity.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 103 advisory committee's note, 2000\n\nAmendment. In applying this rule, we must pay particular attention\n\nto the question whether the trial court made \"definitive\" rulings\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fon the motion in limine.   Crowe v. Bolduc, 334 F.3d 124, 133-34\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Carpenter repeatedly objected to the introduction of\n\nevidence regarding his trading strategy and losses, arguing that it\n\nwas irrelevant and overly prejudicial because it distracted the\n\njury's attention from whether he intended to defraud Benistar's\n\nclients at the time their funds were solicited, and focused their\n\nattention instead on the sagacity of his investment strategy.\n\nIndeed, before the trial even began, Carpenter moved in limine to\n\npreclude the testimony of the Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber brokers\n\nbased on irrelevance and undue prejudice.     He also argued that,\n\nbecause they had not been identified as expert witnesses, the\n\nbrokers should not be allowed to give any evaluative opinions about\n\nhis trading strategy.\n\n          The   court   found   Carpenter's   arguments   somewhat\n\npersuasive, ruling on the motion in limine that the \"jury may take\n\naccount of what kind of trading was done in evaluating whether\n\nthere was a culpable state of mind. . . . but evaluative opinions\n\nabout the nature of the trading from people who have not been\n\nidentified as [expert] witnesses will not be permitted.\"        In\n\naddition, the court stated that \"it would be appropriate to caution\n\nthe jury in [its] instructions to stay on the elements of the\n\noffenses that are charged and not imagine other wrongs.\" The court\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fadded: \"[w]hen we've seen all the evidence, we'll have a clearer\n\nidea of what to do on that subject.\"\n\n             Despite the court's preliminary ruling on his objection\n\nto the brokers' testimony, Carpenter continued to object to that\n\ntestimony    to    assure    the     preservation         of    his    objection.          For\n\ninstance,    at    the    end   of   the    first        day    of    broker    testimony,\n\nCarpenter's counsel stated: \"I just want to preserve my objection\n\nbecause I don't know if I preserved [it] adequately in terms of all\n\nthe testimony that came in . . . .                  [I]t's the same issue, but I\n\ndidn't want to stand up every time.\"                The court responded: \"I think\n\nyour objection is preserved.\"\n\n             At    the    conclusion       of      the    Merrill       Lynch       brokers'\n\ntestimony, Carpenter filed a motion for mistrial, arguing that he\n\nhad been \"irretrievably prejudiced in front of the jury by the\n\n[testimony    of    the]     Merrill       Lynch    witnesses          that    he    was   an\n\naggressive speculator[,] river boat gambler.\"                          The court denied\n\nCarpenter's motion for a mistrial, explaining: \"I adhere to the\n\nruling that permitted the admission of the evidence in advance.                              I\n\nunderstand the point.              We'll deal with it at some additional\n\noccasions.\"        When     Carpenter's         counsel        asked   for     a    \"running\n\nobjection in line with the motion [for a mistrial]. . . . So I\n\ndon't have to stand up,\" the court responded: \"You're covered under\n\nRule 103.\"    The recognition of a continuing objection could not be\n\nclearer.\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f              After Carpenter received that assurance, the government\n\npresented two expert witnesses who testified regarding Carpenter's\n\ninvestment strategy. In a motion in limine seeking to preclude the\n\ntestimony of the second expert, Marc Allaire, Carpenter argued:\n\n\"the jury has already heard sufficient evidence regarding the\n\nrudiments of options investments . . . .           Any further testimony by\n\nAllaire on this issue would simply be cumulative, unhelpful and a\n\nwaste of time.\"      Although the court rejected the motion in a ruling\n\nfrom the bench, it reiterated its concern for\n\n              making sure that the jury at the appropriate\n              time is focused on the elements of the offense\n              and what needs to be proved. And I agree that\n              to some degree this is all relevant as to\n              state of mind, but I'm concerned that the more\n              the wisdom of the trading strategy gets\n              debated, the more the jury will think that has\n              greater significance than maybe it does in\n              their deliberations. . . . I want to keep this\n              focused on whether there was an intent to\n              deceive or specific intent to defraud.\n\nCarpenter's counsel persisted, stating: \"I'm not going to belabor\n\nthe point, your Honor . . . .            I would just preserve the issue.\"\n\nThe   court    responded:    \"Okay.       All    right.\"     After   Allaire's\n\ntestimony,     the   court   heard   a   final   day   of   testimony   focused\n\nprimarily on establishing the authenticity of the actual mail and\n\nwire transfers of funds from Benistar's clients into the Benistar\n\naccount.      The parties then presented their closing arguments the\n\nnext day.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f           Thus, the trial court devoted considerable attention to\n\nthe contested evidence throughout the trial, fielding repeated\n\nobjections and stressing its concern that the government limit its\n\nuse of the evidence to illuminating Carpenter's intent.   Placed in\n\nthis context, we find unpersuasive the government's attempt to\n\ndistinguish between the introduction of the evidence covered by\n\nCarpenter's objections at trial and the prosecution's arguments\n\nfrom that evidence, to which Carpenter did not specifically object\n\nbefore jury deliberations. We look in vain for any indication that\n\nthe government drew this distinction in its written submission to\n\nthe district court in opposition to Carpenter's motion for a new\n\ntrial.   More importantly, even if this distinction was discernible\n\nin the government's opposition, the district court was entitled to\n\nreject it and conclude that Carpenter's continuing objections to\n\nthe admission of evidence about his investment strategy and losses\n\napplied as well to the government's closing arguments based upon\n\nthat evidence.6   Hence we reject the government's argument that the\n\n\n     6\n       The dissent argues that we should not infer that the court\nruled that defendant preserved his objection to the government's\nuse of gambling metaphors in its closing arguments and that the\nplain error standard did not apply to the request for a new trial\nbased on the closing arguments. However, the government explicitly\nargued for plain error review in its written opposition to\nCarpenter's motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial. The\ncourt issued a lengthy published decision on these motions,\naddressing each of Carpenter's arguments in detail, including the\nargument that the court entitled in its decision \"Prejudicial\nInflammatory Argument\" (a reference to the gambling metaphors). In\nexplaining its decision to grant a new trial because of this\ninflammatory argument, the court explained its decision in harmless\n\n                                -14-\n\fdistrict court erred in failing to apply plain error review to the\n\ngovernment's new trial motion.\n\n           The dissent disagrees with this conclusion, asserting\n\nthat the district court had to apply the plain error standard to\n\nthe defendant's motion for a new trial because Carpenter failed to\n\npreserve   his   objection   to   the    government's    use     of    gambling\n\nmetaphors in its closing arguments.         This assertion reflects the\n\ndissent's unstated premise that appellate review of the trial\n\ncourt's preservation determination is de novo.            That is not the\n\nlaw.   Instead,    the   appellate      court   should   defer    to    such   a\n\npreservation ruling by the district court.               The preservation\n\n\nerror terms: \"Because it cannot be said with confidence that the\ngovernment's improper closing arguments did not taint the verdict,\nthe verdict cannot be allowed to stand.\"      This language echoes\nother decisions on new trial motions that have evaluated whether\nthe interest of justice requires a new trial under the harmless\nerror standard. See, e.g., United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 38\n(1st Cir. 2005) (assessing whether trial error affected the trial's\noutcome); United States v. Hodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d 607, 610 (1st\nCir. 1991) (same); United States v. Capone, 683 F.2d 582, 585-86\n(1st Cir. 1982) (same).     Given the thoroughness of the court's\ndecision, including its explanation of the reasons for granting a\nnew trial, we can only conclude that the court did not apply plain\nerror review because it consciously rejected the government's plain\nerror argument. Moreover, even if the district court had satisfied\nthe dissent's insistence on an explicit ruling rejecting the plain\nerror standard, the dissent would still deem that ruling a legal\nerror. The dissent's central concern is not the adequacy of the\ncourt's explanation of its decision to apply the harmless error\nstandard.   Instead, the dissent argues that the district court\ncould not apply the harmless error standard because, as a matter of\nlaw, the defendant did not preserve his objection to the\ngovernment's use of gambling metaphors in its closing arguments.\nAs we explain more fully, that argument misperceives the standard\nof review that an appellate court should apply to a trial court's\npreservation ruling.\n\n                                   -15-\n\frequirement has two components: alerting a trial judge to a party's\n\nobjection   to   a   ruling   or   to   the   admission   of   evidence   and\n\nadequately explaining the basis for that objection.            See Estate of\n\nKeatinge v. Biddle, 316 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir. 2002).            Thus advised,\n\nthe trial judge can decide what course of action to take to assure,\n\nso far as possible, the legal correctness of the trial proceedings.\n\nId.   Faced with post-trial arguments debating whether an objection\n\nto evidence or arguments was adequately preserved, it is certainly\n\nthe trial judge who is in the best position to decide if she\n\nsufficiently understood that an objection had been made and the\n\ngrounds for it.      Given that reality, the appellate court should\n\ndefer to the trial court's preservation ruling.7                The dissent\n\nrejects such deference in favor of a de novo standard of review\n\nwhich fails to account for the trial court's superior position to\n\ndetermine whether it has been properly apprised of an objection.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       We routinely defer to the trial court when it is better\npositioned to assess the relevant factors for making particular\nkinds of decisions. See, e.g., Castro v. Chicago Hous. Auth., 360\nF.3d 721, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (deferring to trial court's\nevaluation of party's motion practice); United States v. Capelton,\n350 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir. 2003) (applying abuse of discretion\nstandard to trial court's ruling on a motion for mistrial); Ferrara\n& Dimercurio v. St. Paul Mercury, 240 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(deferring to trial court's determination whether misconduct\noccurred and whether it required judicial sanction); United States\nv. Dumas, 207 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2000) (deferring to trial\ncourt's assessment of witness credibility); United States v.\nGonzales-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 1997) (deferring to\ntrial court's determination of evidence's relevance).\n\n                                    -16-\n\f           In addition, contrary to the suggestion of the dissent,\n\nthere is no rule that preserved objections to the admission of\n\nevidence cannot also cover closing arguments based upon that\n\ntestimony.    Here, in evaluating defendant's demand for a new trial\n\non the basis of gambling metaphors in the government's closing\n\narguments, the district court could reasonably conclude that the\n\ndefendant's    strenuous      objections       to    the    evidence       on    trading\n\nstrategy     and    losses    embraced      the      gambling         metaphors     that\n\ncharacterized that evidence in such provocative terms in the\n\ngovernment's closing arguments.\n\n           The dissent cites unfairness to the government in the\n\ndistrict court's new trial ruling.                   Specifically, the dissent\n\nspeculates that \"had there been a cognizable objection here, the\n\ngovernment would likely not have to retry the case, and the\n\nconsiderable       burdens   of   a    retrial      would       not   be   placed   upon\n\nwitnesses and alleged victims.\"           Once again the dissent refuses to\n\nacknowledge    the     superior       position    of      the    district    court   to\n\ndetermine,    from    its    vantage,     that      the    defendant       had   already\n\nregistered a cognizable objection to the government's use of\n\ngambling metaphors through its repeated objections to the evidence\n\nunderlying those metaphors.\n\n           However, there was always the risk for the government\n\nthat the court, in the context of a post-trial motion for a new\n\ntrial, would reconsider the appropriateness of its handling of the\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fevidence and arguments on trading strategy and financial losses.\n\nThat risk emphasizes why there is no unfairness to the government\n\nin the court's decision to award a new trial.           As we have already\n\nnoted, after one of its rulings admitting evidence on trading\n\nstrategy and losses, the court stated that \"it would be appropriate\n\nto caution the jury in [its] instructions to stay on the elements\n\nof the offenses that are charged and not imagine other wrongs.\"\n\nThe court expressed similar concerns on other occasions about the\n\npotential for the unfairly prejudicial impact of this evidence on\n\nthe jury.   Yet, as we explain more fully in the next section of the\n\nopinion, the government ignored the court's concerns about the\n\nlimited relevance of the trading strategy and financial losses\n\nevidence.   Instead of engaging in a straightforward explanation of\n\nthe relevance of that evidence to the defendant's criminal intent,\n\nthe government used provocative gambling metaphors to characterize\n\nthat   evidence.       This   calculated     decision   by   the   government\n\nincreased the risk that the court, in evaluating a post-trial\n\nmotion for a new trial, would conclude that this provocative\n\ntreatment of the potentially unfairly prejudicial evidence made\n\nthis prejudice real and required a new trial in the interest of\n\njustice.\n\n            The government cannot claim surprise in such a ruling.\n\nWhen   it   resorted    to    the   gambling   metaphors     in   its   closing\n\narguments, the government made its own gamble that the court,\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fdespite its uneasiness about the potential prejudicial impact of\n\nthe evidence of trading strategy and financial losses on the jury,\n\nwould not conclude, in evaluating the inevitable motion for a new\n\ntrial, that the government had gone too far with its arguments.\n\nThere is no unfairness to the government if it has now lost that\n\ngamble.\n\n          2.   Propriety of Gambling Metaphors in Closing\n\n          We must now decide if the district court was correct in\n\nruling that the government had gone too far with the many gambling\n\nreferences during its closing arguments.    Although we employ the\n\ndeferential abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the district\n\ncourt's ultimate determination that the prosecution's inflammatory\n\nstatements warrant a new trial, we must review de novo the prior\n\nquestion of whether the comments themselves were improper.   United\n\nStates v. Hernandez, 218 F.3d 58, 68 (1st Cir. 2000) (reviewing de\n\nnovo whether prosecutor's statements during closing arguments were\n\nimproper because they relied on evidence related to activities\n\noutside the scope of the alleged conspiracy to prove a criminal\n\nassociation); United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1337-38 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (applying de novo review to determine the propriety of\n\nprosecutor's comments during closing arguments that the defense had\n\nfailed to produce evidence regarding an alleged \"frame up\"); United\n\nStates v. Glantz, 810 F.2d 316, 320-21 & n.2 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(acknowledging that a de novo standard of review applies to the\n\n\n                               -19-\n\flegal question of whether the prosecutor's arguments were proper,\n\nbut determining that the court need not decide propriety where it\n\nfinds that the grant of a new trial on the basis of such arguments\n\nwas an abuse of discretion even if the arguments were improper).\n\n            The   district   court   acknowledged   that   the   \"gambling\n\ncharacterizations were not, as a matter of the narrative of the\n\ngovernment's case, wholly inapt,\" 405 F. Supp. 2d at 101. However,\n\nit found that the \"repeated references to gambling were intended\n\nto, and did, inflame the jury's passions against the defendant,\"\n\nid.   We agree.\n\n            In assessing whether the use of particular language is\n\nimproper, we look beyond the technical accuracy of a phrase and\n\nconsider such factors as the \"threat of unfair prejudice, frequency\n\nof use, and alternative means of description.\"         United States v.\n\nFelton, 417 F.3d 97, 103 (1st Cir. 2005).       The prosecution's use of\n\ngambling language was extensive.            The district court counted\n\neighteen instances in which the government used some permutation of\n\nthe word \"gamble,\" along with numerous references to other gambling\n\nterms.     405 F. Supp. 2d at 101.          The government referred to\n\ngambling in its morally freighted gaming sense, with provocative\n\nreferences to \"cashing in chips,\" \"doubling down\" and \"river boat\n\ngambler.\"    In a particularly dramatic example, the prosecution\n\nintoned:\n\n            Any   reasonable  person   with   or   without\n            investment experience and knowledge would have\n\n                                     -20-\n\f            said it's time to cash in my chips and go\n            home.    Not Dan Carpenter.     He kept on\n            playing. . . . The self-professed river boat\n            gambler pushes on until the losses mount and\n            mount and mount.\n\nFinally, we are most concerned that the government would use such\n\nprovocative language in the face of the court's repeated caution\n\nthat the evidence upon which the gambling terminology was based\n\nshould    not   be   used   to    distract      the    jury   from    its   focus      on\n\nCarpenter's state of mind when he obtained his clients' funds.                         We\n\ncannot ignore this important context in evaluating the choices the\n\nprosecution     made   when      it   crafted    its    closing      arguments.\n\n            While we agree that \"a criminal defendant is not entitled\n\n'to   a   prosecutorial       summing-up        confined      to    platitudes      and\n\neuphemisms,'\" United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 159\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (quoting Palmariello v. Sup't of MCI Norfolk, 873\n\nF.2d 491, 494 (1st Cir. 1989)), we must also ensure that \"while a\n\nprosecutor 'may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike\n\nfoul ones,'\"     United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (quoting Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935)).\n\nBecause   the   government        repeatedly     referred      to    gambling     in    a\n\npejorative sense in its closing arguments, despite the district\n\ncourt's explicit warning against distracting the jurors from the\n\nelements of the crimes charged, we agree with the district court\n\nthat the prosecutor's gambling arguments were improper.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\f          3.   Grant of a New Trial\n\n          Before granting a new trial based on a prosecutor's\n\nimproper comments in a closing argument, a court must \"determin[e]\n\n'whether [those comments] ha[ve] so poisoned the well that a new\n\ntrial is required,'\" United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 387, 398\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).   In so doing, the court considers such factors as:\n\n(1) the extent of the improper remarks, (2) the context, (3) the\n\nlikely effect of any curative instructions given by the judge, and\n\n(4) the weight of the evidence against the defendant.   Id. (citing\n\nUnited States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 38 (1st Cir. 2005)).   However,\n\nthese factors are not exhaustive; they are meant merely to guide\n\nthe court's inquiry into whether the prosecutor's improper comments\n\nhave undermined the fairness of the trial.\n\n          In assessing the extent to which the improper arguments\n\naffected the outcome of the trial, the district court focused on\n\nthe frequency with which the gambling references were made, their\n\n\"persistently pejorative\" nature and their \"tendency to lead the\n\njury away from the charges in the indictment by inviting them to\n\nblame Carpenter because he was a gambler, or because he lost the\n\nexchangors' money, rather than because he had committed mail or\n\nwire fraud.\"   405 F. Supp. 2d at 102.\n\n          The court also emphasized the context in which those\n\ncomments were made, noting that it had admitted the evidence from\n\nwhich these gambling metaphors were drawn for a \"limited purpose,\"\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fand observing that \"this evidence was introduced in the latter\n\nstages of the government's case, close in time to the closing\n\narguments.      As the arguments were made, this evidence likely\n\nremained vivid in the jurors' memories.\"         Id.   Placed in this\n\ncontext, the court concluded: \"Condemning Carpenter for 'gambling,'\n\nas the prosecutors persisted in doing, was an appeal to instincts\n\nof moral disapprobation about recklessness, waste, and perhaps even\n\ntheft.\"   Id.\n\n            After    highlighting     the   improper   nature   of the\n\ngovernment's arguments, the court related those arguments to the\n\noverall strength of the government's case:\n\n            though sufficient to withstand a motion for\n            judgment of acquittal, the case was not so\n            strong that it can confidently be said that\n            the repeated 'gambling' references had no\n            illegitimate effect on the jury's assessment\n            of the evidence.    On what was perhaps the\n            crucial issue, the jury would certainly have\n            been   warranted  in   concluding  beyond  a\n            reasonable doubt that Carpenter acted with\n            intent to defraud, but a contrary conclusion\n            also would have been rationally possible on\n            the evidence.\n\nId. at 103.     The court concluded: \"Because it cannot be said with\n\nconfidence that the government's improper closing arguments did not\n\ntaint the verdict, the verdict cannot be allowed to stand.\"       Id.\n\n            We afford the district court substantial deference in\n\nsuch an assessment, reflecting the trial judge's familiarity with\n\nthe case.       The \"trial judge 'has listened to the tone of the\n\nargument as it was delivered and has observed the apparent reaction\n\n                                    -23-\n\fof the jurors.      In short, he is far more \"conversant with the\n\nfactors relevant to the determination\" than any reviewing court can\n\npossibly be.'\"      Glantz, 810 F.2d at 320 n.2 (quoting Arizona v.\n\nWashington, 434 U.S. 497, 514 (1978)).            We find no basis for\n\nconcluding   that   the   district    court   abused   its   discretion   in\n\nordering a new trial.8\n\nB.   The Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n\n           In his cross-appeal, Carpenter contends that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because\n\nthe government failed to present sufficient evidence on the mail\n\nand wire fraud charges to permit a reasonable jury to convict him.\n\nBefore we may reach the merits of Carpenter's cross-appeal, we face\n\nthe threshold question of our jurisdiction.        Carpenter urges us to\n\nassert jurisdiction over his cross-appeal under the so-called\n\n\"collateral order\" doctrine, in order to protect his right to be\n\nfree from double jeopardy and as a matter of judicial economy.\n\n           Although 28 U.S.C. § 1291 specifies that our jurisdiction\n\nextends only to appeals from \"final decisions of the district\n\ncourts,\" the Supreme Court, in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan\n\nCorp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949), identified a \"small class . . .\n\n[of] claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights\n\nasserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too\n\n\n     8\n      Our agreement with the district court's grant of a new trial\nbecause of gambling metaphors obviates any need to address the\nalternative bases Carpenter asserted in his motion for a new trial.\n\n                                     -24-\n\findependent    of    the    cause     itself    to    require     that    appellate\n\nconsideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\"\n\n            The Court has since held that \"a pretrial order denying\n\na motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds . . .\n\nfall[s] within [this] 'small class of cases.'\"                    Abney v. United\n\nStates, 431 U.S. 651, 659 (1977).         There, the Court relied upon the\n\nfinality of the district court's action – there being \"no further\n\nsteps that can be taken in the District Court to avoid the trial\n\nthe   defendant     maintains    is    barred    by    the   Fifth       Amendment's\n\nguarantee,\" id. – and the fact that the \"elements of [his double\n\njeopardy]   claim     are   completely        independent    of    his     guilt   or\n\ninnocence,\" id. at 660.         The court also emphasized that \"even if\n\nthe accused is acquitted, or, if convicted, has his conviction\n\nultimately reversed on double jeopardy grounds, he has still been\n\nforced to endure a trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was\n\ndesigned to prohibit.\"       Id. at 662.\n\n            Carpenter argues that the refusal to consider his cross-\n\nappeal would force him \"to endure the personal strain, public\n\nembarrassment, and expense of a [second] criminal trial,\" which\n\nAbney sought to avoid.       Id. at 661.       With this language, Carpenter\n\ninvokes the principle of double jeopardy.                 See Green v. United\n\nStates, 355 U.S. 184, 187-88 (1957) (\"[T]he State with all its\n\nresources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts\n\nto convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fhim to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live\n\nin a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as\n\nenhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found\n\nguilty.\").     In addition, he claims that our refusal to hear a\n\nsufficiency claim in these circumstances would burden defendants\n\nwith a \"Hobson's choice\" between: (1) waiving the right to move for\n\na new trial in order to ensure appellate review of a sufficiency\n\nclaim; and (2) moving for a new trial and losing the right to\n\nappeal a sufficiency claim arising from the first trial. Carpenter\n\nfurther argues that considerations of judicial economy support our\n\nreview because we must review the trial record in any event to\n\nassess the government's appeal of the new trial ruling.\n\n           While Carpenter's assertions have practical appeal, they\n\nrun afoul of most of the relevant precedent.             As we have recognized\n\nelsewhere,     Abney    \"is     not   carte   blanche     authority     for   all\n\ninterlocutory appeals brought under the Double Jeopardy banner,\n\nsince   some   such    claims    do   not   meet   the   requirements    of   the\n\n'collateral order' doctrine.\"          United States v. Ramirez-Burgos, 44\n\nF.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir. 1995).          In order to qualify for review under\n\nthe collateral order doctrine, the collateral issue must:\n\n           (1) [be] so conceptually distinct from other\n           issues being litigated in the underlying\n           action that an immediate appeal would neither\n           disrupt the main action, nor threaten to\n           deprive the appellate court of useful context\n           which might be derived from subsequent\n           developments in the litigation; (2) completely\n           and conclusively resolve the collateral issue;\n\n                                       -26-\n\f          (3) infringe rights which appellant could not\n          effectively vindicate in an appeal after final\n          judgment in the case; and (4) involve an\n          important or unsettled legal issue, rather\n          than merely challenge discretionary trial\n          court rulings.\n\nUnited States v. Kouri-Perez, 187 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).    We\n\nhave emphasized that \"all four of [these] criteria must be met for\n\nthere to be jurisdiction under this exception to § 1291 finality.\"\n\nIn re Licht & Semonoff, 796 F.2d 564, 571 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n          In Richardson v. United States, 468 U.S. 317, 325 (1984),\n\nthe Supreme Court reasoned that \"the protection of the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause . . . applies only if there has been some event,\n\nsuch as an acquittal, which terminates the original jeopardy.\"\n\nGuided by this principle, the Court went on to determine that a\n\nmistrial was not a jeopardy-terminating event and thus a second\n\ntrial was not barred even if there had been insufficient evidence\n\nto convict at the first trial.    Id. at 326.\n\n          We extended this logic to the vacatur of a conviction on\n\nappeal for legal error in United States v. Porter, 807 F.2d 21, 24\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1986), stating: \"where the first conviction was\n\nvacated for legal error, not insufficiency of evidence, the concept\n\nof continuing jeopardy rules out a double jeopardy claim based on\n\npurported insufficiency of evidence at the first trial.\"   Thus, a\n\ndefendant who succeeds on appeal in demonstrating that he is\n\nentitled to a new trial because of error at his first trial may not\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fassert a double jeopardy bar to retrial.       As his original jeopardy\n\nhas not yet ended, there is no double jeopardy to avoid.\n\n          It is a short step from Porter to the case before us,\n\nwhere the trial court itself ordered a new trial on the basis of\n\nlegal error.    Porter teaches that a defendant has no double\n\njeopardy claim when his conviction has been vacated for legal\n\nerror.   Id.   at   24.   That   is   what   occurred   here.   Although\n\nCarpenter's conviction was undone by the trial court rather than on\n\nappeal, this is a distinction without a difference.\n\n          Without a viable double jeopardy claim, Carpenter has no\n\ndouble jeopardy \"right\" that he cannot effectively vindicate if he\n\nis not permitted to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in\n\nthis appeal.    Hence he cannot meet the third criterion of the\n\ncollateral order doctrine.9      The Second and Seventh Circuits have\n\n\n     9\n       It is important to understand that Carpenter, in pursuing\nhis cross-appeal, has invoked the principle of double jeopardy in\nthe service of his primary argument that we should review the\nsufficiency of the evidence argument he makes in his cross-appeal.\nThat is, Carpenter did not file a motion in the trial court arguing\nthat his retrial was barred by the principle of double jeopardy.\nIndeed, there was no basis for any such argument. Hence, we are\nnot reviewing a double jeopardy ruling by the trial court, or a\nclaim that such a double jeopardy ruling itself falls within the\ncollateral order doctrine. Instead, Carpenter uses double jeopardy\nprinciples to address the third element of the collateral order\ndoctrine – namely, that the failure to address the collateral issue\non appeal (here, sufficiency of the evidence) will infringe rights\nwhich appellant could not effectively vindicate in an appeal after\nfinal judgment in the case. Carpenter argues that, if the trial\njudge ruled incorrectly on his motion for judgment of acquittal,\nand if we failed to assess that possibility by hearing his cross-\nappeal, his retrial would infringe his double jeopardy right.\nHowever, as we have now shown, Carpenter misconstrues the nature of\n\n                                  -28-\n\fsimilarly found no jurisdiction to hear cross-appeals of a denial\n\nof a motion for judgment of acquittal under the collateral order\n\ndoctrine where the district court's order of a new trial vacated\n\nthe underlying conviction.    United States v. Eberhart, 388 F.3d\n\n1043, 1051 (7th Cir. 2004), rev'd on other grounds, 546 U.S. 12\n\n(2005); United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d 129, 138 (2d Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           Carpenter claims support for his cross-appeal in three\n\ndecisions from other circuits: United States v. Greene, 834 F.2d 86\n\n(4th Cir. 1987); United States v. Wood, 958 F.2d 963 (10th Cir.\n\n1992); and United States v. Gotti, 451 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\nOnly Greene supports his position, and we decline to follow it.\n\n           In Greene, after the trial court ordered a new trial and\n\ndenied Greene's motion for acquittal, the government appealed the\n\nnew trial grant.   Greene cross-appealed, arguing that the district\n\ncourt erred when it rejected his claim that the evidence was not\n\nsufficient to convict him and that to require another trial would\n\nviolate his right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same\n\noffense.   Greene, 834 F.2d at 87.     While acknowledging that the\n\n\"denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal prior to entry of a\n\njudgment or sentence [is] normally not reviewable in the Court of\n\n\n\n\nhis double jeopardy right, and hence he cannot meet the third\ncriterion of the collateral order doctrine.\n\n                                -29-\n\fAppeals,\" the court determined that it \"would be unfair to apply\n\nsuch a rule in the present proceedings.\"          Id. at 89.\n\n            Neither Wood nor Gotti reaches such a result.            In Wood,\n\nthe trial court ordered a new trial and denied Wood's motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal.       The government appealed the grant of a new\n\ntrial,    and   Wood    cross-appealed   the   denial   of   his   motion   for\n\nacquittal contending that double jeopardy barred his retrial.\n\nWood, 958 F.2d at 965.       Wood's double jeopardy claim was also based\n\non the insufficiency of the evidence at his trial.           Id. at 967.     On\n\nthe government's motion to dismiss the cross-appeal for lack of\n\njurisdiction, the Tenth Circuit denied the motion and asserted\n\njurisdiction over Wood's cross-appeal because it found a \"colorable\n\ndouble jeopardy claim\" giving rise to jurisdiction under the\n\ncollateral order doctrine, United States v. Wood, 950 F.2d 638, 643\n\n(10th Cir. 1991).        However, in its subsequent ruling, it affirmed\n\nthe new trial grant and ultimately ruled that the double jeopardy\n\nclaim lacked merit for many of the same reasons that we cite here,\n\ngiven that the district court had granted defendant's motion for a\n\nnew trial, Wood        958 F.2d at 970-71.10   Notably, the court further\n\nconcluded that its \"resolution of the merits of Defendant's claims\n\nmakes future double jeopardy claims like Defendant's non-colorable\n\n\n     10\n       For example, the court emphasized that Wood could not be at\nrisk of double jeopardy where his original jeopardy had not yet\nended. 958 F.2d 963 at 970 (explaining that \"[a] guilty verdict by\na jury which is set aside by the district court on a motion by the\ndefendant does not terminate jeopardy.\").\n\n                                     -30-\n\fand, therefore, subject to summary dismissal when asserted on an\n\ninterlocutory appeal.\"       Id. at 972 n.12.\n\n           In Gotti, there was no motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nbased on insufficiency of the evidence in his first trial. Indeed,\n\nthe jury had not convicted Gotti on any of the charges against him.\n\nGotti, 451 F.3d at 135.       Instead, it acquitted him on one charge\n\nand divided on others, resulting in the declaration of a mistrial\n\non those charges.     Id.     The district court then denied Gotti's\n\npost-trial motion to bar a retrial on two of the counts on double\n\njeopardy grounds.    Id. at 135-36.       Gotti then sought interlocutory\n\nreview of that double jeopardy ruling itself.           Id. at 136.      There\n\nwas no appeal by the government of any trial court ruling and no\n\ncross-appeal by Gotti trying to challenge a trial court ruling on\n\na motion for judgment of acquittal.           Citing Abney, the Court of\n\nAppeals analogized the trial court's double jeopardy ruling to a\n\ncourt's denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss counts of an\n\nindictment on double jeopardy grounds and concluded that this\n\nruling met the requirements of the collateral order doctrine.              Id.\n\nIn addressing the merits of Gotti's double jeopardy argument, it\n\nrejected   that   argument    on   very    different   grounds   than    those\n\nCarpenter raises in asking us to hear his cross-appeal.11               Id. at\n\n\n     11\n        Gotti argued that because the jury could not unanimously\nagree that the government had proved two predicate racketeering\nacts with which he was charged, he was entitled to acquittal on the\nRICO charges against him and could not be retried on any of the\ncharges.   The court rejected Gotti's \"extraordinary argument,\"\n\n                                    -31-\n\f136-37.   Moreover, as noted, the \"merits\" issue on appeal in Gotti\n\nwas the trial court's double jeopardy ruling itself.            Here the\n\n\"merits\" issue in the cross-appeal is the trial court's ruling on\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence.       Gotti has scant relevance to our\n\napplication of the collateral order doctrine to that sufficiency\n\nruling.\n\n            To the extent that Carpenter makes a judicial efficiency\n\nargument that is independent of the collateral order doctrine, we\n\nreject that argument as well.          Carpenter's primary efficiency\n\nargument – that granting appellate jurisdiction over the cross-\n\nappeal makes \"practical sense\" because \"given the government's\n\nappeal, the Court will now conduct a thorough review of the trial\n\nrecord in this case\" – is beside the point.        We are not at liberty\n\nto go beyond the established criteria of the collateral order\n\ndoctrine to create new exceptions to the finality requirements of\n\n§ 1291.   Indeed, Carpenter's argument that we should consider his\n\nsufficiency claim as we consider the government's appeal runs\n\ndirectly counter to the first criterion of the collateral order\n\ndoctrine,    which   requires   that     the   collateral   issue   (here,\n\nsufficiency) be \"conceptually distinct\" from the issues in the\n\nunderlying action.      Kouri-Perez, 187 F.3d at 5.           Of course,\n\n\n\nnoting that \"[o]n this reasoning, juror disagreement as to the\nproof of a predicate act could never result in a hung jury,\" and\nthat \"[t]he government is permitted to retry a defendant following\na mistrial resulting from a hung jury.\" 451 F.3d at 136-37.\n\n                                  -32-\n\fCarpenter's sufficiency arguments are deeply entwined with the\n\nmerits of the mail and wire fraud charges that constitute the\n\nunderlying action.\n\n             In     addition,     even   if     we    could   recognize    such   an\n\nefficiency exception, any efficiency gains promised by Carpenter\n\nare illusory because there is little comparability between the\n\nreview that we have had to conduct in our deferential review of the\n\nnew trial grant and the de novo review we would have to conduct to\n\nevaluate the sufficiency of the evidence.                     In his sufficiency\n\nchallenge,        Carpenter     raises   arguments       of   causation,    intent,\n\nconstructive amendment of the indictment, reliance upon a theory of\n\nliability based on omission, good faith as an absolute defense, and\n\nvenue.   We have not had to address any of those issues in order to\n\nevaluate the district court's new trial ruling.\n\n             Carpenter raises a second argument under the banner of\n\nefficiency.        If we deny appellate jurisdiction over his cross-\n\nappeal, he says, and reverse the district court's grant of a new\n\ntrial, we will have to conduct a second review of the trial record\n\nat a later point in time after Carpenter is sentenced and files a\n\ndirect appeal.       Thus, Carpenter contends, granting jurisdiction to\n\nhear   the   cross-appeal        at   this    point    will   \"conserve    judicial\n\nresources.\"        However, the subsequent direct review of the issues\n\nnow raised in the cross-appeal would not represent a \"second\n\nreview\" of the trial record because, as we have already noted, our\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\freview of the new trial ruling has not required us to review the\n\nportions of the record relevant to the issues raised in the cross-\n\nappeal.   More importantly, Carpenter's second efficiency argument\n\nbetrays his frontal challenge to the most basic precepts of the\n\nfinal judgment rule.      If we were to reverse the trial court's new\n\ntrial ruling, there would be no final judgment until Carpenter had\n\nbeen sentenced after a remand.          See Berman v. United States, 302\n\nU.S. 211, 212 (1937) (\"Final judgment in a criminal case means\n\nsentence.   The   sentence   is   the    judgment.\");   United   States   v.\n\nLeichter, 160 F.3d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1998).         We are not at liberty\n\nto disregard such well-established final judgment rules in pursuit\n\nof a false efficiency.\n\n                                   III.\n\n            For the reasons described above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of a new trial.     We dismiss the cross-appeal for lack\n\nof jurisdiction.\n\n            So Ordered.\n\n            - Concurring and Dissenting Opinions Follow -\n\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge, concurring.                    A trial judge may\n\ngrant a new trial only \"if the interest of justice so requires.\"\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 33(a).           The power is used sparingly.              But it may\n\nbe triggered by a myriad of circumstances.                     Rule 33 wisely does not\n\nattempt to characterize those circumstances so as to limit a trial\n\njudge's authority to rule on a timely motion for a new trial.\n\n              Here, the trial judge concluded that the jury may well\n\nhave   been    diverted    from       its   task    of    determining     whether     the\n\ngovernment     had    proven     beyond      a   reasonable       doubt   each   of   the\n\nelements of the charged offenses.                United States v. Carpenter, 405\n\nF. Supp. 2d 85, 102 (D. Mass. 2005).                     The judge found that the\n\ngovernment's case was not so strong that it could confidently be\n\nsaid that the repeated gambling references had no illegitimate\n\neffect on the verdict.          Id. at 103.        The court held that because it\n\nwas possible that the government's closing arguments tainted the\n\njury's verdict, the verdict could not be allowed to stand.                       In that\n\ncontext,      the    district    court      called       the    government's     closing\n\narguments \"improper.\"           Id.\n\n              The trial judge implicitly ruled that defendant had\n\nsufficiently preserved his objection to the gambling metaphor so\n\nthat he was not required to take the unusual step of interrupting\n\nthe government's closing argument.                   An appellate court is not\n\nentitled to second guess that conclusion, which was certainly not\n\nan abuse of discretion.          The trial judge recognized that there was\n\n\n                                            -35-\n\fa point at which the relevance of the large losses produced by\n\nrisky trading was outweighed by the danger of distracting the jury\n\nfrom focused consideration of the actual charges.            That grey zone\n\nwas never well defined throughout the trial, and its demarcation\n\npoints were not clarified before the closing arguments, despite the\n\ngranting of a continuing objection. Perhaps both sides should have\n\nsought clarification before the closing arguments.\n\n              In my view, the real issue is not whether one side acted\n\n\"improperly.\"     It is the potential effect of this situation on the\n\njury which matters.      The experienced trial judge, who sat through\n\nthe trial and the closing, concluded that the balance had tipped\n\ntoo far within that grey zone and that the interest of justice\n\nrequired a new trial.\n\n              Given that the trial judge lacked confidence that the\n\nverdict was based on proper considerations, and given the context\n\nin which the trial judge ruled, an appellate judge cannot say that\n\nthe   trial    judge's   conclusion    was   unreasonable.     Indeed,   the\n\ndecision to grant a new trial does not even approach being an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\f                   CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.       This appeal\n\ncenters around two issues:           (1) whether in ruling upon defendant's\n\nmotion for a new trial, the district court had to apply the plain\n\nerror standard in Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b)--a question turning on\n\nwhether defendant failed to lodge a timely objection within Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 51(b)12 sufficient to preserve the error for which the new\n\ntrial        was    granted,   namely,   the    government's   use   of   gambling\n\nmetaphors in its closing, which the court felt may have induced a\n\nverdict based on the jury's moral disapproval of gambling; and (2)\n\nwhether the U.S. Attorney's gambling rhetoric went so far as to\n\nexceed fair comment and, in the event plain error review was\n\nrequired, to meet that standard.\n\n                   In answer to (1), I believe the district court was\n\nrequired to apply the plain error standard in ruling on the new\n\ntrial motion.           As for issue (2), it would be premature for us to\n\npass judgment on whether the gambling rhetoric could be found to\n\namount to plain error, that question being one for the district\n\ncourt in the first instance.               I would vacate and remand while\n\n\n        12\n             Fed. R. Crim. P. 51(b) provides,\n\n     A party may preserve a claim of error by informing the\n     court--when the court ruling or order is made or sought--\n     of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the\n     party's objection to the court's action and the grounds\n     for that objection.     If a party does not have an\n     opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence\n     of an objection does not later prejudice that party. A\n     ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is\n     governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 103.\n\n                                         -37-\n\fretaining jurisdiction so as to be able to decide in the future--\n\nshould plain error be found below--whether that finding exceeds the\n\ndistrict court's considerable discretion in the matter.\n\n          1.   Adequacy of Objection\n\n          Judicial review is limited to \"the notably ungenerous\n\nplain error standard\" whenever \"a defendant defaults on [the]\n\nobligation [to protect his own interests] by failing to make a\n\ncontemporaneous    objection   to   questionable   comments   in   the\n\nprosecution's closing argument.\"    United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d\n\n967, 977 (1st Cir. 1995).   Nothing in the language of Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 51 and 52, or in binding precedent, suggests that some different\n\nrule applies where a district court, as here, (rather than a court\n\nof appeals) is asked, post-verdict, to grant a new trial based on\n\nan alleged inappropriate closing.\n\n          One of the principal purposes of the contemporaneous\n\nobjection requirement is to alert the district judge so that she or\n\nhe can take on-the-spot curative steps, by instructing the jury to\n\ndisregard the prejudicial rhetoric or in some other way minimizing\n\nthe harm, thus obviating the trouble and expense of a new trial.\n\nAs this court stated in Taylor, 54 F.3d at 972,\n\n     [C]alling a   looming error to the trial court's attention\n     affords an    opportunity to correct the problem before\n     irreparable   harm occurs. Then, too, the raise-or-waive\n     rule . . .     precludes a party from making a tactical\n\n\n\n\n                                -38-\n\f     decision to refrain from objecting, and subsequently,\n     should the case turn sour, assigning error . . . .13\n\nHere, there is simply no indication that the gambling metaphors\n\nused by the government in its closing, and the purported moral\n\ndisapproval they might engender in jurors, were concerns ever\n\ncontemporaneously called to the district court's attention, either\n\nduring the closing when those references were actually being made\n\nor, right after, before the case went to the jury, when the\n\ndistrict judge could still have taken steps to cure whatever\n\nprejudice the rhetorical metaphors may have caused in the minds of\n\nthe jurors.      The basis for the grant of a new trial was not the\n\nbrokers' testimony, to admission of which earlier, unsuccessful,\n\nobjections were lodged and on which earlier objections the majority\n\nnow relies in its opinion, but the colorful gambling metaphors\n\nemployed by the government in closing argument which were later\n\nsaid by the district court to have carried the risk of inflaming\n\nthe jurors' moral disapproval.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n          In a later civil case, this court has said,\n\n     We have made it transparently clear that the raise-or-\n     waive rule can neither be ignored nor brushed aside as a\n     \"pettifogging technicality or a trap for the indolent.\"\n     Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 627\n     (1st Cir. 1995).

Rovira, 373 F.3d 1, 4 (2004).\n\n                                  -39-\n\f            Had     defendant    contemporaneously        objected    to     this\n\nallegedly inflammatory rhetoric either during or after the closing,\n\nbefore the case went to the jury, the court could have instructed\n\nthe jury to disregard it and explained to the jurors why the\n\nanalogies   were     prejudicial    and   overblown,      thus   obviating    the\n\nextreme and costly remedy of a new trial.                Even had the defense\n\nattorney hesitated to interrupt the government's argument, there\n\nwas ample time afterwards to have lodged an objection and for the\n\ncourt to have taken corrective steps.                Indeed, following the\n\ncourt's closing jury instructions, when counsel were invited to\n\nsubmit their objections to the charge, defense counsel took that\n\nopportunity to protest certain parts of the government's closing\n\nbut never mentioned these supposedly outrageous misstatements. Nor\n\ndid the judge say anything to counsel or the jury about them during\n\nor after the closing, as one might have expected had the earlier\n\nevidentiary       objections    relied    on   by   my   colleagues   actually\n\nfunctioned so as to call to the judge's mind that the defense was\n\nnow objecting to the closing's gambling rhetoric14--or even that the\n\n\n     14\n      Judge Lipez states that the court's earlier response, \"You're\ncovered under Rule 103,\" to Carpenter's request for a running\nobjection to admission of the Merrill Lynch brokers' testimony\n(described by defense counsel as portraying Carpenter as \"an\naggressive speculator[,] river boat gambler\") was a clear\nrecognition by the court of a continuing objection that served\nlater as an adequate objection under Rule 51(b) to the government's\nrepeated rhetorical use, in its closing, of the gambling analogies.\nBut Rule 103 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is an evidentiary\nrule. See Rule 51(b) (\"A ruling or order that admits or excludes\nevidence is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 103\").\n\n                                     -40-\n\frhetoric violated the court's own earlier cautionary admonition\n\nagainst overemphasizing certain matters.            The court's silence on\n\nthe subject at the crucial moments strongly suggests that whatever\n\nthe earlier objections accomplished, they did not accomplish what\n\nRule 51(b) seeks--namely to alert the court contemporaneously, when\n\ncorrective action by the court still remains possible, that the\n\ndefense is then and there objecting to certain language being used\n\nin the government's oratory.\n\n             The purpose of Rule 51(b), in other words, is to put the\n\ncourt   on   actual,   not   just   constructive,    notice   that   a   party\n\nprotests a particular alleged defect--here, the closing gambling\n\nrhetoric--so that, inter alia, appropriate corrective action can be\n\ntaken immediately if warranted.        Rule 51(b) is not well served by\n\nresting the finding of an adequate objection upon an elaborate\n\nchain of appellate inferences going back to non-contemporaneous\n\nobjections made earlier for a different purpose.                Rule 51(b)\n\nrequires, and ordinarily receives, a practical interpretation,\n\n\n\n\nAppropriately, the objections in question all related to the\ncourt's admission in evidence of the brokers' testimony, which\nemphasized the risky nature of option trading but did not invoke\nrepetitive gambling metaphors nor raise the question of whether\nanalogizing defendant's conduct to gambling would captivate the\ndisapproval of jurors based on their moral disapproval of gambling.\nA new trial was not granted because the court decided it had erred\nin admitting the brokers' testimony but because of the inflammatory\nnature of the gambling figure used in the closing, with its\npeculiar tendency to invoke moral disapprobation.\n\n                                     -41-\n\fconsistent with its purpose to alert the court in a meaningful way\n\nso that it can act before too late.\n\n            It is overwhelmingly evident from the record that no one,\n\nprior to the verdict, got the message, including the judge, that\n\nthe defense was protesting the government's rhetorical gambling\n\nanalogies--analogies which the district court later said may have\n\nelicited the jurors' moral disapproval based upon their distaste\n\nfor gambling.    Without having been contemporaneously alerted by a\n\nRule 51(b) objection, the district court was obliged, when it ruled\n\non defendant's post-verdict motion for a new trial, to employ plain\n\nerror review under Rule 52(b). The government made this point when\n\narguing the motion,15 but the district court did not address it at\n\nall.    As my colleagues agree, it now seems the court, in granting\n\na new trial, used the ordinary review standard (although Carpenter\n\nargues otherwise in his appellate brief).\n\n            My colleagues contend we should leave it to the district\n\ncourt, in these circumstances, whether a sufficient objection was\n\nlodged to preserve the closing gambling metaphor issue.    Here, the\n\njudge, in passing on the defendants' new trial motion, made no\n\n\n       15\n      Judge Lipez, in the majority opinion, speaks of \"looking in\nvain\" for any indication that the government ever argued that\nobjection to the closing's gambling metaphors had not been\npreserved. In fact, the government noted (under the heading that\nits \"closing and rebuttal fell within the bounds of proper\nargument\") that most of Carpenter's points had not been preserved,\nand listed the few that had been, making clear its belief that the\ndefense's objection to the use of gambling metaphors was one that\nhad not been preserved and was subject to plain error review.\n\n                                 -42-\n\fexpress finding that an objection had been made, nor did he rule at\n\nall on the government's contention that an objection had not been\n\npreserved by the defense on the use of the gambling metaphors\n\nduring the closing.        But my colleagues would infer from the\n\ndistrict   court's    complete   silence   that    it     must   have   found   a\n\nsufficient defense objection, and they say they must defer to the\n\ndistrict court on that and all related matters.\n\n           My difficulty with the above is that it treats the raise-\n\nor-waive rule as if it were only of concern to the district court--\n\nto protect it, for instance, against being \"sandbagged\" in the\n\ncommon situation where a defendant appeals to this court from an\n\nadverse ruling of the trial judge concerning some matter never\n\ncalled to the court's attention below.            My colleagues' viewpoint\n\nwould   hold   that   where   the   district      judge    is    satisfied--as\n\npresumably he was here--with whatever steps defendant took, or did\n\nnot take, to preserve an objection, that should end the matter.\n\n           But I believe such deference is extreme.              The raise-or-\n\nwaive rule, it is true, exists to protect the trial judge, but it\n\nalso serves other important goals. As already discussed, it serves\n\nthe purpose of judicial economy, forcing all concerned, including\n\nthe court itself, to face issues--such as the challenged rhetoric\n\nused by the government here--at a time when corrective action can\n\nstill be taken short of a costly new trial.             The opportunity for\n\ncorrection afforded by a timely objection, as well as the penalty\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\fof plain error review for failure to object, also promote essential\n\nfairness to the other party, here the government--and not only to\n\nthe government alone, but to those who must bear the burdens of a\n\nnew trial, such as the victims of defendant's alleged misconduct\n\nand other witnesses.   Had there been a meaningful, contemporaneous\n\nobjection here, the government would likely not have to retry the\n\ncase, saving both monetary costs and the added burdens on many\n\nothers.\n\n          This is not to question the district court's discretion,\n\nwere there merely a question of disputed evidence over the making\n\nof a sufficient contemporaneous objection, to resolve that dispute.\n\nBut, here, the only arguably pertinent objections in the record--\n\nthose made earlier under Fed. R. Evid. 103 to the admission of\n\ncertain   testimony--fell   flagrantly   short   of     meeting   the\n\nrequirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 51(b) for valid objections to the\n\nclosing's gambling rhetoric.     And the record contains nothing\n\nexcept silence to suggest that the district court, when granting a\n\nnew trial, ever determined that an adequate objection--or any\n\nobjection--had been made.   Rules 51 and 52 are binding procedural\n\nrules to which courts must adhere.       The wide discretion very\n\nproperly given to the trial judge does not include the discretion\n\nto ignore or simply bypass the raise-or-waive rule.16\n\n\n     16\n      Of course, one might imagine special circumstances where a\ndefense objection might not be needed to preserve an issue. For\ninstance, the judge might, when the offending conduct occurs, give\n\n                                -44-\n\f           I would add that even the plain error standard of Rule\n\n52(b) still allows a court, in appropriate circumstances, when\n\nfaced with a strong sense that an injustice has or may have\n\noccurred, to allow a new trial even though a timely objection was\n\nnot lodged--and our review of such a decision would and should take\n\ninto account the trial judge's firsthand \"feel\" for a case tried in\n\nhis   presence.       Nevertheless,   plain   error   review   remains   a\n\nconsiderably tougher, higher, standard than ordinary review. Given\n\ndefendant's default, the government was entitled to the reassurance\n\nthat the latter standard was being applied in this case, since the\n\nquestion of whether or not the gambling rhetoric used went too far,\n\nand its likely unfair impact on jurors, is a close one as to which\n\nthe standard of review used could well have a decisive effect on\n\nwhether or not to grant a new trial.\n\n           2.     Whether Gambling Rhetoric Was Excessive\n\n\n\nvoice, sua sponte, on the record, to his own objection, which might\nin some circumstances relieve the defense of the need to object\nseparately. But it seems unwarranted to presume such a special\nexception here, given the judge's complete silence at and after the\nclosing, especially as, when the gambling rhetoric was later called\nto the judge's attention, he granted the extraordinary relief of a\nnew trial.   Surely, one would suppose, if the judge had at all\nconsidered the questionable character of the rhetoric at the time\nit was delivered, or then had believed the defense had objected to\nit at some earlier time, he would not have remained silent in the\nface of such knowledge, allowing events to proceed and the jury to\nremain uninstructed as to the improprieties that had occurred. To\ninfer on this record and in the face of judicial silence, the\npreserving of a sufficient objection, seems to me tantamount to\nsaying that Rule 51(b) and its companion, 52(b), need not be\nobserved by the trial judge unless he or she cares to do so.\n\n                                  -45-\n\f          As said, I believe that this appeal should be remanded to\n\nthe district court with instructions to reconsider its new trial\n\nruling under the correct plain error standard.   A ruling by us at\n\nthis juncture would be premature, since the district court's\n\njudgment based on its first-hand knowledge and feel is an essential\n\nprelude to whatever action this court takes.   We would necessarily\n\ngrant considerable deference to whatever view the district court\n\ntakes on whether what occurred at the trial met the high standard\n\nof plain error.   This does not mean there are no limits to our\n\ndeference, nor that appellate review will thereafter be forbidden.\n\nA district court would not have carte blanche discretion to order\n\na new trial simply because, to take a purely hypothetical example,\n\nit deemed the U.S. Attorney's closing remarks to be too eloquent\n\nand defense counsel's closing much less so--even if the trial court\n\nbelieved the difference had been decisive to the case's outcome.\n\nThere are, moreover, some arguments an attorney may make which will\n\nbe so entirely relevant as to be privileged as a matter of law,\n\njust as there are others which the district court may determine\n\ndispositively as going too far.\n\n          Here, the government argues that its gambling analogy was\n\nso apt that it fell within the safety zone and that, in any event,\n\nthe analogy was not so extreme as to amount to plain error.   This\n\nis not an easy issue, and it is one as to which the district\n\ncourt's ruling, along with its reasons, one way or another, will\n\n\n                               -46-\n\fnot only be helpful but essential.        I would, therefore, remand for\n\na new ruling on the new trial motion, one explicitly based on the\n\nplain error standard, which, in these circumstances, the district\n\ncourt was, in my view, legally obliged by the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure to apply.        It is most unlikely the district\n\ncourt   believed   it   was   applying    that   standard   when   it   ruled\n\npreviously, and, given especially the closeness of the grounds for\n\ngranting a new trial, I believe the government is entitled to a\n\nruling expressly based upon the correct legal standard.            Given the\n\nhigh hurdle of plain error review, a remand is no mere waste of\n\njudicial time.     To the contrary, it could be critical to the\n\noutcome, and it is also a necessary act              of fairness to the\n\ngovernment and those persons and interests the government serves,\n\ngiven the defendant's failure to have preserved a proper objection.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\f",

In a cross-appeal, Carpenter asserts that the district court erred in failing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal. We affirm the new trial ruling. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to hear Carpenter's cross-appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>A. Factual Background</p>\n<p>We briefly rehearse the relevant facts, which are largely undisputed. In October 1998, Daniel Carpenter and Martin Paley formed Benistar Property Exchange Trust Company, Inc. (\"Benistar\") for the purpose of performing property exchanges pursuant to section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1031. § 1031(a)(1) allows a seller of \"property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment\" to avoid capital gains on the sales proceeds if they are used to purchase a replacement property meeting the same criteria. In order to qualify, the seller must complete the exchange within 180 days of the original sale and must not take control of the proceeds in the interim, § 1031(a)(3). Accordingly, property owners typically entrust their sales proceeds to a qualified intermediary until they purchase replacement property; Benistar was created to play this role.</p>\n<p>Benistar's clients signed standard form agreements providing that property sale proceeds be transmitted by wire or check directly from the closing attorney into a Benistar account. Clients chose between a Merrill Lynch Ready Asset Money Market Account, yielding a 3% return on investment per annum (which allowed clients to access their funds upon 48 hours' notice), and a Merrill Lynch Investment Account, yielding 6% interest (which required 30 days' notice before funds could be accessed).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> According to the agreement between Paley and Carpenter, Paley marketed Benistar's services to clients while Carpenter maintained sole authority over the financial aspects of the business. Carpenter opened two accounts at Merrill Lynch in October 1998: the \"B01 account,\" into which client funds were deposited; and the \"B10 account,\" into which Carpenter transferred client funds which he then invested. When he opened the B10 account, Carpenter characterized his risk tolerance as \"aggressive\" and he informed Merrill Lynch that he intended to engage in options trading. As is their practice, Merrill Lynch counseled Carpenter on the riskiness of these investments and required him to sign a form acknowledging his understanding of those risks.</p>\n<p>From October 1998 until late September 2000, Carpenter transferred funds from the B01 account to the B10 account and traded extensively in stock options. While his trading strategy was successful at first,<sup>[1]</sup> Carpenter lost significant sums when the stock market began to decline in March 2000. As the market continued to decline thereafter, his Merrill Lynch brokers repeatedly counseled Carpenter to adopt a more conservative trading strategy. After Carpenter sustained roughly $4 million in losses, Merrill Lynch suspended his trading privileges.</p>\n<p>Carpenter then moved his trading activity to PaineWebber, where he again opened linked accounts: client funds were deposited by mail or wire into one account and he engaged in stock option trading from the other account. As had Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber counseled Carpenter on the risks inherent in options trading; Carpenter acknowledged these risks and continued his aggressive investment strategy. Carpenter continued to sustain heavy trading losses at PaineWebber and, despite his broker's urging that he adopt a more conservative investment strategy, Carpenter increased the size and riskiness of his trades as his fortunes declined. PaineWebber discontinued Carpenter's trading privileges in December 2000. Although Benistar had been losing client funds since March 2000, incoming funds had covered the losses. However, by January 2001, Benistar was forced to tell its clients that their money was gone. Benistar subsequently ceased operations, having lost roughly $9 million in client funds.</p>\n<p>B. Carpenter's Trial</p>\n<p>Carpenter was indicted in February 2004 by a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts on fourteen counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and five counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341. In particular, Carpenter was charged with having devised and implemented a scheme to defraud investors by representing that their money would be invested prudently in conformity with the property exchange requirements of the Internal Revenue Code while he intended to pursue an investment strategy at odds with such representations. Critically, clients transferred funds to Carpenter and Benistar by mail and wire in response to the investment scheme. Because both mail and wire fraud require an intent to defraud, the trial focused largely on Carpenter's state of mind when he obtained the funds of Benistar's clients through the representations made to them.</p>\n<p>In his defense, Carpenter portrayed his lack of interaction with clients and his lack of knowledge about Benistar's promotional materials. He contended that any assurances made to clients about the risks to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> their funds were made by Paley alone and without his knowledge.<sup>[2]</sup> In addition, Carpenter emphasized that the client agreements placed no restrictions on how funds would be managed in order to produce the 3% or 6% return selected by the clients. Carpenter argued that he never misled clients into believing their funds would be safe. Rather, he insisted that he acted with the good faith belief that he had unfettered discretion to invest client funds. He attributed Benistar's losses not to an unwise trading strategy but to a generalized stock market crash well beyond his control.</p>\n<p>The government focused on the incongruity between the nature of a § 1031 property exchange (a transaction structured to avoid capital gains while allowing investors to use the proceeds of one property sale to purchase a replacement property within a short period of time) and the aggressive nature of Carpenter's investment behavior. It contended that this incongruity demonstrated Carpenter's intent to mislead Benistar's clients into depositing their real estate proceeds with a supposedly safe intermediary so that he could leverage the funds into a substantial profit for himself through risky options trading. To prove this agenda, the prosecution sought to introduce extensive evidence regarding Carpenter's investment behavior, relying chiefly on testimony from his brokers at Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber.</p>\n<p>Carpenter's counsel objected to such evidence before its introduction and throughout the trial, arguing that testimony regarding Carpenter's trading strategy and losses was both irrelevant to establishing his state of mind at the time he obtained client funds and also highly prejudicial. The court denied counsel's motions in limine and his repeated objections, ruling that the brokers could testify as to factual matters for the limited purpose of allowing the jury to \"consider[] the historical fact of the kind of trading that was done so the jury can decide . . . whether [Carpenter] had the requisite criminal state of mind\" when investors were assured that their funds would be kept safe. The court also determined that, because no foundation had been laid to treat them as experts, these witnesses could not provide opinion testimony. In addition, the court repeatedly expressed its concern that such evidence not be used to distract the jurors from the elements of the charged offenses of mail and wire fraud. These witnesses's testimony dominated three of the ten days of Carpenter's trial.</p>\n<p>During its closing and rebuttal arguments,<sup>[3]</sup> the government emphasized that the riskiness of Carpenter's trading strategy conflicted with the purposes for which Benistar's clients entrusted their money to Carpenter's management. In making this argument, the government embellished its description of Carpenter's trading strategy with gambling metaphors and terminology intended to show Carpenter's recklessness.</p>\n<p>A jury convicted Carpenter on all counts. Shortly thereafter, Carpenter filed motions for a new trial under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 33(b)(2) and for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29(c), each raising several grounds. The district court granted the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> motion for a new trial, ruling that the government's repeated use of gambling metaphors during its closing arguments \"may [] have induced a verdict based on the jury's moral disapproval of the `gambling'\" rather than on the jury's conclusion that Carpenter had committed mail and wire fraud. <i>United States v. Carpenter,</i> 405 F.Supp.2d 85, 102 (D.Mass.2005). The court denied the motion for acquittal and subsequently denied Carpenter's motion for reconsideration. The government appealed the new trial ruling pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3731<sup>[4]</sup> and Carpenter filed a cross-appeal, arguing that the court wrongly decided his motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. The Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p>The government contends that the district court abused its discretion in granting the motion for a new trial because: (1) it did not apply plain error review despite Carpenter's failure to object to the government's use of gambling metaphors until after the jury delivered its verdict; (2) the government's references to gambling were not improper under any standard; and (3) even if the gambling references were improper, they did not amount to a \"miscarriage of justice,\" warranting a new trial. <i>England v. Reinauer Transp. Cos.,</i> 194 F.3d 265, 270 (1st Cir.1999) (citing <i>Conway v. Electro Switch Corp.,</i> 825 F.2d 593, 598-99 (1st Cir.1987)). We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p>1. Preservation of Carpenter's Objection</p>\n<p>The government argues that because Carpenter did not contemporaneously object to the government's use of gambling metaphors during its closing arguments, the district court should have reviewed the motion for a new trial based on those arguments for plain error.<sup>[5]</sup> Although the government pressed this same plain error argument before the district court, the court did not expressly address the argument in its opinion ordering a new trial. Nevertheless, as we shall explain, the court's opinion can only be read as an implicit determination that Carpenter preserved his objection to the closing arguments.</p>\n<p>The government concedes that Carpenter moved in limine and made several trial objections to the introduction of testimony related to Carpenter's investment strategy and losses. However, the government argues that these objections were insufficiently specific, and that they addressed only the <i>admission</i> of evidence and not the manner in which the government could <i>argue from</i> that evidence during its closing and rebuttal.</p>\n<p>Historically, when a party's motion in limine to exclude evidence had been denied, the party's failure to renew the objection at trial was considered \"fatal.\" <i>E.g., </i><i>United States v. Vest,</i> 842 F.2d 1319, 1325 (1st Cir.1988). However, Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a) was amended in 2000 to read, in pertinent part: \"[o]nce the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.\" The accompanying commentary explains that \"[w]hen the ruling is definitive, a renewed objection or offer of proof at the time the evidence is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> to be offered is more a formalism than a necessity.\" Fed.R.Evid. 103 advisory committee's note, 2000 Amendment. In applying this rule, we must pay particular attention to the question whether the trial court made \"definitive\" rulings on the motion in limine. <i>Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> 334 F.3d 124, 133-34 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Carpenter repeatedly objected to the introduction of evidence regarding his trading strategy and losses, arguing that it was irrelevant and overly prejudicial because it distracted the jury's attention from whether he intended to defraud Benistar's clients at the time their funds were solicited, and focused their attention instead on the sagacity of his investment strategy. Indeed, before the trial even began, Carpenter moved in limine to preclude the testimony of the Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber brokers based on irrelevance and undue prejudice. He also argued that, because they had not been identified as expert witnesses, the brokers should not be allowed to give any evaluative opinions about his trading strategy.</p>\n<p>The court found Carpenter's arguments somewhat persuasive, ruling on the motion in limine that the \"jury may take account of what kind of trading was done in evaluating whether there was a culpable state of mind. . . . but evaluative opinions about the nature of the trading from people who have not been identified as [expert] witnesses will not be permitted.\" In addition, the court stated that \"it would be appropriate to caution the jury in [its] instructions to stay on the elements of the offenses that are charged and not imagine other wrongs.\" The court added: \"[w]hen we've seen all the evidence, we'll have a clearer idea of what to do on that subject.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the court's preliminary ruling on his objection to the brokers' testimony, Carpenter continued to object to that testimony to assure the preservation of his objection. For instance, at the end of the first day of broker testimony, Carpenter's counsel stated: \"I just want to preserve my objection because I don't know if I preserved [it] adequately in terms of all the testimony that came in. . . . [I]t's the same issue, but I didn't want to stand up every time.\" The court responded: \"I think your objection is preserved.\"</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the Merrill Lynch brokers' testimony, Carpenter filed a motion for mistrial, arguing that he had been \"irretrievably prejudiced in front of the jury by the [testimony of the] Merrill Lynch witnesses that he was an aggressive speculator[,] river boat gambler.\" The court denied Carpenter's motion for a mistrial, explaining: \"I adhere to the ruling that permitted the admission of the evidence in advance. I understand the point. We'll deal with it at some additional occasions.\" When Carpenter's counsel asked for a \"running objection in line with the motion [for a mistrial]. . . . So I don't have to stand up,\" the court responded: \"You're covered under Rule 103.\" The recognition of a continuing objection could not be clearer.</p>\n<p>After Carpenter received that assurance, the government presented two expert witnesses who testified regarding Carpenter's investment strategy. In a motion in limine seeking to preclude the testimony of the second expert, Marc Allaire, Carpenter argued: \"the jury has already heard sufficient evidence regarding the rudiments of options investments. . . . Any further testimony by Allaire on this issue would simply be cumulative, unhelpful and a waste of time.\" Although the court rejected the motion in a ruling from the bench, it reiterated its concern for</p>\n<blockquote>making sure that the jury at the appropriate time is focused on the elements of the offense and what needs to be proved. And I agree that to some degree this is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> all relevant as to state of mind, but I'm concerned that the more the wisdom of the trading strategy gets debated, the more the jury will think that has greater significance than maybe it does in their deliberations. . . . I want to keep this focused on whether there was an intent to deceive or specific intent to defraud.</blockquote>\n<p>Carpenter's counsel persisted, stating: \"I'm not going to belabor the point, your Honor. . . . I would just preserve the issue.\" The court responded: \"Okay. All right.\" After Allaire's testimony, the court heard a final day of testimony focused primarily on establishing the authenticity of the actual mail and wire transfers of funds from Benistar's clients into the Benistar account. The parties then presented their closing arguments the next day.</p>\n<p>Thus, the trial court devoted considerable attention to the contested evidence throughout the trial, fielding repeated objections and stressing its concern that the government limit its use of the evidence to illuminating Carpenter's intent. Placed in this context, we find unpersuasive the government's attempt to distinguish between the introduction of the evidence covered by Carpenter's objections at trial and the prosecution's arguments from that evidence, to which Carpenter did not specifically object before jury deliberations. We look in vain for any indication that the government drew this distinction in its written submission to the district court in opposition to Carpenter's motion for a new trial. More importantly, even if this distinction was discernible in the government's opposition, the district court was entitled to reject it and conclude that Carpenter's continuing objections to the admission of evidence about his investment strategy and losses applied as well to the government's closing arguments based upon that evidence.<sup>[6]</sup> Hence we reject the government's argument that the district court erred in failing to apply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> plain error review to the government's new trial motion.</p>\n<p>The dissent disagrees with this conclusion, asserting that the district court had to apply the plain error standard to the defendant's motion for a new trial because Carpenter failed to preserve his objection to the government's use of gambling metaphors in its closing arguments. This assertion reflects the dissent's unstated premise that appellate review of the trial court's preservation determination is de novo. That is not the law. Instead, the appellate court should defer to such a preservation ruling by the district court. The preservation requirement has two components: alerting a trial judge to a party's objection to a ruling or to the admission of evidence and adequately explaining the basis for that objection. <i>See </i><i>Estate of Keatinge v. Biddle,</i> 316 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir.2002). Thus advised, the trial judge can decide what course of action to take to assure, so far as possible, the legal correctness of the trial proceedings. <i>Id.</i> Faced with post-trial arguments debating whether an objection to evidence or arguments was adequately preserved, it is certainly the trial judge who is in the best position to decide if she sufficiently understood that an objection had been made and the grounds for it. Given that reality, the appellate court should defer to the trial court's preservation ruling.<sup>[7]</sup> The dissent rejects such deference in favor of a de novo standard of review which fails to account for the trial court's superior position to determine whether it has been properly apprised of an objection.</p>\n<p>In addition, contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, there is no rule that preserved objections to the admission of evidence cannot also cover closing arguments based upon that testimony. Here, in evaluating defendant's demand for a new trial on the basis of gambling metaphors in the government's closing arguments, the district court could reasonably conclude that the defendant's strenuous objections to the evidence on trading strategy and losses embraced the gambling metaphors that characterized that evidence in such provocative terms in the government's closing arguments.</p>\n<p>The dissent cites unfairness to the government in the district court's new trial ruling. Specifically, the dissent speculates that \"had there been a cognizable objection here, the government would likely not have to retry the case, and the considerable burdens of a retrial would not be placed upon witnesses and alleged victims.\" Once again the dissent refuses to acknowledge the superior position of the district court to determine, from its vantage, that the defendant had already registered a cognizable objection to the government's use of gambling metaphors through its repeated objections to the evidence underlying those metaphors.</p>\n<p>However, there was always the risk for the government that the court, in the context of a post-trial motion for a new trial, would reconsider the appropriateness of its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> handling of the evidence and arguments on trading strategy and financial losses. That risk emphasizes why there is no unfairness to the government in the court's decision to award a new trial. As we have already noted, after one of its rulings admitting evidence on trading strategy and losses, the court stated that \"it would be appropriate to caution the jury in [its] instructions to stay on the elements of the offenses that are charged and not imagine other wrongs.\" The court expressed similar concerns on other occasions about the potential for the unfairly prejudicial impact of this evidence on the jury. Yet, as we explain more fully in the next section of the opinion, the government ignored the court's concerns about the limited relevance of the trading strategy and financial losses evidence. Instead of engaging in a straightforward explanation of the relevance of that evidence to the defendant's criminal intent, the government used provocative gambling metaphors to characterize that evidence. This calculated decision by the government increased the risk that the court, in evaluating a post-trial motion for a new trial, would conclude that this provocative treatment of the potentially unfairly prejudicial evidence made this prejudice real and required a new trial in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p>The government cannot claim surprise in such a ruling. When it resorted to the gambling metaphors in its closing arguments, the government made its own gamble that the court, despite its uneasiness about the potential prejudicial impact of the evidence of trading strategy and financial losses on the jury, would not conclude, in evaluating the inevitable motion for a new trial, that the government had gone too far with its arguments. There is no unfairness to the government if it has now lost that gamble.</p>\n<p>2. Propriety of Gambling Metaphors in Closing</p>\n<p>We must now decide if the district court was correct in ruling that the government had gone too far with the many gambling references during its closing arguments. Although we employ the deferential abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the district court's ultimate determination that the prosecution's inflammatory statements warrant a new trial, we must review de novo the prior question of whether the comments themselves were improper. <i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> 218 F.3d 58, 68 (1st Cir.2000) (reviewing de novo whether prosecutor's statements during closing arguments were improper because they relied on evidence related to activities outside the scope of the alleged conspiracy to prove a criminal association); <i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 40 F.3d 1325, 1337-38 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying de novo review to determine the propriety of prosecutor's comments during closing arguments that the defense had failed to produce evidence regarding an alleged \"frame up\"); <i>United States v. Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d 316, 320-21 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1987) (acknowledging that a de novo standard of review applies to the legal question of whether the prosecutor's arguments were proper, but determining that the court need not decide propriety where it finds that the grant of a new trial on the basis of such arguments was an abuse of discretion even if the arguments were improper).</p>\n<p>The district court acknowledged that the \"gambling characterizations were not, as a matter of the narrative of the government's case, wholly inapt,\" 405 F.Supp.2d at 101. However, it found that the \"repeated references to gambling were intended to, and did, inflame the jury's passions against the defendant,\" <i>id.</i> We agree.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> In assessing whether the use of particular language is improper, we look beyond the technical accuracy of a phrase and consider such factors as the \"threat of unfair prejudice, frequency of use, and alternative means of description.\" <i>United States v. Felton,</i> 417 F.3d 97, 103 (1st Cir.2005). The prosecution's use of gambling language was extensive. The district court counted eighteen instances in which the government used some permutation of the word \"gamble,\" along with numerous references to other gambling terms. 405 F.Supp.2d at 101. The government referred to gambling in its morally freighted gaming sense, with provocative references to \"cashing in chips,\" \"doubling down\" and \"river boat gambler.\" In a particularly dramatic example, the prosecution intoned:</p>\n<blockquote>Any reasonable person with or without investment experience and knowledge would have said it's time to cash in my chips and go home. Not Dan Carpenter. He kept on playing. . . . The self-professed river boat gambler pushes on until the losses mount and mount and mount.</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, we are most concerned that the government would use such provocative language in the face of the court's repeated caution that the evidence upon which the gambling terminology was based should not be used to distract the jury from its focus on Carpenter's state of mind when he obtained his clients' funds. We cannot ignore this important context in evaluating the choices the prosecution made when it crafted its closing arguments.</p>\n<p>While we agree that \"a criminal defendant is not entitled `to a prosecutorial summing-up confined to platitudes and euphemisms,'\" <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada,</i> 877 F.2d 153, 159 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting <i>Palmariello v. Sup't of MCI Norfolk,</i> 873 F.2d 491, 494 (1st Cir.1989)), we must also ensure that \"while a prosecutor `may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones,'\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>Berger v. United States,</i> 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935)). Because the government repeatedly referred to gambling in a pejorative sense in its closing arguments, despite the district court's explicit warning against distracting the jurors from the elements of the crimes charged, we agree with the district court that the prosecutor's gambling arguments were improper.</p>\n<p>3. Grant of a New Trial</p>\n<p>Before granting a new trial based on a prosecutor's improper comments in a closing argument, a court must \"determin[e] `whether [those comments] ha[ve] so poisoned the well that a new trial is required,'\" <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 473 F.3d 387, 398 (1st Cir.2007). In so doing, the court considers such factors as: (1) the extent of the improper remarks, (2) the context, (3) the likely effect of any curative instructions given by the judge, and (4) the weight of the evidence against the defendant. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 425 F.3d 23, 38 (1st Cir.2005)). However, these factors are not exhaustive; they are meant merely to guide the court's inquiry into whether the prosecutor's improper comments have undermined the fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p>In assessing the extent to which the improper arguments affected the outcome of the trial, the district court focused on the frequency with which the gambling references were made, their \"persistently pejorative\" nature and their \"tendency to lead the jury away from the charges in the indictment by inviting them to blame Carpenter because he was a gambler, or because he lost the exchangors' money, rather <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> than because he had committed mail or wire fraud.\" 405 F.Supp.2d at 102.</p>\n<p>The court also emphasized the context in which those comments were made, noting that it had admitted the evidence from which these gambling metaphors were drawn for a \"limited purpose,\" and observing that \"this evidence was introduced in the latter stages of the government's case, close in time to the closing arguments. As the arguments were made, this evidence likely remained vivid in the jurors' memories.\" <i>Id.</i> Placed in this context, the court concluded: \"Condemning Carpenter for `gambling,' as the prosecutors persisted in doing, was an appeal to instincts of moral disapprobation about recklessness, waste, and perhaps even theft.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>After highlighting the improper nature of the government's arguments, the court related those arguments to the overall strength of the government's case:</p>\n<blockquote>though sufficient to withstand a motion for judgment of acquittal, the case was not so strong that it can confidently be said that the repeated `gambling' references had no illegitimate effect on the jury's assessment of the evidence. On what was perhaps the crucial issue, the jury would certainly have been warranted in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that Carpenter acted with intent to defraud, but a contrary conclusion also would have been rationally possible on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 103. The court concluded: \"Because it cannot be said with confidence that the government's improper closing arguments did not taint the verdict, the verdict cannot be allowed to stand.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We afford the district court substantial deference in such an assessment, reflecting the trial judge's familiarity with the case. The \"trial judge `has listened to the tone of the argument as it was delivered and has observed the apparent reaction of the jurors. In short, he is far more \"conversant with the factors relevant to the determination\" than any reviewing court can possibly be.'\" <i>Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d at 320 n. 2 (quoting <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. 497, 514, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978)). We find no basis for concluding that the district court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>B. The Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n<p>In his cross-appeal, Carpenter contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government failed to present sufficient evidence on the mail and wire fraud charges to permit a reasonable jury to convict him. Before we may reach the merits of Carpenter's cross-appeal, we face the threshold question of our jurisdiction. Carpenter urges us to assert jurisdiction over his cross-appeal under the so-called \"collateral order\" doctrine, in order to protect his right to be free from double jeopardy and as a matter of judicial economy.</p>\n<p>Although 28 U.S.C. § 1291 specifies that our jurisdiction extends only to appeals from \"final decisions of the district courts,\" the Supreme Court, in <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), identified a \"small class . . . [of] claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> The Court has since held that \"a pretrial order denying a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds . . . fall[s] within [this] `small class of cases.'\" <i>Abney v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 651, 659, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977). There, the Court relied upon the finality of the district court's action  there being \"no further steps that can be taken in the District Court to avoid the trial the defendant maintains is barred by the Fifth Amendment's guarantee,\" <i>id.</i>  and the fact that the \"elements of [his double jeopardy] claim are completely independent of his guilt or innocence,\" <i>id.</i> at 660, 97 S.Ct. 2034. The court also emphasized that \"even if the accused is acquitted, or, if convicted, has his conviction ultimately reversed on double jeopardy grounds, he has still been forced to endure a trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prohibit.\" <i>Id.</i> at 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034.</p>\n<p>Carpenter argues that the refusal to consider his cross-appeal would force him \"to endure the personal strain, public embarrassment, and expense of a [second] criminal trial,\" which <i>Abney</i> sought to avoid. <i>Id.</i> at 661, 97 S.Ct. 2034. With this language, Carpenter invokes the principle of double jeopardy. <i>See </i><i>Green v. United States,</i> 355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957) (\"[T]he State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\"). In addition, he claims that our refusal to hear a sufficiency claim in these circumstances would burden defendants with a \"Hobson's choice\" between: (1) waiving the right to move for a new trial in order to ensure appellate review of a sufficiency claim; and (2) moving for a new trial and losing the right to appeal a sufficiency claim arising from the first trial. Carpenter further argues that considerations of judicial economy support our review because we must review the trial record in any event to assess the government's appeal of the new trial ruling.</p>\n<p>While Carpenter's assertions have practical appeal, they run afoul of most of the relevant precedent. As we have recognized elsewhere, <i>Abney</i> \"is not carte blanche authority for all interlocutory appeals brought under the Double Jeopardy banner, since some such claims do not meet the requirements of the `collateral order' doctrine.\" <i>United States v. Ramirez-Burgos,</i> 44 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir. 1995). In order to qualify for review under the collateral order doctrine, the collateral issue must:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) [be] so conceptually distinct from other issues being litigated in the underlying action that an immediate appeal would neither disrupt the main action, nor threaten to deprive the appellate court of useful context which might be derived from subsequent developments in the litigation; (2) completely and conclusively resolve the collateral issue; (3) infringe rights which appellant could not effectively vindicate in an appeal after final judgment in the case; <i>and</i> (4) involve an important or unsettled legal issue, rather than merely challenge discretionary trial court rulings.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Kouri-Perez,</i> 187 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1999). We have emphasized that \"all four of [these] criteria must be met for there to be jurisdiction under this exception to § 1291 finality.\" <i>In re Licht &amp; Semonoff,</i> 796 F.2d 564, 571 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n<p>In <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> 468 U.S. 317, 325, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984), the Supreme Court reasoned that \"the protection of the Double Jeopardy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> Clause . . . applies only if there has been some event, such as an acquittal, which terminates the original jeopardy.\" Guided by this principle, the Court went on to determine that a mistrial was not a jeopardy-terminating event and thus a second trial was not barred even if there had been insufficient evidence to convict at the first trial. <i>Id.</i> at 326, 104 S.Ct. 3081.</p>\n<p>We extended this logic to the vacatur of a conviction on appeal for legal error in <i>United States v. Porter,</i> 807 F.2d 21, 24 n. 2 (1st Cir.1986), stating: \"where the first conviction was vacated for legal error, not insufficiency of evidence, the concept of continuing jeopardy rules out a double jeopardy claim based on purported insufficiency of evidence at the first trial.\" Thus, a defendant who succeeds on appeal in demonstrating that he is entitled to a new trial because of error at his first trial may not assert a double jeopardy bar to retrial. As his original jeopardy has not yet ended, there is no double jeopardy to avoid.</p>\n<p>It is a short step from <i>Porter</i> to the case before us, where the trial court itself ordered a new trial on the basis of legal error. <i>Porter</i> teaches that a defendant has no double jeopardy claim when his conviction has been vacated for legal error. <i>Id.</i> at 24. That is what occurred here. Although Carpenter's conviction was undone by the trial court rather than on appeal, this is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p>Without a viable double jeopardy claim, Carpenter has no double jeopardy \"right\" that he cannot effectively vindicate if he is not permitted to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in this appeal. Hence he cannot meet the third criterion of the collateral order doctrine.<sup>[9]</sup> The Second and Seventh Circuits have similarly found no jurisdiction to hear cross-appeals of a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under the collateral order doctrine where the district court's order of a new trial vacated the underlying conviction. <i>United States v. Eberhart,</i> 388 F.3d 1043, 1051 (7th Cir.2004), rev'd on other grounds, 546 U.S. 12, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005); <i>United States v. Ferguson,</i> 246 F.3d 129, 138 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Carpenter claims support for his cross-appeal in three decisions from other circuits: <i>United States v. Greene,</i> 834 F.2d 86 (4th Cir.1987); <i>United States v. Wood,</i> 958 F.2d 963 (10th Cir.1992); and <i>United States v. Gotti,</i> 451 F.3d 133 (2d Cir.2006). Only <i>Greene</i> supports his position, and we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p>In <i>Greene,</i> after the trial court ordered a new trial and denied Greene's motion for acquittal, the government appealed the new trial grant. Greene cross-appealed, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> arguing that the district court erred when it rejected his claim that the evidence was not sufficient to convict him and that to require another trial would violate his right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense. <i>Greene,</i> 834 F.2d at 87. While acknowledging that the \"denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal prior to entry of a judgment or sentence [is] normally not reviewable in the Court of Appeals,\" the court determined that it \"would be unfair to apply such a rule in the present proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 89.</p>\n<p>Neither <i>Wood</i> nor <i>Gotti</i> reaches such a result. In <i>Wood,</i> the trial court ordered a new trial and denied Wood's motion for judgment of acquittal. The government appealed the grant of a new trial, and Wood cross-appealed the denial of his motion for acquittal contending that double jeopardy barred his retrial. <i>Wood,</i> 958 F.2d at 965. Wood's double jeopardy claim was also based on the insufficiency of the evidence at his trial. <i>Id.</i> at 967. On the government's motion to dismiss the cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Tenth Circuit denied the motion and asserted jurisdiction over Wood's cross-appeal because it found a \"colorable double jeopardy claim\" giving rise to jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine, <i>United States v. Wood,</i> 950 F.2d 638, 643 (10th Cir.1991). However, in its subsequent ruling, it affirmed the new trial grant and ultimately ruled that the double jeopardy claim lacked merit for many of the same reasons that we cite here, given that the district court had granted defendant's motion for a new trial, <i>Wood</i> 958 F.2d at 970-71.<sup>[10]</sup> Notably, the court further concluded that its \"resolution of the merits of Defendant's claims makes future double jeopardy claims like Defendant's non-colorable and, therefore, subject to summary dismissal when asserted on an interlocutory appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 972 n. 12.</p>\n<p>In <i>Gotti,</i> there was no motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence in his first trial. Indeed, the jury had not convicted Gotti on any of the charges against him. <i>Gotti,</i> 451 F.3d at 135. Instead, it acquitted him on one charge and divided on others, resulting in the declaration of a mistrial on those charges. <i>Id.</i> The district court then denied Gotti's post-trial motion to bar a retrial on two of the counts on double jeopardy grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 135-36. Gotti then sought interlocutory review of that double jeopardy ruling itself. <i>Id.</i> at 136. There was no appeal by the government of any trial court ruling and no cross-appeal by Gotti trying to challenge a trial court ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal. Citing <i>Abney,</i> the Court of Appeals analogized the trial court's double jeopardy ruling to a court's denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss counts of an indictment on double jeopardy grounds and concluded that this ruling met the requirements of the collateral order doctrine. <i>Id.</i> In addressing the merits of Gotti's double jeopardy argument, it rejected that argument on very different grounds than those Carpenter raises in asking us to hear his cross-appeal.<sup>[11]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 136-37. Moreover, as noted, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> the \"merits\" issue on appeal in <i>Gotti</i> was the trial court's double jeopardy ruling itself. Here the \"merits\" issue in the cross-appeal is the trial court's ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence. <i>Gotti</i> has scant relevance to our application of the collateral order doctrine to that sufficiency ruling.</p>\n<p>To the extent that Carpenter makes a judicial efficiency argument that is independent of the collateral order doctrine, we reject that argument as well. Carpenter's primary efficiency argument  that granting appellate jurisdiction over the cross-appeal makes \"practical sense\" because \"given the government's appeal, the Court will now conduct a thorough review of the trial record in this case\"  is beside the point. We are not at liberty to go beyond the established criteria of the collateral order doctrine to create new exceptions to the finality requirements of § 1291. Indeed, Carpenter's argument that we should consider his sufficiency claim as we consider the government's appeal runs directly counter to the first criterion of the collateral order doctrine, which requires that the collateral issue (here, sufficiency) be \"conceptually distinct\" from the issues in the underlying action. <i>Kouri-Perez,</i> 187 F.3d at 5. Of course, Carpenter's sufficiency arguments are deeply entwined with the merits of the mail and wire fraud charges that constitute the underlying action.</p>\n<p>In addition, even if we could recognize such an efficiency exception, any efficiency gains promised by Carpenter are illusory because there is little comparability between the review that we have had to conduct in our deferential review of the new trial grant and the de novo review we would have to conduct to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence. In his sufficiency challenge, Carpenter raises arguments of causation, intent, constructive amendment of the indictment, reliance upon a theory of liability based on omission, good faith as an absolute defense, and venue. We have not had to address any of those issues in order to evaluate the district court's new trial ruling.</p>\n<p>Carpenter raises a second argument under the banner of efficiency. If we deny appellate jurisdiction over his cross-appeal, he says, and reverse the district court's grant of a new trial, we will have to conduct a second review of the trial record at a later point in time after Carpenter is sentenced and files a direct appeal. Thus, Carpenter contends, granting jurisdiction to hear the cross-appeal at this point will \"conserve judicial resources.\" However, the subsequent direct review of the issues now raised in the cross-appeal would not represent a \"second review\" of the trial record because, as we have already noted, our review of the new trial ruling has not required us to review the portions of the record relevant to the issues raised in the cross-appeal. More importantly, Carpenter's second efficiency argument betrays his frontal challenge to the most basic precepts of the final judgment rule. If we were to reverse the trial court's new trial ruling, there would be no final judgment until Carpenter had been sentenced after a remand. <i>See </i><i>Berman v. United States,</i> 302 U.S. 211, 212, 58 S.Ct. 164, 82 L.Ed. 204 (1937) (\"Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment.\"); <i>United States v. Leichter,</i> 160 F.3d 33, 35 (1st Cir.1998). We are not at liberty to disregard such well-established final judgment rules in pursuit of a false efficiency.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons described above, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's grant of a new trial. We <i>dismiss</i> the cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<p>LYNCH, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>A trial judge may grant a new trial only \"if the interest of justice so requires.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). The power is used sparingly. But it may be triggered by a myriad of circumstances. Rule 33 wisely does not attempt to characterize those circumstances so as to limit a trial judge's authority to rule on a timely motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>Here, the trial judge concluded that the jury may well have been diverted from its task of determining whether the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of the charged offenses. <i>United States v. Carpenter,</i> 405 F.Supp.2d 85, 102 (D.Mass.2005). The judge found that the government's case was not so strong that it could confidently be said that the repeated gambling references had no illegitimate effect on the verdict. <i>Id.</i> at 103. The court held that because it was possible that the government's closing arguments tainted the jury's verdict, the verdict could not be allowed to stand. In that context, the district court called the government's closing arguments \"improper.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The trial judge implicitly ruled that defendant had sufficiently preserved his objection to the gambling metaphor so that he was not required to take the unusual step of interrupting the government's closing argument. An appellate court is not entitled to second guess that conclusion, which was certainly not an abuse of discretion. The trial judge recognized that there was a point at which the relevance of the large losses produced by risky trading was outweighed by the danger of distracting the jury from focused consideration of the actual charges. That grey zone was never well defined throughout the trial, and its demarcation points were not clarified before the closing arguments, despite the granting of a continuing objection. Perhaps both sides should have sought clarification before the closing arguments.</p>\n<p>In my view, the real issue is not whether one side acted \"improperly.\" It is the potential effect of this situation on the jury which matters. The experienced trial judge, who sat through the trial and the closing, concluded that the balance had tipped too far within that grey zone and that the interest of justice required a new trial.</p>\n<p>Given that the trial judge lacked confidence that the verdict was based on proper considerations, and given the context in which the trial judge ruled, an appellate judge cannot say that the trial judge's conclusion was unreasonable. Indeed, the decision to grant a new trial does not even approach being an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This appeal centers around two issues: (1) whether in ruling upon defendant's motion for a new trial, the district court had to apply the plain error standard in Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b)  a question turning on whether defendant failed to lodge a timely objection within Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b)<sup>[12]</sup> sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> to preserve the error for which the new trial was granted, namely, the government's use of gambling metaphors in its closing, which the court felt may have induced a verdict based on the jury's moral disapproval of gambling; and (2) whether the U.S. Attorney's gambling rhetoric went so far as to exceed fair comment and, in the event plain error review was required, to meet that standard.</p>\n<p>In answer to (1), I believe the district court was required to apply the plain error standard in ruling on the new trial motion. As for issue (2), it would be premature for us to pass judgment on whether the gambling rhetoric could be found to amount to plain error, that question being one for the district court in the first instance. I would vacate and remand while retaining jurisdiction so as to be able to decide in the future  should plain error be found below  whether that finding exceeds the district court's considerable discretion in the matter.</p>\n<p>1. Adequacy of Objection</p>\n<p>Judicial review is limited to \"the notably ungenerous plain error standard\" whenever \"a defendant defaults on [the] obligation [to protect his own interests] by failing to make a contemporaneous objection to questionable comments in the prosecution's closing argument.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.1995). Nothing in the language of Fed.R.Crim.P. 51 and 52, or in binding precedent, suggests that some different rule applies where a district court, as here, (rather than a court of appeals) is asked, post-verdict, to grant a new trial based on an alleged inappropriate closing.</p>\n<p>One of the principal purposes of the contemporaneous objection requirement is to alert the district judge so that she or he can take on-the-spot curative steps, by instructing the jury to disregard the prejudicial rhetoric or in some other way minimizing the harm, thus obviating the trouble and expense of a new trial. As this court stated in <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 972,</p>\n<blockquote>[C]alling a looming error to the trial court's attention affords an opportunity to correct the problem before irreparable harm occurs. Then, too, the raise-or-waive rule . . . precludes a party from making a tactical decision to refrain from objecting, and subsequently, should the case turn sour, assigning error. . . . <sup>[13]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Here, there is simply no indication that the gambling metaphors used by the government in its closing, and the purported moral disapproval they might engender in jurors, were concerns ever contemporaneously called to the district court's attention, either during the closing when those references were actually being made or, right after, before the case went to the jury, when the district judge could still have taken steps to cure whatever prejudice the rhetorical metaphors may have caused in the minds of the jurors. The basis for the grant of a new trial was not the brokers' testimony, to admission of which earlier, unsuccessful, objections were lodged and on which earlier objections <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> the majority now relies in its opinion, but the colorful gambling metaphors employed by the government in closing argument which were later said by the district court to have carried the risk of inflaming the jurors' moral disapproval.</p>\n<p>Had defendant contemporaneously objected to this allegedly inflammatory rhetoric either during or after the closing, before the case went to the jury, the court could have instructed the jury to disregard it and explained to the jurors why the analogies were prejudicial and overblown, thus obviating the extreme and costly remedy of a new trial. Even had the defense attorney hesitated to interrupt the government's argument, there was ample time afterwards to have lodged an objection and for the court to have taken corrective steps. Indeed, following the court's closing jury instructions, when counsel were invited to submit their objections to the charge, defense counsel took that opportunity to protest certain parts of the government's closing but never mentioned these supposedly outrageous misstatements. Nor did the judge say anything to counsel or the jury about them during or after the closing, as one might have expected had the earlier evidentiary objections relied on by my colleagues actually functioned so as to call to the judge's mind that the defense was now objecting to the closing's gambling rhetoric<sup>[14]</sup>  or even that the rhetoric violated the court's own earlier cautionary admonition against overemphasizing certain matters. The court's silence on the subject at the crucial moments strongly suggests that whatever the earlier objections accomplished, they did not accomplish what Rule 51(b) seeks  namely to alert the court contemporaneously, when corrective action by the court still remains possible, that the defense is then and there objecting to certain language being used in the government's oratory.</p>\n<p>The purpose of Rule 51(b), in other words, is to put the court on <i>actual,</i> not just constructive, notice that a party protests a particular alleged defect  here, the closing gambling rhetoric  so that, inter alia, appropriate corrective action can be taken immediately if warranted. Rule 51(b) is not well served by resting the finding of an adequate objection upon an elaborate chain of appellate inferences going back to non-contemporaneous objections made earlier for a different purpose. Rule 51(b) requires, and ordinarily receives, a practical interpretation, consistent with its purpose to alert the court in a meaningful way so that it can act before too late.</p>\n<p>It is overwhelmingly evident from the record that no one, prior to the verdict, got <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> the message, including the judge, that the defense was protesting the government's rhetorical gambling analogies  analogies which the district court later said may have elicited the jurors' moral disapproval based upon their distaste for gambling. Without having been contemporaneously alerted by a Rule 51(b) objection, the district court was obliged, when it ruled on defendant's post-verdict motion for a new trial, to employ plain error review under Rule 52(b). The government made this point when arguing the motion,<sup>[15]</sup> but the district court did not address it at all. As my colleagues agree, it now seems the court, in granting a new trial, used the ordinary review standard (although Carpenter argues otherwise in his appellate brief).</p>\n<p>My colleagues contend we should leave it to the district court, in these circumstances, whether a sufficient objection was lodged to preserve the closing gambling metaphor issue. Here, the judge, in passing on the defendants' new trial motion, made no express finding that an objection had been made, nor did he rule at all on the government's contention that an objection had not been preserved by the defense on the use of the gambling metaphors during the closing. But my colleagues would infer from the district court's complete silence that it must have found a sufficient defense objection, and they say they must defer to the district court on that and all related matters.</p>\n<p>My difficulty with the above is that it treats the raise-or-waive rule as if it were only of concern to the district court  to protect it, for instance, against being \"sandbagged\" in the common situation where a defendant appeals to this court from an adverse ruling of the trial judge concerning some matter never called to the court's attention below. My colleagues' viewpoint would hold that where the district judge is satisfied  as presumably he was here  with whatever steps defendant took, <i>or did not take,</i> to preserve an objection, that should end the matter.</p>\n<p>But I believe such deference is extreme. The raise-or-waive rule, it is true, exists to protect the trial judge, but it also serves other important goals. As already discussed, it serves the purpose of judicial economy, forcing all concerned, including the court itself, to face issues  such as the challenged rhetoric used by the government here  at a time when corrective action can still be taken short of a costly new trial. The opportunity for correction afforded by a timely objection, as well as the penalty of plain error review for failure to object, also promote essential fairness to the other party, here the government  and not only to the government alone, but to those who must bear the burdens of a new trial, such as the victims of defendant's alleged misconduct and other witnesses. Had there been a meaningful, contemporaneous objection here, the government would likely not have to retry the case, saving both monetary costs and the added burdens on many others.</p>\n<p>This is not to question the district court's discretion, were there merely a question of disputed evidence over the making of a sufficient contemporaneous <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> objection, to resolve that dispute. But, here, the only arguably pertinent objections in the record  those made earlier under Fed.R.Evid. 103 to the admission of certain testimony  fell flagrantly short of meeting the requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 51(b) for valid objections to the closing's gambling rhetoric. And the record contains nothing except silence to suggest that the district court, when granting a new trial, ever determined that an adequate objection  or any objection  had been made. Rules 51 and 52 are binding procedural rules to which courts must adhere. The wide discretion very properly given to the trial judge does not include the discretion to ignore or simply bypass the raise-or-waive rule.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>I would add that even the plain error standard of Rule 52(b) still allows a court, in appropriate circumstances, when faced with a strong sense that an injustice has or may have occurred, to allow a new trial even though a timely objection was not lodged  and our review of such a decision would and should take into account the trial judge's firsthand \"feel\" for a case tried in his presence. Nevertheless, plain error review remains a considerably tougher, higher, standard than ordinary review. Given defendant's default, the government was entitled to the reassurance that the latter standard was being applied in this case, since the question of whether or not the gambling rhetoric used went too far, and its likely unfair impact on jurors, is a close one as to which the standard of review used could well have a decisive effect on whether or not to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p>2. Whether Gambling Rhetoric Was Excessive</p>\n<p>As said, I believe that this appeal should be remanded to the district court with instructions to reconsider its new trial ruling under the correct plain error standard. A ruling by us at this juncture would be premature, since the district court's judgment based on its first-hand knowledge and feel is an essential prelude to whatever action this court takes. We would necessarily grant considerable deference to whatever view the district court takes on whether what occurred at the trial met the high standard of plain error. This does not mean there are no limits to our deference, nor that appellate review will thereafter be forbidden. A district court would not have carte blanche discretion to order a new trial simply because, to take a purely hypothetical example, it deemed the U.S. Attorney's closing remarks to be too eloquent and defense counsel's closing much less so  even if the trial court believed the difference had been decisive to the case's outcome. There are, moreover, some arguments an attorney may make which will be so entirely relevant as to be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> privileged as a matter of law, just as there are others which the district court may determine dispositively as going too far.</p>\n<p>Here, the government argues that its gambling analogy was so apt that it fell within the safety zone and that, in any event, the analogy was not so extreme as to amount to plain error. This is not an easy issue, and it is one as to which the district court's ruling, along with its reasons, one way or another, will not only be helpful but essential. I would, therefore, remand for a new ruling on the new trial motion, one explicitly based on the plain error standard, which, in these circumstances, the district court was, in my view, legally obliged by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to apply. It is most unlikely the district court believed it was applying that standard when it ruled previously, and, given especially the closeness of the grounds for granting a new trial, I believe the government is entitled to a ruling expressly based upon the correct legal standard. Given the high hurdle of plain error review, a remand is no mere waste of judicial time. To the contrary, it could be critical to the outcome, and it is also a necessary act of fairness to the government and those persons and interests the government serves, given the defendant's failure to have preserved a proper objection.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Indeed, testimony indicated that, in the fourth quarter of 1999, Carpenter was \"up\" roughly $800,000.00, providing Carpenter with slightly more than $600,000.00 in profit.</p>\n<p>[2]  Paley provided extensive documentary evidence and deposition testimony to the government as it built its case. He also testified as a witness against Carpenter at trial. No criminal charges were brought against Paley in connection with this wire and mail fraud scheme.</p>\n<p>[3]  The closing and rebuttal arguments will be referred to hereinafter as \"the closing arguments.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  We note that the government's ability to appeal the district court's grant of a motion for a new trial is a relatively recent phenomenon, arising from the 1984 amendments to § 3731.</p>\n<p>[5]  The parties agree that the court did not apply plain error review.</p>\n<p>[6]  The dissent argues that we should not infer that the court ruled that defendant preserved his objection to the government's use of gambling metaphors in its closing arguments and that the plain error standard did not apply to the request for a new trial based on the closing arguments. However, the government explicitly argued for plain error review in its written opposition to Carpenter's motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial. The court issued a lengthy published decision on these motions, addressing each of Carpenter's arguments in detail, including the argument that the court entitled in its decision \"Prejudicial Inflammatory Argument\" (a reference to the gambling metaphors). In explaining its decision to grant a new trial because of this inflammatory argument, the court explained its decision in harmless error terms: \"Because it cannot be said with confidence that the government's improper closing arguments did not taint the verdict, the verdict cannot be allowed to stand.\" This language echoes other decisions on new trial motions that have evaluated whether the interest of justice requires a new trial under the harmless error standard. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Casas,</i> 425 F.3d 23, 38 (1st Cir.2005) (assessing whether trial error affected the trial's outcome); <i>United States v. Hodge-Balwing,</i> 952 F.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir.1991) (same); <i>United States v. Capone,</i> 683 F.2d 582, 585-86 (1st Cir.1982) (same). Given the thoroughness of the court's decision, including its explanation of the reasons for granting a new trial, we can only conclude that the court did not apply plain error review because it consciously rejected the government's plain error argument. Moreover, even if the district court had satisfied the dissent's insistence on an explicit ruling rejecting the plain error standard, the dissent would still deem that ruling a legal error. The dissent's central concern is not the adequacy of the court's explanation of its decision to apply the harmless error standard. Instead, the dissent argues that the district court could not apply the harmless error standard because, as a matter of law, the defendant did not preserve his objection to the government's use of gambling metaphors in its closing arguments. As we explain more fully, that argument misperceives the standard of review that an appellate court should apply to a trial court's preservation ruling.</p>\n<p>[7]  We routinely defer to the trial court when it is better positioned to assess the relevant factors for making particular kinds of decisions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Castro v. Chicago Hous. Auth.,</i> 360 F.3d 721, 735 (7th Cir.2004) (deferring to trial court's evaluation of party's motion practice); <i>United States v. Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir.2003) (applying abuse of discretion standard to trial court's ruling on a motion for mistrial); <i>Ferrara &amp; DiMercurio v. St. Paul Mercury,</i> 240 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2001) (deferring to trial court's determination whether misconduct occurred and whether it required judicial sanction); <i>United States v. Dumas,</i> 207 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.2000) (deferring to trial court's assessment of witness credibility); <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado,</i> 115 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir.1997) (deferring to trial court's determination of evidence's relevance).</p>\n<p>[8]  Our agreement with the district court's grant of a new trial because of gambling metaphors obviates any need to address the alternative bases Carpenter asserted in his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>[9]  It is important to understand that Carpenter, in pursuing his cross-appeal, has invoked the principle of double jeopardy in the service of his primary argument that we should review the sufficiency of the evidence argument he makes in his cross-appeal. That is, Carpenter did not file a motion in the trial court arguing that his retrial was barred by the principle of double jeopardy. Indeed, there was no basis for any such argument. Hence, we are not reviewing a double jeopardy ruling by the trial court, or a claim that such a double jeopardy ruling itself falls within the collateral order doctrine. Instead, Carpenter uses double jeopardy principles to address the third element of the collateral order doctrine-namely, that the failure to address the collateral issue on appeal (here, sufficiency of the evidence) will infringe rights which appellant could not effectively vindicate in an appeal after final judgment in the case. Carpenter argues that, if the trial judge ruled incorrectly on his motion for judgment of acquittal, and if we failed to assess that possibility by hearing his cross-appeal, his retrial would infringe his double jeopardy right. However, as we have now shown, Carpenter misconstrues the nature of his double jeopardy right, and hence he cannot meet the third criterion of the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p>[10]  For example, the court emphasized that Wood could not be at risk of double jeopardy where his original jeopardy had not yet ended. 958 F.2d 963 at 970 (explaining that \"[a] guilty verdict by a jury which is set aside by the district court on a motion by the defendant does not terminate jeopardy.\").</p>\n<p>[11]  Gotti argued that because the jury could not unanimously agree that the government had proved two predicate racketeering acts with which he was charged, he was entitled to acquittal on the RICO charges against him and could not be retried on any of the charges. The court rejected Gotti's \"extraordinary argument,\" noting that \"[o]n this reasoning, juror disagreement as to the proof of a predicate act could <i>never</i> result in a hung jury,\" and that \"[t]he government is permitted to retry a defendant following a mistrial resulting from a hung jury.\" 451 F.3d at 136-37.</p>\n<p>[12]  Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b) provides,\n</p>\n<p>A party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court  when the court ruling or order is made or sought  of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party's objection to the court's action and the grounds for that objection. If a party does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence of an objection does not later prejudice that party. A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 103.</p>\n<p>[13]  In a later civil case, this court has said,\n</p>\n<p>We have made it transparently clear that the raise-or-waive rule can neither be ignored nor brushed aside as a \"pettifogging technicality or a trap for the indolent.\" <i>Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st Cir.1995). Rather, it is a prudential rule \"founded upon important considerations of fairness, judicial economy, and practical wisdom.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>Muniz v. Rovira,</i> 373 F.3d 1, 4 (2004).</p>\n<p>[14]  Judge Lipez states that the court's earlier response, \"You're covered under Rule 103,\" to Carpenter's request for a running objection to admission of the Merrill Lynch brokers' testimony (described by defense counsel as portraying Carpenter as \"an aggressive speculator[,] river boat gambler\") was a clear recognition by the court of a continuing objection that served later as an adequate objection under Rule 51(b) to the government's repeated rhetorical use, in its closing, of the gambling analogies. But Rule 103 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is an evidentiary rule. <i>See</i> Rule 51(b) (\"A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 103\"). Appropriately, the objections in question all related to the court's admission in evidence of the brokers' testimony, which emphasized the risky nature of option trading but did not invoke repetitive gambling metaphors nor raise the question of whether analogizing defendant's conduct to gambling would captivate the disapproval of jurors based on their moral disapproval of gambling. A new trial was not granted because the court decided it had erred in admitting the brokers' testimony but because of the inflammatory nature of the gambling figure used in the closing, with its peculiar tendency to invoke moral disapprobation.</p>\n<p>[15]  Judge Lipez, in the majority opinion, speaks of \"looking in vain\" for any indication that the government ever argued that objection to the closing's gambling metaphors had not been preserved. In fact, the government noted (under the heading that its \"closing and rebuttal fell within the bounds of proper argument\") that most of Carpenter's points had not been preserved, and listed the few that had been, making clear its belief that the defense's objection to the use of gambling metaphors was one that had not been preserved and was subject to plain error review.</p>\n<p>[16]  Of course, one might imagine special circumstances where a defense objection might not be needed to preserve an issue. For instance, the judge might, when the offending conduct occurs, give voice, sua sponte, on the record, to his own objection, which might in some circumstances relieve the defense of the need to object separately. But it seems unwarranted to presume such a special exception here, given the judge's complete silence at and after the closing, especially as, when the gambling rhetoric was later called to the judge's attention, he granted the extraordinary relief of a new trial. Surely, one would suppose, if the judge had at all considered the questionable character of the rhetoric at the time it was delivered, or then had believed the defense had objected to it at some earlier time, he would not have remained silent in the face of such knowledge, allowing events to proceed and the jury to remain uninstructed as to the improprieties that had occurred. To infer on this record and in the face of judicial silence, the preserving of a sufficient objection, seems to me tantamount to saying that Rule 51(b) and its companion, 52(b), need not be observed by the trial judge unless he or she cares to do so.</p>\n\n</div>",

In a cross-appeal, Carpenter asserts that the district court erred in failing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal. We affirm the new trial ruling. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to hear Carpenter's cross-appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>A. Factual Background</p>\n<p>We briefly rehearse the relevant facts, which are largely undisputed. In October 1998, Daniel Carpenter and Martin Paley formed Benistar Property Exchange Trust Company, Inc. (\"Benistar\") for the purpose of performing property exchanges pursuant to section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1031. § 1031(a)(1) allows a seller of \"property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment\" to avoid capital gains on the sales proceeds if they are used to purchase a replacement property meeting the same criteria. In order to qualify, the seller must complete the exchange within 180 days of the original sale and must not take control of the proceeds in the interim, § 1031(a)(3). Accordingly, property owners typically entrust their sales proceeds to a qualified intermediary until they purchase replacement property; Benistar was created to play this role.</p>\n<p>Benistar's clients signed standard form agreements providing that property sale proceeds be transmitted by wire or check directly from the closing attorney into a Benistar account. Clients chose between a Merrill Lynch Ready Asset Money Market Account, yielding a 3% return on investment per annum (which allowed clients to access their funds upon 48 hours' notice), and a Merrill Lynch Investment Account, yielding 6% interest (which required 30 days' notice before funds could be accessed).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> According to the agreement between Paley and Carpenter, Paley marketed Benistar's services to clients while Carpenter maintained sole authority over the financial aspects of the business. Carpenter opened two accounts at Merrill Lynch in October 1998: the \"B01 account,\" into which client funds were deposited; and the \"B10 account,\" into which Carpenter transferred client funds which he then invested. When he opened the B10 account, Carpenter characterized his risk tolerance as \"aggressive\" and he informed Merrill Lynch that he intended to engage in options trading. As is their practice, Merrill Lynch counseled Carpenter on the riskiness of these investments and required him to sign a form acknowledging his understanding of those risks.</p>\n<p>From October 1998 until late September 2000, Carpenter transferred funds from the B01 account to the B10 account and traded extensively in stock options. While his trading strategy was successful at first,<sup>[1]</sup> Carpenter lost significant sums when the stock market began to decline in March 2000. As the market continued to decline thereafter, his Merrill Lynch brokers repeatedly counseled Carpenter to adopt a more conservative trading strategy. After Carpenter sustained roughly $4 million in losses, Merrill Lynch suspended his trading privileges.</p>\n<p>Carpenter then moved his trading activity to PaineWebber, where he again opened linked accounts: client funds were deposited by mail or wire into one account and he engaged in stock option trading from the other account. As had Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber counseled Carpenter on the risks inherent in options trading; Carpenter acknowledged these risks and continued his aggressive investment strategy. Carpenter continued to sustain heavy trading losses at PaineWebber and, despite his broker's urging that he adopt a more conservative investment strategy, Carpenter increased the size and riskiness of his trades as his fortunes declined. PaineWebber discontinued Carpenter's trading privileges in December 2000. Although Benistar had been losing client funds since March 2000, incoming funds had covered the losses. However, by January 2001, Benistar was forced to tell its clients that their money was gone. Benistar subsequently ceased operations, having lost roughly $9 million in client funds.</p>\n<p>B. Carpenter's Trial</p>\n<p>Carpenter was indicted in February 2004 by a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts on fourteen counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and five counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341. In particular, Carpenter was charged with having devised and implemented a scheme to defraud investors by representing that their money would be invested prudently in conformity with the property exchange requirements of the Internal Revenue Code while he intended to pursue an investment strategy at odds with such representations. Critically, clients transferred funds to Carpenter and Benistar by mail and wire in response to the investment scheme. Because both mail and wire fraud require an intent to defraud, the trial focused largely on Carpenter's state of mind when he obtained the funds of Benistar's clients through the representations made to them.</p>\n<p>In his defense, Carpenter portrayed his lack of interaction with clients and his lack of knowledge about Benistar's promotional materials. He contended that any assurances made to clients about the risks to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> their funds were made by Paley alone and without his knowledge.<sup>[2]</sup> In addition, Carpenter emphasized that the client agreements placed no restrictions on how funds would be managed in order to produce the 3% or 6% return selected by the clients. Carpenter argued that he never misled clients into believing their funds would be safe. Rather, he insisted that he acted with the good faith belief that he had unfettered discretion to invest client funds. He attributed Benistar's losses not to an unwise trading strategy but to a generalized stock market crash well beyond his control.</p>\n<p>The government focused on the incongruity between the nature of a § 1031 property exchange (a transaction structured to avoid capital gains while allowing investors to use the proceeds of one property sale to purchase a replacement property within a short period of time) and the aggressive nature of Carpenter's investment behavior. It contended that this incongruity demonstrated Carpenter's intent to mislead Benistar's clients into depositing their real estate proceeds with a supposedly safe intermediary so that he could leverage the funds into a substantial profit for himself through risky options trading. To prove this agenda, the prosecution sought to introduce extensive evidence regarding Carpenter's investment behavior, relying chiefly on testimony from his brokers at Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber.</p>\n<p>Carpenter's counsel objected to such evidence before its introduction and throughout the trial, arguing that testimony regarding Carpenter's trading strategy and losses was both irrelevant to establishing his state of mind at the time he obtained client funds and also highly prejudicial. The court denied counsel's motions in limine and his repeated objections, ruling that the brokers could testify as to factual matters for the limited purpose of allowing the jury to \"consider[] the historical fact of the kind of trading that was done so the jury can decide . . . whether [Carpenter] had the requisite criminal state of mind\" when investors were assured that their funds would be kept safe. The court also determined that, because no foundation had been laid to treat them as experts, these witnesses could not provide opinion testimony. In addition, the court repeatedly expressed its concern that such evidence not be used to distract the jurors from the elements of the charged offenses of mail and wire fraud. These witnesses's testimony dominated three of the ten days of Carpenter's trial.</p>\n<p>During its closing and rebuttal arguments,<sup>[3]</sup> the government emphasized that the riskiness of Carpenter's trading strategy conflicted with the purposes for which Benistar's clients entrusted their money to Carpenter's management. In making this argument, the government embellished its description of Carpenter's trading strategy with gambling metaphors and terminology intended to show Carpenter's recklessness.</p>\n<p>A jury convicted Carpenter on all counts. Shortly thereafter, Carpenter filed motions for a new trial under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 33(b)(2) and for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29(c), each raising several grounds. The district court granted the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> motion for a new trial, ruling that the government's repeated use of gambling metaphors during its closing arguments \"may [] have induced a verdict based on the jury's moral disapproval of the `gambling'\" rather than on the jury's conclusion that Carpenter had committed mail and wire fraud. <i>United States v. Carpenter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2446247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2446247/united-states-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 102 (D.Mass.2005). The court denied the motion for acquittal and subsequently denied Carpenter's motion for reconsideration. The government appealed the new trial ruling pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3731<sup>[4]</sup> and Carpenter filed a cross-appeal, arguing that the court wrongly decided his motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. The Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p>The government contends that the district court abused its discretion in granting the motion for a new trial because: (1) it did not apply plain error review despite Carpenter's failure to object to the government's use of gambling metaphors until after the jury delivered its verdict; (2) the government's references to gambling were not improper under any standard; and (3) even if the gambling references were improper, they did not amount to a \"miscarriage of justice,\" warranting a new trial. <i>England v.

We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p>1. Preservation of Carpenter's Objection</p>\n<p>The government argues that because Carpenter did not contemporaneously object to the government's use of gambling metaphors during its closing arguments, the district court should have reviewed the motion for a new trial based on those arguments for plain error.<sup>[5]</sup> Although the government pressed this same plain error argument before the district court, the court did not expressly address the argument in its opinion ordering a new trial. Nevertheless, as we shall explain, the court's opinion can only be read as an implicit determination that Carpenter preserved his objection to the closing arguments.</p>\n<p>The government concedes that Carpenter moved in limine and made several trial objections to the introduction of testimony related to Carpenter's investment strategy and losses. However, the government argues that these objections were insufficiently specific, and that they addressed only the <i>admission</i> of evidence and not the manner in which the government could <i>argue from</i> that evidence during its closing and rebuttal.</p>\n<p>Historically, when a party's motion in limine to exclude evidence had been denied, the party's failure to renew the objection at trial was considered \"fatal.\" <i>E.g., </i><i>United States v. Vest,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503754\"><a href=\"/opinion/503754/united-states-v-george-h-vest/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span>, 1325 (1st Cir.1988). However, Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a) was amended in 2000 to read, in pertinent part: \"[o]nce the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.\" The accompanying commentary explains that \"[w]hen the ruling is definitive, a renewed objection or offer of proof at the time the evidence is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> to be offered is more a formalism than a necessity.\" Fed.R.Evid. 103 advisory committee's note, 2000 Amendment. In applying this rule, we must pay particular attention to the question whether the trial court made \"definitive\" rulings on the motion in limine. <i>Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200534\"><a href=\"/opinion/200534/crowe-v-bolduc/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 133-34 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Carpenter repeatedly objected to the introduction of evidence regarding his trading strategy and losses, arguing that it was irrelevant and overly prejudicial because it distracted the jury's attention from whether he intended to defraud Benistar's clients at the time their funds were solicited, and focused their attention instead on the sagacity of his investment strategy. Indeed, before the trial even began, Carpenter moved in limine to preclude the testimony of the Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber brokers based on irrelevance and undue prejudice. He also argued that, because they had not been identified as expert witnesses, the brokers should not be allowed to give any evaluative opinions about his trading strategy.</p>\n<p>The court found Carpenter's arguments somewhat persuasive, ruling on the motion in limine that the \"jury may take account of what kind of trading was done in evaluating whether there was a culpable state of mind. . . . but evaluative opinions about the nature of the trading from people who have not been identified as [expert] witnesses will not be permitted.\" In addition, the court stated that \"it would be appropriate to caution the jury in [its] instructions to stay on the elements of the offenses that are charged and not imagine other wrongs.\" The court added: \"[w]hen we've seen all the evidence, we'll have a clearer idea of what to do on that subject.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the court's preliminary ruling on his objection to the brokers' testimony, Carpenter continued to object to that testimony to assure the preservation of his objection. For instance, at the end of the first day of broker testimony, Carpenter's counsel stated: \"I just want to preserve my objection because I don't know if I preserved [it] adequately in terms of all the testimony that came in. . . . [I]t's the same issue, but I didn't want to stand up every time.\" The court responded: \"I think your objection is preserved.\"</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the Merrill Lynch brokers' testimony, Carpenter filed a motion for mistrial, arguing that he had been \"irretrievably prejudiced in front of the jury by the [testimony of the] Merrill Lynch witnesses that he was an aggressive speculator[,] river boat gambler.\" The court denied Carpenter's motion for a mistrial, explaining: \"I adhere to the ruling that permitted the admission of the evidence in advance. I understand the point. We'll deal with it at some additional occasions.\" When Carpenter's counsel asked for a \"running objection in line with the motion [for a mistrial]. . . . So I don't have to stand up,\" the court responded: \"You're covered under Rule 103.\" The recognition of a continuing objection could not be clearer.</p>\n<p>After Carpenter received that assurance, the government presented two expert witnesses who testified regarding Carpenter's investment strategy. In a motion in limine seeking to preclude the testimony of the second expert, Marc Allaire, Carpenter argued: \"the jury has already heard sufficient evidence regarding the rudiments of options investments. . . . Any further testimony by Allaire on this issue would simply be cumulative, unhelpful and a waste of time.\" Although the court rejected the motion in a ruling from the bench, it reiterated its concern for</p>\n<blockquote>making sure that the jury at the appropriate time is focused on the elements of the offense and what needs to be proved. And I agree that to some degree this is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> all relevant as to state of mind, but I'm concerned that the more the wisdom of the trading strategy gets debated, the more the jury will think that has greater significance than maybe it does in their deliberations. . . . I want to keep this focused on whether there was an intent to deceive or specific intent to defraud.</blockquote>\n<p>Carpenter's counsel persisted, stating: \"I'm not going to belabor the point, your Honor. . . . I would just preserve the issue.\" The court responded: \"Okay. All right.\" After Allaire's testimony, the court heard a final day of testimony focused primarily on establishing the authenticity of the actual mail and wire transfers of funds from Benistar's clients into the Benistar account. The parties then presented their closing arguments the next day.</p>\n<p>Thus, the trial court devoted considerable attention to the contested evidence throughout the trial, fielding repeated objections and stressing its concern that the government limit its use of the evidence to illuminating Carpenter's intent. Placed in this context, we find unpersuasive the government's attempt to distinguish between the introduction of the evidence covered by Carpenter's objections at trial and the prosecution's arguments from that evidence, to which Carpenter did not specifically object before jury deliberations. We look in vain for any indication that the government drew this distinction in its written submission to the district court in opposition to Carpenter's motion for a new trial. More importantly, even if this distinction was discernible in the government's opposition, the district court was entitled to reject it and conclude that Carpenter's continuing objections to the admission of evidence about his investment strategy and losses applied as well to the government's closing arguments based upon that evidence.<sup>[6]</sup> Hence we reject the government's argument that the district court erred in failing to apply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> plain error review to the government's new trial motion.</p>\n<p>The dissent disagrees with this conclusion, asserting that the district court had to apply the plain error standard to the defendant's motion for a new trial because Carpenter failed to preserve his objection to the government's use of gambling metaphors in its closing arguments. This assertion reflects the dissent's unstated premise that appellate review of the trial court's preservation determination is de novo. That is not the law. Instead, the appellate court should defer to such a preservation ruling by the district court. The preservation requirement has two components: alerting a trial judge to a party's objection to a ruling or to the admission of evidence and adequately explaining the basis for that objection. <i>See </i><i>Estate of Keatinge v. Biddle,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2002). Thus advised, the trial judge can decide what course of action to take to assure, so far as possible, the legal correctness of the trial proceedings. <i>Id.</i> Faced with post-trial arguments debating whether an objection to evidence or arguments was adequately preserved, it is certainly the trial judge who is in the best position to decide if she sufficiently understood that an objection had been made and the grounds for it. Given that reality, the appellate court should defer to the trial court's preservation ruling.<sup>[7]</sup> The dissent rejects such deference in favor of a de novo standard of review which fails to account for the trial court's superior position to determine whether it has been properly apprised of an objection.</p>\n<p>In addition, contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, there is no rule that preserved objections to the admission of evidence cannot also cover closing arguments based upon that testimony. Here, in evaluating defendant's demand for a new trial on the basis of gambling metaphors in the government's closing arguments, the district court could reasonably conclude that the defendant's strenuous objections to the evidence on trading strategy and losses embraced the gambling metaphors that characterized that evidence in such provocative terms in the government's closing arguments.</p>\n<p>The dissent cites unfairness to the government in the district court's new trial ruling. Specifically, the dissent speculates that \"had there been a cognizable objection here, the government would likely not have to retry the case, and the considerable burdens of a retrial would not be placed upon witnesses and alleged victims.\" Once again the dissent refuses to acknowledge the superior position of the district court to determine, from its vantage, that the defendant had already registered a cognizable objection to the government's use of gambling metaphors through its repeated objections to the evidence underlying those metaphors.</p>\n<p>However, there was always the risk for the government that the court, in the context of a post-trial motion for a new trial, would reconsider the appropriateness of its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> handling of the evidence and arguments on trading strategy and financial losses. That risk emphasizes why there is no unfairness to the government in the court's decision to award a new trial. As we have already noted, after one of its rulings admitting evidence on trading strategy and losses, the court stated that \"it would be appropriate to caution the jury in [its] instructions to stay on the elements of the offenses that are charged and not imagine other wrongs.\" The court expressed similar concerns on other occasions about the potential for the unfairly prejudicial impact of this evidence on the jury. Yet, as we explain more fully in the next section of the opinion, the government ignored the court's concerns about the limited relevance of the trading strategy and financial losses evidence. Instead of engaging in a straightforward explanation of the relevance of that evidence to the defendant's criminal intent, the government used provocative gambling metaphors to characterize that evidence. This calculated decision by the government increased the risk that the court, in evaluating a post-trial motion for a new trial, would conclude that this provocative treatment of the potentially unfairly prejudicial evidence made this prejudice real and required a new trial in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p>The government cannot claim surprise in such a ruling. When it resorted to the gambling metaphors in its closing arguments, the government made its own gamble that the court, despite its uneasiness about the potential prejudicial impact of the evidence of trading strategy and financial losses on the jury, would not conclude, in evaluating the inevitable motion for a new trial, that the government had gone too far with its arguments. There is no unfairness to the government if it has now lost that gamble.</p>\n<p>2. Propriety of Gambling Metaphors in Closing</p>\n<p>We must now decide if the district court was correct in ruling that the government had gone too far with the many gambling references during its closing arguments. Although we employ the deferential abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the district court's ultimate determination that the prosecution's inflammatory statements warrant a new trial, we must review de novo the prior question of whether the comments themselves were improper. <i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769364\"><a href=\"/opinion/769364/united-states-v-jose-ramon-hernandez-united-states-of-america-v-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2000) (reviewing de novo whether prosecutor's statements during closing arguments were improper because they relied on evidence related to activities outside the scope of the alleged conspiracy to prove a criminal association); <i>United States v. Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195723\"><a href=\"/opinion/195723/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span>, 1337-38 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying de novo review to determine the propriety of prosecutor's comments during closing arguments that the defense had failed to produce evidence regarding an alleged \"frame up\"); <i>United States v. Glantz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482473\"><a href=\"/opinion/482473/united-states-v-ronald-h-glantz-and-anthony-j-bucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 320-21 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1987) (acknowledging that a de novo standard of review applies to the legal question of whether the prosecutor's arguments were proper, but determining that the court need not decide propriety where it finds that the grant of a new trial on the basis of such arguments was an abuse of discretion even if the arguments were improper).</p>\n<p>The district court acknowledged that the \"gambling characterizations were not, as a matter of the narrative of the government's case, wholly inapt,\" 405 F.Supp.2d at 101. However, it found that the \"repeated references to gambling were intended to, and did, inflame the jury's passions against the defendant,\" <i>id.</i> We agree.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> In assessing whether the use of particular language is improper, we look beyond the technical accuracy of a phrase and consider such factors as the \"threat of unfair prejudice, frequency of use, and alternative means of description.\" <i>United States v. Felton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791236\"><a href=\"/opinion/791236/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-leo-v-felton-erica/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.2005). The prosecution's use of gambling language was extensive. The district court counted eighteen instances in which the government used some permutation of the word \"gamble,\" along with numerous references to other gambling terms. 405 F.Supp.2d at 101. The government referred to gambling in its morally freighted gaming sense, with provocative references to \"cashing in chips,\" \"doubling down\" and \"river boat gambler.\" In a particularly dramatic example, the prosecution intoned:</p>\n<blockquote>Any reasonable person with or without investment experience and knowledge would have said it's time to cash in my chips and go home. Not Dan Carpenter. He kept on playing. . . . The self-professed river boat gambler pushes on until the losses mount and mount and mount.</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, we are most concerned that the government would use such provocative language in the face of the court's repeated caution that the evidence upon which the gambling terminology was based should not be used to distract the jury from its focus on Carpenter's state of mind when he obtained his clients' funds. We cannot ignore this important context in evaluating the choices the prosecution made when it crafted its closing arguments.</p>\n<p>While we agree that \"a criminal defendant is not entitled `to a prosecutorial summing-up confined to platitudes and euphemisms,'\" <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 159 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting <i>Palmariello v. Sup't of MCI Norfolk,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522154\"><a href=\"/opinion/522154/edward-palmariello-v-superintendent-of-mci-norfolk/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span>, 494 (1st Cir.1989)), we must also ensure that \"while a prosecutor `may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones,'\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 977 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>Berger v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1314</span></span> (1935)). Because the government repeatedly referred to gambling in a pejorative sense in its closing arguments, despite the district court's explicit warning against distracting the jurors from the elements of the crimes charged, we agree with the district court that the prosecutor's gambling arguments were improper.</p>\n<p>3. Grant of a New Trial</p>\n<p>Before granting a new trial based on a prosecutor's improper comments in a closing argument, a court must \"determin[e] `whether [those comments] ha[ve] so poisoned the well that a new trial is required,'\" <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202591\"><a href=\"/opinion/202591/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span>, 398 (1st Cir.2007). In so doing, the court considers such factors as: (1) the extent of the improper remarks, (2) the context, (3) the likely effect of any curative instructions given by the judge, and (4) the weight of the evidence against the defendant. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792073\"><a href=\"/opinion/792073/united-states-v-angel-casas-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2005)). However, these factors are not exhaustive; they are meant merely to guide the court's inquiry into whether the prosecutor's improper comments have undermined the fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p>In assessing the extent to which the improper arguments affected the outcome of the trial, the district court focused on the frequency with which the gambling references were made, their \"persistently pejorative\" nature and their \"tendency to lead the jury away from the charges in the indictment by inviting them to blame Carpenter because he was a gambler, or because he lost the exchangors' money, rather <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> than because he had committed mail or wire fraud.\" 405 F.Supp.2d at 102.</p>\n<p>The court also emphasized the context in which those comments were made, noting that it had admitted the evidence from which these gambling metaphors were drawn for a \"limited purpose,\" and observing that \"this evidence was introduced in the latter stages of the government's case, close in time to the closing arguments. As the arguments were made, this evidence likely remained vivid in the jurors' memories.\" <i>Id.</i> Placed in this context, the court concluded: \"Condemning Carpenter for `gambling,' as the prosecutors persisted in doing, was an appeal to instincts of moral disapprobation about recklessness, waste, and perhaps even theft.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>After highlighting the improper nature of the government's arguments, the court related those arguments to the overall strength of the government's case:</p>\n<blockquote>though sufficient to withstand a motion for judgment of acquittal, the case was not so strong that it can confidently be said that the repeated `gambling' references had no illegitimate effect on the jury's assessment of the evidence. On what was perhaps the crucial issue, the jury would certainly have been warranted in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that Carpenter acted with intent to defraud, but a contrary conclusion also would have been rationally possible on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 103. The court concluded: \"Because it cannot be said with confidence that the government's improper closing arguments did not taint the verdict, the verdict cannot be allowed to stand.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We afford the district court substantial deference in such an assessment, reflecting the trial judge's familiarity with the case. The \"trial judge `has listened to the tone of the argument as it was delivered and has observed the apparent reaction of the jurors. In short, he is far more \"conversant with the factors relevant to the determination\" than any reviewing court can possibly be.'\" <i>Glantz,</i> 810 F.2d at 320 n. 2 (quoting <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109773\"><a href=\"/opinion/109773/arizona-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 514, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109773\"><a href=\"/opinion/109773/arizona-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span> (1978)). We find no basis for concluding that the district court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>B. The Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n<p>In his cross-appeal, Carpenter contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government failed to present sufficient evidence on the mail and wire fraud charges to permit a reasonable jury to convict him. Before we may reach the merits of Carpenter's cross-appeal, we face the threshold question of our jurisdiction. Carpenter urges us to assert jurisdiction over his cross-appeal under the so-called \"collateral order\" doctrine, in order to protect his right to be free from double jeopardy and as a matter of judicial economy.</p>\n<p>Although 28 U.S.C. § 1291 specifies that our jurisdiction extends only to appeals from \"final decisions of the district courts,\" the Supreme Court, in <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, 546, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There, the Court relied upon the finality of the district court's action  there being \"no further steps that can be taken in the District Court to avoid the trial the defendant maintains is barred by the Fifth Amendment's guarantee,\" <i>id.</i>  and the fact that the \"elements of [his double jeopardy] claim are completely independent of his guilt or innocence,\" <i>id.</i> at 660, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court also emphasized that \"even if the accused is acquitted, or, if convicted, has his conviction ultimately reversed on double jeopardy grounds, he has still been forced to endure a trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prohibit.\" <i>Id.</i> at 662, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In addition, he claims that our refusal to hear a sufficiency claim in these circumstances would burden defendants with a \"Hobson's choice\" between: (1) waiving the right to move for a new trial in order to ensure appellate review of a sufficiency claim; and (2) moving for a new trial and losing the right to appeal a sufficiency claim arising from the first trial. Carpenter further argues that considerations of judicial economy support our review because we must review the trial record in any event to assess the government's appeal of the new trial ruling.</p>\n<p>While Carpenter's assertions have practical appeal, they run afoul of most of the relevant precedent.

As his original jeopardy has not yet ended, there is no double jeopardy to avoid.</p>\n<p>It is a short step from <i>Porter</i> to the case before us, where the trial court itself ordered a new trial on the basis of legal error. <i>Porter</i> teaches that a defendant has no double jeopardy claim when his conviction has been vacated for legal error. <i>Id.</i> at 24. That is what occurred here. Although Carpenter's conviction was undone by the trial court rather than on appeal, this is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p>Without a viable double jeopardy claim, Carpenter has no double jeopardy \"right\" that he cannot effectively vindicate if he is not permitted to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in this appeal. Hence he cannot meet the third criterion of the collateral order doctrine.<sup>[9]</sup> The Second and Seventh Circuits have similarly found no jurisdiction to hear cross-appeals of a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under the collateral order doctrine where the district court's order of a new trial vacated the underlying conviction. <i>United States v.

Only <i>Greene</i> supports his position, and we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p>In <i>Greene,</i> after the trial court ordered a new trial and denied Greene's motion for acquittal, the government appealed the new trial grant. Greene cross-appealed, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> arguing that the district court erred when it rejected his claim that the evidence was not sufficient to convict him and that to require another trial would violate his right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense. <i>Greene,</i> 834 F.2d at 87. While acknowledging that the \"denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal prior to entry of a judgment or sentence [is] normally not reviewable in the Court of Appeals,\" the court determined that it \"would be unfair to apply such a rule in the present proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 89.</p>\n<p>Neither <i>Wood</i> nor <i>Gotti</i> reaches such a result. In <i>Wood,</i> the trial court ordered a new trial and denied Wood's motion for judgment of acquittal. The government appealed the grant of a new trial, and Wood cross-appealed the denial of his motion for acquittal contending that double jeopardy barred his retrial. <i>Wood,</i> 958 F.2d at 965. Wood's double jeopardy claim was also based on the insufficiency of the evidence at his trial. <i>Id.</i> at 967. On the government's motion to dismiss the cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Tenth Circuit denied the motion and asserted jurisdiction over Wood's cross-appeal because it found a \"colorable double jeopardy claim\" giving rise to jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine, <i>United States v. Wood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572762\"><a href=\"/opinion/572762/united-states-of-america-and-cross-appellee-v-paul-d-wood-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 643 (10th Cir.1991). However, in its subsequent ruling, it affirmed the new trial grant and ultimately ruled that the double jeopardy claim lacked merit for many of the same reasons that we cite here, given that the district court had granted defendant's motion for a new trial, <i>Wood</i> 958 F.2d at 970-71.<sup>[10]</sup> Notably, the court further concluded that its \"resolution of the merits of Defendant's claims makes future double jeopardy claims like Defendant's non-colorable and, therefore, subject to summary dismissal when asserted on an interlocutory appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 972 n. 12.</p>\n<p>In <i>Gotti,</i> there was no motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence in his first trial. Indeed, the jury had not convicted Gotti on any of the charges against him. <i>Gotti,</i> 451 F.3d at 135. Instead, it acquitted him on one charge and divided on others, resulting in the declaration of a mistrial on those charges. <i>Id.</i> The district court then denied Gotti's post-trial motion to bar a retrial on two of the counts on double jeopardy grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 135-36. Gotti then sought interlocutory review of that double jeopardy ruling itself. <i>Id.</i> at 136. There was no appeal by the government of any trial court ruling and no cross-appeal by Gotti trying to challenge a trial court ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal. Citing <i>Abney,</i> the Court of Appeals analogized the trial court's double jeopardy ruling to a court's denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss counts of an indictment on double jeopardy grounds and concluded that this ruling met the requirements of the collateral order doctrine. <i>Id.</i> In addressing the merits of Gotti's double jeopardy argument, it rejected that argument on very different grounds than those Carpenter raises in asking us to hear his cross-appeal.<sup>[11]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 136-37. Moreover, as noted, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> the \"merits\" issue on appeal in <i>Gotti</i> was the trial court's double jeopardy ruling itself. Here the \"merits\" issue in the cross-appeal is the trial court's ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence. <i>Gotti</i> has scant relevance to our application of the collateral order doctrine to that sufficiency ruling.</p>\n<p>To the extent that Carpenter makes a judicial efficiency argument that is independent of the collateral order doctrine, we reject that argument as well. Carpenter's primary efficiency argument  that granting appellate jurisdiction over the cross-appeal makes \"practical sense\" because \"given the government's appeal, the Court will now conduct a thorough review of the trial record in this case\"  is beside the point. We are not at liberty to go beyond the established criteria of the collateral order doctrine to create new exceptions to the finality requirements of § 1291. Indeed, Carpenter's argument that we should consider his sufficiency claim as we consider the government's appeal runs directly counter to the first criterion of the collateral order doctrine, which requires that the collateral issue (here, sufficiency) be \"conceptually distinct\" from the issues in the underlying action. <i>Kouri-Perez,</i> 187 F.3d at 5. Of course, Carpenter's sufficiency arguments are deeply entwined with the merits of the mail and wire fraud charges that constitute the underlying action.</p>\n<p>In addition, even if we could recognize such an efficiency exception, any efficiency gains promised by Carpenter are illusory because there is little comparability between the review that we have had to conduct in our deferential review of the new trial grant and the de novo review we would have to conduct to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence. In his sufficiency challenge, Carpenter raises arguments of causation, intent, constructive amendment of the indictment, reliance upon a theory of liability based on omission, good faith as an absolute defense, and venue. We have not had to address any of those issues in order to evaluate the district court's new trial ruling.</p>\n<p>Carpenter raises a second argument under the banner of efficiency. If we deny appellate jurisdiction over his cross-appeal, he says, and reverse the district court's grant of a new trial, we will have to conduct a second review of the trial record at a later point in time after Carpenter is sentenced and files a direct appeal. Thus, Carpenter contends, granting jurisdiction to hear the cross-appeal at this point will \"conserve judicial resources.\" However, the subsequent direct review of the issues now raised in the cross-appeal would not represent a \"second review\" of the trial record because, as we have already noted, our review of the new trial ruling has not required us to review the portions of the record relevant to the issues raised in the cross-appeal. More importantly, Carpenter's second efficiency argument betrays his frontal challenge to the most basic precepts of the final judgment rule. If we were to reverse the trial court's new trial ruling, there would be no final judgment until Carpenter had been sentenced after a remand. <i>See </i><i>Berman v.

Carpenter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2446247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2446247/united-states-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 102 (D.Mass.2005). The judge found that the government's case was not so strong that it could confidently be said that the repeated gambling references had no illegitimate effect on the verdict. <i>Id.</i> at 103. The court held that because it was possible that the government's closing arguments tainted the jury's verdict, the verdict could not be allowed to stand. In that context, the district court called the government's closing arguments \"improper.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The trial judge implicitly ruled that defendant had sufficiently preserved his objection to the gambling metaphor so that he was not required to take the unusual step of interrupting the government's closing argument. An appellate court is not entitled to second guess that conclusion, which was certainly not an abuse of discretion. The trial judge recognized that there was a point at which the relevance of the large losses produced by risky trading was outweighed by the danger of distracting the jury from focused consideration of the actual charges. That grey zone was never well defined throughout the trial, and its demarcation points were not clarified before the closing arguments, despite the granting of a continuing objection. Perhaps both sides should have sought clarification before the closing arguments.</p>\n<p>In my view, the real issue is not whether one side acted \"improperly.\" It is the potential effect of this situation on the jury which matters. The experienced trial judge, who sat through the trial and the closing, concluded that the balance had tipped too far within that grey zone and that the interest of justice required a new trial.</p>\n<p>Given that the trial judge lacked confidence that the verdict was based on proper considerations, and given the context in which the trial judge ruled, an appellate judge cannot say that the trial judge's conclusion was unreasonable. Indeed, the decision to grant a new trial does not even approach being an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This appeal centers around two issues: (1) whether in ruling upon defendant's motion for a new trial, the district court had to apply the plain error standard in Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b)  a question turning on whether defendant failed to lodge a timely objection within Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b)<sup>[12]</sup> sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> to preserve the error for which the new trial was granted, namely, the government's use of gambling metaphors in its closing, which the court felt may have induced a verdict based on the jury's moral disapproval of gambling; and (2) whether the U.S. Attorney's gambling rhetoric went so far as to exceed fair comment and, in the event plain error review was required, to meet that standard.</p>\n<p>In answer to (1), I believe the district court was required to apply the plain error standard in ruling on the new trial motion. As for issue (2), it would be premature for us to pass judgment on whether the gambling rhetoric could be found to amount to plain error, that question being one for the district court in the first instance. I would vacate and remand while retaining jurisdiction so as to be able to decide in the future  should plain error be found below  whether that finding exceeds the district court's considerable discretion in the matter.</p>\n<p>1. Adequacy of Objection</p>\n<p>Judicial review is limited to \"the notably ungenerous plain error standard\" whenever \"a defendant defaults on [the] obligation [to protect his own interests] by failing to make a contemporaneous objection to questionable comments in the prosecution's closing argument.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 977 (1st Cir.1995). Nothing in the language of Fed.R.Crim.P. 51 and 52, or in binding precedent, suggests that some different rule applies where a district court, as here, (rather than a court of appeals) is asked, post-verdict, to grant a new trial based on an alleged inappropriate closing.</p>\n<p>One of the principal purposes of the contemporaneous objection requirement is to alert the district judge so that she or he can take on-the-spot curative steps, by instructing the jury to disregard the prejudicial rhetoric or in some other way minimizing the harm, thus obviating the trouble and expense of a new trial. As this court stated in <i>Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 972,</p>\n<blockquote>[C]alling a looming error to the trial court's attention affords an opportunity to correct the problem before irreparable harm occurs. Then, too, the raise-or-waive rule . . . precludes a party from making a tactical decision to refrain from objecting, and subsequently, should the case turn sour, assigning error. . . . <sup>[13]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Here, there is simply no indication that the gambling metaphors used by the government in its closing, and the purported moral disapproval they might engender in jurors, were concerns ever contemporaneously called to the district court's attention, either during the closing when those references were actually being made or, right after, before the case went to the jury, when the district judge could still have taken steps to cure whatever prejudice the rhetorical metaphors may have caused in the minds of the jurors. The basis for the grant of a new trial was not the brokers' testimony, to admission of which earlier, unsuccessful, objections were lodged and on which earlier objections <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> the majority now relies in its opinion, but the colorful gambling metaphors employed by the government in closing argument which were later said by the district court to have carried the risk of inflaming the jurors' moral disapproval.</p>\n<p>Had defendant contemporaneously objected to this allegedly inflammatory rhetoric either during or after the closing, before the case went to the jury, the court could have instructed the jury to disregard it and explained to the jurors why the analogies were prejudicial and overblown, thus obviating the extreme and costly remedy of a new trial. Even had the defense attorney hesitated to interrupt the government's argument, there was ample time afterwards to have lodged an objection and for the court to have taken corrective steps. Indeed, following the court's closing jury instructions, when counsel were invited to submit their objections to the charge, defense counsel took that opportunity to protest certain parts of the government's closing but never mentioned these supposedly outrageous misstatements. Nor did the judge say anything to counsel or the jury about them during or after the closing, as one might have expected had the earlier evidentiary objections relied on by my colleagues actually functioned so as to call to the judge's mind that the defense was now objecting to the closing's gambling rhetoric<sup>[14]</sup>  or even that the rhetoric violated the court's own earlier cautionary admonition against overemphasizing certain matters. The court's silence on the subject at the crucial moments strongly suggests that whatever the earlier objections accomplished, they did not accomplish what Rule 51(b) seeks  namely to alert the court contemporaneously, when corrective action by the court still remains possible, that the defense is then and there objecting to certain language being used in the government's oratory.</p>\n<p>The purpose of Rule 51(b), in other words, is to put the court on <i>actual,</i> not just constructive, notice that a party protests a particular alleged defect  here, the closing gambling rhetoric  so that, inter alia, appropriate corrective action can be taken immediately if warranted. Rule 51(b) is not well served by resting the finding of an adequate objection upon an elaborate chain of appellate inferences going back to non-contemporaneous objections made earlier for a different purpose. Rule 51(b) requires, and ordinarily receives, a practical interpretation, consistent with its purpose to alert the court in a meaningful way so that it can act before too late.</p>\n<p>It is overwhelmingly evident from the record that no one, prior to the verdict, got <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> the message, including the judge, that the defense was protesting the government's rhetorical gambling analogies  analogies which the district court later said may have elicited the jurors' moral disapproval based upon their distaste for gambling. Without having been contemporaneously alerted by a Rule 51(b) objection, the district court was obliged, when it ruled on defendant's post-verdict motion for a new trial, to employ plain error review under Rule 52(b). The government made this point when arguing the motion,<sup>[15]</sup> but the district court did not address it at all. As my colleagues agree, it now seems the court, in granting a new trial, used the ordinary review standard (although Carpenter argues otherwise in his appellate brief).</p>\n<p>My colleagues contend we should leave it to the district court, in these circumstances, whether a sufficient objection was lodged to preserve the closing gambling metaphor issue. Here, the judge, in passing on the defendants' new trial motion, made no express finding that an objection had been made, nor did he rule at all on the government's contention that an objection had not been preserved by the defense on the use of the gambling metaphors during the closing. But my colleagues would infer from the district court's complete silence that it must have found a sufficient defense objection, and they say they must defer to the district court on that and all related matters.</p>\n<p>My difficulty with the above is that it treats the raise-or-waive rule as if it were only of concern to the district court  to protect it, for instance, against being \"sandbagged\" in the common situation where a defendant appeals to this court from an adverse ruling of the trial judge concerning some matter never called to the court's attention below. My colleagues' viewpoint would hold that where the district judge is satisfied  as presumably he was here  with whatever steps defendant took, <i>or did not take,</i> to preserve an objection, that should end the matter.</p>\n<p>But I believe such deference is extreme. The raise-or-waive rule, it is true, exists to protect the trial judge, but it also serves other important goals. As already discussed, it serves the purpose of judicial economy, forcing all concerned, including the court itself, to face issues  such as the challenged rhetoric used by the government here  at a time when corrective action can still be taken short of a costly new trial. The opportunity for correction afforded by a timely objection, as well as the penalty of plain error review for failure to object, also promote essential fairness to the other party, here the government  and not only to the government alone, but to those who must bear the burdens of a new trial, such as the victims of defendant's alleged misconduct and other witnesses. Had there been a meaningful, contemporaneous objection here, the government would likely not have to retry the case, saving both monetary costs and the added burdens on many others.</p>\n<p>This is not to question the district court's discretion, were there merely a question of disputed evidence over the making of a sufficient contemporaneous <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> objection, to resolve that dispute. But, here, the only arguably pertinent objections in the record  those made earlier under Fed.R.Evid. 103 to the admission of certain testimony  fell flagrantly short of meeting the requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 51(b) for valid objections to the closing's gambling rhetoric. And the record contains nothing except silence to suggest that the district court, when granting a new trial, ever determined that an adequate objection  or any objection  had been made. Rules 51 and 52 are binding procedural rules to which courts must adhere. The wide discretion very properly given to the trial judge does not include the discretion to ignore or simply bypass the raise-or-waive rule.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>I would add that even the plain error standard of Rule 52(b) still allows a court, in appropriate circumstances, when faced with a strong sense that an injustice has or may have occurred, to allow a new trial even though a timely objection was not lodged  and our review of such a decision would and should take into account the trial judge's firsthand \"feel\" for a case tried in his presence. Nevertheless, plain error review remains a considerably tougher, higher, standard than ordinary review. Given defendant's default, the government was entitled to the reassurance that the latter standard was being applied in this case, since the question of whether or not the gambling rhetoric used went too far, and its likely unfair impact on jurors, is a close one as to which the standard of review used could well have a decisive effect on whether or not to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p>2. Whether Gambling Rhetoric Was Excessive</p>\n<p>As said, I believe that this appeal should be remanded to the district court with instructions to reconsider its new trial ruling under the correct plain error standard. A ruling by us at this juncture would be premature, since the district court's judgment based on its first-hand knowledge and feel is an essential prelude to whatever action this court takes. We would necessarily grant considerable deference to whatever view the district court takes on whether what occurred at the trial met the high standard of plain error. This does not mean there are no limits to our deference, nor that appellate review will thereafter be forbidden. A district court would not have carte blanche discretion to order a new trial simply because, to take a purely hypothetical example, it deemed the U.S. Attorney's closing remarks to be too eloquent and defense counsel's closing much less so  even if the trial court believed the difference had been decisive to the case's outcome. There are, moreover, some arguments an attorney may make which will be so entirely relevant as to be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> privileged as a matter of law, just as there are others which the district court may determine dispositively as going too far.</p>\n<p>Here, the government argues that its gambling analogy was so apt that it fell within the safety zone and that, in any event, the analogy was not so extreme as to amount to plain error. This is not an easy issue, and it is one as to which the district court's ruling, along with its reasons, one way or another, will not only be helpful but essential. I would, therefore, remand for a new ruling on the new trial motion, one explicitly based on the plain error standard, which, in these circumstances, the district court was, in my view, legally obliged by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to apply. It is most unlikely the district court believed it was applying that standard when it ruled previously, and, given especially the closeness of the grounds for granting a new trial, I believe the government is entitled to a ruling expressly based upon the correct legal standard. Given the high hurdle of plain error review, a remand is no mere waste of judicial time. To the contrary, it could be critical to the outcome, and it is also a necessary act of fairness to the government and those persons and interests the government serves, given the defendant's failure to have preserved a proper objection.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Indeed, testimony indicated that, in the fourth quarter of 1999, Carpenter was \"up\" roughly $800,000.00, providing Carpenter with slightly more than $600,000.00 in profit.</p>\n<p>[2]  Paley provided extensive documentary evidence and deposition testimony to the government as it built its case. He also testified as a witness against Carpenter at trial. No criminal charges were brought against Paley in connection with this wire and mail fraud scheme.</p>\n<p>[3]  The closing and rebuttal arguments will be referred to hereinafter as \"the closing arguments.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  We note that the government's ability to appeal the district court's grant of a motion for a new trial is a relatively recent phenomenon, arising from the 1984 amendments to § 3731.</p>\n<p>[5]  The parties agree that the court did not apply plain error review.</p>\n<p>[6]  The dissent argues that we should not infer that the court ruled that defendant preserved his objection to the government's use of gambling metaphors in its closing arguments and that the plain error standard did not apply to the request for a new trial based on the closing arguments. However, the government explicitly argued for plain error review in its written opposition to Carpenter's motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial. The court issued a lengthy published decision on these motions, addressing each of Carpenter's arguments in detail, including the argument that the court entitled in its decision \"Prejudicial Inflammatory Argument\" (a reference to the gambling metaphors). In explaining its decision to grant a new trial because of this inflammatory argument, the court explained its decision in harmless error terms: \"Because it cannot be said with confidence that the government's improper closing arguments did not taint the verdict, the verdict cannot be allowed to stand.\" This language echoes other decisions on new trial motions that have evaluated whether the interest of justice requires a new trial under the harmless error standard. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792073\"><a href=\"/opinion/792073/united-states-v-angel-casas-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2005) (assessing whether trial error affected the trial's outcome); <i>United States v.

Given the thoroughness of the court's decision, including its explanation of the reasons for granting a new trial, we can only conclude that the court did not apply plain error review because it consciously rejected the government's plain error argument. Moreover, even if the district court had satisfied the dissent's insistence on an explicit ruling rejecting the plain error standard, the dissent would still deem that ruling a legal error. The dissent's central concern is not the adequacy of the court's explanation of its decision to apply the harmless error standard. Instead, the dissent argues that the district court could not apply the harmless error standard because, as a matter of law, the defendant did not preserve his objection to the government's use of gambling metaphors in its closing arguments. As we explain more fully, that argument misperceives the standard of review that an appellate court should apply to a trial court's preservation ruling.</p>\n<p>[7]  We routinely defer to the trial court when it is better positioned to assess the relevant factors for making particular kinds of decisions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Castro v. Chicago Hous.

That is, Carpenter did not file a motion in the trial court arguing that his retrial was barred by the principle of double jeopardy. Indeed, there was no basis for any such argument. Hence, we are not reviewing a double jeopardy ruling by the trial court, or a claim that such a double jeopardy ruling itself falls within the collateral order doctrine. Instead, Carpenter uses double jeopardy principles to address the third element of the collateral order doctrine-namely, that the failure to address the collateral issue on appeal (here, sufficiency of the evidence) will infringe rights which appellant could not effectively vindicate in an appeal after final judgment in the case. Carpenter argues that, if the trial judge ruled incorrectly on his motion for judgment of acquittal, and if we failed to assess that possibility by hearing his cross-appeal, his retrial would infringe his double jeopardy right. However, as we have now shown, Carpenter misconstrues the nature of his double jeopardy right, and hence he cannot meet the third criterion of the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p>[10]  For example, the court emphasized that Wood could not be at risk of double jeopardy where his original jeopardy had not yet ended. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579274\"><a href=\"/opinion/579274/united-states-of-america-and-cross-appellee-v-paul-d-wood-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span> at 970 (explaining that \"[a] guilty verdict by a jury which is set aside by the district court on a motion by the defendant does not terminate jeopardy.\").</p>\n<p>[11]  Gotti argued that because the jury could not unanimously agree that the government had proved two predicate racketeering acts with which he was charged, he was entitled to acquittal on the RICO charges against him and could not be retried on any of the charges. The court rejected Gotti's \"extraordinary argument,\" noting that \"[o]n this reasoning, juror disagreement as to the proof of a predicate act could <i>never</i> result in a hung jury,\" and that \"[t]he government is permitted to retry a defendant following a mistrial resulting from a hung jury.\" 451 F.3d at 136-37.</p>\n<p>[12]  Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b) provides,\n</p>\n<p>A party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court  when the court ruling or order is made or sought  of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party's objection to the court's action and the grounds for that objection. If a party does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence of an objection does not later prejudice that party. A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 103.</p>\n<p>[13]  In a later civil case, this court has said,\n</p>\n<p>We have made it transparently clear that the raise-or-waive rule can neither be ignored nor brushed aside as a \"pettifogging technicality or a trap for the indolent.\" <i>Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707518\"><a href=\"/opinion/707518/national-association-of-social-workers-v-john-b-harwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 627 (1st Cir.1995). Rather, it is a prudential rule \"founded upon important considerations of fairness, judicial economy, and practical wisdom.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>Muniz v. Rovira,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4 (2004).</p>\n<p>[14]  Judge Lipez states that the court's earlier response, \"You're covered under Rule 103,\" to Carpenter's request for a running objection to admission of the Merrill Lynch brokers' testimony (described by defense counsel as portraying Carpenter as \"an aggressive speculator[,] river boat gambler\") was a clear recognition by the court of a continuing objection that served later as an adequate objection under Rule 51(b) to the government's repeated rhetorical use, in its closing, of the gambling analogies. But Rule 103 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is an evidentiary rule. <i>See</i> Rule 51(b) (\"A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 103\"). Appropriately, the objections in question all related to the court's admission in evidence of the brokers' testimony, which emphasized the risky nature of option trading but did not invoke repetitive gambling metaphors nor raise the question of whether analogizing defendant's conduct to gambling would captivate the disapproval of jurors based on their moral disapproval of gambling. A new trial was not granted because the court decided it had erred in admitting the brokers' testimony but because of the inflammatory nature of the gambling figure used in the closing, with its peculiar tendency to invoke moral disapprobation.</p>\n<p>[15]  Judge Lipez, in the majority opinion, speaks of \"looking in vain\" for any indication that the government ever argued that objection to the closing's gambling metaphors had not been preserved. In fact, the government noted (under the heading that its \"closing and rebuttal fell within the bounds of proper argument\") that most of Carpenter's points had not been preserved, and listed the few that had been, making clear its belief that the defense's objection to the use of gambling metaphors was one that had not been preserved and was subject to plain error review.</p>\n<p>[16]  Of course, one might imagine special circumstances where a defense objection might not be needed to preserve an issue. For instance, the judge might, when the offending conduct occurs, give voice, sua sponte, on the record, to his own objection, which might in some circumstances relieve the defense of the need to object separately. But it seems unwarranted to presume such a special exception here, given the judge's complete silence at and after the closing, especially as, when the gambling rhetoric was later called to the judge's attention, he granted the extraordinary relief of a new trial. Surely, one would suppose, if the judge had at all considered the questionable character of the rhetoric at the time it was delivered, or then had believed the defense had objected to it at some earlier time, he would not have remained silent in the face of such knowledge, allowing events to proceed and the jury to remain uninstructed as to the improprieties that had occurred. To infer on this record and in the face of judicial silence, the preserving of a sufficient objection, seems to me tantamount to saying that Rule 51(b) and its companion, 52(b), need not be observed by the trial judge unless he or she cares to do so.</p>\n\n</div>",
