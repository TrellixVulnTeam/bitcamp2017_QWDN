Devaney, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Civil Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Peter D.\nKeisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Carol\nFederighi, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                            August 10, 2007\n\f          PER CURIAM.    Cherif Boukhtouchen petitions for review of\n\na decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirming an\n\norder of removal against him.       We deny the petition.\n\n          We recount the facts as presented in petitioner's oral\n\ntestimony and in the documentation he submitted in support of his\n\napplication for asylum.    Petitioner is a citizen of Algeria and a\n\nmember of that country's Berber minority.        In his application for\n\nasylum1 and withholding of removal, petitioner described several\n\nevents in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, during the period of military\n\nrule in Algeria, when he faced harassment, such as being briefly\n\narrested following a political demonstration, police yelling at him\n\nfor speaking in the Kabylian language of the Berber minority, and\n\nonce having his car shot at by unknown assailants.\n\n          In the late 1980s, petitioner worked toward achieving\n\nsome autonomy for the Berber regions of Algeria.              He wrote and\n\ndistributed a pamphlet arguing for federalism, and attempted,\n\nunsuccessfully,   to   start   a   political   party   with   the   goal   of\n\nimplementing federalism, multiparty democracy, and minority rights.\n\nBy 1993, petitioner felt that the government was beginning to crack\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Immigration Judge denied petitioner's application for\nasylum because he had not sought asylum within one year of arriving\nin the United States nor established that an exception to that\ndeadline applied. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) & (D). The BIA\naffirmed that decision. Petitioner does not seek review of that\ndecision, nor the decision to deny him protection under the\nConvention Against Torture. He petitions for review only of the\ndecision to deny him withholding of removal.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fdown on opposition.         Although the government did not confront him,\n\nhe feared that his ethnic and political background, his writings,\n\nand   his    frequent      trips   abroad    would      make   him   a   target   for\n\ngovernment pressure, and he left the country.                  From 1993 to 1999 he\n\nlived in Niger and Benin, with a brief return to Algeria in 1998.\n\n              In   1999,    petitioner      came   to   the    United    States   and\n\noverstayed his visa. On or about January 10, 2003, the Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (\"INS\")2 filed a Notice to Appear, and\n\non September 4, 2003, petitioner filed his application for asylum\n\nand withholding of removal.              On March 22, 2005, an Immigration\n\nJudge denied his application, a decision that was affirmed by the\n\nBIA on October 16, 2006.\n\n              We review the decision of the BIA as the final agency\n\norder.      Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 199 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nGeorcely v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"When the\n\nBIA issues its own opinion, we review the Board's decision and not\n\nthe immigration judge's.\").          We review the factual determinations\n\nof the BIA under the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard.\n\nOrelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 2006).                    Under this\n\nstandard, we will uphold a decision of the BIA if \"'supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\n\n\n      2\n      On March 1, 2003, the functions of the INS were transferred\nto the Department of Homeland Security.

Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4) (1988)).                \"This means that\n\nthe   BIA's    determination    must        stand   unless     'any   reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\"\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n             To qualify for withholding of removal, the petitioner\n\nmust show that his \"life or freedom would be threatened in [the\n\nremoval] country because of [his] race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"                8\n\nU.S.C.   §    1231(b)(3)(A).     \"As    a    general   rule,    withholding   is\n\nmandatory if an alien 'establish[es] that it is more likely than\n\nnot that [he] would be subject to persecution on one of the\n\nspecified grounds.'\"      INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 419\n\n(1999) (quoting INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30 (1984)); accord\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372-73 (1st Cir. 2003) (applying\n\n\"more likely than not\" standard).            This is a tougher standard than\n\nthat for asylum, which requires only a \"well-founded fear of\n\npersecution.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 569 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999) (contrasting \"well-founded\n\nfear of persecution\" with \"clear probability of persecution\").\n\n             \"If the applicant is determined to have suffered past\n\npersecution in the proposed country of removal [based on one of the\n\nprotected grounds] it shall be presumed that the applicant's life\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\for freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of\n\nremoval     on    the   basis    of        the    original          claim.\"     8       C.F.R.    §\n\n1208.16(b)(1)(i).             \"To     qualify          as    persecution,           a    person's\n\nexperience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even\n\nbasic suffering.\"         Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n             The BIA found that petitioner had not presented evidence\n\nsufficient to show past persecution. The few events of harassment,\n\nthe BIA found, did not rise to the level of persecution, and\n\nneither     the   petitioner         nor    his       family    members       had       ever   been\n\ntargeted by the Algerian government.                        As the petitioner states in\n\nhis   application       for     asylum,          \"I    never    personally          experienced\n\nsignificant harm or mistreatment.                     I did experience some forms of\n\nthreats that were generalized and regarded as ordinary in Algeria\n\nat the time when they occurred.\"                      In his petition for review, the\n\npetitioner does not give an argument, nor do we see one, against\n\nthe BIA's conclusion that he did not suffer past persecution, and\n\nthus we turn to the issue of future persecution.                         See United States\n\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n             Having failed to establish past persecution, petitioner\n\nis    not   entitled      to     a     presumption             of     future    persecution.\n\nPalma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2005).                                   He\n\nbears the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that he\n\nwill be persecuted based on a statutorily protected ground if he is\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fdeported to Algeria.   Chahid Hayek v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 501, 508\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          The   petitioner's   claim,   essentially,   is   that   as   a\n\npolitically active member of the Berber minority, he is likely to\n\nface persecution if he returns to Algeria.     He points to evidence\n\nof mistreatment of Berbers, including violence and death following\n\nprotests and riots by members of the Berber minority, and the\n\ndetention and beating of a prominent Berber activist, Belaid\n\nAbrika.   The BIA found that this was not sufficient to show\n\npersecution, because the petitioner was not able to show that he\n\nwould be specifically targeted by the Algerian government, and\n\nbecause he was not affiliated with Abrika other than through their\n\nshared ethnicity.   The BIA further noted that the petitioner was\n\nunable to support his claim with evidence of persecution of family\n\nmembers in Algeria.3\n\n          Petitioner's argument in his petition for review is not\n\nso much that substantial evidence compels an alternative result,\n\n\n     3\n      Petitioner argues that it was inappropriate to look to the\ntreatment of his family members in determining the likelihood of\npetitioner being persecuted if he returns to Algeria, because his\nsituation is not identical to theirs. This is mistaken; relatives'\nsituations in the home country, while not conclusive, are certainly\nrelevant.    See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 573 (\"Without some\nexplanation, the fact that close relatives continue to live\npeacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that\npersecution awaits his return\"); In re A-E-—, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1157,\n1160 (BIA 1998) (en banc) (holding that the reasonableness of an\nalien's fear of persecution is reduced when his family remains in\nhis native country unharmed for a long period of time after his\ndeparture).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fbut rather that the BIA did not sufficiently consider all the\n\nevidence or sufficiently explain its conclusion.4   To support his\n\nargument, petitioner looks to the case of Halo v. Gonzales, 419\n\nF.3d 15 (1st Cir. 2005), in which we stated that \"[w]e may remand\n\n. . . if the BIA's opinion fails to 'state with sufficient\n\nparticularity and clarity the reasons'\" for its conclusion. Id. at\n\n18 (quoting Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 46 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\nHowever, as Halo and Gailius make clear, our concern is with\n\nsituations where the BIA has made a perfunctory decision to deny\n\nrelief in cases where the administrative record could support the\n\nopposite conclusion.    Halo, 419 F.3d at 19 (stating that the\n\nevidence presented a strong argument for persecution, and the BIA\n\ndid not give its reasons for concluding the opposite); Gailius, 147\n\nF.3d at 46 (stating that \"the documentary evidence alone, if\n\ngenuine, could well cause us to question the conclusion that there\n\nis no well-founded fear of persecution\"); accord Xu v. Gonzales,\n\n424 F.3d 45, 46 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"We held in Halo that, where the\n\nadministrative record of a case could easily be thought to compel\n\na conclusion contrary to the one reached by the BIA, it is\n\n\n\n     4\n      Petitioner also argues that the BIA \"applied an incorrect\nlegal standard\" when it noted that there is no evidence that\npetitioner is currently being targeted by the Algerian government.\nThis is without merit. Whether or not a person is currently being\ntargeted by a government is certainly relevant to the question of\nwhether he is likely to be persecuted in the future, and the BIA\nwas entitled to rely on that evidence. See, e.g., Chahid Hayek,\n445 F.3d at 508.\n\n                               -7-\n\fincumbent on the agency to give some reasoned explanation for the\n\nconclusion it reached.\"); Sulaiman v. Gonzales, 429 F.3d 347, 350\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (holding that the agency \"is obligated to offer\n\nmore explanation when the record suggests strong arguments for the\n\npetitioner that [the agency] has not considered\") (citing Halo, 419\n\nF.3d at 15, and Gailius, 147 F.3d at 34).\n\n          Here, the BIA addressed petitioner's main arguments: his\n\nprevious detentions by the government; his membership in the Berber\n\nminority; his political activism; and the arrest and detention of\n\na prominent Berber activist.5        The BIA also stated that it reviewed\n\nthe documentary evidence, which included reports on human rights in\n\nAlgeria from the U.S. Department of State and other governments,\n\nand found that they did not support a claim of future persecution.\n\nGiven that the record does not \"suggest[] strong arguments for the\n\npetitioner,\"    id.,   the   BIA's    treatment   of   his   arguments   was\n\nsufficient.    Furthermore, we are not compelled, on this record, to\n\nconclude that it is more likely than not that petitioner will be\n\npersecuted if he returns to Algeria.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Petitioner argues that the BIA \"inappropriately provided no\nweight\" to the evidence of Abrika's treatment.        This is also\nwithout merit.   The BIA considered the evidence and determined\nthat, because petitioner was not affiliated with Abrika's party and\ndid not approach Abrika's prominence, Abrika's treatment did not\nsupport petitioner's claim that he would be treated in a similar\nmanner. We see no error in this.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f",

We deny the petition.</p>\n<p>We recount the facts as presented in petitioner's oral testimony and in the documentation he submitted in support of his application for asylum. Petitioner is a citizen of Algeria and a member of that country's Berber minority. In his application for asylum<sup>[1]</sup> and withholding of removal, petitioner described several events in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, during the period of military rule in Algeria, when he faced harassment, such as being briefly arrested following a political demonstration, police yelling at him for speaking in the Kabylian language of the Berber minority, and once having his car shot at by unknown assailants.</p>\n<p>In the late 1980s, petitioner worked toward achieving some autonomy for the Berber regions of Algeria.

By 1993, petitioner felt that the government was beginning to crack down on opposition. Although the government did not confront him, he feared that his ethnic and political background, his writings, and his frequent trips abroad would make him a target for government pressure, and he left the country. From 1993 to 1999 he lived in Niger and Benin, with a brief return to Algeria in 1998.</p>\n<p>In 1999, petitioner came to the United States and overstayed his visa. On or about January 10, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")<sup>[2]</sup> filed a Notice to Appear, and on September 4, 2003, petitioner filed his application for asylum and withholding of removal.

Given that the record does not \"suggest[ ] strong arguments for the petitioner,\" <i>id.,</i> the BIA's treatment of his arguments was sufficient.

We deny the petition.</p>\n<p>We recount the facts as presented in petitioner's oral testimony and in the documentation he submitted in support of his application for asylum. Petitioner is a citizen of Algeria and a member of that country's Berber minority. In his application for asylum<sup>[1]</sup> and withholding of removal, petitioner described several events in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, during the period of military rule in Algeria, when he faced harassment, such as being briefly arrested following a political demonstration, police yelling at him for speaking in the Kabylian language of the Berber minority, and once having his car shot at by unknown assailants.</p>\n<p>In the late 1980s, petitioner worked toward achieving some autonomy for the Berber regions of Algeria. He wrote and distributed a pamphlet arguing for federalism, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to start a political party with the goal of implementing federalism, multiparty democracy, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> and minority rights. By 1993, petitioner felt that the government was beginning to crack down on opposition. Although the government did not confront him, he feared that his ethnic and political background, his writings, and his frequent trips abroad would make him a target for government pressure, and he left the country. From 1993 to 1999 he lived in Niger and Benin, with a brief return to Algeria in 1998.</p>\n<p>In 1999, petitioner came to the United States and overstayed his visa. On or about January 10, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")<sup>[2]</sup> filed a Notice to Appear, and on September 4, 2003, petitioner filed his application for asylum and withholding of removal. On March 22, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied his application, a decision that was affirmed by the BIA on October 16, 2006.</p>\n<p>We review the decision of the BIA as the final agency order. <i>Mukamusoni v.

This is a tougher standard than that for asylum, which requires only a \"well-founded fear of persecution.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>see </i><i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 569 n. 3 (1st Cir.1999) (contrasting \"well-founded fear of persecution\" with \"clear probability of persecution\").</p>\n<p>\"If the applicant is determined to have suffered past persecution in the proposed country of removal [based on one of the protected grounds] it shall be presumed that the applicant's life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the original claim.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i). \"To qualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\" <i>Nelson v.

The few events of harassment, the BIA found, did not rise to the level of persecution, and neither the petitioner nor his family members had ever been targeted by the Algerian government. As the petitioner states in his application for asylum, \"I never personally experienced significant harm or mistreatment. I did experience some forms of threats that were generalized and regarded as ordinary in Algeria at the time when they occurred.\" In his petition for review, the petitioner does not give an argument, nor do we see one, against the BIA's conclusion that he did not suffer past persecution, and thus we turn to the issue of future persecution. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>Having failed to establish past persecution, petitioner is not entitled to a presumption of future persecution. <i>Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201897\"><a href=\"/opinion/201897/palma-mazariegos-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2005). He bears the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted based on a statutorily protected ground if he is deported to Algeria. <i>Chahid Hayek v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202159\"><a href=\"/opinion/202159/hayek-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The petitioner's claim, essentially, is that as a politically active member of the Berber minority, he is likely to face persecution if he returns to Algeria. He points to evidence of mistreatment of Berbers, including violence and death following protests and riots by members of the Berber minority, and the detention and beating of a prominent Berber activist, Belaid Abrika. The BIA found that this was not sufficient to show persecution, because the petitioner was not able to show that he would be specifically targeted by the Algerian government, and because he was not affiliated with Abrika other than through their shared ethnicity. The BIA further noted that the petitioner was unable to support his claim with evidence of persecution of family members in Algeria.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Petitioner's argument in his petition for review is not so much that substantial evidence compels an alternative result, but rather that the BIA did not sufficiently consider all the evidence or sufficiently explain its conclusion.<sup>[4]</sup> To support his argument, petitioner looks to the case of <i>Halo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201773\"><a href=\"/opinion/201773/halo-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2005), in which we stated that \"[w]e may remand . . . if the BIA's opinion fails to `state with sufficient particularity and clarity the reasons'\" for its conclusion. <i>Id.</i> at 18 (quoting <i>Gailius v.
