Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Timothy Ganun, Jr., on brief pro se.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         November 7, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.      Timothy J. Ganun, Jr. pled guilty to one\n\ncount of conspiracy to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine\n\nbase, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and 846.\n\nHe was sentenced to the applicable statutory mandatory minimum\n\nsentence of ten years.       See id. § 841(b)(1)(A).        In January 2008,\n\nGanun filed a form motion requesting appointment of counsel to\n\nrepresent him in pursuing a motion for reduction of sentence\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and the Sentencing Commission's\n\nretroactive amendment of the crack cocaine guideline (Amendments\n\n706, 711 and 713).     The district court summarily denied a sentence\n\nreduction on the ground that \"because the sentence is required by\n\nstatute, the Court may not reduce the sentence pursuant to the\n\nrecent amendments.\"        Ganun appeals from that ruling on the ground\n\nthat it was prematurely entered before he had the opportunity to\n\nfile the motion and memorandum in support, and that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying the reduction.\n\n            Having carefully examined the record and considered the\n\nparties'    briefs,   we    conclude     that   the   district   court   lacked\n\nauthority    to   grant    Ganun   his    requested    sentencing   reduction\n\npursuant to § 3582(c)(2) and the crack cocaine amendment to the\n\nSentencing Guidelines because he was serving a statutory mandatory\n\nminimum sentence.         Section 3582(c)(2) \"confers no power on the\n\ndistrict court to reduce a minimum sentence mandated by statute.\"\n\nUnited States v. Dimeo, 28 F.3d 240, 241 (1st Cir. 1994).                Ganun's\n\n                                       -2-\n\fargument that the concerns that prompted the Sentencing Commission\n\nto lower the base offense level for cocaine base offenses should\n\nalso result in reductions in the statutory mandatory minimums\n\noverlooks the fact that the Sentencing Commission is without power\n\nto determine statutory minimums.\n\n          Independently, we also note that the application notes to\n\nthe applicable policy statements provide that \"a reduction in the\n\ndefendant's term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if:\n\n. . . the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the\n\ndefendant's applicable guideline range because of the operation of\n\n[a] . . . statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum\n\nterm of imprisonment).\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10, comment. (n. 1(A)).\n\n          We need not decide whether Ganun's argument that he was\n\ndenied due process by the district court's premature denial of his\n\nmotion has any merit.   Having considered all of Ganun's arguments\n\nin support of such reduction, it is clear that Ganun was not\n\nprejudiced by his inability to present those arguments to the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
