This is an appeal from the district court’s\n\naffirmance of a bankruptcy court’s order that approved a settlement\n\nbetween the bankruptcy trustee and certain defendants against whom\n\nthe debtor, 110 Beaver Street Partnership, had asserted legal\n\nclaims.      The bankruptcy court approved the settlement, and the\n\ndistrict court affirmed.             For the reasons set forth in this\n\nopinion, we now affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n                                       A.\n\n             In   October    1994,   the    110    Beaver   Street   Trust   (the\n\n“Trust”) purchased land and buildings located at 110 Beaver Street\n\nin Waltham, Massachusetts (the “Property”) from George W. Moore,\n\nInc. (“Moore”).        To finance the purchase, the Trust executed a\n\npromissory note payable to Moore in the amount of $850,000.                  The\n\nnote   was   secured    by   a   mortgage     on   the   Property.     The   sole\n\nbeneficiary of the Trust is an entity called the 110 Beaver Street\n\nPartnership (the “Partnership”).               Martha Jean Eakin and Paul\n\nMcGinty (the “Partners”) are partners in the Partnership; Jeff\n\nBuster is the former trustee of the Trust.               We shall refer to Ms.\n\nEakin, Mr. McGinty and Mr. Buster collectively as the “Principals.”\n\n             In April 1996, the Duffy Brothers Management Company,\n\nowner of a parcel of land next to the Property, filed a proposal\n\nwith the Waltham Conservation Commission to build a shopping mall\n\non its parcel.      The Trust opposed the proposal on the ground that\n\n\n                                      - 3 -\n\fthe project, if approved, would cause harm to the Property in\n\nviolation of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 131, § 40.       In July 1996, the Commission nevertheless\n\napproved the Duffy Brothers proposal.         The Trust then filed an\n\nappeal with the Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”).\n\nThis appeal had the practical effect of postponing any development\n\nuntil the Trust had exhausted its right to both administrative and\n\njudicial review.1\n\n          On   November    13,   1996,    Moore   commenced   foreclosure\n\nproceedings on the 110 Beaver Street property.            Thirteen days\n\nlater, Moore sold and assigned the mortgage and the promissory note\n\nto Goffe, Inc., a company controlled by the Duffys.2          In response\n\n\n     1\n       In August 1996, Mr. Buster and three other individuals also\nfiled an action in Superior Court in which they alleged that the\nCommission’s approval of the project violated the state’s open\nmeeting law.\n     2\n        The facts found by the Superior Court, in the proceeding\nthat shall be discussed later in the text, provide a more complete\npicture of this episode.    They reveal that in August 1996, the\nDuffys learned that the 110 Beaver Street property was “in\ntrouble.” Buster v. George W. Moore, Inc., No. 97-637-F, 2000 WL\n576363, at *8 (Mass. Super. Apr. 28, 2000). They investigated the\nsituation, discovering that Mr. Buster was in default on Moore’s\nnote and that real estate taxes had not been paid for roughly two\nyears. Id. At the end of October, one of the Duffys called Moore\nfor the first time to discuss purchasing the note.      Id. at *9.\nLater, the Duffys began to insist that Moore commence foreclosure\nproceedings before the sale. Id. Moore was resistant, but the\ndisagreement became moot when the parties learned that Sherburne,\nPowers & Needham, the law firm that had represented both the Duffys\nand Moore but was not representing either of them in this\ntransaction, had already filed a complaint to foreclose the\nmortgage in Moore’s name. Id. at *10. The Superior Court found\nthat the Duffys had paid the law firm to prepare the foreclosure\n\n                                  - 4 -\n\fto the foreclosure, Mr. Buster filed an action in Massachusetts\n\nSuperior Court, to which the other Principals were later joined.\n\nThe complaint in this action alleged two sets of claims relevant to\n\nthis    discussion.   It   alleged    that   Goffe   had   undertaken   the\n\nforeclosure to prevent the Principals from exercising their First\n\nAmendment right to petition by prosecuting the DEP appeal (the\n\n“Civil Rights Claims”), and that Moore had refused to remove its\n\ninventory from the Property in a timely manner (the “Storage\n\nClaims”).    See R.App. 791-801.\n\n            Once they had taken ownership of the mortgage through\n\nGoffe, the Duffys met with the Principals and offered to allow them\n\nto deed the Property in lieu of foreclosure or to negotiate a\n\nforbearance.    Buster v. George W. Moore, Inc., No. 97-637-F, 2000\n\nWL 576363, at *11 (Mass. Super. Apr. 28, 2000).              Both options\n\nrequired, however, that the Principals withdraw the DEP appeal and\n\ndismiss the Superior Court action.         The Principals refused.\n\n                                     B.\n\n            Goffe then scheduled a foreclosure sale for February\n\n1997.    However, on the day of the sale, the Partnership filed a\n\npetition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of\n\n\n\npapers, but that the actual filing was the result of a\nmiscommunication within the firm.    Id.   In any case, once the\npapers had been filed, nothing stood in the way of the transfer of\nthe note to Goffe.    The Superior Court found that the Duffys’s\nprimary motivation in this purchase was to induce Mr. Buster to\nwithdraw his DEP appeal and open meeting law action. Id. at *14.\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fMassachusetts, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy\n\nCode.       The commencement of this bankruptcy action triggered the\n\nautomatic-stay provision of 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), barring Goffe from\n\nproceeding with the foreclosure sale.\n\n              In   April   1997,   Goffe,    hoping   to   foreclose   on   the\n\nProperty, moved for relief from the automatic stay.                 It argued\n\nthat, because there was no equity in the Property and the Property\n\nwas not necessary for effective reorganization, relief from the\n\nstay was justified under 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(2).3            R.App. 57.   Goffe\n\nalso argued that the Partnership had violated zoning, environmental\n\nand   building     regulations,    which     threatened    the   insurability,\n\nmarketability and value of the collateral, justifying relief under\n\n11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(1).        R.App. 61, 64.\n\n              On May 30, the Duffys met with the Mayor of Waltham and\n\ntold him that they believed that there were safety violations at\n\n110 Beaver Street.         Subsequently, a comprehensive fire inspection\n\n\n\n        3\n            11 U.S.C. § 362(d) provides in pertinent part:\n\n     On request of a party in interest and after notice and a\nhearing, the court shall grant relief from the stay provided under\nsubsection (a) of this section, such as by terminating, annulling,\nmodifying, or conditioning such stay--\n     (1) for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an\ninterest in property of such party in interest;\n     (2) with respect to a stay of an act against property under\nsubsection (a) of this section, if--\n          (A) the debtor does not have an equity in such property;\nand\n          (B) such property is not necessary to an effective\nreorganization[.]\n\n                                     - 6 -\n\fof   the   Property   took   place.     The   violations     uncovered   were\n\nsufficiently serious to result in the issuance of a cease and\n\ndesist order.   Buster, 2000 WL 576363, at *14; In re 110 Beaver St.\n\nP’ship, 244 B.R. 185, 189 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2000); R.App. 256.4\n\n            Shortly thereafter, the Partnership and Goffe entered\n\ninto an agreement that would have put in place a Goffe-supported\n\nreorganization plan, released the Principals from any liability on\n\nthe note and released all claims against Goffe.            Mr. Buster signed\n\nthe agreement on behalf of the Principals, but then subsequently\n\nopposed it.    Mr. Buster claimed that the agreement was “done under\n\nduress,” R.App. 383, and involved risk, R.App. 384.            When asked by\n\nthe court to identify the aspect of the agreement with which he\n\ndisagreed, Mr. Buster responded only that “it says something to the\n\ntune of ‘not then perform.’”          R.App. 385.    The bankruptcy court\n\ncharacterized    these   complaints    as   “vague   and   unintelligible.”\n\nR.App. 428.     The court approved the settlement and appointed a\n\nbankruptcy trustee, Harold B. Murphy, who filed a motion to compel\n\nthe Principals to comply with the agreement.                R.App. 820-24.\n\n            At a hearing on the motion in October 1997, the court\n\nsaid, “I think the settlement is a good one,” but nevertheless\n\nconcluded that, in light of Mr. Buster’s “absolutely outrageous”\n\n\n      4\n       The Superior Court found that the primary motivation of the\nDuffys in their meeting with the Mayor was to “trigger\nadministrative action by the City of Waltham that would strengthen\ntheir argument for lifting the automatic stay[.]” Buster, 2000 WL\n576363, at *17.\n\n                                  - 7 -\n\fconduct, the cost of enforcing the settlement would be too high to\n\njustify.       Rather than enforce the settlement, the court opted to\n\ngrant Goffe relief from the automatic stay.                 The court stated that\n\nGoffe    was    entitled     to   such    relief    “because   it    [Goffe]   lacks\n\nadequate protection due to the fact that the property has been the\n\nsubject of cease and desist orders by the City of Waltham which\n\nimpair, potentially seriously hurt Goffe’s ability to realize on\n\nits collateral.”        R.App. 451-52.        The court’s action allowed the\n\nforeclosure sale to proceed, and the Property was sold in 1998 for\n\napproximately $1.3 million.5             Also in 1998, the bankruptcy case was\n\nconverted to Chapter 7.           Beaver St., 244 B.R. at 190.\n\n               After   his   appointment,         Trustee   Murphy   took   up   the\n\nprosecution of the Superior Court action as well as two additional\n\nclaims:    that Goffe had violated the automatic stay by informing\n\nWaltham officials of code violations at the Property (the “Stay\n\nClaim”), and that Goffe had overstated its claim to the foreclosure\n\nproceeds (the “Proceeds Claim”).\n\n               The year 2000 was a significant year for this case.\n\nFirst, the bankruptcy court declined to approve a settlement that\n\nTrustee Murphy had reached with Goffe. The court believed that the\n\ncompromise was deficient with respect to all of the claims that we\n\nhave mentioned. Second, following that rejection, the Civil Rights\n\n\n\n     5\n        The Partnership had claimed that the fair market value of\nthe Property was $1.1 million. R.App. 364.\n\n                                          - 8 -\n\fClaims were tried in Superior Court, and the court found no\n\nliability.      Buster, 2000 WL 576363, at *27.            The decision was\n\naffirmed subsequently by the Supreme Judicial Court.               Buster v.\n\nGeorge   W.   Moore,   Inc.,    783    N.E.2d    399,    403   (Mass.   2003).\n\nConsequently, only the Stay Claim, the Storage Claim and the\n\nProceeds Claim remained unresolved.\n\n                                       C.\n\n           After quite a few years with little significant activity,\n\nin 2007, Trustee Murphy and Goffe negotiated the settlement at\n\nissue in this case.     The settlement resolved the Proceeds Claim,\n\nthe Storage Claim and the Stay Claim--the last remaining assets of\n\nthe estate--for $125,000.        R.App. 598, 612-16.           The Principals\n\nopposed the settlement.    They also asked the bankruptcy court for\n\nan evidentiary hearing on their allegation that Goffe had violated\n\nthe automatic stay.\n\n           The court held that the settlement was reasonable.              It\n\nnoted that, in light of the resolution of the Civil Rights Claims\n\nby the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and the accrual of\n\nincreased legal fees, the Partnership’s prospects of recovering\n\nsignificantly more than the settlement amount were “at best, very\n\nuncertain.”       Appellant’s    Addendum       13-14.     Also,    continued\n\nlitigation would involve additional expense, inconvenience and\n\ndelay.    Id.     The court also pointed out that no non-insider\n\ncreditor had voiced any objection to the settlement, and that\n\n\n                                      - 9 -\n\f“where[, as here,] administrative and non-insider unsecured claims\n\nwill not be fully paid, the interest of the principals is more\n\nattenuated      than   before[.]”     Id.         The    court   also   denied   the\n\nPrincipals’ motion for an evidentiary hearing on the Stay Claim,\n\nsaying that “[l]itigating causes of action to assess their outcome\n\nis precisely what the reasonableness standard for compromises is\n\nintended to avoid.”       Id.\n\n              Following the approval of the settlement, the Principals\n\nfiled    an   adversary   complaint     in    the       bankruptcy   court.      The\n\ncomplaint outlined the Duffys’s alleged violation of the automatic\n\nstay and attempted to frame the Duffys’s conduct as a broader\n\npattern of wrongdoing: fraudulently obtaining the cease and desist\n\norders, failing to disclose their conduct to the court and using\n\nthe orders to argue impairment of their collateral, “when the real\n\nreason   they    wanted   to    foreclose    was     to    silence   the   Debtor’s\n\npetitioning activities[.]”          R.App. 1209-10.         The complaint sought\n\nmonetary      sanctions   pursuant    to     11    U.S.C.    §   105(a)    and   the\n\nbankruptcy court’s inherent powers.               The district court dismissed\n\nthis complaint sua sponte.          R.App. 1172.\n\n     The Principals appealed the bankruptcy court’s decisions to\n\nthe district court, which affirmed. They now appeal to this court.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\fII.   DISCUSSION\n\n                                     A.\n\n              In reviewing this matter, we must confine ourselves to\n\nthe same record that was before the bankruptcy court and the\n\ndistrict court.      We review independently the bankruptcy court’s\n\ndetermination.     With respect to that court’s findings of fact, we\n\napply   the    clearly   erroneous   standard;   with   respect   to   its\n\nconclusions of law, we apply a de novo standard of review.        Jeffrey\n\nv. Desmond, 70 F.3d 183, 185 (1st Cir. 1995).              Our case law\n\nestablishes that, in deciding whether to accept a compromise\n\nproposal that discharges legal claims held by the debtor, the\n\nbankruptcy court should consider the following factors:\n\n              (i) the probability of success in the litigation\n              being compromised; (ii) the difficulties, if any,\n              to be encountered in the matter of collection;\n              (iii) the complexity of the litigation involved,\n              and the expense, inconvenience and delay attending\n              it; and, (iv) the paramount interest of the\n              creditors   and  a   proper  deference   to  their\n              reasonable views in the premise.\n\n\nId. at 185.     In applying these factors, the trustee is accorded a\n\nsignificant range of discretion in the prudent exercise of business\n\njudgment.      We also must keep in mind the general principle that\n\n“compromises are favored in bankruptcy.”          In re Mailman Steam\n\nCarpet Cleaning Corp., 212 F.3d 632, 635 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).      Consequently, our task is\n\nto determine whether the settlement meets the “lowest point in the\n\n\n                                 - 11 -\n\frange of reasonableness.”           In re Healthco Int’l, 136 F.3d 45, 51\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n              The Principals’s opening brief in this court makes no\n\nfocused argument with respect to the Proceeds Claim and the Storage\n\nClaim.    Accordingly, these issues are waived.                See Playboy Enters.\n\nv. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of Puerto Rico, 906 F.2d 25, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (“An appellant waives any issue which it does not adequately\n\nraise    in   its     initial    brief[.]”).        The   brief     provides     scant\n\ninformation, and it is not our role to make arguments not presented\n\nby the parties at the appropriate time.              Suffice it to say that the\n\nPrincipals would be hard-pressed to show that these claims would\n\nadd value to the estate, given the very significant administrative\n\nexpenses amassed during the course of these bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n              There    is   substantial      reason       to   believe    that     the\n\nPartnership would not prevail on the Stay Claim.                          In In re\n\nMcMullen, 386 F.3d 320, 328 (1st Cir. 2004), we held that, for\n\npublic    policy      reasons,     courts     should      be   circumspect       about\n\nconstruing a “private party’s reporting of wrongful conduct to\n\ngovernmental        regulatory    authorities”       as    a   violation     of    the\n\nautomatic stay.         The Principals seek to distinguish McMullen by\n\nclaiming that it does not apply in cases of bad faith.                      However,\n\neven if the Principals were successful in proving bad faith (and it\n\nis   clear     that    proving     this     point    would     be   a    substantial\n\nundertaking), we have expressed skepticism in both McMullen and In\n\n\n                                      - 12 -\n\fre    Spookyworld,    Inc.,    346      F.3d   1   (1st   Cir.    2003),     that   an\n\nallegation of bad faith makes any difference in the valuation\n\nprocess.      In Spookyworld, for example, we expressed concern that\n\ninquiring into the legitimacy of the regulatory claims would mire\n\nthe bankruptcy courts in “mini-trials of purely state regulatory\n\nissues.”       Id.   at   10   (internal       quotation   marks       and   citation\n\nomitted).       In   McMullen,     we    cited     Spookyworld    in    noting   “the\n\ntenuousness of the arguments for engrafting such a ‘bad faith’\n\nexception . . . noting the emergent rule that bankruptcy courts\n\nshould not inquire into the legitimacy of ongoing administrative\n\nenforcement proceedings in determining whether the police power\n\nexception applies to them.”             386 F.3d at 328 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n              Moreover, even if the Partnership prevailed on this\n\nclaim, it is questionable whether it would be able to collect much\n\nin the way of damages.            See 11 U.S.C. § 362(k)(1);6 Spookyworld,\n\n346 F.3d at 7 (holding that a debtor that is a corporation cannot\n\nsue   under    §   362(h)   for    a    violation    of   the    automatic    stay).\n\nFurthermore, any recovery likely would be offset by the fees and\n\ncosts incurred in pursuing litigation.7\n\n\n       6\n         Before recent amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, the\nrelevant provision appeared as § 362(h).\n       7\n       We also note that it would have been very difficult for the\nPrincipals to argue that this case is controlled by our decision in\nIn re Lloyd, Carr & Co., 617 F.2d 882 (1st Cir. 1980). In Lloyd,\nCarr, we held that “where . . . a settlement rewards a bankrupt for\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\f            The fourth prong of the Jeffrey analysis requires that\n\nthe bankruptcy court recognize “the paramount interest of the\n\ncreditors and a proper deference to their reasonable views in the\n\npremise.”    70 F.3d at 185.    Notably, none of the non-insider\n\ncreditors objected to the settlement, which provided a payment of\n\nthirty-two cents on the dollar to the unsecured creditors. Had the\n\nTrust been required to litigate these claims, there is a good\n\n\n\nhis contumacious refusal to comply with the Bankruptcy Act itself,\nmore is required than a simple showing of marginal benefit. Public\npolicy forbids a settlement of this character without, at least, a\npowerful showing of such potential detriment to the estate that no\nother course is reasonably available.” Id. at 891. The debtor,\nwho was being held on charges of fraud in the sale of stock\noptions, had stashed $1.75 million in banks in Bermuda.         The\nbankruptcy court ordered him to have those funds transferred to an\nAmerican bank and placed under the control of a receiver.       The\ndebtor refused to comply with the court’s order and in fact\nstrenuously resisted attempts in Bermudan courts to have the funds\ntransferred to the United States. After its attempts to obtain the\nmoney by other means were thwarted, the receiver reached a\nsettlement with the debtor. The agreement called for the debtor to\ntransfer $207,000 from Bermuda to the United States. Half of that\nmoney would go to the receiver; the debtor would retain the other\nhalf and would use it to post bail. All of the major creditors\nopposed this proposed settlement. The district court nevertheless\napproved the settlement, but we reversed. We noted that the debtor\nwas required by law to transfer the money even in the absence of\nthe agreement; thus, he provided no consideration for the\nagreement. Id. at 890. We further concluded that the bankruptcy\ncode did not permit the disbursement of funds from the bankruptcy\nestate to allow a debtor to post bail. Id. at 889. We also noted\nthat the compromise had been actively opposed by the major\ncreditors and affirmatively approved by none. Id. at 892. In sum,\nwe held that the agreement was contrary to public policy because\nthe debtor would give up nothing and would get a benefit to which\nhe was not legally entitled.\n     Here, by contrast, the allegations involve alleged wrongdoing\nby a third party and, as we have shown, it may well be that a trier\nof fact would not decide that there was a showing of bad faith.\n\n                               - 14 -\n\fchance that these creditors would have received a great deal less,\n\nassuming there had been some recovery.           In that respect, we give\n\nsubstantial deference to a bankruptcy court’s decision to approve\n\na proposed settlement.\n\n           The Principals, therefore, have not carried their burden\n\nof showing that the bankruptcy court’s determination falls below\n\nthe bottom of the range of reasonableness.         Even if the claims have\n\nmerit, the amount that the Trust might collect is so uncertain as\n\nto make the bankruptcy court’s decision to approve the settlement\n\nreasonable. We have no difficulty in determining that the judgment\n\nof the trustee was well within the range of reasonableness and that\n\nthe bankruptcy court correctly approved the settlement.                    The\n\nstrength     of   the   Partnership’s      remaining   claims   was    indeed\n\nquestionable,     and   the   offer   of    settlement   approved     by   the\n\nbankruptcy court was a very realistic one.\n\n                                      B.\n\n           In its ruling on the motion to reconsider approval of the\n\nsettlement, the bankruptcy court dismissed sua sponte an adversary\n\ncomplaint filed by the Principals.           Its discussion of the matter\n\nwas brief:\n\n           The partners’ rights (including any rights of\n           the 110 Beaver Street Trust) to relief in the\n           adversary proceeding are subject to the terms\n           of the settlement, which was approved before\n           the filing of the adversary proceeding.\n           Moreover, the demands for relief in the\n           adversary proceeding are predicated entirely\n           on rights of the debtor and of the bankruptcy\n\n                                  - 15 -\n\f          estate, which rights have now been settled by\n          the agreement.     Therefore, the adversary\n          proceeding too must be dismissed.\n\nR.App. 1172.\n\n          A sua sponte dismissal “without prior notice to plaintiff\n\nmay be proper in relatively egregious circumstances.”     Martinez-\n\nRivera v. Sanchez Ramos, 498 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).     In such\n\ncases, it is “crystal clear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and\n\nthat amending the complaint would be futile[.]”   Gonzalez-Gonzalez\n\nv. United States, 257 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001).      These cases\n\nhave “incurable defects that are evident from the face of the\n\ncomplaint - e.g., claims based on indisputably bogus legal theories\n\nor delusional factual scenarios.” Green v. Concord Baptist Church,\n\nNo. 08-1977, 2009 WL 580813, at *2 (1st Cir. Mar. 9, 2009) (citing\n\nMartinez-Rivera, 498 F.3d at 7-9).\n\n          When a partnership enters bankruptcy, the partnership’s\n\nclaims become property of the bankruptcy estate, and the partners\n\nmay not bring them.8    Acknowledging this rule, the Principals\n\n\n     8\n        See In re Seven Seas Petroleum, Inc., 522 F.3d 575, 584\n(5th Cir. 2008) (“If a claim belongs to the estate, then the\nbankruptcy trustee has exclusive standing to assert it.”); DiMaio\nFamily Pizza & Luncheonette, Inc. v.

Appellant’s Br. 38.   On the basis of our own review of the\n\ncomplaint, we cannot accept this argument.    The complaint presents\n\na fundamental problem on its face that makes clear the correctness\n\nof the bankruptcy court’s decision.     The complaint simply does not\n\nstate a claim for damages that is separate, as a matter of fact and\n\nlaw, from damage to the Partnership. The Principals’s allegations,\n\nas well as their arguments in their briefs, make clear that\n\nwhatever injury they might be able to show would constitute injury\n\n\n468 F.2d 590, 591 (7th Cir. 1972) (per curiam) (noting that “for\nbankruptcy purposes partnership property is to be distinguished\nfrom property of the individual partners”); Thomasson v.

See St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co.\nv. Labuzan, 579 F.3d 533 (5th Cir. 2009). However, as that case\nmakes clear, the creditor must be able to allege an injury as a\ncreditor from the violation of the automatic stay.      Here, the\nplaintiffs can allege no injury to themselves; they simply allege\nan injury to the partnership estate.\n\n                                    - 18 -\n\f",

The bankruptcy court approved the settlement, and the\n\ndistrict court affirmed.             For the reasons set forth in this\n\nopinion, we now affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n                                       A.\n\n             In   October    1994,   the    110    Beaver   Street   Trust   (the\n\n“Trust”) purchased land and buildings located at 110 Beaver Street\n\nin Waltham, Massachusetts (the “Property”) from George W. Moore,\n\nInc. (“Moore”).        To finance the purchase, the Trust executed a\n\npromissory note payable to Moore in the amount of $850,000.                  The\n\nnote   was   secured    by   a   mortgage     on   the   Property.     The   sole\n\nbeneficiary of the Trust is an entity called the 110 Beaver Street\n\nPartnership (the “Partnership”).               Martha Jean Eakin and Paul\n\nMcGinty (the “Partners”) are partners in the Partnership; Jeff\n\nBuster is the former trustee of the Trust.               We shall refer to Ms.\n\nEakin, Mr. McGinty and Mr. Buster collectively as the “Principals.”\n\n             In April 1996, the Duffy Brothers Management Company,\n\nowner of a parcel of land next to the Property, filed a proposal\n\nwith the Waltham Conservation Commission to build a shopping mall\n\non its parcel.      The Trust opposed the proposal on the ground that\n\n\n                                      - 3 -\n\fthe project, if approved, would cause harm to the Property in\n\nviolation of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 131, § 40.       In July 1996, the Commission nevertheless\n\napproved the Duffy Brothers proposal.         The Trust then filed an\n\nappeal with the Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”).\n\nThis appeal had the practical effect of postponing any development\n\nuntil the Trust had exhausted its right to both administrative and\n\njudicial review.1\n\n          On   November    13,   1996,    Moore   commenced   foreclosure\n\nproceedings on the 110 Beaver Street property.            Thirteen days\n\nlater, Moore sold and assigned the mortgage and the promissory note\n\nto Goffe, Inc., a company controlled by the Duffys.2          In response\n\n\n     1\n       In August 1996, Mr. Buster and three other individuals also\nfiled an action in Superior Court in which they alleged that the\nCommission’s approval of the project violated the state’s open\nmeeting law.\n     2\n        The facts found by the Superior Court, in the proceeding\nthat shall be discussed later in the text, provide a more complete\npicture of this episode.    They reveal that in August 1996, the\nDuffys learned that the 110 Beaver Street property was “in\ntrouble.” Buster v. George W. Moore, Inc., No. 97-637-F, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">576363</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (Mass. Super. Apr. 28, 2000). They investigated the\nsituation, discovering that Mr. Buster was in default on Moore’s\nnote and that real estate taxes had not been paid for roughly two\nyears. Id. At the end of October, one of the Duffys called Moore\nfor the first time to discuss purchasing the note.      Id. at *9.\nLater, the Duffys began to insist that Moore commence foreclosure\nproceedings before the sale. Id. Moore was resistant, but the\ndisagreement became moot when the parties learned that Sherburne,\nPowers & Needham, the law firm that had represented both the Duffys\nand Moore but was not representing either of them in this\ntransaction, had already filed a complaint to foreclose the\nmortgage in Moore’s name. Id. at *10. The Superior Court found\nthat the Duffys had paid the law firm to prepare the foreclosure\n\n                                  - 4 -\n\fto the foreclosure, Mr. Buster filed an action in Massachusetts\n\nSuperior Court, to which the other Principals were later joined.\n\nThe complaint in this action alleged two sets of claims relevant to\n\nthis    discussion.   It   alleged    that   Goffe   had   undertaken   the\n\nforeclosure to prevent the Principals from exercising their First\n\nAmendment right to petition by prosecuting the DEP appeal (the\n\n“Civil Rights Claims”), and that Moore had refused to remove its\n\ninventory from the Property in a timely manner (the “Storage\n\nClaims”).    See R.App. 791-801.\n\n            Once they had taken ownership of the mortgage through\n\nGoffe, the Duffys met with the Principals and offered to allow them\n\nto deed the Property in lieu of foreclosure or to negotiate a\n\nforbearance.

Super. Apr. 28, 2000).              Both options\n\nrequired, however, that the Principals withdraw the DEP appeal and\n\ndismiss the Superior Court action.         The Principals refused.\n\n                                     B.\n\n            Goffe then scheduled a foreclosure sale for February\n\n1997.    However, on the day of the sale, the Partnership filed a\n\npetition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of\n\n\n\npapers, but that the actual filing was the result of a\nmiscommunication within the firm.    Id.   In any case, once the\npapers had been filed, nothing stood in the way of the transfer of\nthe note to Goffe.    The Superior Court found that the Duffys’s\nprimary motivation in this purchase was to induce Mr. Buster to\nwithdraw his DEP appeal and open meeting law action.

The commencement of this bankruptcy action triggered the\n\nautomatic-stay provision of 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), barring Goffe from\n\nproceeding with the foreclosure sale.\n\n              In   April   1997,   Goffe,    hoping   to   foreclose   on   the\n\nProperty, moved for relief from the automatic stay.                 It argued\n\nthat, because there was no equity in the Property and the Property\n\nwas not necessary for effective reorganization, relief from the\n\nstay was justified under 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(2).3            R.App. 57.   Goffe\n\nalso argued that the Partnership had violated zoning, environmental\n\nand   building     regulations,    which     threatened    the   insurability,\n\nmarketability and value of the collateral, justifying relief under\n\n11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(1).        R.App. 61, 64.\n\n              On May 30, the Duffys met with the Mayor of Waltham and\n\ntold him that they believed that there were safety violations at\n\n110 Beaver Street.         Subsequently, a comprehensive fire inspection\n\n\n\n        3\n            11 U.S.C. § 362(d) provides in pertinent part:\n\n     On request of a party in interest and after notice and a\nhearing, the court shall grant relief from the stay provided under\nsubsection (a) of this section, such as by terminating, annulling,\nmodifying, or conditioning such stay--\n     (1) for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an\ninterest in property of such party in interest;\n     (2) with respect to a stay of an act against property under\nsubsection (a) of this section, if--\n          (A) the debtor does not have an equity in such property;\nand\n          (B) such property is not necessary to an effective\nreorganization[.]\n\n                                     - 6 -\n\fof   the   Property   took   place.

Mr. Buster claimed that the agreement was “done under\n\nduress,” R.App. 383, and involved risk, R.App. 384.            When asked by\n\nthe court to identify the aspect of the agreement with which he\n\ndisagreed, Mr. Buster responded only that “it says something to the\n\ntune of ‘not then perform.’”          R.App. 385.    The bankruptcy court\n\ncharacterized    these   complaints    as   “vague   and   unintelligible.”\n\nR.App. 428.     The court approved the settlement and appointed a\n\nbankruptcy trustee, Harold B. Murphy, who filed a motion to compel\n\nthe Principals to comply with the agreement.                R.App. 820-24.\n\n            At a hearing on the motion in October 1997, the court\n\nsaid, “I think the settlement is a good one,” but nevertheless\n\nconcluded that, in light of Mr. Buster’s “absolutely outrageous”\n\n\n      4\n       The Superior Court found that the primary motivation of the\nDuffys in their meeting with the Mayor was to “trigger\nadministrative action by the City of Waltham that would strengthen\ntheir argument for lifting the automatic stay[.]” Buster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">576363</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *17.\n\n                                  - 7 -\n\fconduct, the cost of enforcing the settlement would be too high to\n\njustify.       Rather than enforce the settlement, the court opted to\n\ngrant Goffe relief from the automatic stay.                 The court stated that\n\nGoffe    was    entitled     to   such    relief    “because   it    [Goffe]   lacks\n\nadequate protection due to the fact that the property has been the\n\nsubject of cease and desist orders by the City of Waltham which\n\nimpair, potentially seriously hurt Goffe’s ability to realize on\n\nits collateral.”        R.App. 451-52.        The court’s action allowed the\n\nforeclosure sale to proceed, and the Property was sold in 1998 for\n\napproximately $1.3 million.5             Also in 1998, the bankruptcy case was\n\nconverted to Chapter 7.           Beaver St., 244 B.R. at 190.\n\n               After   his   appointment,         Trustee   Murphy   took   up   the\n\nprosecution of the Superior Court action as well as two additional\n\nclaims:    that Goffe had violated the automatic stay by informing\n\nWaltham officials of code violations at the Property (the “Stay\n\nClaim”), and that Goffe had overstated its claim to the foreclosure\n\nproceeds (the “Proceeds Claim”).\n\n               The year 2000 was a significant year for this case.\n\nFirst, the bankruptcy court declined to approve a settlement that\n\nTrustee Murphy had reached with Goffe.

The settlement resolved the Proceeds Claim,\n\nthe Storage Claim and the Stay Claim--the last remaining assets of\n\nthe estate--for $125,000.        R.App. 598, 612-16.           The Principals\n\nopposed the settlement.    They also asked the bankruptcy court for\n\nan evidentiary hearing on their allegation that Goffe had violated\n\nthe automatic stay.\n\n           The court held that the settlement was reasonable.              It\n\nnoted that, in light of the resolution of the Civil Rights Claims\n\nby the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and the accrual of\n\nincreased legal fees, the Partnership’s prospects of recovering\n\nsignificantly more than the settlement amount were “at best, very\n\nuncertain.”       Appellant’s    Addendum       13-14.     Also,    continued\n\nlitigation would involve additional expense, inconvenience and\n\ndelay.    Id.     The court also pointed out that no non-insider\n\ncreditor had voiced any objection to the settlement, and that\n\n\n                                      - 9 -\n\f“where[, as here,] administrative and non-insider unsecured claims\n\nwill not be fully paid, the interest of the principals is more\n\nattenuated      than   before[.]”     Id.         The    court   also   denied   the\n\nPrincipals’ motion for an evidentiary hearing on the Stay Claim,\n\nsaying that “[l]itigating causes of action to assess their outcome\n\nis precisely what the reasonableness standard for compromises is\n\nintended to avoid.”       Id.\n\n              Following the approval of the settlement, the Principals\n\nfiled    an   adversary   complaint     in    the       bankruptcy   court.      The\n\ncomplaint outlined the Duffys’s alleged violation of the automatic\n\nstay and attempted to frame the Duffys’s conduct as a broader\n\npattern of wrongdoing: fraudulently obtaining the cease and desist\n\norders, failing to disclose their conduct to the court and using\n\nthe orders to argue impairment of their collateral, “when the real\n\nreason   they    wanted   to    foreclose    was     to    silence   the   Debtor’s\n\npetitioning activities[.]”          R.App. 1209-10.         The complaint sought\n\nmonetary      sanctions   pursuant    to     11    U.S.C.    §   105(a)    and   the\n\nbankruptcy court’s inherent powers.               The district court dismissed\n\nthis complaint sua sponte.          R.App. 1172.\n\n     The Principals appealed the bankruptcy court’s decisions to\n\nthe district court, which affirmed.

Our case law\n\nestablishes that, in deciding whether to accept a compromise\n\nproposal that discharges legal claims held by the debtor, the\n\nbankruptcy court should consider the following factors:\n\n              (i) the probability of success in the litigation\n              being compromised; (ii) the difficulties, if any,\n              to be encountered in the matter of collection;\n              (iii) the complexity of the litigation involved,\n              and the expense, inconvenience and delay attending\n              it; and, (iv) the paramount interest of the\n              creditors   and  a   proper  deference   to  their\n              reasonable views in the premise.\n\n\nId. at 185.     In applying these factors, the trustee is accorded a\n\nsignificant range of discretion in the prudent exercise of business\n\njudgment.

The Principals seek to distinguish McMullen by\n\nclaiming that it does not apply in cases of bad faith.                      However,\n\neven if the Principals were successful in proving bad faith (and it\n\nis   clear     that    proving     this     point    would     be   a    substantial\n\nundertaking), we have expressed skepticism in both McMullen and In\n\n\n                                      - 12 -\n\fre    Spookyworld,    Inc.,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200665\"><a href=\"/opinion/200665/spookyworld-inc-v-town-of-berlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span>      <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1st   Cir.    2003),     that   an\n\nallegation of bad faith makes any difference in the valuation\n\nprocess.      In Spookyworld, for example, we expressed concern that\n\ninquiring into the legitimacy of the regulatory claims would mire\n\nthe bankruptcy courts in “mini-trials of purely state regulatory\n\nissues.”       Id.   at   10   (internal       quotation   marks       and   citation\n\nomitted).       In   McMullen,     we    cited     Spookyworld    in    noting   “the\n\ntenuousness of the arguments for engrafting such a ‘bad faith’\n\nexception . . . noting the emergent rule that bankruptcy courts\n\nshould not inquire into the legitimacy of ongoing administrative\n\nenforcement proceedings in determining whether the police power\n\nexception applies to them.”             386 F.3d at 328 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n              Moreover, even if the Partnership prevailed on this\n\nclaim, it is questionable whether it would be able to collect much\n\nin the way of damages.            See 11 U.S.C. § 362(k)(1);6 Spookyworld,\n\n346 F.3d at 7 (holding that a debtor that is a corporation cannot\n\nsue   under    §   362(h)   for    a    violation    of   the    automatic    stay).\n\nFurthermore, any recovery likely would be offset by the fees and\n\ncosts incurred in pursuing litigation.7\n\n\n       6\n         Before recent amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, the\nrelevant provision appeared as § 362(h).\n       7\n       We also note that it would have been very difficult for the\nPrincipals to argue that this case is controlled by our decision in\nIn re Lloyd, Carr & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375899\"><a href=\"/opinion/375899/in-re-lloyd-carr-and-company-bankrupt-two-cases-appeal-of-alan-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1980). In Lloyd,\nCarr, we held that “where . . . a settlement rewards a bankrupt for\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\f            The fourth prong of the Jeffrey analysis requires that\n\nthe bankruptcy court recognize “the paramount interest of the\n\ncreditors and a proper deference to their reasonable views in the\n\npremise.”    70 F.3d at 185.    Notably, none of the non-insider\n\ncreditors objected to the settlement, which provided a payment of\n\nthirty-two cents on the dollar to the unsecured creditors. Had the\n\nTrust been required to litigate these claims, there is a good\n\n\n\nhis contumacious refusal to comply with the Bankruptcy Act itself,\nmore is required than a simple showing of marginal benefit. Public\npolicy forbids a settlement of this character without, at least, a\npowerful showing of such potential detriment to the estate that no\nother course is reasonably available.” Id. at 891. The debtor,\nwho was being held on charges of fraud in the sale of stock\noptions, had stashed $1.75 million in banks in Bermuda.         The\nbankruptcy court ordered him to have those funds transferred to an\nAmerican bank and placed under the control of a receiver.       The\ndebtor refused to comply with the court’s order and in fact\nstrenuously resisted attempts in Bermudan courts to have the funds\ntransferred to the United States. After its attempts to obtain the\nmoney by other means were thwarted, the receiver reached a\nsettlement with the debtor. The agreement called for the debtor to\ntransfer $207,000 from Bermuda to the United States. Half of that\nmoney would go to the receiver; the debtor would retain the other\nhalf and would use it to post bail. All of the major creditors\nopposed this proposed settlement. The district court nevertheless\napproved the settlement, but we reversed. We noted that the debtor\nwas required by law to transfer the money even in the absence of\nthe agreement; thus, he provided no consideration for the\nagreement. Id. at 890. We further concluded that the bankruptcy\ncode did not permit the disbursement of funds from the bankruptcy\nestate to allow a debtor to post bail. Id. at 889. We also noted\nthat the compromise had been actively opposed by the major\ncreditors and affirmatively approved by none. Id. at 892. In sum,\nwe held that the agreement was contrary to public policy because\nthe debtor would give up nothing and would get a benefit to which\nhe was not legally entitled.\n     Here, by contrast, the allegations involve alleged wrongdoing\nby a third party and, as we have shown, it may well be that a trier\nof fact would not decide that there was a showing of bad faith.\n\n                               - 14 -\n\fchance that these creditors would have received a great deal less,\n\nassuming there had been some recovery.           In that respect, we give\n\nsubstantial deference to a bankruptcy court’s decision to approve\n\na proposed settlement.\n\n           The Principals, therefore, have not carried their burden\n\nof showing that the bankruptcy court’s determination falls below\n\nthe bottom of the range of reasonableness.         Even if the claims have\n\nmerit, the amount that the Trust might collect is so uncertain as\n\nto make the bankruptcy court’s decision to approve the settlement\n\nreasonable. We have no difficulty in determining that the judgment\n\nof the trustee was well within the range of reasonableness and that\n\nthe bankruptcy court correctly approved the settlement.                    The\n\nstrength     of   the   Partnership’s      remaining   claims   was    indeed\n\nquestionable,     and   the   offer   of    settlement   approved     by   the\n\nbankruptcy court was a very realistic one.\n\n                                      B.\n\n           In its ruling on the motion to reconsider approval of the\n\nsettlement, the bankruptcy court dismissed sua sponte an adversary\n\ncomplaint filed by the Principals.           Its discussion of the matter\n\nwas brief:\n\n           The partners’ rights (including any rights of\n           the 110 Beaver Street Trust) to relief in the\n           adversary proceeding are subject to the terms\n           of the settlement, which was approved before\n           the filing of the adversary proceeding.\n           Moreover, the demands for relief in the\n           adversary proceeding are predicated entirely\n           on rights of the debtor and of the bankruptcy\n\n                                  - 15 -\n\f          estate, which rights have now been settled by\n          the agreement.

The Principals’s allegations,\n\nas well as their arguments in their briefs, make clear that\n\nwhatever injury they might be able to show would constitute injury\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591 (7th Cir. 1972) (per curiam) (noting that “for\nbankruptcy purposes partnership property is to be distinguished\nfrom property of the individual partners”); Thomasson v.

However, as that case\nmakes clear, the creditor must be able to allege an injury as a\ncreditor from the violation of the automatic stay.      Here, the\nplaintiffs can allege no injury to themselves; they simply allege\nan injury to the partnership estate.\n\n                                    - 18 -\n\f</pre>",
