William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Victoria M. Bonilla and Bourbeau & Bonilla on brief for\nappellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, Michael J. Pelgro\nand Virginia Vander Jagt, Assistant United States Attorneys, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n                         February 8, 2006\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.          Defendant-appellant Gregory Smith\n\nchallenges a condition of supervised release, imposed by the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts, that\n\ndirects him to stay away from his minor daughter, Alisa McDonald.\n\nThe appellant claims that this supervised release condition (i)\n\ndenies him his fundamental right to associate with family members\n\nand (ii) lacks any reasonable relationship to the permissible goals\n\nof supervised release.       After careful consideration, we uphold the\n\nchallenged condition.\n\n            The   background       facts    are    readily   rehearsed.     The\n\ngovernment charged the appellant and his paramour, Megan McDonald,\n\nwith a medley of narcotics offenses. It charged the appellant with\n\nmultiple firearms counts as well.            McDonald and the appellant both\n\npleaded guilty. On September 8, 1995, the district court sentenced\n\nthe appellant to a ten-year incarcerative term, to be succeeded by\n\nan eight-year term of supervised release.\n\n            Megan McDonald's cooperation saved her from a prison\n\nsentence.    During the pendency of the proceedings, she gave birth\n\nto   the   appellant's     daughter.         The   relationship   between   the\n\nappellant and McDonald had soured.             One consequence was that the\n\nappellant did not see the child during his immurement.\n\n            In    1998,    while    still     incarcerated,    the   appellant\n\ninitiated a proceeding in the Barnstable Probate Court to obtain\n\nvisitation rights.        That proceeding remains pending.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f              Shortly before the appellant's release from custody,\n\ncorrectional authorities transferred him to a halfway house.               The\n\nappellant finished serving his sentence on January 8, 2004, and\n\nleft the halfway house at that juncture.          He signed a written set\n\nof standard supervised release conditions that directed him, among\n\nother things, to eschew any contact with convicted felons and to\n\nobey the instructions of his probation officer.\n\n              Upon the appellant's release from the halfway house, the\n\nprobation officer ordered him to stay away from both his minor\n\ndaughter and his former girlfriend (with whom his daughter resided)\n\nunless   he    first   obtained    permission   from    the   Probate   Court.\n\nProbation officers subsequently repeated this instruction.\n\n              On March 26, 2004, the appellant, without leave from\n\neither the Probate Court or his probation officer, set out to\n\ncontact his daughter. His odyssey began at an elementary school in\n\nFalmouth, Massachusetts.           He became visibly agitated when he\n\nrealized that Alisa did not attend that school.               He then went to\n\nthe school district's administrative offices, entered the building,\n\nand demanded access to his daughter. School officials informed him\n\nthat he could not see any student unless his name was on the\n\n\"emergency contact\" list for that pupil.          Because the appellant's\n\nname   did    not   appear   on   Alisa's   emergency   contact    list,   the\n\nofficials turned him away.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           The appellant made yet a third attempt to find his\n\ndaughter. Although he located the correct school, his quest failed\n\nonce again; he spoke to the principal, who stated that the matter\n\nwould have to be sorted out by the Probate Court.\n\n           School    officials      notified     Megan    McDonald    of    the\n\nappellant's meanderings through the Falmouth school system.                 She\n\nalerted the local constabulary and police officers were dispatched\n\nto Alisa's school.          The appellant gave the officers circular\n\nexplanations for his presence at the school.1             He then grudgingly\n\nleft the premises.\n\n           The      appellant's      actions      had     three      immediate\n\nrepercussions.      First, Megan McDonald obtained a state court\n\nrestraining order against the appellant.          Second, the principal of\n\nAlisa's   school    filed    a   notice   of   trespass   that    forbade   the\n\nappellant from setting foot on the institution's grounds.              Last —\n\nbut far from least — on March 31, 2004, the Probation Department\n\nmoved to revoke the appellant's supervised release, claiming in\n\nrelevant part that he had violated the order to stay away from his\n\nminor daughter.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      When the police arrived, the appellant was in the company of\na woman who provided false identification information.      Smith's\nprobation officer eventually learned that the mystery woman was\nKaren McGauley, a convicted felon whom the appellant had met while\nin residence at the halfway house. Although the probation officer\nhad told the appellant specifically to stay away from McGauley, the\nappellant nevertheless pursued a relationship with her.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f            On April 6, 2004, the district court issued an arrest\n\nwarrant.     Eight days later, the appellant called his probation\n\nofficer    to    discuss   the     warrant.       Contrary    to   the   officer's\n\nimportuning, the appellant did not self-surrender.\n\n            While    still    at    large,      the   appellant    married      Karen\n\nMcGauley.       See supra note 1.     The wedding took place on April 22,\n\n2004.   Less than three weeks later, federal marshals arrested the\n\nappellant at McGauley's family home in Yarmouthport.\n\n            At an ensuing evidentiary hearing, a magistrate judge\n\nfound as a fact that the appellant had sojourned to the Falmouth\n\nschools for the express purpose of meeting with his daughter. This\n\nfinding is not seriously controverted and, in all events, is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n            Before the district court, the appellant admitted to four\n\nsupervised       release     violations;        three    involved     frustrating\n\ninstructions and inquiries of the probation officer and the fourth\n\ninvolved associating with a convicted felon.                 The court sentenced\n\nhim to 318 days of additional incarceration and a new supervised\n\nrelease term.       It inserted as a special condition of supervised\n\nrelease a direction that the appellant stay away from his minor\n\ndaughter unless and until the Probate Court ordered otherwise.\n\nThis timely appeal followed.\n\n            In    this   venue,     the   appellant     asseverates      that    this\n\nspecial condition is illegal for two reasons: (i) it deprives him\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fof his fundamental right to associate with a close family member\n\n(his minor daughter) and (ii) it is not reasonably related to the\n\npermissible    goals    of   his   supervised     release.       We   review   the\n\nimposition of a condition of supervised release for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    United States v. Prochner, 417 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    With that deferential standard of review in mind, we\n\nexamine each of the appellant's asseverations.\n\n            The appellant's flagship claim is that the contested\n\nsupervised release condition denies him his fundamental right to\n\nassociate with a close family member and, thus, impinges upon his\n\nconstitutionally prescribed freedom of intimate association.                   See\n\nRoberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617-18 (1984) (discussing a\n\nperson's right \"to enter into and maintain certain intimate human\n\nrelationships\" and the constitutional protection afforded to that\n\nright \"against undue intrusion by the State\").                 We readily accept\n\nthe   appellant's      tripartite     premise    that    the    father-daughter\n\nrelationship is a close one, see Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248,\n\n256 (1983); that it is constitutionally protected, see Quilloin v.\n\nWalcott, 434 U.S. 246, 255 (1978); and that the court-imposed\n\nspecial release condition impinges upon it.              We disagree, however,\n\nwith the appellant's conclusion that, given these facts, his\n\nimmutable    right   to   see   his   child     trumps   the    special   release\n\ncondition.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            It is beyond hope of contradiction that those who are\n\nconvicted     of    crimes       against     society      lose     a     measure      of\n\nconstitutional protection.           See, e.g., Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483\n\nU.S. 868, 874 (1987).          As a result, a sentencing court can infringe\n\nupon a convicted felon's liberty in various ways, such as by\n\nordering incarceration or by imposing conditions of supervised\n\nrelease. The fact that many conditions of supervised release limit\n\na convicted felon's liberty does not render them invalid.                            See\n\nUnited States v. Brown, 235 F.3d 2, 7 (1st Cir. 2000).                              \"The\n\nhallmark that separates impermissible conditions from permissible\n\nones is whether, on a given set of facts, a particular restriction\n\nis clearly unnecessary.\"            Id.     This dividing line is no less\n\nappropriate    when      the    parent-child        relationship       hangs   in    the\n\nbalance.     Cf. United States v. Myers, 426 F.3d 117, 125 (2d Cir.\n\n2005) (\"The constitutional privileges attached to the parent-child\n\nrelationship . . . are hardly absolute.\").\n\n            Accordingly, we reject the appellant's argument that the\n\nchallenged    supervised        release    condition     should    be    invalidated\n\nsimply    because   it    intrudes    upon      a   constitutionally       protected\n\nright.2    The mere existence of a biological link does not override\n\nall other considerations.          See Lehr, 463 U.S. at 261.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      This holding renders academic the government's suggestion\nthat the appellant forfeited his constitutional claim by failing to\nraise it squarely in the court below.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            This   brings     us    to     the    appellant's       \"relatedness\"\n\ncontention. In mounting this aspect of his argument, the appellant\n\nemphasizes the absence of any direct connection between his minor\n\ndaughter and the offenses of conviction.            Yet the critical test is\n\nnot whether such an offense-specific nexus exists but, rather,\n\n\"whether the challenged condition is sufficiently related to one or\n\nmore of the permissible goals of supervised release.\"                     Brown, 235\n\nF.3d at 6.\n\n            Relatedness      must   be    evaluated       against    a     statutory\n\nbackdrop.     Congress has authorized courts to implement a wide\n\nvariety of discretionary supervised release conditions as long as\n\nthey are \"reasonably related to\" the goals of supervised release\n\nand \"involve[] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably\n\nnecessary for [those] purposes.\"           18 U.S.C. § 3583(d)(1)-(2);3 see\n\nUSSG §5D1.3(b).        This framework allows a court to order, as a\n\nspecial    condition    of   supervised        release,    that     the    defendant\n\n\"refrain    from   frequenting      specified     kinds    of     places    or   from\n\nassociating unnecessarily with specified persons.\"                    18 U.S.C. §\n\n3563(b)(6).    The challenged condition fits within this taxonomy.\n\nWe turn, then, to whether \"the nature and circumstances of the\n\noffense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" id.\n\n\n     3\n      A discretionary condition of supervised release also should\nbe \"consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the\nSentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d)(3). Neither party\nsuggests that any such policy statements are germane to the\ncondition challenged here.\n\n                                         -8-\n\f§ 3553(a)(1), the need \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal\n\nconduct,\" id. § 3553(a)(2)(B), and the objective of \"protect[ing]\n\nthe   public      from   further    crimes     of   the   defendant,\"     id.    §\n\n3553(a)(2)(C),      justified      the   condition's      imposition    in    this\n\ninstance.\n\n            As said, the appellant takes a narrow, offense-specific\n\nview of relatedness.         In his estimation, the special condition\n\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion because it does not advance any\n\nof the goals of supervised release or, at the very least, involves\n\na greater deprivation of liberty than is needed to achieve those\n\ngoals. This contention pales, however, in light of the appellant's\n\nactions.    We explain briefly.\n\n            Here, the challenged condition serves the laudable goal\n\nof protecting public safety.         When the appellant left the halfway\n\nhouse, he was told to refrain from contact with his minor daughter.\n\nThe appellant did not abide by this directive.              What is more, the\n\negregious manner in which he transgressed it set off warning\n\nbells.4     His    actions   were    sufficiently      unsettling      that   they\n\nproduced both a state court restraining order and a trespass\n\nnotice.    Under these circumstances, the district court reasonably\n\ncould have believed — as it apparently did — that both Alisa and\n\n\n      4\n      The appellant's proclivity for disrespectful behavior toward\nhis family members was also evidenced by his subsequent behavior.\nAfter being denied access to his daughter at her elementary school,\nhe sent compromising photographs of Megan McDonald to Alisa's\nschool principal and to the Barnstable Probate Court.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fMegan McDonald, as members of the public, needed to be protected\n\nfrom the appellant.     The special release condition plainly served\n\nthat permissible purpose.     See Wilkinson v. Russell, 182 F.3d 89,\n\n104 (2d Cir. 1999) (emphasizing the strong governmental interest in\n\nsafeguarding minors, particularly when a child is in need of\n\nprotection against a parent's actions).\n\n           If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\nappellant unquestionably violated an order that he refrain from\n\nassociating with convicted felons by consorting with McGauley (a\n\nconvicted felon) and eventually marrying her.            Alisa's custodial\n\nparent, Megan McDonald, likewise was a convicted felon — indeed,\n\nshe was the appellant's codefendant — and, given the likelihood of\n\ncoming into contact with her in the course of any attempt to\n\ncontact Alisa, it was within the district court's proper province\n\nto direct the appellant to stay away from the child.            Cf. United\n\nStates v. Bolinger, 940 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir. 1991) (\"Probation\n\nconditions may seek to prevent reversion into a former crime-\n\ninducing   lifestyle    by   barring    contact   with    old   haunts   and\n\nassociates, even though the activities may be legal.\").\n\n           The appellant's fallback position — that the special\n\ncondition of supervised release deprives him of more liberty than\n\nis reasonably necessary — lacks force.         After all, the condition\n\nwas not absolute.      Family matters are best adjudicated in state\n\ndomestic   relations    courts,   and    the   district    judge   sensibly\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fconstructed this condition to allow for its alteration by the\n\nProbate Court (a court of competent jurisdiction that the appellant\n\nalready had petitioned for a grant of visitation rights).        So\n\nviewed, the challenged condition does not go too far.    See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Crume, 422 F.3d 728, 734 (8th Cir. 2005) (allowing\n\ncondition barring defendant who possessed child pornography from\n\nseeing his child without the permission of parole officer); see\n\nalso Myers, 426 F.3d at 127 (noting, in dictum, that condition\n\nprohibiting appellant from spending time alone with his son absent\n\nprior authorization would be acceptable if its goal was to \"protect\n\nother children\").\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\npromulgating the challenged condition of supervised release.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

First, Megan McDonald obtained a state court restraining order against the appellant. Second, the principal of Alisa's school filed a notice of trespass that forbade the appellant from setting foot on the institution's grounds. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; on March 31, 2004, the Probation Department moved to revoke the appellant's supervised release, claiming in relevant part that he had violated the order to stay away from his minor daughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 2004, the district court issued an arrest warrant. Eight days later, the appellant called his probation officer to discuss the warrant. Contrary to the officer's importuning, the appellant did not self-surrender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While still at large, the appellant married Karen McGauley. <i>See supra</i> note 1. The wedding took place on April 22, 2004. Less than three weeks later, federal marshals arrested the appellant at McGauley's family home in Yarmouthport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At an ensuing evidentiary hearing, a magistrate judge found as a fact that the appellant had sojourned to the Falmouth schools for the express purpose of meeting with his daughter. This finding is not seriously controverted and, in all events, is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court, the appellant admitted to four supervised release violations; three involved frustrating instructions and inquiries of the probation officer and the fourth involved associating with a convicted felon. The court sentenced him to 318 days of additional incarceration and a new supervised release term. It inserted as a special condition of supervised release a direction that the appellant stay away from his minor daughter unless and until the Probate Court ordered otherwise. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant asseverates that this special condition is illegal for two reasons: (i) it deprives him of his fundamental right to associate with a close family member (his minor daughter) and (ii) it is not reasonably related to the permissible goals of his supervised release. We review the imposition of a condition of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Prochner,</i> 417 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.2005). With that deferential standard of review in mind, we examine each of the appellant's asseverations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's flagship claim is that the contested supervised release condition denies him his fundamental right to associate with a close family member and, thus, impinges upon his constitutionally prescribed freedom of intimate association. <i>See Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees,</i> 468 U.S. 609, 617-18, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984) (discussing a person's right \"to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships\" and the constitutional protection afforded to that right \"against undue intrusion by the State\"). We readily accept the appellant's tripartite premise that the father-daughter relationship is a close one, <i>see Lehr v. Robertson,</i> 463 U.S. 248, 256, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983); that it is constitutionally protected, <i>see Quilloin v. Walcott,</i> 434 U.S. 246, 255, 98 S.Ct. 549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978); and that the court-imposed special release condition impinges upon it. We disagree, however, with the appellant's conclusion that, given these facts, his immutable right to see his child trumps the special release condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond hope of contradiction that those who are convicted of crimes against society lose a measure of constitutional protection. <i>See, e.g., Griffin v. Wisconsin,</i> 483 U.S. 868, 874, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987). As a result, a sentencing court can infringe upon a convicted felon's liberty in various ways, such as by ordering incarceration or by imposing conditions of supervised release. The fact that many conditions of supervised release limit a convicted felon's liberty does not render them invalid. <i>See United States v. Brown,</i> 235 F.3d 2, 7 (1st Cir.2000). \"The hallmark that separates impermissible conditions from permissible ones is whether, on a given set of facts, a particular restriction is clearly unnecessary.\" <i>Id.</i> This dividing line is no less appropriate when the parent-child relationship hangs in the balance. <i>Cf. United States v. Myers,</i> 426 F.3d 117, 125 (2d Cir.2005) (\"The constitutional privileges attached to the parent-child relationship ... are hardly absolute.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject the appellant's argument that the challenged supervised release condition should be invalidated simply because it intrudes upon a constitutionally protected right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The mere existence of a biological link does not override all other considerations. <i>See Lehr,</i> 463 U.S. at 261, 103 S.Ct. 2985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the appellant's \"relatedness\" contention. In mounting this aspect of his argument, the appellant emphasizes the absence of any direct connection between his minor daughter and the offenses of conviction. Yet the critical test is not whether such an offense-specific nexus exists but, rather, \"whether the challenged condition is sufficiently related to one or more of the permissible goals of supervised release.\" <i>Brown,</i> 235 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedness must be evaluated against a statutory backdrop. Congress has authorized courts to implement a wide variety of discretionary supervised release conditions as long as they are \"reasonably related to\" the goals of supervised release and \"involve[] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for [those] purposes.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)(1)-(2);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 5D1.3(b). This framework allows a court to order, as a special condition of supervised release, that the defendant \"refrain from frequenting specified kinds of places or from associating unnecessarily with specified persons.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(b)(6). The challenged condition fits within this taxonomy. We turn, then, to whether \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 3553(a)(1), the need \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 3553(a)(2)(B), and the objective of \"protect[ing] the public from further crimes of the defendant,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 3553(a)(2)(C), justified the condition's imposition in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the appellant takes a narrow, offense-specific view of relatedness. In his estimation, the special condition constitutes an abuse of discretion because it does not advance any of the goals of supervised release or, at the very least, involves a greater deprivation of liberty than is needed to achieve those goals. This contention pales, however, in light of the appellant's actions. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the challenged condition serves the laudable goal of protecting public safety. When the appellant left the halfway house, he was told to refrain from contact with his minor daughter. The appellant did not abide by this directive. What is more, the egregious manner in which he transgressed it set off warning bells.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> His actions were sufficiently unsettling that they produced both a state court restraining order and a trespass notice. Under these circumstances, the district court reasonably could have believed &#8212; as it apparently did &#8212; that both Alisa and Megan McDonald, as members of the public, needed to be protected from the appellant. The special release condition plainly served that permissible purpose. <i>See Wilkinson v. Russell,</i> 182 F.3d 89, 104 (2d Cir.1999) (emphasizing the strong governmental interest in safeguarding minors, particularly when a child is in need of protection against a parent's actions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; the appellant unquestionably violated an order that he refrain from associating with convicted felons by consorting with McGauley (a convicted felon) and eventually marrying her. Alisa's custodial parent, Megan McDonald, likewise was a convicted felon &#8212; indeed, she was the appellant's codefendant &#8212; and, given the likelihood of coming into contact with her in the course of any attempt to contact Alisa, it was within the district court's proper province to direct the appellant to stay away from the child. <i>Cf. United States v. Bolinger,</i> 940 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir.1991) (\"Probation conditions may seek to prevent reversion into a former crime-inducing lifestyle by barring contact with old haunts and associates, even though the activities may be legal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback position &#8212; that the special condition of supervised release deprives him of more liberty than is reasonably necessary &#8212; lacks force. After all, the condition was not absolute. Family matters are best adjudicated in state domestic relations courts, and the district judge sensibly constructed this condition to allow for its alteration by the Probate Court (a court of competent jurisdiction that the appellant already had petitioned for a grant of visitation rights). So viewed, the challenged condition does not go too far. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Crume,</i> 422 F.3d 728, 734 (8th Cir.2005) (allowing condition barring defendant who possessed child pornography from seeing his child without the permission of parole officer); <i>see also Myers,</i> 426 F.3d at 127 (noting, in dictum, that condition prohibiting appellant from spending time alone with his son absent prior authorization would be acceptable if its goal was to \"protect other children\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in promulgating the challenged condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> When the police arrived, the appellant was in the company of a woman who provided false identification information.

The appellant claims that this supervised release condition (i) denies him his fundamental right to associate with family members and (ii) lacks any reasonable relationship to the permissible goals of supervised release. After careful consideration, we uphold the challenged condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are readily rehearsed. The government charged the appellant and his paramour, Megan McDonald, with a medley of narcotics offenses. It charged the appellant with multiple firearms counts as well. McDonald and the appellant both pleaded guilty. On September 8, 1995, the district court sentenced the appellant to a ten-year incarcerative term, to be succeeded by an eight-year term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Megan McDonald's cooperation saved her from a prison sentence. During the pendency of the proceedings, she gave birth to the appellant's daughter. The relationship between the appellant and McDonald had soured. One consequence was that the appellant did not see the child during his immurement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, while still incarcerated, the appellant initiated a proceeding in the Barnstable Probate Court to obtain visitation rights. That proceeding remains pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the appellant's release from custody, correctional authorities transferred him to a halfway house. The appellant finished serving his sentence on January 8, 2004, and left the halfway house at that juncture. He signed a written set of standard supervised release conditions that directed him, among other things, to eschew any contact with convicted felons and to obey the instructions of his probation officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the appellant's release from the halfway house, the probation officer ordered him to stay away from both his minor daughter and his former girlfriend (with whom his daughter resided) unless he first obtained permission from the Probate Court. Probation officers subsequently repeated this instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 2004, the appellant, without leave from either the Probate Court or his probation officer, set out to contact his daughter. His odyssey began at an elementary school in Falmouth, Massachusetts. He became visibly agitated when he realized that Alisa did not attend that school. He then went to the school district's administrative offices, entered the building, and demanded access to his daughter. School officials informed him that he could not see any student unless his name was on the \"emergency contact\" list for that pupil. Because the appellant's name did not appear on Alisa's emergency contact list, the officials turned him away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant made yet a third attempt to find his daughter. Although he located the correct school, his quest failed once again; he spoke to the principal, who stated that the matter would have to be sorted out by the Probate Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">School officials notified Megan McDonald of the appellant's meanderings through the Falmouth school system.

Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199192\"><a href=\"/opinion/199192/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2000). \"The hallmark that separates impermissible conditions from permissible ones is whether, on a given set of facts, a particular restriction is clearly unnecessary.\" <i>Id.</i> This dividing line is no less appropriate when the parent-child relationship hangs in the balance. <i>Cf. United States v. Myers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792179\"><a href=\"/opinion/792179/united-states-v-duane-arthur-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 125 (2d Cir.2005) (\"The constitutional privileges attached to the parent-child relationship ... are hardly absolute.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject the appellant's argument that the challenged supervised release condition should be invalidated simply because it intrudes upon a constitutionally protected right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The mere existence of a biological link does not override all other considerations. <i>See Lehr,</i> 463 U.S. at 261, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110999\"><a href=\"/opinion/110999/lehr-v-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2985</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the appellant's \"relatedness\" contention. In mounting this aspect of his argument, the appellant emphasizes the absence of any direct connection between his minor daughter and the offenses of conviction. Yet the critical test is not whether such an offense-specific nexus exists but, rather, \"whether the challenged condition is sufficiently related to one or more of the permissible goals of supervised release.\" <i>Brown,</i> 235 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedness must be evaluated against a statutory backdrop. Congress has authorized courts to implement a wide variety of discretionary supervised release conditions as long as they are \"reasonably related to\" the goals of supervised release and \"involve[] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for [those] purposes.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)(1)-(2);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 5D1.3(b). This framework allows a court to order, as a special condition of supervised release, that the defendant \"refrain from frequenting specified kinds of places or from associating unnecessarily with specified persons.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(b)(6). The challenged condition fits within this taxonomy. We turn, then, to whether \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 3553(a)(1), the need \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 3553(a)(2)(B), and the objective of \"protect[ing] the public from further crimes of the defendant,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 3553(a)(2)(C), justified the condition's imposition in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the appellant takes a narrow, offense-specific view of relatedness. In his estimation, the special condition constitutes an abuse of discretion because it does not advance any of the goals of supervised release or, at the very least, involves a greater deprivation of liberty than is needed to achieve those goals. This contention pales, however, in light of the appellant's actions. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the challenged condition serves the laudable goal of protecting public safety. When the appellant left the halfway house, he was told to refrain from contact with his minor daughter. The appellant did not abide by this directive. What is more, the egregious manner in which he transgressed it set off warning bells.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> His actions were sufficiently unsettling that they produced both a state court restraining order and a trespass notice. Under these circumstances, the district court reasonably could have believed &#8212; as it apparently did &#8212; that both Alisa and Megan McDonald, as members of the public, needed to be protected from the appellant. The special release condition plainly served that permissible purpose. <i>See Wilkinson v. Russell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764989\"><a href=\"/opinion/764989/thomas-wilkinson-benjamin-wilkinson-by-next-friend-thomas-wilkinson-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 104 (2d Cir.1999) (emphasizing the strong governmental interest in safeguarding minors, particularly when a child is in need of protection against a parent's actions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; the appellant unquestionably violated an order that he refrain from associating with convicted felons by consorting with McGauley (a convicted felon) and eventually marrying her. Alisa's custodial parent, Megan McDonald, likewise was a convicted felon &#8212; indeed, she was the appellant's codefendant &#8212; and, given the likelihood of coming into contact with her in the course of any attempt to contact Alisa, it was within the district court's proper province to direct the appellant to stay away from the child. <i>Cf. United States v. Bolinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565277\"><a href=\"/opinion/565277/united-states-v-robert-bolinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 480 (9th Cir.1991) (\"Probation conditions may seek to prevent reversion into a former crime-inducing lifestyle by barring contact with old haunts and associates, even though the activities may be legal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback position &#8212; that the special condition of supervised release deprives him of more liberty than is reasonably necessary &#8212; lacks force. After all, the condition was not absolute. Family matters are best adjudicated in state domestic relations courts, and the district judge sensibly constructed this condition to allow for its alteration by the Probate Court (a court of competent jurisdiction that the appellant already had petitioned for a grant of visitation rights). So viewed, the challenged condition does not go too far. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Crume,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791835\"><a href=\"/opinion/791835/united-states-v-derrick-crume/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span>, 734 (8th Cir.2005) (allowing condition barring defendant who possessed child pornography from seeing his child without the permission of parole officer); <i>see also Myers,</i> 426 F.3d at 127 (noting, in dictum, that condition prohibiting appellant from spending time alone with his son absent prior authorization would be acceptable if its goal was to \"protect other children\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in promulgating the challenged condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> When the police arrived, the appellant was in the company of a woman who provided false identification information. Smith's probation officer eventually learned that the mystery woman was Karen McGauley, a convicted felon whom the appellant had met while in residence at the halfway house. Although the probation officer had told the appellant specifically to stay away from McGauley, the appellant nevertheless pursued a relationship with her</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This holding renders academic the government's suggestion that the appellant forfeited his constitutional claim by failing to raise it squarely in the court below</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A discretionary condition of supervised release also should be \"consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)(3). Neither party suggests that any such policy statements are germane to the condition challenged here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The appellant's proclivity for disrespectful behavior toward his family members was also evidenced by his subsequent behavior. After being denied access to his daughter at her elementary school, he sent compromising photographs of Megan McDonald to Alisa's school principal and to the Barnstable Probate Court</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
