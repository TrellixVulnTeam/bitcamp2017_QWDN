This petition for habeas corpus\n\nrelief challenges the propriety of a question asked by a police\n\nofficer after the petitioner had unambiguously invoked his Fifth\n\nAmendment right to counsel.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          On September 13, 1995, a Middlesex Superior Court jury\n\nconvicted the petitioner, Sarourt Nom (\"Nom\"), of the first degree\n\nmurder of his wife and unlawful possession of a firearm.     The court\n\nsentenced Nom to life in prison.         On November 18, 1997, the\n\nMassachusetts   Supreme   Judicial     Court   (\"SJC\")   affirmed   the\n\nconvictions.    After exhausting his further state court appeals,1\n\nNom petitioned the federal district court for habeas corpus relief\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254, claiming (1) that his Fifth Amendment right\n\nto counsel was violated when, after a prior invocation of his right\n\nto counsel, a police officer asked Nom why he had requested\n\ncounsel, and (2) that his Sixth Amendment right to effective\n\nassistance of counsel was violated by trial counsel's failure to\n\nobject to the trial judge's jury charge on malice.2       The district\n\n\n     1\n        Nom filed an untimely petition for re-hearing, which the\nSJC denied on January 26, 1998. On November 10, 1998, Nom filed a\nmotion for a new trial in the Middlesex Superior Court based on\nineffective assistance of counsel, which was denied on May 27,\n1999. On February 28, 2000, a single justice of the SJC denied Nom\nleave to appeal the Superior Court's decision.\n     2\n        Nom also petitioned for habeas relief on the ground that\nthe admission of statements which he made without having received\nhis Miranda warnings violated his Fifth Amendment rights.     Nom\nvoluntarily dismissed this claim prior to the district court's\n\n                                -2-\n\fcourt denied the petition on both grounds, and issued a certificate\n\nof appealability on the Fifth Amendment issue.         We affirm.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            In its opinion on Nom's direct appeal, the SJC summarized\n\nthe relevant facts.     Commonwealth v. Nom, 686 N.E.2d 1017, 1020\n\n(Mass. 1997).    On April 17, 1994, in Lowell, Massachusetts, Nom's\n\nwife was found dead in Nom's parked car with a gunshot wound to the\n\nhead.   That    morning,   police   officers   from   the   Lowell   police\n\ndepartment spoke by telephone with Nom, who agreed to accompany\n\nthem to the police station.         In response to questioning at the\n\npolice station, Nom initially told Inspector John Guilfoyle and\n\nTrooper James M. Connolly that he had remained at home throughout\n\nthe night.    He stated that his wife had left at some point during\n\nthe evening with his car and that he had not seen her or his car\n\nsince then.     At this point, the police officers had not given Nom\n\nhis Miranda warning. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n            Subsequently, the police received information from Nom's\n\nfamily members that he had gone out with his wife the previous\n\nevening and had not remained home as he stated.             In response to\n\nthis information, a police officer advised Nom of his Miranda\n\nrights at approximately 12:35 p.m., and Nom immediately waived\n\nthose rights.    However, when the police subsequently asked to test\n\nhis hands for gunshot residue, Nom stated that he wanted an\n\n\ndecision.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fattorney present.    All questioning ceased and all police personnel\n\nleft the room.    Trooper Connolly then reentered and sat down but\n\ndid not speak.     Nom shrugged his shoulders and Connolly did the\n\nsame.    Nom then said, \"I admit it.\"   Connolly replied, \"What?\" and\n\nNom then said, contrary to his initial statement, that he was out\n\nat a restaurant with his wife the night of the shooting.   Inspector\n\nGuilfoyle then reentered the room and asked Nom why he wanted an\n\nattorney.    Nom replied that he wanted an attorney only for the\n\npurpose of witnessing the gunshot residue test and that he would\n\ncontinue to talk to the police without an attorney present.3      At\n\nthis point, Nom was again given his Miranda warnings orally and by\n\na card which he signed.\n\n            In the ensuing hours, Nom gave the police a second and\n\nthen a third written statement regarding his involvement in the\n\nshooting.   In the second statement he claimed that, while he was in\n\nthe restroom of the restaurant, his wife and a man with whom she\n\nhad been flirting left in Nom's car.     In the third statement, Nom\n\nsaid that he saw his wife leaving the restaurant with the man.    He\n\nthen followed them to the car and got into an altercation with the\n\n\n\n     3\n        The trial court elaborated that when Guilfoyle asked Nom\nwhy he wanted an attorney, \"Nom answered that he wanted an attorney\nto witness the testing of his hands. He was asked whether there\nwas any other reason and said, 'No.' He was asked if he would\ncontinue to speak to the police without an attorney and he\nindicated that he would.\" Commonwealth v. Nom, No. 94-864, slip op.\nat 6 (Mass. Dist. Ct. June 21, 1995)(order on defendant's motion to\nsuppress).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fman, which ended when the man fired a handgun at Nom and drove off\n\nwith Nom's wife.    Soon after giving this last statement, Nom was\n\narrested.    The next morning, after learning that the police had\n\ngathered evidence identifying him as the shooter, Nom gave a fourth\n\nwritten statement asserting that he had shot his wife accidentally\n\nduring an argument.\n\n            Nom moved to suppress the statement he made before the\n\npolice advised him of his Miranda rights (about his wife leaving\n\nwith his car); the trial court granted this suppression motion.\n\nNom also moved to suppress his statements made after he received\n\nhis Miranda warnings, arguing that (1) they were all tainted by the\n\nfact that his first statement was secured in violation of his\n\nMiranda rights, and (2) some of the statements were made in\n\nresponse to questions he was asked after he had unambiguously\n\ninvoked his right to counsel.   The trial judge denied this motion\n\nto suppress on two grounds: (1) the second, third and fourth\n\nstatements were not tainted because his initial statement was not\n\nincriminating--Nom said that he had neither seen nor heard from his\n\nwife since she left home with his car the previous evening;4 and\n\n\n     4\n        There is a presumption that a statement made following the\nviolation of Miranda rights is tainted. \"This presumption may be\novercome by showing either: (1) after the illegally obtained\nstatement, there was a break in the stream of events that\nsufficiently insulated the post-Miranda statement from the tainted\none; or (2) the illegally obtained statement did not incriminate\nthe defendant, or, as it is more colloquially put, the cat was not\nout of the bag.\" Commonwealth v. Nom, No. 94-864, slip op. at 11\n(quoting Commonwealth v. Osachuk, 635 N.E.2d 1192, 1196 (1994)).\n\n                                -5-\n\f(2) Nom's request for counsel was \"scrupulously honored\" since all\n\nquestioning ceased and was only resumed when Nom initiated further\n\nquestioning by spontaneously stating \"I admit it.\" The trial court\n\nfound that Inspector Guilfoyle's inquiry as to why Nom wanted an\n\nattorney was \"reasonable under the circumstances given . . .\n\n[Nom's] spontaneous statement to Connolly.\"                Commonwealth v. Nom,\n\nNo. 94-864, slip op. at 13.         On direct appeal, the SJC agreed with\n\nthese determinations.\n\n            On March 6, 2000, Nom filed a timely habeas petition in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\nasserting, inter alia, that Inspector Guilfoyle violated his Fifth\n\nAmendment right to counsel when he asked Nom why he had requested\n\na lawyer.     The district court denied the writ: \"Although the\n\nquestioning    of    a     suspect's       request    for     an    attorney   is\n\nconstitutionally impermissible under ordinary circumstances, the\n\nSJC did not unreasonably apply federal law to the facts as it found\n\nthem in this case.\"        Nom v. Spencer, No. 00-10413, 2002 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 16099, at *6 (D. Mass. Aug. 28, 2002).                       Petitioner now\n\nappeals.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            The standard of review is set forth in the AEDPA statute,\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 2244-2266 (2002).           On the grounds pertinent to this\n\ncase, a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner\n\nif   it   finds,   inter    alia,   that     the   state    court    adjudication\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f\"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable      application      of,     clearly   established      Federal\n\nlaw. . . .\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1).            This section \"defines two\n\ncategories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal\n\nhabeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in\n\nstate court.\"      Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404-05 (2000).\n\nUnder the \"contrary to\" prong, a federal court may grant the writ\n\nif the state court \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that\n\nreached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state\n\ncourt decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a\n\nset of materially indistinguishable facts.\"          Id. at 412-13.     Under\n\nthe \"unreasonable application\" prong, a federal court may grant the\n\nwrit if the state court \"identifies the correct governing legal\n\nprinciple from [the Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably\n\napplies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\"              Id.\n\nat 413.       With respect to this second prong, the state court's\n\ndetermination must be unreasonable, not simply incorrect, and\n\nunreasonableness is an objective standard.           Id. at 410-11.    \"If it\n\nis a close question whether the state decision is in error, then\n\nthe   state    decision   cannot    be   an   unreasonable   application.\"\n\nMcCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                     IV.\n\n              In affirming the trial court's conclusion that Nom's\n\nFifth Amendment right to counsel was not violated, the SJC noted\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe trial court's finding that \"[t]hroughout the morning of his\n\ncustody, the defendant spoke freely with the police,\" Nom, 686\n\nN.E.2d at 1022, and only requested an attorney when the police\n\nattempted to test his hands for blood and gunshot residue.                     At that\n\npoint,   \"all   questioning    ceased\"       until     Nom      \"initiated     further\n\nconversation by stating 'I admit it.'\" Id. (emphasis in original).\n\nThe SJC agreed with the trial court that Inspector Guilfoyle's\n\nsubsequent inquiry as to why Nom wanted an attorney was \"no more\n\nthan a request for a clarification of the inconsistency between his\n\nearlier request and his subsequent initiation of conversation with\n\nTrooper Connolly,\" and was \"neither designed nor reasonably likely\n\nto elicit an incriminating response.\"                Id.\n\n           Nom argues that the SJC's decision was contrary to the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 100\n\n(1984), because it used the inconsistency between Nom's request for\n\ncounsel and his subsequent initiation of conversation with Trooper\n\nConnolly to cast retrospective ambiguity on the clarity of his\n\n\"crystal clear\"     invocation      of   his    right      to    have    an   attorney\n\npresent.     Nom    also   argues    that      the    SJC's      decision     was   \"an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as\n\ndetermined   by    the   Supreme    Court\"     in     Miranda,     and   Edwards    v.\n\nArizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981), and their progeny.                  We turn to those\n\ncontentions.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fA.   \"Contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law\"\n\n           To assess Nom's argument that the SJC's decision was in\n\ndirect conflict with the Supreme Court's holding in Smith v.\n\nIllinois, we first note the careful distinction drawn by the\n\nSupreme   Court   in   that   case   between   the   defendant's   initial\n\ninvocation of the right to counsel and his subsequent waiver of\n\nthat right.\n\n           The courts below were able to construe Smith's\n           request for counsel as \"ambiguous\" only by\n           looking to Smith's subsequent responses to\n           continued police questioning and by concluding\n           that,   \"considered    in   total,\"    Smith's\n           \"statements\" were equivocal.     This line of\n           analysis is unprecedented and untenable. . . .\n           Where nothing about the request for counsel or\n           the circumstances leading up to the request\n           would render it ambiguous, all questioning\n           must cease.     In these circumstances, an\n           accused's subsequent statements are relevant\n           only to the question whether the accused\n           waived the right he had invoked. Invocation\n           and waiver are entirely distinct inquiries,\n           and the two must not be blurred by merging\n           them together.\n\nSmith, 469 U.S. at 97-98 (internal citations omitted).\n\n           The trial court always described Nom's initial request\n\nfor counsel as unambiguous.\n\n           The Court finds that upon Nom's request for an\n           attorney, all conversation ceased.         Nom\n           reinitiated conversation when he asserted, \"I\n           admit it.\" Inspector Guilfoyle's attempt to\n           clarify Nom's statement that he wanted an\n           attorney was appropriate in the context of\n           this situation.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fCommonwealth v. Nom, No. 94-864, slip op. at 13.              The SJC noted\n\nthis finding in its recitation of the facts: \"When the police\n\nsubsequently requested to test his hands for gunshot residue,\n\nhowever, the defendant stated that he wanted an attorney present.\n\nThe questioning ceased, and all police personnel left the room.\"\n\nNom, 686 N.E.2d at 1020.      These statements by the trial court and\n\nthe SJC indicate that the clarity of Nom's request for an attorney\n\nwas never in question--the police officers, the trial court and the\n\nSJC all understood that he had unambiguously invoked his right to\n\nan attorney.\n\n            Moreover, the SJC correctly stated that once a suspect\n\nhas invoked his right to counsel, police interrogation must cease\n\nand   may   only   be    resumed   if   the   suspect   initiated    further\n\ncommunication with the police.          However, as the SJC stated, \"the\n\nburden remains upon the prosecution to show that subsequent events\n\nindicated a waiver of the Fifth Amendment right to have counsel\n\npresent during     the    interrogation.\"      Nom,   686   N.E.2d   at   1022\n\n(quoting Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U.S. 1039, 1044 (1983)). Contrary\n\nto Nom's interpretation, the SJC did not interpret Inspector\n\nGuilfoyle's question about why Nom wanted an attorney as an attempt\n\nto clarify Nom's ambiguous invocation of his right to counsel.\n\nInstead, the SJC agreed with the trial court that the question was\n\nan attempt to clarify whether, by initiating further communication\n\nwith the police, Nom was waiving his clearly invoked right to\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcounsel. \"Guilfoyle's asking why he wanted an attorney in these\n\ncircumstances was no more than a request for a clarification of the\n\ninconsistency    between      his    earlier        request      and    his   subsequent\n\ninitiation of conversation with Trooper Connolly.\" Nom, 686 N.E.2d\n\nat 1022.\n\n            Understandably,         Nom     cites    the    SJC's       statement   that\n\nInspector Guilfoyle's question was \"a response to the defendant's\n\nambiguously invoking his right to counsel and then initiating\n\nfurther conversation with the statement 'I admit it.'\" (emphasis\n\nadded).      Read     in    isolation,      the     placement      of    \"ambiguously\"\n\nimmediately before \"invoking\" suggests that the SJC did not heed\n\nthe Supreme Court's admonition in Smith that \"invocation and waiver\n\nare entirely distinct inquiries, and the two must not be blurred by\n\nmerging them together.\"         Smith, 469 U.S. at 98.             However, in light\n\nof   the   entirety    of    the    SJC's    opinion       and   the     trial   court's\n\ndecision, we conclude that the SJC was focusing on the issue of\n\nwaiver (i.e. the initiation of conversation by Nom as waiver of his\n\npreviously invoked right to counsel).                 Hence, the SJC recognized\n\nthe principle of Smith that \"an accused's subsequent statements\n\nwere relevant only to the question whether the accused waived the\n\nright he had invoked,\" Id., and its decision was not contrary to\n\nclearly established federal law.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fB.   \"Unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law\"\n\n            Having concluded that the SJC recognized the centrality\n\nof the waiver issue in Nom's appeal, we must now address Nom's\n\ncontention   that   the       SJC's    resolution    of   this   issue   was   an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\n\n            After Nom initiated further communication by stating \"I\n\nadmit it,\" the police did not forge ahead with questioning Nom\n\nabout this admission.           Instead, Inspector Guilfoyle sought to\n\nclarify whether Nom's statement was intended as a waiver of his\n\nright to counsel by asking him why he wanted an attorney.                In Davis\n\nv. United States, 512 U.S. 452 (1994), the Supreme Court held that\n\n\"if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or\n\nequivocal    in   that    a     reasonable     officer     in    light   of    the\n\ncircumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be\n\ninvoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the\n\ncessation of questioning.\"            Id., at 459.    The Supreme Court then\n\nelaborated on this point:\n\n            when the officers conducting the questioning\n            reasonably do not know whether or not the\n            suspect wants a lawyer, a rule requiring the\n            immediate cessation of questioning \"would\n            transform the Miranda safeguards into wholly\n            irrational obstacles to legitimate police\n            investigative activity,\" . . . because it\n            would needlessly prevent the police from\n            questioning a suspect in the absence of\n            counsel even if the suspect did not wish to\n            have a lawyer present.

Nom,</i> 426 Mass. 152, 686 N.E.2d 1017, 1020 (1997). On April 17, 1994, in Lowell, Massachusetts, Nom's wife was found dead in Nom's parked car with a gunshot wound to the head. That morning, police officers from the Lowell police department spoke by telephone with Nom, who agreed to accompany them to the police station. In response to questioning at the police station, Nom initially told Inspector John Guilfoyle and Trooper James M. Connolly that he had remained at home throughout the night. He stated that his wife had left at some point during the evening with his car and that he had not seen her or his car since then. At this point, the police officers had not given Nom his <i>Miranda</i> warning. <i>See Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the police received information from Nom's family members that he had gone out with his wife the previous evening and had not remained home as he stated. In response to this information, a police officer advised Nom of his <i>Miranda</i> rights at approximately 12:35 p.m., and Nom immediately waived those rights. However, when the police subsequently asked to test his hands for gunshot residue, Nom stated that he wanted an attorney present. All questioning ceased and all police personnel left the room. Trooper Connolly then reentered and sat down but did not speak. Nom shrugged his shoulders and Connolly did the same. Nom then said, \"I admit it.\" Connolly replied, \"What?\" and Nom then said, contrary to his initial statement, that he was out at a restaurant with his wife the night of the shooting. Inspector Guilfoyle then reentered the room and asked Nom why he wanted an attorney. Nom replied that he wanted an attorney only for the purpose of witnessing the gunshot residue test and that he would continue to talk to the police without an attorney present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At this point, Nom was again given his <i>Miranda</i> warnings orally and by a card which he signed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ensuing hours, Nom gave the police a second and then a third written statement regarding his involvement in the shooting. In the second statement he claimed that, while he was in the restroom of the restaurant, his wife and a man with whom she had been flirting left in Nom's car. In the third statement, Nom said that he saw his wife leaving the restaurant with the man. He then followed them to the car and got into an altercation with the man, which ended when the man fired a handgun at Nom and drove off with Nom's wife. Soon after giving this last statement, Nom was arrested. The next morning, after learning that the police had gathered evidence identifying him as the shooter, Nom gave a fourth written statement asserting that he had shot his wife accidentally during an argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nom moved to suppress the statement he made before the police advised him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights (about his wife leaving with his car); the trial court granted this suppression motion. Nom also moved to suppress his statements made after he received his <i>Miranda</i> warnings, arguing that (1) they were all tainted by the fact that his first statement was secured in violation of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and (2) some of the statements were made in response to questions he was asked after he had unambiguously invoked his right to counsel. The trial judge denied this motion to suppress on two grounds: (1) the second, third and fourth statements were not tainted because his initial statement was not incriminating &#8212; Nom said that he had neither seen nor heard from his wife since she left home with his car the previous evening;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and (2) Nom's request for counsel was \"scrupulously honored\" since all questioning ceased and was only resumed when Nom initiated further questioning by spontaneously stating \"I admit it.\" The trial court found that Inspector Guilfoyle's inquiry as to why Nom wanted an attorney was \"reasonable under the circumstances given ... [Nom's] spontaneous statement to Connolly.\" <i>Commonwealth v. Nom,</i> No. 94-864, slip op. at 13. On direct appeal, the SJC agreed with these determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 6, 2000, Nom filed a timely habeas petition in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts asserting, inter alia, that Inspector Guilfoyle violated his Fifth Amendment right to counsel when he asked Nom why he had requested a lawyer. The district court denied the writ: \"Although the questioning of a suspect's request for an attorney is constitutionally impermissible under ordinary circumstances, the SJC did not unreasonably apply federal law to the facts as it found them in this case.\" <i>Nom v. Spencer,</i> No. 00-10413, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16099, at *6 (D.Mass. Aug. 28, 2002).

On the grounds pertinent to this case, a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if it finds, <i>inter alia,</i> that the state court adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1). This section \"defines two categories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal habeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 404-05, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Under the \"contrary to\" prong, a federal court may grant the writ if the state court \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Under the \"unreasonable application\" prong, a federal court may grant the writ if the state court \"identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. With respect to this second prong, the state court's determination must be unreasonable, not simply incorrect, and unreasonableness is an objective standard. <i>Id.</i> at 410-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495. \"If it is a close question whether the state decision is in error, then the state decision cannot be an unreasonable application.\" <i>McCambridge v.

At that point, \"all questioning ceased\" until Nom \"initiated further conversation by stating `<i>I admit it.'\" Id.</i> (emphasis in original). The SJC agreed with the trial court that Inspector Guilfoyle's subsequent inquiry as to why Nom wanted an attorney was \"no more than a request for a clarification of the inconsistency between his earlier request and his subsequent initiation of conversation with Trooper Connolly,\" and was \"neither designed nor reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nom argues that the SJC's decision was contrary to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Smith v. Illinois,</i> 469 U.S. 91, 100, 105 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984), because it used the inconsistency between Nom's request for counsel and his subsequent initiation of conversation with Trooper Connolly to cast retrospective ambiguity on the clarity of his \"crystal clear\" invocation of his right to have an attorney present. Nom also argues that the SJC's decision was \"an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\" in <i>Miranda,</i> and <i>Edwards v. Arizona,</i> 451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), and their progeny.

This line of analysis is unprecedented and untenable.... Where nothing about the request for counsel or the circumstances leading up to the request would render it ambiguous, all questioning must cease. In these circumstances, an accused's subsequent statements are relevant only to the question whether the accused waived the right he had invoked. Invocation and waiver are entirely distinct inquiries, and the two must not be blurred by merging them together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Smith,</i> 469 U.S. at 97-98, 105 S.Ct. 490 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court always described Nom's initial request for counsel as unambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court finds that upon Nom's request for an attorney, all conversation ceased.

Nom,</i> No. 94-864, slip op. at 13. The SJC noted this finding in its recitation of the facts: \"When the police subsequently requested to test his hands for gunshot residue, however, the defendant stated that he wanted an attorney present. The questioning ceased, and all police personnel left the room.\" <i>Nom,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 1020. These statements by the trial court and the SJC indicate that the clarity of Nom's request for an attorney was never in question &#8212; the police officers, the trial court and the SJC all understood that he had unambiguously invoked his right to an attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the SJC correctly stated that once a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, police interrogation must cease and may only be resumed if the suspect initiated further communication with the police. However, as the SJC stated, \"the burden remains upon the prosecution to show that subsequent events indicated a waiver of the Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present during the interrogation.\" <i>Nom,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 1022 (quoting <i>Oregon v. Bradshaw,</i> 462 U.S. 1039, 1044, 103 S.Ct. 2830, 77 L.Ed.2d 405 (1983)). Contrary to Nom's interpretation, the SJC did not interpret Inspector Guilfoyle's question about why Nom wanted an attorney as an attempt to clarify Nom's ambiguous invocation of his right to counsel. Instead, the SJC agreed with the trial court that the question was an attempt to clarify whether, by initiating further communication with the police, Nom was waiving his clearly invoked right to counsel. \"Guilfoyle's asking why he wanted an attorney in these circumstances was no more than a request for a clarification of the inconsistency between his earlier request and his subsequent initiation of conversation with Trooper Connolly.\" <i>Nom,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 1022.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understandably, Nom cites the SJC's statement that Inspector Guilfoyle's question was \"a response to the defendant's <i>ambiguously</i> invoking his right to counsel and then initiating further conversation with the statement `I admit it.'\" (emphasis added). Read in isolation, the placement of \"ambiguously\" immediately before \"invoking\" suggests that the SJC did not heed the Supreme Court's admonition in <i>Smith</i> that \"invocation and waiver are entirely distinct inquiries, and the two must not be blurred by merging them together.\" <i>Smith,</i> 469 U.S. at 98, 105 S.Ct. 490. However, in light of the entirety of the SJC's opinion and the trial court's decision, we conclude that the SJC was focusing on the issue of waiver (i.e. the initiation of conversation by Nom as waiver of his previously invoked right to counsel). Hence, the SJC recognized the principle of <i>Smith</i> that \"an accused's subsequent statements were relevant only to the question whether the accused waived the right he had invoked,\" <i>Id.,</i> and its decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. \"Unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the SJC recognized the centrality of the waiver issue in Nom's appeal, we must now address Nom's contention that the SJC's resolution of this issue was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Nom initiated further communication by stating \"I admit it,\" the police did not forge ahead with questioning Nom about this admission. Instead, Inspector Guilfoyle sought to clarify whether Nom's statement was intended as a waiver of his right to counsel by asking him why he wanted an attorney. In <i>Davis v. United States,</i> 512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994), the Supreme Court held that \"if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <i>might</i> be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350. The Supreme Court then elaborated on this point:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">when the officers conducting the questioning reasonably do not know whether or not the suspect wants a lawyer, a rule requiring the immediate cessation of questioning \"would transform the <i>Miranda</i> safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity,\" ... because it would needlessly prevent the police from questioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if the suspect did not wish to have a lawyer present. Nothing in <i>Edwards</i> requires the provision of counsel to a suspect who consents to answer questions without the assistance of a lawyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 460, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the Supreme Court in <i>Davis</i> was addressing an ambiguous request for counsel, not an ambiguous waiver of a prior request for counsel. However, a defendant who has previously invoked counsel unambiguously could, as Nom did here, volunteer a statement in the presence of a police officer subsequent to that invocation that creates an ambiguity in the mind of a reasonable police officer about whether the defendant is now waiving his right to counsel. In the presence of such an ambiguous waiver of a prior request for counsel, the observation of the Supreme Court in <i>Davis</i> seems apt: \"When a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officer to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney.\" <i>Id.</i> at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As the SJC noted, \"in ordinary circumstances, there would be no proper basis for an interrogator's asking a suspect his reason for requesting an attorney.\" <i>Nom,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 1023.

On April 17, 1994, in Lowell, Massachusetts, Nom's wife was found dead in Nom's parked car with a gunshot wound to the head. That morning, police officers from the Lowell police department spoke by telephone with Nom, who agreed to accompany them to the police station. In response to questioning at the police station, Nom initially told Inspector John Guilfoyle and Trooper James M. Connolly that he had remained at home throughout the night. He stated that his wife had left at some point during the evening with his car and that he had not seen her or his car since then. At this point, the police officers had not given Nom his <i>Miranda</i> warning. <i>See Miranda v.

In response to this information, a police officer advised Nom of his <i>Miranda</i> rights at approximately 12:35 p.m., and Nom immediately waived those rights. However, when the police subsequently asked to test his hands for gunshot residue, Nom stated that he wanted an attorney present. All questioning ceased and all police personnel left the room. Trooper Connolly then reentered and sat down but did not speak. Nom shrugged his shoulders and Connolly did the same. Nom then said, \"I admit it.\" Connolly replied, \"What?\" and Nom then said, contrary to his initial statement, that he was out at a restaurant with his wife the night of the shooting. Inspector Guilfoyle then reentered the room and asked Nom why he wanted an attorney. Nom replied that he wanted an attorney only for the purpose of witnessing the gunshot residue test and that he would continue to talk to the police without an attorney present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At this point, Nom was again given his <i>Miranda</i> warnings orally and by a card which he signed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ensuing hours, Nom gave the police a second and then a third written statement regarding his involvement in the shooting. In the second statement he claimed that, while he was in the restroom of the restaurant, his wife and a man with whom she had been flirting left in Nom's car. In the third statement, Nom said that he saw his wife leaving the restaurant with the man. He then followed them to the car and got into an altercation with the man, which ended when the man fired a handgun at Nom and drove off with Nom's wife. Soon after giving this last statement, Nom was arrested. The next morning, after learning that the police had gathered evidence identifying him as the shooter, Nom gave a fourth written statement asserting that he had shot his wife accidentally during an argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nom moved to suppress the statement he made before the police advised him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights (about his wife leaving with his car); the trial court granted this suppression motion. Nom also moved to suppress his statements made after he received his <i>Miranda</i> warnings, arguing that (1) they were all tainted by the fact that his first statement was secured in violation of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and (2) some of the statements were made in response to questions he was asked after he had unambiguously invoked his right to counsel. The trial judge denied this motion to suppress on two grounds: (1) the second, third and fourth statements were not tainted because his initial statement was not incriminating &#8212; Nom said that he had neither seen nor heard from his wife since she left home with his car the previous evening;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and (2) Nom's request for counsel was \"scrupulously honored\" since all questioning ceased and was only resumed when Nom initiated further questioning by spontaneously stating \"I admit it.\" The trial court found that Inspector Guilfoyle's inquiry as to why Nom wanted an attorney was \"reasonable under the circumstances given ... [Nom's] spontaneous statement to Connolly.\" <i>Commonwealth v. Nom,</i> No. 94-864, slip op. at 13.

This line of analysis is unprecedented and untenable.... Where nothing about the request for counsel or the circumstances leading up to the request would render it ambiguous, all questioning must cease.

These statements by the trial court and the SJC indicate that the clarity of Nom's request for an attorney was never in question &#8212; the police officers, the trial court and the SJC all understood that he had unambiguously invoked his right to an attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the SJC correctly stated that once a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, police interrogation must cease and may only be resumed if the suspect initiated further communication with the police.

Contrary to Nom's interpretation, the SJC did not interpret Inspector Guilfoyle's question about why Nom wanted an attorney as an attempt to clarify Nom's ambiguous invocation of his right to counsel. Instead, the SJC agreed with the trial court that the question was an attempt to clarify whether, by initiating further communication with the police, Nom was waiving his clearly invoked right to counsel. \"Guilfoyle's asking why he wanted an attorney in these circumstances was no more than a request for a clarification of the inconsistency between his earlier request and his subsequent initiation of conversation with Trooper Connolly.\" <i>Nom,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 1022.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understandably, Nom cites the SJC's statement that Inspector Guilfoyle's question was \"a response to the defendant's <i>ambiguously</i> invoking his right to counsel and then initiating further conversation with the statement `I admit it.'\" (emphasis added). Read in isolation, the placement of \"ambiguously\" immediately before \"invoking\" suggests that the SJC did not heed the Supreme Court's admonition in <i>Smith</i> that \"invocation and waiver are entirely distinct inquiries, and the two must not be blurred by merging them together.\" <i>Smith,</i> 469 U.S. at 98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111288\"><a href=\"/opinion/111288/smith-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, in light of the entirety of the SJC's opinion and the trial court's decision, we conclude that the SJC was focusing on the issue of waiver (i.e. the initiation of conversation by Nom as waiver of his previously invoked right to counsel). Hence, the SJC recognized the principle of <i>Smith</i> that \"an accused's subsequent statements were relevant only to the question whether the accused waived the right he had invoked,\" <i>Id.,</i> and its decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. \"Unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the SJC recognized the centrality of the waiver issue in Nom's appeal, we must now address Nom's contention that the SJC's resolution of this issue was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Nom initiated further communication by stating \"I admit it,\" the police did not forge ahead with questioning Nom about this admission.

However, a defendant who has previously invoked counsel unambiguously could, as Nom did here, volunteer a statement in the presence of a police officer subsequent to that invocation that creates an ambiguity in the mind of a reasonable police officer about whether the defendant is now waiving his right to counsel. In the presence of such an ambiguous waiver of a prior request for counsel, the observation of the Supreme Court in <i>Davis</i> seems apt: \"When a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officer to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney.\" <i>Id.</i> at 461, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117863\"><a href=\"/opinion/117863/davis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the SJC agreed with the trial court that Inspector Guilfoyle's question to Nom about why he wanted an attorney present was reasonably designed to clarify an ambiguity created by Nom himself with his spontaneous statement, \"I admit it.\" Nom's answer to Guilfoyle's question &#8212; that he wanted the attorney present only for the purpose of witnessing the gunshot residue test &#8212; indicates that Nom understood the question, and that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to have an attorney present during the subsequent interrogation by the officers. The application by the SJC of the principles of <i>Davis</i> to the facts of this case was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nom filed an untimely petition for re-hearing, which the SJC denied on January 26, 1998.
