Petitioner Abdel Hakim Moustafa El Desouky\n\nRagab (\"petitioner\") appeals from the decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration   Appeals's   (\"BIA\")    to   deny   his   motion   to   reopen.\n\nFinding no abuse of discretion in the BIA's order, we affirm.\n\n          Petitioner is a native and citizen of Egypt.               He was\n\nadmitted into the United States on July 16, 2000 as a crewman for\n\na temporary period -- no longer than 29 days -- and remained in the\n\nUnited States beyond that period without further authorization.\n\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")1 issued a notice\n\nto appear charging him with removability.              Petitioner appeared\n\nbefore an Immigration Judge on December 11, 2001.2\n\n          At the hearing, counsel indicated that on April 30, 2001,\n\nthe Brushworks Company filed an application for labor certification\n\non petitioner's behalf with the Massachusetts Department of Labor.\n\nPetitioner argued to the Immigration Judge, that based on the\n\napplication, he was eligible for adjustment of status under 8\n\n\n\n\n1\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(BICE). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n2\n    At petitioner's second hearing, held on July 13, 2001, the\nImmigration Judge asked petitioner if he had any fear of returning\nto Egypt, the designated country of removal. Petitioner reaffirmed\nthe answer he had given at an earlier hearing on July 10, 2001; he\nhad no fear of returning to Egypt.      Therefore, any claims for\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\nAgainst Torture were deemed abandoned.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fU.S.C. § 1255(i);3 if he was so eligible, he would then be a\n\ncandidate for permanent residence.    After consulting counsel for\n\nthe INS and for petitioner, the Immigration Judge concluded that\n\npetitioner was not eligible for adjustment of status, but granted\n\npetitioner's request for voluntary departure in lieu of removal.\n\n           Petitioner appealed to the BIA on December 21, 2001; he\n\nclaimed that the Immigration Judge erred by denying him adjustment\n\nof status, or in the alternative, a continuance to seek adjustment\n\nof status.   The BIA affirmed without opinion on May 8, 2003.    On\n\nMay 30, 2003, petitioner filed a motion to reopen before the BIA,\n\narguing that his visa petition filed on May 5, 2003 was pending\n\nand, if granted, he was planning to seek adjustment of status.\n\n\n3\n    This statute states in relevant part:\n\n      (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c)\n      of this section, an alien physically present in the United\n      States --\n           (A) who --\n                 (i) entered the United States without inspection\n                 . . . [and] . . .\n           (B) who is the beneficiary . . . of . . .\n                 (ii) an application for a labor certification under\n                 section 1182(a)(5)(A) of this title that was filed\n                 pursuant to the regulations of the Secretary of\n                 Labor on or before [April 30, 2001]; and\n           (C) who, in the case of a beneficiary of . . . an\n                 application for labor certification, described in\n                 subparagraph (B) that was filed after January 14,\n                 1998, is physically present in the United States on\n                 December 21, 2000;\n      may apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his or\n      her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent\n      residence.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(1).\n\n                                -3-\n\f                The motion to reopen was denied on August 27, 2003.                      The\n\nBIA     noted    that     while    crewmen       are   generally         prohibited     from\n\nadjusting        their    status,       they    may    do   so     \"if    they   meet    the\n\nrequirements of section 245(i) [codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)] of\n\nthe [Immigration and Nationality] Act, and of 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10\n\n.   .   .   .\"      The    BIA    further       stated      that    petitioner     may    be\n\n'grandfathered' into eligibility because his application for a\n\nlabor certification was filed before April 30, 2001.                         See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1245.10 (a)(1)(B).              Nevertheless, the BIA determined that the\n\ninformation        submitted       by     petitioner        showed       that    his    visa\n\napplication was filed on May 5, 2003, with no indication that it\n\nhad ever been approved.             Therefore, the BIA could not adjust his\n\nstatus as the beneficiary of an approved visa petition.                                See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(i)(2).          Petitioner appeals this decision.4\n\n                The government argues that we have no jurisdiction over\n\nthe initial BIA affirmance of the Immigration Judge's decision\n\ndetermining        the    issue     of    adjustment        of     status   because      the\n\npetitioner appealed only from the denial of the motion to reopen.\n\nUnder the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility\n\nAct of 1996, all final BIA orders must be appealed to this court\n\n\n\n\n4\n   A further motion to reopen was filed on October 6, 2003. No\ndisposition appears in the administrative record. According to the\ngovernment's brief, it was denied on February 6, 2004.\n\n                                               -4-\n\fwithin thirty days.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1).5        A timely appeal\n\nis a strict jurisdictional requirement. See Nascimento v. INS, 274\n\nF.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Sankarapillai v. Ashcroft,\n\n330 F.3d 1004, 1005-06 (7th Cir. 2003) (collecting cases).             The\n\nperiod in which to appeal BIA orders continues to run despite\n\npetitioner's motions to reopen and reconsider; such motions are\n\nappealed separately.         See Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 405-06\n\n(1995)(holding that filing motions for reconsideration does not\n\ntoll or enlarge the time allowed for seeking judicial review). The\n\npetition for review in this appeal was filed on September 26, 2003.\n\nTherefore, we have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the BIA's\n\naffirmance without opinion issued on May 8, 2003.          We do, however,\n\nhave jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the August 27, 2003 BIA\n\ndecision denying the motion to reopen.\n\n           \"Motions     to   reopen    are    disfavored   in   deportation\n\nproceedings because of the strong public interest in bringing\n\nlitigation to a close.\"      Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st\n\nCir.   2003)(internal    quotations     and   citations    omitted).   Two\n\nthreshold requirements must be met to prevail on a motion to\n\nreopen: \"it [must] establish a prima facie case for the underlying\n\nsubstantive relief sought and . . . it [must] introduce previously\n\n\n\n\n5\n   \"The petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days\nafter the date of the final order of removal.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252\n(b)(1).\n\n                                      -5-\n\funavailable, material evidence.\"             Id.   (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted).         We review for abuse of discretion.        Id.\n\n               Petitioner has not made a prima facie case for the\n\nunderlying relief.          The BIA recognized that petitioner may have\n\nbeen     eligible     for     adjustment     as    a   beneficiary        of   the\n\n\"grandfathering\" provision under Section 245(i) of the INA by\n\nfiling    an    application    for   labor    certification   on     or    before\n\nApril 30, 2001.\n\n               Petitioner does not currently meet the second statutory\n\nrequirement for adjustment of status, however, which states that\n\n\"[u]pon receipt of such [a labor certification] application . . .,\n\nthe Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien . . . if --\n\n(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa . . .; and\n\n(B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the\n\ntime the application is filed.\"            8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(2) (emphasis\n\nsupplied). The regulations define the term \"immediately available\"\n\nas:\n\n               (1) Availability of immigrant visas under [8\n               U.S.C. § 1255] . . . . If the applicant is a\n               preference alien, the current Department of\n               State Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Bulletin\n               will be consulted to determine whether an\n               immigrant visa is immediately available. An\n               immigrant visa is considered available for\n               accepting and processing the application Form\n               I-485 [for adjustment of status] if the\n               preference category application has a priority\n               date on the waiting list which is earlier than\n               the date shown in the Bulletin (or the\n               Bulletin   shows   that   numbers   for   visa\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          applicants   in     his    or   her    category    are\n          current).\n\n8 C.F.R. § 245.1(g)(1).\n\n          The BIA held that\n\n          the information submitted . . . in connection\n          with this motion indicates only that the\n          [Department of Homeland Security] received a\n          visa petition filed on [petitioner's] behalf\n          on May 5, 2003.        We have received no\n          information that the visa petition has been\n          approved.    Accordingly, the respondent is\n          currently not eligible to adjust his status as\n          he is not the beneficiary of an approved visa\n          petition, and thus he does not have a visa\n          immediately available to him.       [8 U.S.C.\n          § 1255(i)(2)(A)].   As the respondent is not\n          currently eligible for the relief he seeks his\n          motion must be denied.\n\nPetitioner,   nevertheless,    argues     that   he   was   entitled    to   a\n\ncontinuance by virtue of the pending employment visa petition, the\n\napproval of which would entitle him to adjustment of status.\n\n          In Hernández v. Ashcroft, 345 F.3d 824, 841-42 (9th Cir.\n\n2003), the INS argued that in order to qualify for adjustment of\n\nstatus the petitioner must show that a visa had been approved on\n\nher behalf.   The Ninth Circuit stated that, assuming arguendo this\n\nwas the applicable rule, Hernández had made a showing that she was\n\nthe beneficiary of an immediately available visa because her\n\napplication had been approved and she was given a priority date.\n\nId.   Hernández's   application     had   been   processed    and    she   was\n\neligible under the second family preference category.              Id.; see 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1153(a)(2)(A).\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          In contrast, petitioner here has provided no information,\n\nother than the INS's receipt of his I-140 visa application, to show\n\nthat a visa was immediately available to him.             Since petitioner is\n\na preference alien under the employment preference categories, his\n\nvisa is   not    considered   immediately     available     until   he   has   a\n\npriority date on the waiting list which is earlier than the date\n\nshown on the Department of State Bulletin as specified in 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 245.1(g)(1).    Petitioner has made no showing that his Form I-140\n\nhad been approved or that he was allocated a priority date.              See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 245.1(g)(2).\n\n          Because petitioner was not eligible for adjustment of\n\nstatus under the statute, the BIA did not commit an error of law on\n\nthe substantive issue. See Lasprilla v. Ashcroft, 365 F.3d 98, 101\n\n(1st Cir. 2004)(stating that a motion to reconsider was properly\n\ndenied when     petitioner    failed   to   show   that    he   qualified   for\n\nadjustment of status under the 'grandfathering' provision). We can\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

The\n\nBIA     noted    that     while    crewmen       are   generally         prohibited     from\n\nadjusting        their    status,       they    may    do   so     \"if    they   meet    the\n\nrequirements of section 245(i) [codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)] of\n\nthe [Immigration and Nationality] Act, and of 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10\n\n.   .   .   .\"      The    BIA    further       stated      that    petitioner     may    be\n\n'grandfathered' into eligibility because his application for a\n\nlabor certification was filed before April 30, 2001.                         See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1245.10 (a)(1)(B).              Nevertheless, the BIA determined that the\n\ninformation        submitted       by     petitioner        showed       that    his    visa\n\napplication was filed on May 5, 2003, with no indication that it\n\nhad ever been approved.             Therefore, the BIA could not adjust his\n\nstatus as the beneficiary of an approved visa petition.                                See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(i)(2).          Petitioner appeals this decision.4\n\n                The government argues that we have no jurisdiction over\n\nthe initial BIA affirmance of the Immigration Judge's decision\n\ndetermining        the    issue     of    adjustment        of     status   because      the\n\npetitioner appealed only from the denial of the motion to reopen.\n\nUnder the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility\n\nAct of 1996, all final BIA orders must be appealed to this court\n\n\n\n\n4\n   A further motion to reopen was filed on October 6, 2003. No\ndisposition appears in the administrative record. According to the\ngovernment's brief, it was denied on February 6, 2004.\n\n                                               -4-\n\fwithin thirty days.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1).5        A timely appeal\n\nis a strict jurisdictional requirement. See Nascimento v.

We do, however,\n\nhave jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the August 27, 2003 BIA\n\ndecision denying the motion to reopen.\n\n           \"Motions     to   reopen    are    disfavored   in   deportation\n\nproceedings because of the strong public interest in bringing\n\nlitigation to a close.\"      Fesseha v.

(internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted).         We review for abuse of discretion.        Id.\n\n               Petitioner has not made a prima facie case for the\n\nunderlying relief.          The BIA recognized that petitioner may have\n\nbeen     eligible     for     adjustment     as    a   beneficiary        of   the\n\n\"grandfathering\" provision under Section 245(i) of the INA by\n\nfiling    an    application    for   labor    certification   on     or    before\n\nApril 30, 2001.\n\n               Petitioner does not currently meet the second statutory\n\nrequirement for adjustment of status, however, which states that\n\n\"[u]pon receipt of such [a labor certification] application . . .,\n\nthe Attorney General may adjust the status of the alien . . . if --\n\n(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa . . .; and\n\n(B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the\n\ntime the application is filed.\"            8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(2) (emphasis\n\nsupplied). The regulations define the term \"immediately available\"\n\nas:\n\n               (1) Availability of immigrant visas under [8\n               U.S.C. § 1255] . . . . If the applicant is a\n               preference alien, the current Department of\n               State Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Bulletin\n               will be consulted to determine whether an\n               immigrant visa is immediately available. An\n               immigrant visa is considered available for\n               accepting and processing the application Form\n               I-485 [for adjustment of status] if the\n               preference category application has a priority\n               date on the waiting list which is earlier than\n               the date shown in the Bulletin (or the\n               Bulletin   shows   that   numbers   for   visa\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          applicants   in     his    or   her    category    are\n          current).\n\n8 C.F.R. § 245.1(g)(1).\n\n          The BIA held that\n\n          the information submitted . . . in connection\n          with this motion indicates only that the\n          [Department of Homeland Security] received a\n          visa petition filed on [petitioner's] behalf\n          on May 5, 2003.        We have received no\n          information that the visa petition has been\n          approved.    Accordingly, the respondent is\n          currently not eligible to adjust his status as\n          he is not the beneficiary of an approved visa\n          petition, and thus he does not have a visa\n          immediately available to him.       [8 U.S.C.\n          § 1255(i)(2)(A)].   As the respondent is not\n          currently eligible for the relief he seeks his\n          motion must be denied.\n\nPetitioner,   nevertheless,    argues     that   he   was   entitled    to   a\n\ncontinuance by virtue of the pending employment visa petition, the\n\napproval of which would entitle him to adjustment of status.\n\n          In Hernández v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783767\"><a href=\"/opinion/783767/laura-luis-hernandez-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 841-42 (9th Cir.\n\n2003), the INS argued that in order to qualify for adjustment of\n\nstatus the petitioner must show that a visa had been approved on\n\nher behalf.   The Ninth Circuit stated that, assuming arguendo this\n\nwas the applicable rule, Hernández had made a showing that she was\n\nthe beneficiary of an immediately available visa because her\n\napplication had been approved and she was given a priority date.\n\nId.   Hernández's   application     had   been   processed    and    she   was\n\neligible under the second family preference category.              Id.; see 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1153(a)(2)(A).\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          In contrast, petitioner here has provided no information,\n\nother than the INS's receipt of his I-140 visa application, to show\n\nthat a visa was immediately available to him.             Since petitioner is\n\na preference alien under the employment preference categories, his\n\nvisa is   not    considered   immediately     available     until   he   has   a\n\npriority date on the waiting list which is earlier than the date\n\nshown on the Department of State Bulletin as specified in 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 245.1(g)(1).    Petitioner has made no showing that his Form I-140\n\nhad been approved or that he was allocated a priority date.              See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 245.1(g)(2).\n\n          Because petitioner was not eligible for adjustment of\n\nstatus under the statute, the BIA did not commit an error of law on\n\nthe substantive issue.

Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200975\"><a href=\"/opinion/200975/lasprilla-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101\n\n(1st Cir. 2004)(stating that a motion to reconsider was properly\n\ndenied when     petitioner    failed   to   show   that    he   qualified   for\n\nadjustment of status under the 'grandfathering' provision).
