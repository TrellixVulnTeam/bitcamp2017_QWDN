Dana   McGovern,    the        owner   and\n\noperator of McGovern's Ambulance Service, Inc. (MAS), and his\n\ncompany pled guilty to Medicare and Medicaid fraud, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1347 (2000), as well as obstruction of a federal audit, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1516, and money laundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1).                 He admitted\n\nto more than $800,000 of fraud.         McGovern's sentence was enhanced\n\nfor obstruction of justice, arising out of his earlier submission\n\nof false information to federal auditors before that audit led to\n\nthe criminal investigation and prosecution.            McGovern appeals the\n\nenhancement, arguing that the attempted obstruction did not occur\n\n\"during the course of the investigation . . . of the instant\n\noffense of conviction.\" U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. We reject this argument\n\non the grounds that the Medicare and Medicaid audits had an\n\nadequate link to the ensuing criminal proceedings and so were\n\nduring   the   course    of   the   investigation      of     the    offense       of\n\nconviction.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           Dana McGovern was the sole shareholder, Director and\n\nPresident of MAS.       MAS was based in Calais, Maine, had business\n\nlocations elsewhere in Maine, and owned a Canadian affiliate. MAS,\n\nwhich was licensed by the Maine Emergency Medical Services Office\n\nof the state's Department of Public Safety, provided transportation\n\nby   ambulance   and    wheelchair    van    for    Medicare        and    Medicaid\n\nbeneficiaries.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            Medicaid is a health care program jointly funded by\n\nfederal and state sources that provides health insurance and\n\nnursing     home     coverage   to   low    income     individuals.        It   is\n\nadministered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\n(CMS) and by state agencies such as the Maine Department of Human\n\nServices.     Medicare is a federally subsidized health insurance\n\nprogram for the elderly and for persons with certain disabilities\n\nthat is administered by CMS and private contractors. See generally\n\nFresenius    Med.     Care   Cardiovascular    Res.,    Inc.   v.   P.R.   &    the\n\nCaribbean Cardiovascular Ctr. Corp., 322 F.3d 56, 74 n.24 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (contrasting Medicare and Medicaid programs).                 The Medicare\n\nand Medicaid programs are both health care benefit programs as\n\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. § 24(b).        See San Lazaro Ass'n v. Connell, 286\n\nF.3d 1088, 1093 (9th Cir. 2002); United States v. Herman, 172 F.3d\n\n205, 206 (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Sriram, 147 F. Supp. 2d\n\n914, 942 (N.D. Ill. 2001).\n\n            Medicaid     and    Medicare    each   have   specific    ambulance\n\nregulations and billing instructions, which McGovern had in his\n\npossession.        Reimbursements can include a base rate, mileage for\n\nbasic or advanced life support services, and separate payments for\n\nadministration of oxygen and other incidentals. Providers can only\n\nbill for \"loaded mileage,\" which is when the beneficiary is in the\n\nvehicle.     Providers cannot charge for the distance traveled to a\n\npick-up point or from a drop-off point.                Further, an ambulance\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcannot be used if the patient is healthy enough to use any other\n\nmethod of transportation, such as a wheelchair van, regardless of\n\nwhether a van is actually available.                In addition, an ambulance\n\ncannot be used for routine transport to and from a doctor's office.\n\n             Each time it transported a patient, the MAS ambulance\n\ncrew was required by regulations to fill out a \"run sheet,\" which\n\nrequired the name of the patient, the place of departure, the\n\ndestination, and the names of the MAS employees in the ambulance.\n\nCompleted run sheets were placed in a locked box and retrieved by\n\nor delivered to McGovern.          McGovern used the run sheets as a basis\n\nto    bill   Medicare    and   Medicaid      for    each   ambulance   run.     He\n\npersonally handled the submission of the ambulance billings to\n\nMedicare and Medicaid until early 1998.              At that time, a part-time\n\nemployee, Ruth Campbell, was hired to enter the billing information\n\nestablished      by     McGovern     and     then     submit    Medicare      bills\n\nelectronically. Campbell was not authorized to make changes in the\n\npricing, and even after she was hired McGovern continued to input\n\nand submit some of the bills himself.\n\n             Defendants defrauded Medicare and Medicaid from August\n\n1996 to November 1999 by billing for unnecessary services and for\n\nservices they had not rendered.              At McGovern's instruction, MAS\n\nemployees used ambulances to transport patients who were able to\n\ntake taxis and other alternative forms of transportation, and used\n\nrun   sheets   for    ambulances     when    transporting      beneficiaries     by\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fwheelchair van. MAS employees, as instructed, also falsified parts\n\nof run sheets by, for example, inaccurately representing non-\n\nreimburseable      destinations           (such    as    a     doctor's   office)    as\n\nreimburseable destinations (such as a hospital). McGovern prepared\n\nand submitted      bills   to       Medicare      and    Medicaid     based   on   these\n\ninaccurate run sheets, which had been falsified at his express\n\ninstructions.\n\n            McGovern   also         falsified      run    sheets      himself.      When\n\nemployees refused to misrepresent a destination, for example, he\n\nwrote the name of a hospital over the name of the doctor's office,\n\nwhich had been written by an employee.                    In addition, he told at\n\nleast one    MAS   employee         to    leave   blank      the   mileage    traveled,\n\npresumably so he could fill in excess miles.                           MAS repeatedly\n\ncharged Medicare and Medicaid for excess mileage. Furthermore, the\n\nbox for administration of oxygen was checked on some run sheets\n\nafter the run sheets were completed and placed in the lockbox.\n\nFinally, MAS repeatedly charged Medicare and Medicaid for advanced\n\nlife support services in situations where employees accurately\n\nrepresented (on the run sheets they placed in the lockbox) that\n\nthey had provided only basic life support services.\n\n            Complaints led to administrative audits by the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services in 1995 and 1998.                      In 1995,\n\nMedicare    investigated        a        complaint      that    MAS    transported    a\n\nbeneficiary 200 feet, but billed Medicare for 6 miles.                        By phone\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fand letter, a Medicare fraud investigator explained to McGovern the\n\ncorrect Medicare billing practices regarding loaded mileage.                  As a\n\nresult of this investigation, Medicare recouped $2,691.65 for\n\ninappropriate mileage charges in 1994 and 1995, but did not then\n\ninstigate a criminal investigation.\n\n            In March 1998, Medicare received a complaint from a\n\nMedicare beneficiary about MAS.            MAS had transported nursing home\n\nresidents    to    shelters      during     a   storm     earlier   that     year.\n\nInvestigators found that MAS falsely billed Medicare for a trip to\n\nthe hospital (which, unlike a trip to a shelter, is reimburseable),\n\nexaggerated the loaded mileage, falsely billed for advanced life\n\nsupport services, and transported via ambulance a beneficiary whose\n\nmedical condition apparently permitted her to travel by other\n\nmeans.\n\n            This finding led to progressively more expansive reviews\n\nby   Medicare     and   Medicaid.      These     audits    uncovered   numerous\n\nsuspicious claims.        Medicaid, for example, discovered that MAS\n\nwheelchair      vans    had    routinely     (and   improperly)     billed     for\n\n\"unloaded\" miles (when the patient was not in the vehicle).                   As a\n\nresult, Medicaid administratively collected from MAS $158,254.22 in\n\noverpayments for wheelchair van reimbursements.\n\n            McGovern     and     MAS   submitted     false    run   sheets      to\n\ninvestigators conducting these administrative audits.               On or about\n\nSeptember 25, 1998 and January 5, 1999, defendants submitted to the\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fMedicare and Medicaid representatives a total of nineteen run\n\nsheets containing false information about the services rendered to\n\nbeneficiary Judith Mahar between July 1997 and January 1998.                   The\n\nrun sheets falsely indicated that oxygen was given to Mahar and\n\nthat an ambulance, rather than a wheelchair van, was used to\n\ntransport her. The boxes for administration of oxygen were checked\n\nafter employees completed the run sheets and placed them in the\n\nlockbox.     McGovern also sent a letter to Medicare investigators\n\nblaming     excess      or    inappropriate        charges     on     the     \"new\n\ngirl\" (Campbell) whom he said was doing MAS's billing.\n\n            The findings of the administrative audits led to the\n\ninitiation of a federal criminal investigation.                McGovern and MAS\n\nwere indicted on November 16, 2000. That indictment was superseded\n\nby a 214-count indictment on May 15, 2001.             Counts 210 and 211 of\n\nthe superseding indictment charged the defendant with obstruction\n\nof a federal audit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1516.                    They charged\n\ndefendant with submission to auditors of the nineteen falsified run\n\nsheets     pertaining    to   Mahar.         The   remaining    counts      alleged\n\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. § 1347 (health care fraud) and 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1956(a)(1) (money laundering) and sought forfeiture of cash and\n\nproperty pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), (7).                 The indictment\n\ncovered the same wrongdoing during the same period as the Medicare\n\nand Medicaid audits.          This is true of both the charges for\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fobstruction of a federal audit and the underlying conduct that the\n\nobstruction sought to hide.\n\n             Both McGovern and MAS entered guilty pleas on January 9,\n\n2002.     McGovern and MAS each pled guilty to 40 counts, including\n\nboth counts of obstructing a federal audit, 22 counts of fraud, 16\n\ncounts of money laundering, and 2 forfeiture counts. The remaining\n\ncounts, for fraud and money laundering, were later dismissed.\n\n             At the sentencing hearing on July 30, 2002, the principal\n\ndisputed issue was whether McGovern was subject to a two-level\n\nupward enhancement for obstructing or impeding the administration\n\nof justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, which states:\n\n             If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or\n             attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of\n             justice during the course of the investigation,\n             prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of\n             conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to\n             (i) the defendant's offense of conviction and any\n             relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense,\n             increase the offense level by 2 levels.\n\nThe   parties    stipulated   that   the   administrative   audits   which\n\nMcGovern obstructed (by submitting false run sheets) were not a\n\npart of any criminal investigation.          The district court held that\n\nMcGovern was subject to the two-level upward enhancement for\n\nobstructing the administrative audits under either note 4 or note\n\n8 to U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.1       Note 4 says:\n\n      1\n          Note 8 provides:\n             If the defendant is convicted both of an obstruction\n             offense (e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3146 (Penalty for failure to\n             appear); 18 U.S.C. § 1621 (Perjury generally)) and an\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the\n           types of conduct to which this adjustment applies:\n           . . . .\n           (c)       producing or attempting to produce a false,\n                     altered, or counterfeit document or record during\n                     an official investigation or judicial proceeding.\n\n           The district court found that McGovern had a total\n\noffense level of 23 and a criminal history category of I.         The\n\napplicable guideline range is 46 to 57 months and a fine of $10,000\n\nto $100,000.     Absent the upward enhancement for obstruction of\n\njustice, the applicable guideline range would have been 37 to 46\n\nmonths and a fine of $7,500 to $75,000.          The court sentenced\n\nMcGovern to 49 months in prison and to 3 years of supervised\n\nrelease.   The court also ordered restitution of $729,875.19, for\n\nwhich defendants were jointly and severally liable, and a mandatory\n\nspecial assessment of $3,800.       It waived a fine, on the grounds\n\nthat McGovern would not have the means to pay.        The court found\n\nthat MAS had a total offense level of 24.     It sentenced MAS to five\n\n\n\n\n           underlying offense (the offense with respect to which the\n           obstructive conduct occurred), the count for the\n           obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for\n           the underlying offense under subsection (c) of § 3D1.2\n           (Groups of Closely Related Counts). The offense level\n           for that group of closely related counts will be the\n           offense level for the underlying offense increased by the\n           2-level adjustment specified by this section, or the\n           offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is\n           greater.\nSince we affirm on the basis of U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 note 4(c), we do\nnot reach note 8.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fyears of probation, restitution of $729,875.19, and a mandatory\n\nspecial assessment of $15,200.\n\n            Since    the    district   court    did    not   impose   an   upward\n\nenhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 on MAS, this appeal\n\nconcerns only McGovern himself.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            \"We review the legal determination of the guideline's\n\nmeaning and scope de novo, but allow due deference to the district\n\ncourt's factfinding, reviewing it only for clear error.\"                   United\n\nStates v. Duclos, 214 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations\n\nomitted).    An interpretation of a guideline in the notes and other\n\ncommentary   is     given   controlling       weight   unless   it    is   plainly\n\nerroneous, unconstitutional, contrary to a federal statute, or\n\ninconsistent with the guideline itself.            Stinson v. United States,\n\n508 U.S. 36, 45 (1993).\n\n            McGovern contests the district court's ruling that the\n\nobstruction occurred \"during the course of the investigation,\n\nprosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.          He argues that the administrative audits by\n\nMedicare and Medicaid were not \"official investigation[s]\" pursuant\n\nto note 4(c) because there was no pending criminal proceeding at\n\nthe time of the administrative audit and, absent a qualifying\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\finvestigation, no enhancement could be made.2                    McGovern notes that\n\nthe   administrative         audit      was    undertaken    before      the   criminal\n\ninvestigation, and that the government expressed its determination\n\nat the sentencing hearing to avoid \"even . . . the appearance that\n\nthe     administrative         proceedings       are   driven     by    the    criminal\n\ninvestigation.\"\n\n               The   guideline        itself   contains     no   requirement       of   an\n\n\"official\" investigation.                And while note 4 does refer to an\n\n\"official investigation,\" it does so by way of example.                        There is\n\nno requirement that the investigation be \"official.\"\n\n               McGovern's real claim is that there is an insufficient\n\nnexus     to    show    that    he     \"attempted      to   obstruct     .     .   .    the\n\nadministration of justice during the course of the investigation .\n\n. . of the instant offense of conviction.\"                   U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.           He\n\nseems to make both temporal- and identity-type arguments.                                He\n\ncontends that the conduct took place before there was any criminal\n\ninvestigation          and     that     Medicaid/Medicare         audits       are      not\n\ninvestigations of the offense of conviction.                           This court has\n\nalready rejected both types of arguments.\n\n\n\n      2\n       McGovern adequately preserved the issue for appeal by\nobjecting to the presentence report (PSR) on this precise ground\n(that U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 does not apply to obstruction of an\nadministrative audit because an audit is not an official\ninvestigation) and then arguing the point at length during the\nsentencing hearing. See United States v. Fox, 889 F.2d 357, 358-\n59, 361 (1st Cir. 1989) (treating issue as adequately preserved\nwhere defendant objected on this basis to the PSR).\n\n                                           -11-\n\f          In United States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907 (1st Cir. 1993),\n\nwe rejected the temporal argument, holding that the fact that there\n\nwas no pending federal criminal investigation at the time of the\n\nobstruction did not disqualify a defendant from an enhancement\n\nwhere there was a \"close connection between the obstructive conduct\n\nand the offense of conviction.\"   Id. at 911; see United States v.\n\nMills, 194 F.3d 1108, 1115 (10th Cir. 1999) (U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 nexus\n\nrequirement satisfied where prison guard destroyed compromising\n\nevidence before any investigation was initiated); United States v.\n\nBarry, 938 F.2d 1327, 1335 (D.C.

(MAS), and his company pled guilty to Medicare and Medicaid fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1347 (2000), as well as obstruction of a federal audit, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1516, and money laundering, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1). He admitted to more than $800,000 of fraud. McGovern's sentence was enhanced for obstruction of justice, arising out of his earlier submission of false information to federal auditors before that audit led to the criminal investigation and prosecution. McGovern appeals the enhancement, arguing that the attempted obstruction did not occur \"during the course of the investigation... of the instant offense of conviction.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1. We reject this argument on the grounds that the Medicare and Medicaid audits had an adequate link to the ensuing criminal proceedings and so were during the course of the investigation of the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dana McGovern was the sole shareholder, Director and President of MAS. MAS was based in Calais, Maine, had business locations elsewhere in Maine, and owned a Canadian affiliate. MAS, which was licensed by the Maine Emergency Medical Services Office of the state's Department of Public Safety, provided transportation by ambulance and wheelchair van for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicaid is a health care program jointly funded by federal and state sources that provides health insurance and nursing home coverage to low income individuals. It is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and by state agencies such as the Maine Department of Human Services. Medicare is a federally subsidized health insurance program for the elderly and for persons with certain disabilities that is administered by CMS and private contractors. <i>See generally Fresenius Med. Care Cardiovascular Res., Inc. v. P.R. &amp; Caribbean Cardiovascular Ctr. Corp.,</i> 322 F.3d 56, 74 n. 24 (1st Cir.2003) (contrasting Medicare and Medicaid programs). The Medicare and Medicaid programs are both health care benefit programs as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 24(b). <i>See San Lazaro Ass'n v. Connell,</i> 286 F.3d 1088, 1093 (9th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Herman,</i> 172 F.3d 205, 206 (2d Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Sriram,</i> 147 F.Supp.2d 914, 942 (N.D.Ill.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicaid and Medicare each have specific ambulance regulations and billing instructions, which McGovern had in his possession. Reimbursements can include a base rate, mileage for basic or advanced life support services, and separate payments for administration of oxygen and other incidentals. Providers can only bill for \"loaded mileage,\" which is when the beneficiary is in the vehicle. Providers cannot charge for the distance traveled to a pick-up point or from a drop-off point. Further, an ambulance cannot be used if the patient is healthy enough to use any other method of transportation, such as a wheelchair van, regardless of whether a van is actually available. In addition, an ambulance cannot be used for routine transport to and from a doctor's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each time it transported a patient, the MAS ambulance crew was required by regulations to fill out a \"run sheet,\" which required the name of the patient, the place of departure, the destination, and the names of the MAS employees in the ambulance. Completed run sheets were placed in a locked box and retrieved by or delivered to McGovern. McGovern used the run sheets as a basis to bill Medicare and Medicaid for each ambulance run. He personally handled the submission of the ambulance billings to Medicare and Medicaid until early 1998. At that time, a part-time employee, Ruth Campbell, was hired to enter the billing information established by McGovern and then submit Medicare bills electronically. Campbell was not authorized to make changes in the pricing, and even after she was hired McGovern continued to input and submit some of the bills himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants defrauded Medicare and Medicaid from August 1996 to November 1999 by billing for unnecessary services and for services they had not rendered. At McGovern's instruction, MAS employees used ambulances to transport patients who were able to take taxis and other alternative forms of transportation, and used run sheets for ambulances when transporting beneficiaries by wheelchair van. MAS employees, as instructed, also falsified parts of run sheets by, for example, inaccurately representing non-reimburseable destinations (such as a doctor's office) as reimburseable destinations (such as a hospital). McGovern prepared and submitted bills to Medicare and Medicaid based on these inaccurate run sheets, which had been falsified at his express instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGovern also falsified run sheets himself. When employees refused to misrepresent a destination, for example, he wrote the name of a hospital over the name of the doctor's office, which had been written by an employee. In addition, he told at least one MAS employee to leave blank the mileage traveled, presumably so he could fill in excess miles. MAS repeatedly charged Medicare and Medicaid for excess mileage. Furthermore, the box for administration of oxygen was checked on some run sheets <i>after</i> the run sheets were completed and placed in the lockbox. Finally, MAS repeatedly charged Medicare and Medicaid for advanced life support services in situations where employees accurately represented (on the run sheets they placed in the lockbox) that they had provided only basic life support services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Complaints led to administrative audits by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 1995 and 1998. In 1995, Medicare investigated a complaint that MAS transported a beneficiary 200 feet, but billed Medicare for 6 miles. By phone and letter, a Medicare fraud investigator explained to McGovern the correct Medicare billing practices regarding loaded mileage. As a result of this investigation, Medicare recouped $2,691.65 for inappropriate mileage charges in 1994 and 1995, but did not then instigate a criminal investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1998, Medicare received a complaint from a Medicare beneficiary about MAS. MAS had transported nursing home residents to shelters during a storm earlier that year. Investigators found that MAS falsely billed Medicare for a trip to the hospital (which, unlike a trip to a shelter, is reimburseable), exaggerated the loaded mileage, falsely billed for advanced life support services, and transported via ambulance a beneficiary whose medical condition apparently permitted her to travel by other means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finding led to progressively more expansive reviews by Medicare and Medicaid. These audits uncovered numerous suspicious claims. Medicaid, for example, discovered that MAS wheelchair vans had routinely (and improperly) billed for \"unloaded\" miles (when the patient was not in the vehicle). As a result, Medicaid administratively collected from MAS $158,254.22 in overpayments for wheelchair van reimbursements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGovern and MAS submitted false run sheets to investigators conducting these administrative audits. On or about September 25, 1998 and January 5, 1999, defendants submitted to the Medicare and Medicaid representatives a total of nineteen run sheets containing false information about the services rendered to beneficiary Judith Mahar between July 1997 and January 1998. The run sheets falsely indicated that oxygen was given to Mahar and that an ambulance, rather than a wheelchair van, was used to transport her. The boxes for administration of oxygen were checked after employees completed the run sheets and placed them in the lockbox. McGovern also sent a letter to Medicare investigators blaming excess or inappropriate charges on the \"new girl\" (Campbell) whom he said was doing MAS's billing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings of the administrative audits led to the initiation of a federal criminal investigation. McGovern and MAS were indicted on November 16, 2000. That indictment was superseded by a 214-count indictment on May 15, 2001. Counts 210 and 211 of the superseding indictment charged the defendant with obstruction of a federal audit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1516. They charged defendant with submission to auditors of the nineteen falsified run sheets pertaining to Mahar. The remaining counts alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1347 (health care fraud) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1) (money laundering) and sought forfeiture of cash and property pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(1), (7). The indictment covered the same wrongdoing during the same period as the Medicare and Medicaid audits. This is true of both the charges for obstruction of a federal audit and the underlying conduct that the obstruction sought to hide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both McGovern and MAS entered guilty pleas on January 9, 2002. McGovern and MAS each pled guilty to 40 counts, including both counts of obstructing a federal audit, 22 counts of fraud, 16 counts of money laundering, and 2 forfeiture counts. The remaining counts, for fraud and money laundering, were later dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on July 30, 2002, the principal disputed issue was whether McGovern was subject to a two-level upward enhancement for obstructing or impeding the administration of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant's offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties stipulated that the administrative audits which McGovern obstructed (by submitting false run sheets) were not a part of any criminal investigation. The district court held that McGovern was subject to the two-level upward enhancement for obstructing the administrative audits under either note 4 or note 8 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Note 4 says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which this adjustment applies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) producing or attempting to produce a false, altered, or counterfeit document or record during an official investigation or judicial proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that McGovern had a total offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of I. The applicable guideline range is 46 to 57 months and a fine of $10,000 to $100,000. Absent the upward enhancement for obstruction of justice, the applicable guideline range would have been 37 to 46 months and a fine of $7,500 to $75,000. The court sentenced McGovern to 49 months in prison and to 3 years of supervised release. The court also ordered restitution of $729,875.19, for which defendants were jointly and severally liable, and a mandatory special assessment of $3,800. It waived a fine, on the grounds that McGovern would not have the means to pay. The court found that MAS had a total offense level of 24. It sentenced MAS to five years of probation, restitution of $729,875.19, and a mandatory special assessment of $15,200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the district court did not impose an upward enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 on MAS, this appeal concerns only McGovern himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review the legal determination of the guideline's meaning and scope de novo, but allow due deference to the district court's factfinding, reviewing it only for clear error.\" <i>United States v.

He seems to make both temporal- and identity-type arguments. He contends that the conduct took place before there was any criminal investigation and that Medicaid/Medicare audits are not investigations of the offense of conviction.

(MAS), and his company pled guilty to Medicare and Medicaid fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1347 (2000), as well as obstruction of a federal audit, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1516, and money laundering, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1). He admitted to more than $800,000 of fraud. McGovern's sentence was enhanced for obstruction of justice, arising out of his earlier submission of false information to federal auditors before that audit led to the criminal investigation and prosecution. McGovern appeals the enhancement, arguing that the attempted obstruction did not occur \"during the course of the investigation... of the instant offense of conviction.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1. We reject this argument on the grounds that the Medicare and Medicaid audits had an adequate link to the ensuing criminal proceedings and so were during the course of the investigation of the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dana McGovern was the sole shareholder, Director and President of MAS. MAS was based in Calais, Maine, had business locations elsewhere in Maine, and owned a Canadian affiliate. MAS, which was licensed by the Maine Emergency Medical Services Office of the state's Department of Public Safety, provided transportation by ambulance and wheelchair van for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicaid is a health care program jointly funded by federal and state sources that provides health insurance and nursing home coverage to low income individuals. It is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and by state agencies such as the Maine Department of Human Services. Medicare is a federally subsidized health insurance program for the elderly and for persons with certain disabilities that is administered by CMS and private contractors. <i>See generally Fresenius Med.

Reimbursements can include a base rate, mileage for basic or advanced life support services, and separate payments for administration of oxygen and other incidentals. Providers can only bill for \"loaded mileage,\" which is when the beneficiary is in the vehicle. Providers cannot charge for the distance traveled to a pick-up point or from a drop-off point. Further, an ambulance cannot be used if the patient is healthy enough to use any other method of transportation, such as a wheelchair van, regardless of whether a van is actually available. In addition, an ambulance cannot be used for routine transport to and from a doctor's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each time it transported a patient, the MAS ambulance crew was required by regulations to fill out a \"run sheet,\" which required the name of the patient, the place of departure, the destination, and the names of the MAS employees in the ambulance. Completed run sheets were placed in a locked box and retrieved by or delivered to McGovern. McGovern used the run sheets as a basis to bill Medicare and Medicaid for each ambulance run. He personally handled the submission of the ambulance billings to Medicare and Medicaid until early 1998. At that time, a part-time employee, Ruth Campbell, was hired to enter the billing information established by McGovern and then submit Medicare bills electronically. Campbell was not authorized to make changes in the pricing, and even after she was hired McGovern continued to input and submit some of the bills himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants defrauded Medicare and Medicaid from August 1996 to November 1999 by billing for unnecessary services and for services they had not rendered. At McGovern's instruction, MAS employees used ambulances to transport patients who were able to take taxis and other alternative forms of transportation, and used run sheets for ambulances when transporting beneficiaries by wheelchair van. MAS employees, as instructed, also falsified parts of run sheets by, for example, inaccurately representing non-reimburseable destinations (such as a doctor's office) as reimburseable destinations (such as a hospital). McGovern prepared and submitted bills to Medicare and Medicaid based on these inaccurate run sheets, which had been falsified at his express instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGovern also falsified run sheets himself. When employees refused to misrepresent a destination, for example, he wrote the name of a hospital over the name of the doctor's office, which had been written by an employee. In addition, he told at least one MAS employee to leave blank the mileage traveled, presumably so he could fill in excess miles. MAS repeatedly charged Medicare and Medicaid for excess mileage. Furthermore, the box for administration of oxygen was checked on some run sheets <i>after</i> the run sheets were completed and placed in the lockbox. Finally, MAS repeatedly charged Medicare and Medicaid for advanced life support services in situations where employees accurately represented (on the run sheets they placed in the lockbox) that they had provided only basic life support services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Complaints led to administrative audits by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 1995 and 1998. In 1995, Medicare investigated a complaint that MAS transported a beneficiary 200 feet, but billed Medicare for 6 miles. By phone and letter, a Medicare fraud investigator explained to McGovern the correct Medicare billing practices regarding loaded mileage. As a result of this investigation, Medicare recouped $2,691.65 for inappropriate mileage charges in 1994 and 1995, but did not then instigate a criminal investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1998, Medicare received a complaint from a Medicare beneficiary about MAS. MAS had transported nursing home residents to shelters during a storm earlier that year. Investigators found that MAS falsely billed Medicare for a trip to the hospital (which, unlike a trip to a shelter, is reimburseable), exaggerated the loaded mileage, falsely billed for advanced life support services, and transported via ambulance a beneficiary whose medical condition apparently permitted her to travel by other means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finding led to progressively more expansive reviews by Medicare and Medicaid. These audits uncovered numerous suspicious claims. Medicaid, for example, discovered that MAS wheelchair vans had routinely (and improperly) billed for \"unloaded\" miles (when the patient was not in the vehicle). As a result, Medicaid administratively collected from MAS $158,254.22 in overpayments for wheelchair van reimbursements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGovern and MAS submitted false run sheets to investigators conducting these administrative audits. On or about September 25, 1998 and January 5, 1999, defendants submitted to the Medicare and Medicaid representatives a total of nineteen run sheets containing false information about the services rendered to beneficiary Judith Mahar between July 1997 and January 1998. The run sheets falsely indicated that oxygen was given to Mahar and that an ambulance, rather than a wheelchair van, was used to transport her. The boxes for administration of oxygen were checked after employees completed the run sheets and placed them in the lockbox. McGovern also sent a letter to Medicare investigators blaming excess or inappropriate charges on the \"new girl\" (Campbell) whom he said was doing MAS's billing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings of the administrative audits led to the initiation of a federal criminal investigation. McGovern and MAS were indicted on November 16, 2000. That indictment was superseded by a 214-count indictment on May 15, 2001. Counts 210 and 211 of the superseding indictment charged the defendant with obstruction of a federal audit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1516. They charged defendant with submission to auditors of the nineteen falsified run sheets pertaining to Mahar. The remaining counts alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1347 (health care fraud) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1) (money laundering) and sought forfeiture of cash and property pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(1), (7). The indictment covered the same wrongdoing during the same period as the Medicare and Medicaid audits. This is true of both the charges for obstruction of a federal audit and the underlying conduct that the obstruction sought to hide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both McGovern and MAS entered guilty pleas on January 9, 2002. McGovern and MAS each pled guilty to 40 counts, including both counts of obstructing a federal audit, 22 counts of fraud, 16 counts of money laundering, and 2 forfeiture counts. The remaining counts, for fraud and money laundering, were later dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on July 30, 2002, the principal disputed issue was whether McGovern was subject to a two-level upward enhancement for obstructing or impeding the administration of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant's offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties stipulated that the administrative audits which McGovern obstructed (by submitting false run sheets) were not a part of any criminal investigation. The district court held that McGovern was subject to the two-level upward enhancement for obstructing the administrative audits under either note 4 or note 8 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Note 4 says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which this adjustment applies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) producing or attempting to produce a false, altered, or counterfeit document or record during an official investigation or judicial proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that McGovern had a total offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of I. The applicable guideline range is 46 to 57 months and a fine of $10,000 to $100,000. Absent the upward enhancement for obstruction of justice, the applicable guideline range would have been 37 to 46 months and a fine of $7,500 to $75,000. The court sentenced McGovern to 49 months in prison and to 3 years of supervised release. The court also ordered restitution of $729,875.19, for which defendants were jointly and severally liable, and a mandatory special assessment of $3,800. It waived a fine, on the grounds that McGovern would not have the means to pay. The court found that MAS had a total offense level of 24. It sentenced MAS to five years of probation, restitution of $729,875.19, and a mandatory special assessment of $15,200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the district court did not impose an upward enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 on MAS, this appeal concerns only McGovern himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review the legal determination of the guideline's meaning and scope de novo, but allow due deference to the district court's factfinding, reviewing it only for clear error.\" <i>United States v.

He argues that the administrative audits by Medicare and Medicaid were not \"official investigation[s]\" pursuant to note 4(c) because there was no pending criminal proceeding at the time of the administrative audit and, absent a qualifying investigation, no enhancement could be made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> McGovern notes that the administrative audit was undertaken before the criminal investigation, and that the government expressed its determination at the sentencing hearing to avoid \"even ... the appearance that the administrative proceedings are driven by the criminal investigation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guideline itself contains no requirement of an \"official\" investigation.
