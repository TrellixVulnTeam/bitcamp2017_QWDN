An immigration judge (IJ) denied\n\nConsuelo Barrientos'1 application for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed her\n\nappeal of that denial.              The BIA also contemporaneously denied\n\nBarrientos' motion to remand proceedings, a request based on a\n\nclaim       that    Barrientos'     prior   counsel's      alleged   ineffective\n\nassistance amounted to a due process violation.               On appeal to this\n\ncourt, Barrientos seeks review of both BIA determinations.                    After\n\ncareful consideration, we deny Barrientos' petition as to both\n\nissues.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n              In 1992, Consuelo Barrientos entered the United States\n\nwithout inspection from Guatemala.               She submitted three subsequent\n\nasylum applications, in 1992, 1998, and 2006.2               In September 2006,\n\nthe Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear (NTA)\n\nfor   being        present   in   the   United    States   without   having   been\n\npreviously admitted or paroled. Before the IJ, Barrientos admitted\n\nthe allegations in the NTA, conceded removability, and sought\n\nrelief pursuant to the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American\n\n\n\n        1\n      Barrientos' petition for review is filed jointly with Juan\nRamon Pineda, her husband and derivative beneficiary. Pineda is\nalso a native and citizen of Guatemala.\n        2\n      It is not clear from the record or briefs why the respondent\nsubmitted three separate asylum applications or why the government\nwaited until 2006 to issue a Notice to Appear. Nonetheless, these\nunresolved questions have no bearing on the legal issues before us.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fRelief Act (NACARA), asylum, withholding of removal, the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture, and voluntary departure.\n\n            The essence of Barrientos' asylum claim was that she fled\n\nGuatemala in 1992 after being threatened by masked guerrillas who\n\ndemanded she reveal the location of her now-deceased first husband,\n\nwho had been a military commissioner in their town and who had fled\n\nGuatemala for the United States when the guerrillas threatened to\n\nkill him.     Given twelve days to tell the guerrillas where her\n\nhusband was or face reprisals, Barrientos made provisions for her\n\nchildren in Guatemala and then fled alone to the United States.\n\nDuring her asylum hearing, she stated that she feared returning to\n\nGuatemala because there are \"still a lot of groups in Guatemala\"\n\nand \"it's still dangerous.\"    She also said she feared \"groups that\n\nare going around killing people [and] committing terrorist acts.\"\n\n            The IJ denied Barrientos' NACARA application, finding\n\nthat she did not meet the statutory requirement of a date of entry\n\ninto the United States before October 1, 1990.     Further, assuming\n\nthe credibility of Barrientos' written asylum application and oral\n\ntestimony, the IJ denied asylum and withholding relief, concluding\n\nthat her claim of persecution by the guerrillas did not meet the\n\nstatutory requirements for past persecution or a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution.     The IJ did grant Barrientos the limited\n\nremedy of voluntary departure.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          The BIA dismissed Barrientos' appeal of the IJ's denial\n\nof asylum and withholding, concluding that she neither suffered\n\npast persecution nor had a well-founded fear of future persecution,\n\nand was thus ineligible for asylum and therefore also ineligible\n\nfor the non-discretionary relief of withholding of removal.\n\n          As to Barrientos' motion to remand proceedings based on\n\nher former counsel's alleged ineffective assistance at the IJ\n\nhearing, the BIA concluded that there was no evidence of a denial\n\nof due process that would justify a remand:\n\n          The record indicates that prior counsel, the\n          DHS attorney, and the Immigration Judge asked\n          [Barrientos] questions relevant to the asylum\n          application. [Barrientos] on appeal [has] not\n          identified the facts or evidence that [she] was\n          precluded from providing that were material to\n          [her] application for relief from removal.\n\n\n                          II. Discussion\n\nA. Due Process Claim\n\n          We first address Barrientos' appeal of the BIA's denial\n\nof her due process claim.3   Barrientos alleges that her counsel\n\nbefore the IJ provided ineffective assistance by asserting grounds\n\n\n\n     3\n      As a preliminary matter, we decline the government's request\nthat we decide the question of whether there is a Fifth Amendment\nright to counsel in removal proceedings when the relief sought is\nnon-discretionary, such as with withholding of removal. We need\nnot address that question in order to resolve the matter before us.\nWe also note that the Supreme Court's recent decision in Padilla v.\nKentucky, No. 08-651, 78 U.S.L.W. 4235 (U.S. March 31, 2010), does\nnot provide an answer to the question the government urges us to\nconsider.\n\n                               -4-\n\ffor relief for which she was clearly ineligible,4 failing to submit\n\nproper documentation in support of those ineligible claims, and\n\nfailing to prepare to present her asylum and withholding claims or\n\nbackground materials supporting those claims. Indeed, after the IJ\n\ndetermined that Barrientos was likely ineligible for relief under\n\nNACARA and cancellation of removal, he requested that counsel\n\nproceed by presenting Barrientos' asylum claim, to which counsel\n\nreplied, \"I'm not prepared to go forward on that today, Judge.\"\n\nThe IJ replied:\n\n          Well, then you better be -- get prepared\n          because, you know, I, I, I put the case on\n          so that we could get an idea as to whether\n          or not there was some basis to the claim.\n\n\nThe IJ continued:\n\n          Well, you're going to have to ask her about\n          her asylum case.     I mean, I've got an\n          interpreter here, I set aside three hours.\n          You can simply ask her why it is, if at all,\n          she's afraid to go back to Guatemala, if\n          you'd like.\n\n\nCounsel then proceeded to ask Barrientos why she fled Guatemala and\n\nwhether she feared returning.      Our review of the record shows that\n\nBarrientos   cogently   narrated    the   basis   of   her   asylum   and\n\nwithholding claims, and that her oral account closely paralleled\n\n\n\n     4\n      Specifically, the attorney asserted claims for relief\npursuant to NACARA and cancellation of removal, neither of which\nwas appropriate given Barrientos' date of entry and her lack of a\nUnited States citizen spouse, parent, or child.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe one she gave in her written application as well as her\n\nrecitation of the facts on appeal to the BIA and to this court.\n\nThe record also shows that the IJ and counsel for the government\n\nhad the opportunity to ask appropriate and probing questions of\n\nBarrientos regarding her claim of persecution.\n\n          \"Ineffective   assistance     of   counsel   in   a   deportation\n\nproceeding is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so\n\nfundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably\n\npresenting his case.\"    Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (internal quotation omitted); see also Guerrero-Santana v.\n\nGonzales, 499 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 2007); Betouche v. Ashcroft,\n\n357 F.3d 147, 149 (1st Cir. 2004).           To succeed on such a due\n\nprocess claim, we have generally required the petitioner to show \"a\n\nreasonable probability of prejudice\" caused by former counsel's\n\nperformance.   Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001); see\n\nalso Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007); Wang v.\n\nAshcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Though Barrientos styled her motion before the BIA as a\n\nmotion to remand, \"[a]s a procedural matter, a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel is typically raised through a motion to\n\nreopen, which can be brought before either the BIA or the IJ\n\ndirectly.\"   Saakian, 252 F.3d at 25.    We review the BIA's denial of\n\na motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.       See Zeru, 503 F.3d at\n\n71; Wang, 367 F.3d at 26-27.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f               Former     counsel's    statement     to    the   IJ    that    he   was\n\nunprepared to present the asylum claim certainly raises a serious\n\nquestion as to his competence.           In addition, the paltry supporting\n\nevidence submitted by him on Barrientos' behalf raises further\n\nconcerns. Despite these concerns, we deny Barrientos' petition for\n\nreview on due process grounds because she has not put forth any\n\nargument that former counsel's performance resulted in a reasonable\n\nprobability of prejudice.             Indeed, she has failed to suggest any\n\nfacts, argument, or documentary evidence not submitted that might\n\nhave       produced   a   different     outcome     as    to   her    asylum   claim.\n\nEssentially, it appears she would have us remand for further\n\nproceedings on the exact same claim and facts already presented and\n\ndenied.        This     falls   far    short   of   the    required     showing     of\n\nprejudice.5\n\n\n       5\n      To the extent that Barrientos makes a second due process\nargument regarding the IJ's conduct of the hearing, we also deny\nreview. Barrientos briefly suggests that the IJ's conduct of the\nhearing deprived her of due process because he \"fail[ed] to re-set\nthe   hearing   to  allow   [Barrientos]    to   obtain   competent\nrepresentation or to allow [Barrientos] to prepare [her] case more\nfully with [her] attorney.\" We review such a claim de novo. See\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999). The IJ's\ninsistence that counsel proceed in the face of counsel's statement\nthat he was not prepared certainly draws our attention. However,\nwe conclude that, in this case, this decision fell within the IJ's\n\"broad (though not uncabined) discretion over the conduct of trial\nproceedings.\" Id.\n     We also find no abuse of discretion in the BIA's conclusion\nthat Barrientos failed to comply with the procedural requirements\nin effect at the time the appeal was filed for an ineffective\nassistance claim, as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec.\n637 (BIA 1988). See Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 10 (1st\nCir. 2008).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fB. Asylum Claim\n\n              Having   reviewed   the    record   carefully,   we   also   deny\n\nBarrientos' petition for review of the BIA's dismissal of her\n\nasylum claim.      We review only for \"substantial evidence,\" and will\n\nnot reverse unless \"'the record evidence would compel a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to make a contrary determination.'\"           Guzman v. INS, 327\n\nF.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at\n\n569).       We find nothing in the record approaching such compelling\n\nevidence to the contrary.\n\n              Even assuming that the record compelled the conclusion\n\nthat the guerrillas' threat against Barrientos amounted to past\n\npersecution, the record does not compel (or even suggest) the\n\nconclusion that Barrientos has an objective well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution given that the threat against her occurred over\n\nseventeen years ago, the husband the guerrillas were pursuing has\n\nbeen deceased since 1995, Guatemala's civil war has concluded and\n\nthe country has transitioned to a multi-party democracy,6 and\n\nBarrientos offered no reason she would be unable to relocate to\n\nanother part of the country where her former husband would be\n\nunknown.      See, e.g., Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n\n\n\n        6\n      For country conditions, the IJ and the BIA relied on the U.S.\nState Department Country Report on Guatemala (2006), submitted by\nBarrientos and admitted into evidence by the IJ.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f(outlining the standard for asylum).     We thus deny Barrientos'\n\npetition for review as to the asylum claim.7\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons we deny Barrientos' petition\n\nfor review.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Because Barrientos does not meet the asylum standard, we need\nnot address her petition for review as to withholding, which\nrequires the higher showing of a clear probability of persecution.\nSee Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 569 n.3; see also Ang v. Gonzales,\n430 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

Indeed, after the IJ\n\ndetermined that Barrientos was likely ineligible for relief under\n\nNACARA and cancellation of removal, he requested that counsel\n\nproceed by presenting Barrientos' asylum claim, to which counsel\n\nreplied, \"I'm not prepared to go forward on that today, Judge.\"\n\nThe IJ replied:\n\n          Well, then you better be -- get prepared\n          because, you know, I, I, I put the case on\n          so that we could get an idea as to whether\n          or not there was some basis to the claim.\n\n\nThe IJ continued:\n\n          Well, you're going to have to ask her about\n          her asylum case.     I mean, I've got an\n          interpreter here, I set aside three hours.\n          You can simply ask her why it is, if at all,\n          she's afraid to go back to Guatemala, if\n          you'd like.\n\n\nCounsel then proceeded to ask Barrientos why she fled Guatemala and\n\nwhether she feared returning.      Our review of the record shows that\n\nBarrientos   cogently   narrated    the   basis   of   her   asylum   and\n\nwithholding claims, and that her oral account closely paralleled\n\n\n\n     4\n      Specifically, the attorney asserted claims for relief\npursuant to NACARA and cancellation of removal, neither of which\nwas appropriate given Barrientos' date of entry and her lack of a\nUnited States citizen spouse, parent, or child.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe one she gave in her written application as well as her\n\nrecitation of the facts on appeal to the BIA and to this court.\n\nThe record also shows that the IJ and counsel for the government\n\nhad the opportunity to ask appropriate and probing questions of\n\nBarrientos regarding her claim of persecution.\n\n          \"Ineffective   assistance     of   counsel   in   a   deportation\n\nproceeding is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so\n\nfundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably\n\npresenting his case.\"    Lozada v.

We review the BIA's denial of\n\na motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.       See Zeru, 503 F.3d at\n\n71; Wang, 367 F.3d at 26-27.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f               Former     counsel's    statement     to    the   IJ    that    he   was\n\nunprepared to present the asylum claim certainly raises a serious\n\nquestion as to his competence.           In addition, the paltry supporting\n\nevidence submitted by him on Barrientos' behalf raises further\n\nconcerns. Despite these concerns, we deny Barrientos' petition for\n\nreview on due process grounds because she has not put forth any\n\nargument that former counsel's performance resulted in a reasonable\n\nprobability of prejudice.             Indeed, she has failed to suggest any\n\nfacts, argument, or documentary evidence not submitted that might\n\nhave       produced   a   different     outcome     as    to   her    asylum   claim.\n\nEssentially, it appears she would have us remand for further\n\nproceedings on the exact same claim and facts already presented and\n\ndenied.        This     falls   far    short   of   the    required     showing     of\n\nprejudice.5\n\n\n       5\n      To the extent that Barrientos makes a second due process\nargument regarding the IJ's conduct of the hearing, we also deny\nreview. Barrientos briefly suggests that the IJ's conduct of the\nhearing deprived her of due process because he \"fail[ed] to re-set\nthe   hearing   to  allow   [Barrientos]    to   obtain   competent\nrepresentation or to allow [Barrientos] to prepare [her] case more\nfully with [her] attorney.\" We review such a claim de novo. See\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568 (1st Cir. 1999). The IJ's\ninsistence that counsel proceed in the face of counsel's statement\nthat he was not prepared certainly draws our attention. However,\nwe conclude that, in this case, this decision fell within the IJ's\n\"broad (though not uncabined) discretion over the conduct of trial\nproceedings.\" Id.\n     We also find no abuse of discretion in the BIA's conclusion\nthat Barrientos failed to comply with the procedural requirements\nin effect at the time the appeal was filed for an ineffective\nassistance claim, as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec.\n637 (BIA 1988). See Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203423\"><a href=\"/opinion/203423/beltre-veloz-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st\nCir. 2008).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fB. Asylum Claim\n\n              Having   reviewed   the    record   carefully,   we   also   deny\n\nBarrientos' petition for review of the BIA's dismissal of her\n\nasylum claim.      We review only for \"substantial evidence,\" and will\n\nnot reverse unless \"'the record evidence would compel a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to make a contrary determination.'\"           Guzman v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200443\"><a href=\"/opinion/200443/guzman-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at\n\n569).       We find nothing in the record approaching such compelling\n\nevidence to the contrary.\n\n              Even assuming that the record compelled the conclusion\n\nthat the guerrillas' threat against Barrientos amounted to past\n\npersecution, the record does not compel (or even suggest) the\n\nconclusion that Barrientos has an objective well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution given that the threat against her occurred over\n\nseventeen years ago, the husband the guerrillas were pursuing has\n\nbeen deceased since 1995, Guatemala's civil war has concluded and\n\nthe country has transitioned to a multi-party democracy,6 and\n\nBarrientos offered no reason she would be unable to relocate to\n\nanother part of the country where her former husband would be\n\nunknown.      See, e.g., Yatskin v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199481\"><a href=\"/opinion/199481/yatskin-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n\n\n\n        6\n      For country conditions, the IJ and the BIA relied on the U.S.\nState Department Country Report on Guatemala (2006), submitted by\nBarrientos and admitted into evidence by the IJ.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f(outlining the standard for asylum).     We thus deny Barrientos'\n\npetition for review as to the asylum claim.7\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons we deny Barrientos' petition\n\nfor review.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Because Barrientos does not meet the asylum standard, we need\nnot address her petition for review as to withholding, which\nrequires the higher showing of a clear probability of persecution.\nSee Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 569 n.3; see also Ang v.
