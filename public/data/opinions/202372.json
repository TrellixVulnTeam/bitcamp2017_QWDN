TZANNOS, a/k/a Gregory F. Tzannas,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n           APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Honorable Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                 Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n               and Stafford,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Michael L. Tabak, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Richard M. Egbert, with whom Patricia A. DeJuneas and Law\nOffices of Richard M. Egbert, P.C., were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          August 22, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of   the   Northern    District    of   Florida,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         This is the government's appeal\n\nfrom a district court's suppression order.\n\n            The district court suppressed evidence, seized pursuant\n\nto a state court warrant, based on the defendant's allegations that\n\nthe   affidavit      by   a   state   trooper    in   support     of     the    warrant\n\napplication contained material misrepresentations.                        In essence,\n\ndefendant      argued,    the    affidavit      referred     to     a    confidential\n\ninformant who did not exist.\n\n            Over the government's objections that the defendant had\n\nnot made the \"substantial preliminary showing\" required for a\n\nhearing under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978), the\n\ndistrict court convened a hearing.              The court appeared to accept\n\nthe defendant's representations, and it rejected the government's\n\nrequest that it consider contrary information, which the government\n\nhad   sought    to   present     ex   parte   and     in   camera       based   on   its\n\nrepresentation that doing otherwise would endanger the informant's\n\nlife.   Without making specific findings under Franks, the district\n\ncourt granted the motion to suppress.               We reverse and remand with\n\ninstructions to deny the motion to suppress.\n\n                                         I.\n\nA.          The State Search Warrant Affidavit\n\n            On August 28, 2003, Massachusetts State Trooper Pasquale\n\nRussolillo submitted an application for a search warrant to a\n\nmagistrate in a state district court in East Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fRussolillo included a fourteen-page affidavit in support of the\n\napplication.      The affidavit made the following assertions:\n\n              Russolillo and another state trooper knew Gregory Tzannos\n\nto be involved in the bookmaking business from information from\n\npast       investigations    \"coupled     with    intelligence     from    other\n\ninformants\" as well as from the confidential informant central to\n\nthis case.       In early July of 2003, Russolillo and another state\n\ntrooper spoke to the confidential informant, \"CI-1.\"               CI-1 agreed\n\nto provide information to the troopers only if his1 identity was\n\nnot revealed.\n\n              CI-1 told the troopers that he was placing illegal bets\n\non   sporting     events    with    Gregory   Tzannos   via   telephone.    The\n\ninformant said he had placed the bets by calling (617) 567-6114\n\n(\"the 6114 line\") and by speaking to Tzannos directly.                      The\n\nofficers subpoenaed the telephone company and discovered that that\n\nnumber belonged to Tzannos and that it was unpublished.\n\n              They also discovered via subpoena that calls to the 6114\n\nline had been forwarded to a separate number, (617) 846-6630, on\n\nseveral days in August.            This was significant because bookmakers\n\noften used call forwarding to disguise the location of their\n\noperations.      The officers discovered that the second phone number,\n\n(617) 846-6630, was registered to a corporation, DBA: American\n\n\n\n       1\n          The gender of the confidential informant was unspecified;\nfor convenience we use \"he.\"\n\n                                        -3-\n\fEagle   Purchasing      Agents,     at    381     Winthrop     Street,     Winthrop,\n\nMassachusetts.       The    person       listed      in   state      records    as   the\n\ncorporation's treasurer and registered agent was Tzannos, who was\n\nalso listed on the telephone bill.\n\n             Russolillo spoke to CI-1 on August 18 and was told that\n\nCI-1 had placed \"several wagers\" with Tzannos over the 6114 line on\n\nAugust 16 and 17.       On August 20, another officer spoke to CI-1 and\n\nwas told that CI-1 had placed another bet with Tzannos that day,\n\nagain   on    the   6114    line.         Troopers        subsequently     conducted\n\nsurveillance at 381 Winthrop Street and, on several separate days,\n\nobserved     vehicles    registered       to     a    Linda    Wagner;     this      was\n\nsignificant    because     CI-1   had     told    police      that    Tzannos    had   a\n\ngirlfriend named \"Linda.\"\n\n             The affidavit recounted that on August 25, 2003, CI-1 and\n\nRussolillo placed a \"controlled call\" to Tzannos on the 6114 line.\n\nThis allegation is key to Tzannos's later Franks motion.                             The\n\naffidavit explained that in a controlled call, the police officer\n\ndials the number, waits until the target of the investigation\n\nanswers, hands the phone to the informant, and then watches as the\n\ninformant speaks to the target.           CI-1 told Russolillo that Tzannos\n\nwas the person who answered the phone during the controlled call,\n\nand that Tzannos proceeded to give a rundown of the day's betting\n\nlines for baseball.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f            Russolillo's affidavit stated that CI-1 had provided\n\ninformation to Russolillo and other troopers in the past, and the\n\ninformation \"has proven to be reliable and true.\"                      It said the\n\ntroopers had known CI-1 for more than two years and that they knew\n\nhis identity and address.            The affidavit also gave extensive\n\ndetails on CI-1's past cooperation, stating, for example, that CI-1\n\nhad    identified   various      bookmakers      and    their    identities     and\n\ntelephone    numbers,     that    all      of   the     information      had    been\n\ncorroborated by subsequent investigation, and that past information\n\nfrom CI-1 had led to the arrest, prosecution, and conviction of\n\nthree men for gaming violations.              The affidavit stated that CI-1\n\nhad also provided general intelligence information regarding other\n\ncriminal    matters,    but   that   the      affiant   could    not   detail    the\n\nparticulars of these cases, because doing so would compromise the\n\nanonymity of the informant, making him \"susceptible to physical\n\nharm   and/or   retribution.\"        It    explained      that   Russolillo      had\n\n\"learned that traditional organized crime families (such as La Cosa\n\nNostra or the Mafia) and other organized crime groups (such as the\n\nWinter Hill Gang) in the Boston area have been heavily involved in\n\nillegal gaming and bookmaking and have maintained a significant\n\ndegree of control over organized bookmaking operations.\"\n\nB.          The State Search Warrant, the Search, and the Federal\n            Indictment\n\n            The affidavit asserted that CI-1's information, combined\n\nwith the officers' investigation, sufficed to create probable cause\n\n                                        -5-\n\fto believe that Tzannos was violating state laws forbidding certain\n\ngaming activities, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, §§ 17-17A, and was\n\ndoing so from the building at 381 Winthrop Street.                     It sought a\n\nwarrant to search that address.               The magistrate agreed and issued\n\nthe warrant.      Massachusetts state police executed the warrant on\n\nAugust   28,    2003,    and    found    a    fully    equipped     gaming    office.\n\nOfficers seized gaming records, $10,200 in cash, and tape recorders\n\nand   tapes    that     had    been    used     to   record     conversations    with\n\ncustomers.      In addition, police found and seized a loaded pistol,\n\ntwo   loaded    revolvers,      a     sawed-off      shotgun,    various     types   of\n\nammunition, three switchblade knives, a pair of brass knuckles, and\n\na blowgun with needles.\n\n              On June 30, 2004, a        federal grand jury indicted Tzannos\n\non charges of violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), which prohibits\n\npossession of firearms by convicted felons.                   The indictment stated\n\nthat the offense \"involved three to seven firearms\" and that\n\nTzannos possessed at least one of the firearms and at least one\n\npiece of ammunition \"in connection with another felony offense, to\n\nwit: occupying a place for registering bets in violation of Mass.\n\nGen. Laws[] ch. 271, § 17, a Massachusetts offense punishable by\n\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"\n\nC.            The Franks Hearing and the Suppression Order\n\n              On February 15, 2005, Tzannos asked the district court to\n\nconduct a Franks hearing so that he could challenge \"the accuracy\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fand truthfulness of the affidavit.\"               In his motion papers, Tzannos\n\nargued   that   the    affidavit     had     to    be   untruthful     because     (1)\n\nRussolillo swore that the informant placed calls to the 6114 line\n\non four particular days, August 16, 17, 20, and 25, and spoke to\n\nTzannos on each of those days, (2) the defense identified each and\n\nevery caller to that number on those days and \"ha[d] documentation\n\nto back it up,\" and (3) each and every one of those callers had\n\nsigned a statement denying under oath that he or she was the\n\ninformant. Tzannos argued that \"[t]he only logical conclusion that\n\none could possibly reach is that there was no informant, or at\n\nleast    that   no    informant      did     the     things      described   in   the\n\n[Russolillo] affidavit.\" Thus, Tzannos argued, if it were not true\n\nthat the informant made gambling-related calls to Tzannos over the\n\n6114 line on the four days, then it was necessarily true that no\n\ninformant existed and that Russolillo had lied.\n\n           Tzannos's motion was accompanied by an affidavit of\n\ndefense counsel, which in turn was supported by several exhibits.\n\nThose exhibits included (1) some handwritten ledger sheets, which\n\nwere seized during the execution of the search warrant at issue,\n\n(2) a transcript of one of four audiocassette tapes that were also\n\nseized    during     the   search,     and     (3)      signed     statements     from\n\nindividuals that Tzannos identified, from the ledger sheets, as\n\nhaving called to place bets with him on the four days in question.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f           Tzannos focused his challenge on Russolillo's allegation\n\nthat CI-1 had made a controlled call to Tzannos on August 25, 2003\n\non the 6114 line.    Defense counsel represented that the ledger\n\nsheets show that on August 25, only two individuals, \"Jerry\" and\n\n\"Norton,\" called to place bets on the 6114 line.   Counsel further\n\nrepresented that the tape is a recording of telephone calls made to\n\nthe 6114 line on August 25, 2003, and that a transcript of that\n\ntape shows that only three people, \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton,\"\n\nmade gaming-related calls that day to the 6114 line.   Counsel then\n\nattached signed statements from \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton,\"\n\nswearing that \"[a]t no time did I cooperate with the police, nor\n\nwas I a confidential informant.\"\n\n           In response to Tzannos's motion, the government argued\n\nthat he had failed to meet \"the substantial preliminary showing\n\nthat is a prerequisite to obtaining an evidentiary hearing under\n\nFranks.\"   Specifically, the government argued in its reply papers\n\n(1) that there was no evidence that the police had obtained all the\n\ntapes and written records of Tzannos's illegal gambling activities\n\non the days in question; (2) that even if the police had seized\n\nevery tape and record, \"that would not guarantee (nor does Tzannos\n\nclearly assert) that those records reflected every transaction and\n\nphone call that occurred on\" those dates; (3) that there was no\n\nevidence that the tape on which Tzannos heavily relies -- which had\n\nno external markings (other than a Bates number added by the\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fgovernment) -- was actually a recording of all the calls made to\n\nhim on August 25, 2003 and on the 6114 line; and (4) that even if\n\nCI-1 were mistaken about the date or phone line, \"that would be an\n\nerror on CI-1's part and not any indication of perjury by Trooper\n\nRussolillo.\"\n\n           The government also challenged the reliability of the\n\nsigned statements from the bettors Tzannos identified, arguing,\n\ninter alia, that the statements do not reveal the true names of the\n\npurported affiants (whose names and signatures were redacted) and\n\ndo not indicate that those affiants were sworn before anyone\n\nauthorized by law to administer oaths. Even if the affidavits were\n\ngenuine,   the   government   argued,   \"it   would   hardly   have   been\n\nsurprising if . . . 'CI-1' had denied to Tzannos that [he or she]\n\nhad provided information to the State Police.\"             Finally, the\n\ngovernment argued that Tzannos provided no reason why Russolillo\n\nwould have reason to lie and no explanation for how Russolillo\n\ncould have divined the detailed information set forth in his\n\naffidavit -- which Tzannos conceded, and the evidence uncovered\n\nduring the execution of the search warrant confirmed, was accurate\n\n-- if CI-1 did not, in fact, exist.\n\n           In reply, Tzannos essentially reiterated his claim that\n\nhe had \"identified each and every person who could possibly be CI-\n\n1\" and that \"each and every one of these people has signed an\n\naffidavit[] denying . . . that s/he is Russolillo's informant.\" He\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\foffered   in   further   support   of   this   claim   his   own   conclusory\n\naffidavit, which simply asserted that the police \"seized every\n\nsingle paper and record from the third floor of my home\"2 and \"also\n\nseized each and every audio cassette from August[] 2003, as well as\n\nall of the tape recorders I had.\"         His affidavit also stated that\n\nhe \"did not draft any of the papers that were submitted to the\n\n[c]ourt on [his] behalf.\"     His reply papers were also accompanied\n\nby a second affidavit of defense counsel, which stated:\n\n           7.     I personally drafted each and every one\n           of those affidavits.\n\n           . . . .\n\n           16.    I listened to the tapes produced by the\n           prosecution. The vast majority of the tapes\n           are blank. As for the tapes that do contain\n           recordings, I, with assistance from Mr.\n           Tzannos, was able to determine the dates of\n           each tape by comparing the conversations on\n           the tapes to the documents that were seized.\n\n           17.    I was able to determine which tapes\n           recorded   incoming    calls   on   particular\n           telephone numbers because the affidavits state\n           which people called each number. For example,\n           I know from the affidavits which people called\n           . . . (617) 567-6114 . . . .\n\nNeither Tzannos's affidavit nor that of his counsel stated that the\n\nrecords and tapes that were seized reflected every gambling-related\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          It appears that the police searched Tzannos's entire\nresidence, not just the third floor; indeed, Russolillo's affidavit\ndescribed 381 Winthrop Street as \"a one family, three story, wood\nstructure, white siding with black shutters.\"\n\n                                   -10-\n\ftransaction and phone call that occurred on the four days in\n\nquestion.\n\n            After discussion with the parties at a status conference\n\non July 6, 2005, the district court granted Tzannos's motion for a\n\nFranks hearing.          The court did not articulate its reasons for\n\ngranting the hearing and did not make any specific findings of fact\n\nat this time.3\n\n            In     a    memorandum     filed    on    September      23,   2005,   the\n\ngovernment    renewed       its   objection      to   the   Franks    hearing.      It\n\nreiterated its earlier argument that there was no evidence that\n\nRussolillo had lied.         It also explained that it could not divulge\n\nthe identity of CI-1 publicly because doing so would endanger the\n\ninformant's life.          It represented that it was not authorized to\n\ndisclose     the       informant's     name     without     permission     from    the\n\nDepartment    of       Justice    or   the    state    Attorney      General.      The\n\ngovernment offered instead to prove the veracity of Russolillo's\n\naffidavit and the existence of CI-1 in an ex parte, in camera\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          At the Franks hearing itself, however, the court provided\na retrospective account of its reasons for granting the hearing:\n\n          We have a record of people testifying . . . the\n     conversations did not take place at a particular time.\n     That is sufficient evidence to trigger a Franks hearing.\n     It isn't like the defendant is just pulling something out\n     of the clouds.\n          We have people who have stated under oath certain\n     facts. And what I want to do is to have them say it on\n     the witness stand. . . .\n\n                                         -11-\n\fproceeding, in which it would offer, inter alia, testimony of\n\nRussolillo revealing the identity of CI-1.\n\n          In reply, Tzannos agreed to an in camera proceeding, but\n\nobjected to the court's allowing such a proceeding to take place ex\n\nparte.    Tzannos   also   requested      that   the   Franks   hearing   be\n\nstructured as a \"full evidentiary hearing,\" in which defense\n\ncounsel would have \"the opportunity to cross[-]examine the very\n\naffiant whose allegations are at issue.\"         Finally, Tzannos stated\n\nthat it was his intention to show at the hearing, inter alia, that\n\n\"as a matter of practice, he recorded each and every incoming\n\ncall,\" and that \"[a]fter a week's books were settled, he would\n\nerase the tapes and record over them.\"\n\n          The   district   court    convened     the   Franks   hearing   on\n\nSeptember 28, 2005.    At the start of the hearing, the district\n\ncourt announced a procedure that neither party had proposed:\n\n                 [A]ccording to the defendant's proffer\n          of evidence, there are three people [who]\n          spoke [to Tzannos on August 25, 2003]: Paulie,\n          Jerry[,] and Norton. So Paulie, Jerry[,] and\n          Norton at the worst come in and testify that\n          they are not the confidential informant. And\n          I don't have to hear from anybody claiming to\n          be the confidential informant.\n                 And if it turns out that I think that\n          [the controlled] call was not made to [the\n          6114] line on August 25, 2003, I can determine\n          that there is no basis for whatever exists and\n          allow a motion to suppress, without violating\n          the identity of the confidential informant.\n\n          Tzannos made no objections to the procedure; indeed, he\n\nindicated that the three individuals had already been summoned and\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthat they were outside the courtroom at that moment and ready to\n\ntestify.      The government, however, was far less enthusiastic.             It\n\nraised two main objections to the procedure. First, it argued that\n\nthe procedure placed it in a double bind: if one of the three\n\nindividuals were, in fact, CI-1, but testified on the stand to the\n\ncontrary, the government would be placed in a position where it\n\nwould be forced either to knowingly elicit and condone perjurious\n\ntestimony or to \"out\" an informant and expose him or her to mortal\n\ndanger. As a corollary of that argument, the government also noted\n\nthat \"if one of [the three] is the informant and tells the truth,\n\nthen the Court is eliciting a statement that may get the person\n\nkilled,\"      which   is   \"not   [a]   procedure   that   the   government   is\n\nprepared to participate in.\"            Second, the government argued that\n\nthere was a \"fundamental flaw\" in the procedure, which it could not\n\nexplain in open court without providing information that would\n\nnecessarily divulge CI-1's identity, but which it could explain \"in\n\none sentence ex parte [and] in camera.\"             The government stressed\n\nthat \"the Court would not come out with the truthful and just\n\nresult   if    the    Court   follow[ed]    the   procedure   that   the   Court\n\noutlined.\"\n\n              The court refused to hear the government's explanation ex\n\nparte and in camera.          It also refused the government's original\n\nproposal, which was to provide to the court evidence of the\n\nexistence and identity of the informant ex parte and in camera.\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fThe court stated that \"[t]here are two things I don't want\": \"one,\n\nI don't want to do an ex parte hearing,\" and \"two, I don't want to\n\nknow who the confidential informant is.\"        It also explained:\n\n                 There is nothing absolute about the\n          confidential informant and confidentiality. I\n          mean, it has to be weighed under all the\n          circumstances.\n                 I think my suggest[ed procedure] is a\n          good one. I don't even want to know who the\n          confidential informant is.\n                 I just want to know are these three\n          people going to take the stand and say they\n          are not. And if they take the stand and say\n          they are not, then that is the end of it. I\n          am not going to say who is it.\n\n          The court went further.       It stated:\n\n          [I]f it turns out that the defendant puts\n          three people on the stand and the tapes verify\n          that only these three people made phone calls\n          and that's it, and none of the three is the\n          confidential informant, that is it as far as I\n          am concerned. I don't have to hear any more.\n          I will allow the motion to suppress.\n\nTo the government's argument that \"[t]he issue here is not whether\n\nthe confidential informant gave somewhat incorrect or incomplete or\n\nany other degree of defective evidence\" but \"whether Trooper\n\nRussolillo lied under oath,\" the court stated: \"I don't think I\n\nhave to find that he lied.      I can find that none of those three\n\npeople is the confidential informant and that no other calls were\n\nmade that day and that, therefore, there is no basis for whatever\n\nit was and then I am going to suppress it.\"\n\n          Unwilling   to   go   along    with   the   court's   proposed\n\nprocedure, the government submitted a written request that the\n\n                                 -14-\n\fcourt reconsider its rejection of the government's request to\n\nproceed ex parte and in camera. In the alternative, the government\n\nrequested that the court enter an order suppressing the fruits of\n\nthe    search   so    that   the        procedure        could   be    appealed.\n\n            Tzannos   objected    and    sought     to    question    the     three\n\nindividuals, whom he identified as Jerry Ahearn, Paulie DeStefano,\n\nand Joseph McParland. In the ensuing colloquy, the court said that\n\nit was willing to allow the three individuals to testify, in part\n\nso that a record could be created for the appeal.                The government\n\nagain objected, stating that it could not cross-examine the three\n\nindividuals.       It then agreed to stipulate that if the three\n\nindividuals were called to testify, they would each testify that he\n\nhad called Tzannos on August 25, 2003, and that he had never been\n\na confidential informant or made a controlled call for Russolillo.\n\nThe   government    emphasized,    however,    that       it   was   making   this\n\nstipulation \"with the understanding that for the reasons previously\n\nexplained the government cannot cross-examine these individuals to\n\nbring out the truth,\" and that \"the government is not conceding the\n\ntruth.\"    The court then suppressed the evidence seized pursuant to\n\nthe search warrant.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            We bypass the question of whether Tzannos made the\n\n\"substantial preliminary showing\" necessary to invoke a Franks\n\nhearing.    Franks, 438 U.S. at 156-57.        Instead, we review de novo\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fthe district court's ultimate decision to suppress the evidence\n\nobtained pursuant to the warrant at issue.4       United States v.\n\nDessesaure, 429 F.3d 359, 365 (1st Cir. 2005).    We also evaluate,\n\nfor abuse of discretion, the procedure the district court used at\n\nthe Franks hearing and the district court's refusal to hear, ex\n\nparte and in camera, the government's explanation of why that\n\nprocedure was flawed.   Cf. United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 62\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (noting that \"it is entirely within the discretion\n\nof the judge presented with the request to decide whether the\n\ndisclosure [of a confidential informant's identity] is necessary in\n\norder to determine the believability of the testifying officer,\"\n\nand reviewing for abuse of discretion the trial judge's refusal to\n\nallow an in camera hearing to probe the identity of the informant).\n\nAs always, factual findings made by a district court in connection\n\nwith a Franks hearing are reviewed for clear error.    Id.\n\nA.        The Suppression Order\n\n          \"There is . . . a presumption of validity with respect to\n\nthe affidavit supporting the search warrant.\"    Franks, 438 U.S. at\n\n\n     4\n          That the government requested the entry of the\nsuppression order -- after its procedural offer was rejected --\ndoes not affect our analysis. The district court made clear that\nit intended to go forward with the procedure it devised, and it\nalso made clear that if each of the three individuals identified by\nTzannos as the only callers to the 6114 line on August 25 were to\ntestify that he was not the informant, or if the government were to\nrefuse to participate in the procedure, the consequence would be\nsuppression.   The government's request merely allowed the court\nmore quickly to reach what the court had already declared to be a\nforegone conclusion.\n\n                                -16-\n\f171.    For this reason, a defendant must meet a high bar even to get\n\na Franks hearing in the first place.           In order for a warrant to be\n\nvoided and the fruits of the search excluded, the defendant must\n\nmeet an even more exacting standard: he must (1) show that the\n\naffiant in fact made a false statement knowingly and intentionally,\n\nor with reckless disregard for the truth, (2) make this showing by\n\na preponderance of the evidence, and (3) show in addition that\n\n\"with    the    affidavit's    false    material   set   to    one   side,    the\n\naffidavit's remaining content is insufficient to establish probable\n\ncause.\"    Id. at 156.\n\n               Our analysis turns on the first two factors; we do not\n\nreach the third.\n\n               The alleged falsehood in the affidavit is that Trooper\n\nRussolillo fabricated the existence of a confidential informant.\n\nThat    Russolillo      made    the    false     statement     knowingly     and\n\nintelligently is shown, defendant says, by his having stated that\n\nhe was present at the controlled call made by CI-1 to Tzannos on\n\nAugust 25, 2003 to the 6114 line.\n\n               The district court's decision to suppress the fruits of\n\nthe search would be proper only if it found, by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence, that Tzannos proved three assertions. First, Tzannos\n\nmust    show     that   only   \"Paulie,\"      \"Jerry,\"   and   \"Norton\"      made\n\ngaming-related calls to Tzannos on the 6114 line on August 25,\n\n2003, and that therefore CI-1 had to be one of the three.                  To do\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fso, he must show that the audiocassette tape on which he relied was\n\na recording of calls made to him on the 6114 line, that the\n\nrecording was of calls made on August 25, 2003, that all calls made\n\nto the 6114 line on August 25 were in fact recorded on that tape,\n\nand that the transcript entered into evidence was accurate and\n\ncomplete. Second, even if each of these assertions were proven, it\n\ndoes not follow that CI-1 does not exist; Tzannos still must prove,\n\nby    a   preponderance         of    the    evidence,         that      each    of   the     three\n\nindividuals     is    telling         the    truth       in    denying     being      CI-1    and,\n\nfurther, that the real CI-1 did not provide misinformation, whether\n\ninadvertently        or    purposefully,                to    Russolillo.             Third    and\n\nultimately, Tzannos must show, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nthat Trooper Russolillo made a false statement knowingly and\n\nintentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n             We begin with the first of the three assertions Tzannos\n\nmust prove.     Tzannos did not show that the tape on which he relied\n\nwas actually of calls made to the 6114 line on August 25, 2003.\n\nThe   tape   itself       was    unmarked,         and       nothing     in     the   transcript\n\nsupplied by Tzannos identifies what number the callers dialed or on\n\nwhat date they called.               The only proffer Tzannos made relating the\n\nthree     conversations         he    transcribed            off    of   that     tape   to    the\n\nparticular line and date of the controlled call were his own\n\naffidavit,     two    affidavits            of    counsel,         and   their    accompanying\n\nexhibits.     Counsel's second affidavit stated that, with Tzannos's\n\n\n                                                 -18-\n\fhelp, counsel determined the date of the tape by comparing the\n\nrecorded   conversations   to   the   ledgers   that   were   seized,   and\n\ndetermined the line on which those conversations had taken place by\n\nlooking to the signed statements she solicited from the bettors.\n\nNothing in the record establishes that the bettors' statements were\n\ntruthful or accurate, or that the seized documents completely and\n\naccurately recorded all betting-related transactions. Indeed, what\n\nTzannos asserted is the ledger from August 25 stated only that\n\n\"Jerry\" and \"Norton\" called to place bets; it made no reference to\n\n\"Paulie\" or to individuals who called to discuss betting lines\n\nwithout placing a bet.\n\n           Further, Tzannos has failed to show (1) that he recorded\n\nevery gambling-related call, on every line, and on every date as a\n\nmatter of course, (2) that the four tapes identified in his\n\ncounsel's affidavit contained every call to the 6114 line that\n\nTzannos recorded on August 25, and (3) that the one transcript\n\nTzannos provided of calls allegedly made on August 25 to the 6114\n\nline was complete and accurate.       Indeed, while Tzannos stated in\n\nhis pre-trial memorandum that he would prove at the Franks hearing\n\nthat he routinely taped every incoming call, he never made that\n\nshowing.\n\n           Tzannos largely disproved his own argument.        He admitted\n\nin that same pre-trial memorandum that after a week's books were\n\nsettled, it was his practice to erase the tapes and to record over\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fthem.       He did not say on which day of the week he did so, or\n\nwhether the practice was irregular.                   Most of the tapes seized\n\nduring the search were blank or unintelligible, tending to disprove\n\nhis assertion that the tapes are accurate evidence of the calls he\n\nreceived.5     He did not show that the tapes contained each and every\n\ncall made to him on the four dates in question, let alone on August\n\n25.   In fact, defense counsel's affidavit made reference to three\n\nother tapes, allegedly of incoming calls made by a number of other\n\ncallers \"on several days, including August 25, 2003.\"                      Tzannos did\n\nnot provide transcripts of any of these other tapes.\n\n              Nor did he prove the accuracy of the one transcript he\n\ndid     provide.        The    transcript         itself   appears    to    end    mid-\n\nconversation,       thus      suggesting    that     either   the    transcript    was\n\nincomplete or that the tape stopped recording in the middle of a\n\ncall.       These   inconsistencies         substantially     undercut      Tzannos's\n\nshowing.\n\n\n\n        5\n          Even the tape on which Tzannos largely relies appears to\nhave some technical problems.     For example, according to the\ntranscript, the tape has a two-line conversation between two\nunidentified individuals, in which the name \"Dahlia\" is mentioned:\n\n      F:   Heya.    [inaudible].   I [inaudible].                     I    ain't\n      [inaudible] that's bad luck. C and Dahlia.\n\n      F2:     Dahlia.\n\nNothing in the record explains who took part in this conversation,\nwhat the conversation was about, and whether the conversation was\nactually only two-lines long or whether it was recorded over or cut\noff.\n\n                                           -20-\n\f            The district court did not make any explicit findings of\n\nfact at the Franks hearing.        Nonetheless, it must implicitly have\n\nfound   that   Tzannos's   evidence    was       sufficient   to   show,   by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that only \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and\n\n\"Norton,\" made gambling-related calls to Tzannos on the 6114 line\n\non August 25.     Given the substantial gaps in the evidence, this\n\nfinding was clear error and alone provides a basis for reversal.\n\n            There are further grounds, however, for reversing the\n\nsuppression order.     Even if Tzannos had proven his first assertion\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence, it does not follow that he\n\nproved by a preponderance of the evidence that no confidential\n\ninformant exists.\n\n            Ultimately, Tzannos must demonstrate, by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, that the affiant, Trooper Russolillo, rather than\n\nthe informant, made a false statement knowingly and intentionally,\n\nor   with   reckless   disregard    for    the    truth.      \"Allegations      of\n\nnegligence or innocent mistake are insufficient,\" Franks, 438 U.S.\n\nat 171, as are allegations going to show that the informant relayed\n\nmisinformation to the affiant, see id. (\"The deliberate falsity or\n\nreckless disregard whose impeachment is permitted today is only\n\nthat of the affiant, not of any nongovernmental informant.\");\n\nUnited States v. Southard, 700 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"Franks'\n\nrequirements cannot be satisfied by a showing that an informer lied\n\nto an unsuspecting affiant, even when the lie was deliberate.\").\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\f          Tzannos has not contested the accuracy of any of the\n\nsubstantive information provided by CI-1 to Russolillo, and has not\n\nexplained how Russolillo would have obtained such detailed and\n\naccurate information if CI-1 did not exist.    Nor has Tzannos made\n\nany showing of why Russolillo would have reason to lie.     He thus\n\nhas not met his burden of showing that Russolillo made a false\n\nstatement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard\n\nfor the truth.     To the extent that the district court        held\n\notherwise, it committed clear error.6   We hold that the court erred\n\nin suppressing the evidence.\n\nB.        Problems with the District Court's Procedure at the\n          Franks Hearing\n\n          The government also appeals (1) the district court's\n\nrefusal to hear the government's one-line explanation of why the\n\nprocedure that the court devised for the Franks hearing was, in the\n\ngovernment's view, flawed, and (2) the court's ultimate decision to\n\ngo forward with the hearing without listening to that explanation.7\n\n\n\n     6\n          The district court stated: \"I don't think I have to find\nthat [Russolillo] lied. I can find that none of those three people\nis the confidential informant and that no other calls were made\nthat day and that, therefore, there is no basis for whatever it was\nand then I am going to suppress it.\" The court did not state that\nif Tzannos did not show that Russolillo lied, then he at least\nneeded to show that Russolillo acted with a reckless disregard for\ntruth.\n     7\n          The government does not appeal from the court's rejection\nof its initial proposal to have an evidentiary hearing, ex parte\nand in camera, in which it would, inter alia, call Russolillo to\ntestify to the truth of his affidavit and to identify CI-1.\n\n                               -22-\n\f          At the Franks hearing, when the government asked to\n\nexplain to the court, in one sentence, what the government argued\n\nwas a \"fundamental flaw\" in the court's analysis, the court refused\n\nto hear the explanation ex parte and in camera, despite the\n\ngovernment's entreaties that the way the court structured the\n\nproceeding would jeopardize the life of the informant and lead to\n\na miscarriage of justice.   The court in essence shifted the burden\n\nof proof to the government: short of proving CI-1's existence,\n\nthere was no way the government could disprove the defendant's\n\nallegations.\n\n          The court's position effectively eliminated the privilege\n\nthe government has under Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53\n\n(1957),8 to protect the identity of confidential informants.   The\n\ncourt's refusal to hear the government's explanation and its\n\ninsistence on going forward with the procedure of its own devising\n\nwere thus an abuse of discretion.\n\n          In oft-quoted language, Roviaro stated:\n\n          What is usually referred to as the informer's\n          privilege is in reality the Government's\n          privilege to withhold from disclosure the\n          identity of persons who furnish information of\n          violations of law to officers charged with\n          enforcement of that law. The purpose of the\n          privilege is the furtherance and protection of\n\n\n\n     8\n          Unlike Roviaro, the issue here is not the suppression of\nthe informant's testimony, but rather the suppression of the fruits\nof the search pursuant to a warrant issued by a state court judge\nand presumed to be valid.\n\n                                -23-\n\f            the   public      interest         in     effective       law\n            enforcement.\n\nId. at 59 (citations omitted).           The privilege, while significant,\n\nis not absolute.        Thus, \"[w]here the disclosure of an informer's\n\nidentity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and\n\nhelpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair\n\ndetermination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\"                     Id. at 60-\n\n61; see also id. at 60 (holding that \"where the disclosure of the\n\ncontents of a communication will not tend to reveal the identity of\n\nan   informer,    the     contents      are    not     privileged,\"         and   that\n\n\"[l]ikewise, once the identity of the informer has been disclosed\n\nto those who would have cause to resent the communication, the\n\nprivilege is no longer applicable\").\n\n            Ultimately, Roviaro requires a \"balancing [of] the public\n\ninterest   in    protecting      the    flow   of     information      against     the\n\nindividual's right to prepare his defense.\"                  Id. at 62.      \"Whether\n\na proper balance . . . [requires] nondisclosure . . . must depend\n\non   the   particular     circumstances        of     each    case,    taking     into\n\nconsideration     the    crime   charged,       the    possible       defenses,    the\n\npossible   significance     of    the    informer's      testimony,         and   other\n\nrelevant factors.\" Id.; see also McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300,\n\n311 (1967).      This court has stated that \"when the government\n\ninformant is not an actual participant or a witness to the offense,\n\ndisclosure is required only in those exceptional cases where the\n\ndefendant can point to some concrete circumstance that might\n\n                                        -24-\n\fjustify overriding both the public interest in encouraging the flow\n\nof information, and the informant's private interest in his or her\n\nown safety.\"    United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 921 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n           Tzannos, as the party seeking disclosure, bore the burden\n\nof persuasion in this analysis.    See United States v. Gomez-Genao,\n\n267 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2001); see also United States v. Perez, 299\n\nF.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[T]he law         places the burden squarely\n\non the party seeking disclosure (typically, the defendant) to\n\ndemonstrate that knowledge of the identity of a confidential\n\ninformant is vital to the proper preparation and presentation of\n\nhis case.\").    This court has described this burden as a \"heavy\"\n\none.   United States v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104, 106 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nThe government argues that Tzannos has failed to meet this burden\n\nand that the court abused its discretion in implicitly holding\n\notherwise.\n\n           For his part, Tzannos offers no arguments as to why\n\ndisclosure of the confidential informant's identity was warranted\n\nin this case.       Instead, Tzannos puts all of his stock in two\n\narguments, of which we readily dispose. His first argument is that\n\nhe never asked the court to order the disclosure of CI-1's identity\n\nand thus Roviaro does not even apply.             The court's procedure,\n\nhowever,   placed   the   government   in   a    Catch-22:   it   could   not\n\nparticipate in the Franks hearing without risking exposing its\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\finformant (or suborning perjury), and it could not explain to the\n\ncourt, beyond the other arguments it made, why the court's analysis\n\nwas flawed without effectively disclosing the identity of its\n\ninformant.       That the court did not require the government to say\n\nthe actual name of the informant is of little significance; it was\n\nrequiring the government to provide information that would, for all\n\npractical    purposes,     divulge      the    informant's       identity.        \"The\n\nprivilege identified in Roviaro protects more than just the name of\n\nthe informant and extends to information that would tend to reveal\n\nthe identity of the informant.\"            United States v. Napier, 436 F.3d\n\n1133, 1136 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\n            Tzannos's second argument as to why Roviaro does not\n\napply is that \"if one of the three would-be witnesses turned out to\n\nbe CI-1, then that witness had voluntarily put himself in the\n\nposition    of    having   to   admit     being   an    informant.\"      Tzannos's\n\nargument rests on mistaken premises: as we noted above, the Roviaro\n\nprivilege does not belong to the informant, but rather to the\n\ngovernment.       Thus, even assuming that CI-1 was one of the three\n\nindividuals identified by Tzannos, so long as that individual has\n\nnot   voluntarily     disclosed    his     status      as   an   informant   to    the\n\ndefendant, the government may still invoke its \"privilege to\n\nwithhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish\n\ninformation      of   violations     of    law    to    officers     charged      with\n\nenforcement of that law.\"         Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 59.\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\f            The government emphatically argued that the particular\n\ncircumstances of this case warranted protection of the informant's\n\nidentity.    It repeatedly stressed during the course of the Franks\n\nhearing and in its filings that CI-1 would likely be murdered if\n\nhis   identity    were    publicly    disclosed.      It     also    pointed    to\n\nRussolillo's affidavit, which stated that \"traditional organized\n\ncrime families (such as La Cosa Nostra or the Mafia) and other\n\norganized crime groups (such as the Winter Hill Gang) in the Boston\n\narea have been heavily involved in illegal gaming and bookmaking\n\nand have maintained a significant degree of control over organized\n\nbookmaking operations,\" and that \"compromis[ing] the anonymity of\n\nthe   confidential       reliable    informant     [would]       mak[e]   him/her\n\nsusceptible to physical harm and/or retribution.\"\n\n            Against    the    government's   interest       in   protecting    the\n\nidentity    of   the   informant,    we   must    balance    \"the    fundamental\n\nrequirements of fairness\" and Tzannos's right to prepare his\n\ndefense.    Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 60.             Generally, the defendant's\n\ncompeting interests are of a lesser magnitude at the suppression\n\nstage than at trial.         See United States v. Jackson, 918 F.2d 236,\n\n240 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667,\n\n679 (1980)); cf. McCray, 386 U.S. at 312 (\"[T]he Court in the\n\nexercise of its power to formulate evidentiary rules for federal\n\ncriminal cases has consistently declined to hold that an informer's\n\nidentity need always be disclosed in a federal criminal trial, let\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\falone in a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause for an\n\narrest or search.\").

Nor has Tzannos\n\nshown that the disclosure of the informant's identity would allow\n\nhim to meet his burden under Franks.\n\n            Tzannos has failed to show why disclosure of the identity\n\nof CI-1 is warranted in the circumstances of this case.

The court appeared to accept the defendant's representations, and it rejected the government's request that it consider contrary information, which the government had sought to present ex parte and in camera based on its representation that doing otherwise would endanger the informant's life.

Russolillo included a fourteen-page affidavit in support of the application. The affidavit made the following assertions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russolillo and another state trooper knew Gregory Tzannos to be involved in the bookmaking business from information from past investigations \"coupled with intelligence from other informants\" as well as from the confidential informant central to this case. In early July of 2003, Russolillo and another state trooper spoke to the confidential informant, \"CI-1.\" CI-1 agreed to provide information to the troopers only if his<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> identity was not revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CI-1 told the troopers that he was placing illegal bets on sporting events with Gregory Tzannos via telephone. The informant said he had placed the bets by calling (617) 567-6114 (\"the 6114 line\") and by speaking to Tzannos directly. The officers subpoenaed the telephone company and discovered that that number belonged to Tzannos and that it was unpublished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They also discovered via subpoena that calls to the 6114 line had been forwarded to a separate number, (617) 846-6630, on several days in August. This was significant because bookmakers often used call forwarding to disguise the location of their operations. The officers discovered that the second phone number, (617) 846-6630, was registered to a corporation, DBA: American Eagle Purchasing Agents, at 381 Winthrop Street, Winthrop, Massachusetts. The person listed in state records as the corporation's treasurer and registered agent was Tzannos, who was also listed on the telephone bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russolillo spoke to CI-1 on August 18 and was told that CI-1 had placed \"several wagers\" with Tzannos over the 6114 line on August 16 and 17. On August 20, another officer spoke to CI-1 and was told that CI-1 had placed another bet with Tzannos that day, again on the 6114 line. Troopers subsequently conducted surveillance at 381 Winthrop Street and, on several separate days, observed vehicles registered to a Linda Wagner; this was significant because CI-1 had told police that Tzannos had a girlfriend named \"Linda.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit recounted that on August 25, 2003, CI-1 and Russolillo placed a \"controlled call\" to Tzannos on the 6114 line. This allegation is key to Tzannos's later <i>Franks</i> motion. The affidavit explained that in a controlled call, the police officer dials the number, waits until the target of the investigation answers, hands the phone to the informant, and then watches as the informant speaks to the target. CI-1 told Russolillo that Tzannos was the person who answered the phone during the controlled call, and that Tzannos proceeded to give a rundown of the day's betting lines for baseball.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russolillo's affidavit stated that CI-1 had provided information to Russolillo and other troopers in the past, and the information \"has proven to be reliable and true.\" It said the troopers had known CI-1 for more than two years and that they knew his identity and address. The affidavit also gave extensive details on CI-1's past cooperation, stating, for example, that CI-1 had identified various bookmakers and their identities and telephone numbers, that all of the information had been corroborated by subsequent investigation, and that past information from CI-1 had led to the arrest, prosecution, and conviction of three men for gaming violations. The affidavit stated that CI-1 had also provided general intelligence information regarding other criminal matters, but that the affiant could not detail the particulars of these cases, because doing so would compromise the anonymity of the informant, making him \"susceptible to physical harm and/or retribution.\" It explained that Russolillo had \"learned that traditional organized crime families (such as La Cosa Nostra or the Mafia) and other organized crime groups (such as the Winter Hill Gang) in the Boston area have been heavily involved in illegal gaming and bookmaking and have maintained a significant degree of control over organized bookmaking operations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The State Search Warrant, the Search, and the Federal Indictment</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit asserted that CI-1's information, combined with the officers' investigation, sufficed to create probable cause to believe that Tzannos was violating state laws forbidding certain gaming activities, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167;&#167; 17-17A, and was doing so from the building at 381 Winthrop Street. It sought a warrant to search that address. The magistrate agreed and issued the warrant. Massachusetts state police executed the warrant on August 28, 2003, and found a fully equipped gaming office. Officers seized gaming records, $10,200 in cash, and tape recorders and tapes that had been used to record conversations with customers. In addition, police found and seized a loaded pistol, two loaded revolvers, a sawed-off shotgun, various types of ammunition, three switchblade knives, a pair of brass knuckles, and a blowgun with needles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 2004, a federal grand jury indicted Tzannos on charges of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), which prohibits possession of firearms by convicted felons. The indictment stated that the offense \"involved three to seven firearms\" and that Tzannos possessed at least one of the firearms and at least one piece of ammunition \"in connection with another felony offense, to wit: occupying a place for registering bets in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws[] ch. 271, &#167; 17, a Massachusetts offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" C. <i>The Franks Hearing and the Suppression Order</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 2005, Tzannos asked the district court to conduct a <i>Franks</i> hearing so that he could challenge \"the accuracy and truthfulness of the affidavit.\" In his motion papers, Tzannos argued that the affidavit had to be untruthful because (1) Russolillo swore that the informant placed calls to the 6114 line on four particular days, August 16, 17, 20, and 25, and spoke to Tzannos on each of those days, (2) the defense identified each and every caller to that number on those days and \"ha[d] documentation to back it up,\" and (3) each and every one of those callers had signed a statement denying under oath that he or she was the informant. Tzannos argued that \"[t]he only logical conclusion that one could possibly reach is that there was no informant, or at least that no informant did the things described in the [Russolillo] affidavit.\" Thus, Tzannos argued, if it were not true that the informant made gambling-related calls to Tzannos over the 6114 line on the four days, then it was necessarily true that no informant existed and that Russolillo had lied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos's motion was accompanied by an affidavit of defense counsel, which in turn was supported by several exhibits. Those exhibits included (1) some handwritten ledger sheets, which were seized during the execution of the search warrant at issue, (2) a transcript of one of four audiocassette tapes that were also seized during the search, and (3) signed statements from individuals that Tzannos identified, from the ledger sheets, as having called to place bets with him on the four days in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos focused his challenge on Russolillo's allegation that CI-1 had made a controlled call to Tzannos on August 25, 2003 on the 6114 line. Defense counsel represented that the ledger sheets show that on August 25, only two individuals, \"Jerry\" and \"Norton,\" called to place bets on the 6114 line. Counsel further represented that the tape is a recording of telephone calls made to the 6114 line on August 25, 2003, and that a transcript of that tape shows that only three people, \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton,\" made gaming-related calls that day to the 6114 line. Counsel then attached signed statements from \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton,\" swearing that \"[a]t no time did I cooperate with the police, nor was I a confidential informant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Tzannos's motion, the government argued that he had failed to meet \"the substantial preliminary showing that is a prerequisite to obtaining an evidentiary hearing under <i>Franks.</i>\" Specifically, the government argued in its reply papers (1) that there was no evidence that the police had obtained <i>all</i> the tapes and written records of Tzannos's illegal gambling activities on the days in question; (2) that even if the police had seized every tape and record, \"that would not guarantee (nor does Tzannos clearly assert) that those records reflected every transaction and phone call that occurred on\" those dates; (3) that there was no evidence that the tape on which Tzannos heavily relies &#8212; which had no external markings (other than a Bates number added by the government) &#8212; was actually a recording of <i>all</i> the calls made to him on August 25, 2003 and on the 6114 line; and (4) that even if CI-1 were mistaken about the date or phone line, \"that would be an error on CI-1's part and <i>not</i> any indication of perjury by Trooper Russolillo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also challenged the reliability of the signed statements from the bettors Tzannos identified, arguing, inter alia, that the statements do not reveal the true names of the purported affiants (whose names and signatures were redacted) and do not indicate that those affiants were sworn before anyone authorized by law to administer oaths. Even if the affidavits were genuine, the government argued, \"it would hardly have been surprising if . . . `CI-1' had denied to Tzannos that [he or she] had provided information to the State Police.\" Finally, the government argued that Tzannos provided no reason why Russolillo would have reason to lie and no explanation for how Russolillo could have divined the detailed information set forth in his affidavit &#8212; which Tzannos conceded, and the evidence uncovered during the execution of the search warrant confirmed, was accurate &#8212; if CI-1 did not, in fact, exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reply, Tzannos essentially reiterated his claim that he had \"identified each and every person who could possibly be CI-1\" and that \"each and every one of these people has signed an affidavit[] denying . . . that s/he is Russolillo's informant.\" He offered in further support of this claim his own conclusory affidavit, which simply asserted that the police \"seized every single paper and record from the third floor of my home\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and \"also seized each and every audio cassette from August[] 2003, as well as all of the tape recorders I had.\" His affidavit also stated that he \"did not draft any of the papers that were submitted to the [c]ourt on [his] behalf.\" His reply papers were also accompanied by a second affidavit of defense counsel, which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. I personally drafted each and every one of those affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">16. I listened to the tapes produced by the prosecution. The vast majority of the tapes are blank. As for the tapes that do contain recordings, I, with assistance from Mr. Tzannos, was able to determine the dates of each tape by comparing the conversations on the tapes to the documents that were seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">17. I was able to determine which tapes recorded incoming calls on particular telephone numbers because the affidavits state which people called each number. For example, I know from the affidavits which people called . . . (617) 567-6114 . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Tzannos's affidavit nor that of his counsel stated that the records and tapes that were seized reflected every gambling-related transaction and phone call that occurred on the four days in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discussion with the parties at a status conference on July 6, 2005, the district court granted Tzannos's motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing. The court did not articulate its reasons for granting the hearing and did not make any specific findings of fact at this time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum filed on September 23, 2005, the government renewed its objection to the <i>Franks</i> hearing. It reiterated its earlier argument that there was no evidence that Russolillo had lied. It also explained that it could not divulge the identity of CI-1 publicly because doing so would endanger the informant's life. It represented that it was not authorized to disclose the informant's name without permission from the Department of Justice or the state Attorney General. The government offered instead to prove the veracity of Russolillo's affidavit and the existence of CI-1 in an ex parte, in camera proceeding, in which it would offer, inter alia, testimony of Russolillo revealing the identity of CI-1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reply, Tzannos agreed to an in camera proceeding, but objected to the court's allowing such a proceeding to take place ex parte. Tzannos also requested that the <i>Franks</i> hearing be structured as a \"full evidentiary hearing,\" in which defense counsel would have \"the opportunity to cross[-]examine the very affiant whose allegations are at issue.\" Finally, Tzannos stated that it was his intention to show at the hearing, inter alia, that \"as a matter of practice, he recorded each and every incoming call,\" and that \"[a]fter a week's books were settled, he would erase the tapes and record over them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened the <i>Franks</i> hearing on September 28, 2005. At the start of the hearing, the district court announced a procedure that neither party had proposed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ccording to the defendant's proffer of evidence, there are three people [who] spoke [to Tzannos on August 25, 2003]: Paulie, Jerry[,] and Norton. So Paulie, Jerry[,] and Norton at the worst come in and testify that they are not the confidential informant. And I don't have to hear from anybody claiming to be the confidential informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And if it turns out that I think that [the controlled] call was not made to [the 6114] line on August 25, 2003, I can determine that there is no basis for whatever exists and allow a motion to suppress, without violating the identity of the confidential informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos made no objections to the procedure; indeed, he indicated that the three individuals had already been summoned and that they were outside the courtroom at that moment and ready to testify. The government, however, was far less enthusiastic. It raised two main objections to the procedure. First, it argued that the procedure placed it in a double bind: if one of the three individuals were, in fact, CI-1, but testified on the stand to the contrary, the government would be placed in a position where it would be forced either to knowingly elicit and condone perjurious testimony or to \"out\" an informant and expose him or her to mortal danger. As a corollary of that argument, the government also noted that \"if one of [the three] is the informant and tells the truth, then the Court is eliciting a statement that may get the person killed,\" which is \"not [a] procedure that the government is prepared to participate in.\" Second, the government argued that there was a \"fundamental flaw\" in the procedure, which it could not explain in open court without providing information that would necessarily divulge CI-1's identity, but which it could explain \"in one sentence ex parte [and] in camera.\" The government stressed that \"the Court would not come out with the truthful and just result if the Court follow[ed] the procedure that the Court outlined.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court refused to hear the government's explanation ex parte and in camera. It also refused the government's original proposal, which was to provide to the court evidence of the existence and identity of the informant ex parte and in camera. The court stated that \"[t]here are two things I don't want\": \"one, I don't want to do an ex parte hearing,\" and \"two, I don't want to know who the confidential informant is.\" It also explained: There is nothing absolute about the confidential informant and confidentiality. I mean, it has to be weighed under all the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think my suggest[ed procedure] is a good one.

And if they take the stand and say they are not, then that is the end of it. I am not going to say who is it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court went further. It stated:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f it turns out that the defendant puts three people on the stand and the tapes verify that only these three people made phone calls and that's it, and none of the three is the confidential informant, that is it as far as I am concerned. I don't have to hear any more. I will allow the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the government's argument that \"[t]he issue here is not whether the confidential informant gave somewhat incorrect or incomplete or any other degree of defective evidence\" but \"whether Trooper Russolillo lied under oath,\" the court stated: \"I don't think I have to find that he lied. I can find that none of those three people is the confidential informant and that no other calls were made that day and that, therefore, there is no basis for whatever it was and then I am going to suppress it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unwilling to go along with the court's proposed procedure, the government submitted a written request that the court reconsider its rejection of the government's request to proceed ex parte and in camera. In the alternative, the government requested that the court enter an order suppressing the fruits of the search so that the procedure could be appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos objected and sought to question the three individuals, whom he identified as Jerry Ahearn, Paulie DeStefano, and Joseph McParland. In the ensuing colloquy, the court said that it was willing to allow the three individuals to testify, in part so that a record could be created for the appeal. The government again objected, stating that it could not cross-examine the three individuals. It then agreed to stipulate that if the three individuals were called to testify, they would each testify that he had called Tzannos on August 25, 2003, and that he had never been a confidential informant or made a controlled call for Russolillo. The government emphasized, however, that it was making this stipulation \"with the understanding that for the reasons previously explained the government cannot cross-examine these individuals to bring out the truth,\" and that \"the government is not conceding the truth.\" The court then suppressed the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bypass the question of whether Tzannos made the \"substantial preliminary showing\" necessary to invoke a <i>Franks</i> hearing. <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 156-57, 98 S.Ct. 2674. Instead, we review de novo the district court's ultimate decision to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>United States</i> v. <i>Dessesaure,</i> 429 F.3d 359, 365 (1st Cir. 2005). We also evaluate, for abuse of discretion, the procedure the district court used at the <i>Franks</i> hearing and the district court's refusal to hear, ex parte and in camera, the government's explanation of why that procedure was flawed. <i>Cf. United States v. Valerio,</i> 48 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that \"it is entirely within the discretion of the judge presented with the request to decide whether the disclosure [of a confidential informant's identity] is necessary in order to determine the believability of the testifying officer,\" and reviewing for abuse of discretion the trial judge's refusal to allow an in camera hearing to probe the identity of the informant). As always, factual findings made by a district court in connection with a <i>Franks</i> hearing are reviewed for clear error. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Suppression Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"There is . . . a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant.\" <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674. For this reason, a defendant must meet a high bar even to get a <i>Franks</i> hearing in the first place. In order for a warrant to be voided and the fruits of the search excluded, the defendant must meet an even more exacting standard: he must (1) show that the affiant in fact made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, (2) make this showing by a preponderance of the evidence, and (3) show in addition that \"with the affidavit's false material set to one side, the affidavit's remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause.\" <i>Id.</i> at 156, 98 S.Ct. 2674.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis turns on the first two factors; we do not reach the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The alleged falsehood in the affidavit is that Trooper Russolillo fabricated the existence of a confidential informant. That Russolillo made the false statement knowingly and intelligently is shown, defendant says, by his having stated that he was present at the controlled call made by CI-1 to Tzannos on August 25, 2003 to the 6114 line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision to suppress the fruits of the search would be proper only if it found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Tzannos proved three assertions. First, Tzannos must show that only \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton\" made gaming-related calls to Tzannos on the 6114 line on August 25, 2003, and that therefore CI-1 had to be one of the three. To do so, he must show that the audiocassette tape on which he relied was a recording of calls made to him on the 6114 line, that the recording was of calls made on August 25, 2003, that <i>all</i> calls made to the 6114 line on August 25 were in fact recorded on that tape, and that the transcript entered into evidence was accurate and complete. Second, even if each of these assertions were proven, it does not follow that CI-1 does not exist; Tzannos still must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that each of the three individuals is telling the truth in denying being CI-1 and, further, that the real CI-1 did not provide misinformation, whether inadvertently or purposefully, to Russolillo. Third and ultimately, Tzannos must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Trooper Russolillo made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the first of the three assertions Tzannos must prove. Tzannos did not show that the tape on which he relied was actually of calls made to the 6114 line on August 25, 2003. The tape itself was unmarked, and nothing in the transcript supplied by Tzannos identifies what number the callers dialed or on what date they called. The only proffer Tzannos made relating the three conversations he transcribed off of that tape to the particular line and date of the controlled call were his own affidavit, two affidavits of counsel, and their accompanying exhibits. Counsel's second affidavit stated that, with Tzannos's help, counsel determined the date of the tape by comparing the recorded conversations to the ledgers that were seized, and determined the line on which those conversations had taken place by looking to the signed statements she solicited from the bettors. Nothing in the record establishes that the bettors' statements were truthful or accurate, or that the seized documents completely and accurately recorded all betting-related transactions. Indeed, what Tzannos asserted is the ledger from August 25 stated only that \"Jerry\" and \"Norton\" called to place bets; it made no reference to \"Paulie\" or to individuals who called to discuss betting lines without placing a bet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Tzannos has failed to show (1) that he recorded every gambling-related call, on every line, and on every date as a matter of course, (2) that the four tapes identified in his counsel's affidavit contained every call to the 6114 line that Tzannos recorded on August 25, and (3) that the one transcript Tzannos provided of calls allegedly made on August 25 to the 6114 line was complete and accurate. Indeed, while Tzannos stated in his pre-trial memorandum that he would prove at the <i>Franks</i> hearing that he routinely taped every incoming call, he never made that showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos largely disproved his own argument. He admitted in that same pre-trial memorandum that after a week's books were settled, it was his practice to erase the tapes and to record over them. He did not say on which day of the week he did so, or whether the practice was irregular. Most of the tapes seized during the search were blank or unintelligible, tending to disprove his assertion that the tapes are accurate evidence of the calls he received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> He did not show that the tapes contained each and every call made to him on the four dates in question, let alone on August 25. In fact, defense counsel's affidavit made reference to three other tapes, allegedly of incoming calls made by a number of other callers \"on several days, including August 25, 2003.\" Tzannos did not provide transcripts of any of these other tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did he prove the accuracy of the one transcript he did provide. The transcript itself appears to end mid-conversation, thus suggesting that either the transcript was incomplete or that the tape stopped recording in the middle of a call. These inconsistencies substantially undercut Tzannos's showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not make any explicit findings of fact at the <i>Franks</i> hearing. Nonetheless, it must implicitly have found that Tzannos's evidence was sufficient to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that only \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton\" made gambling-related calls to Tzannos on the 6114 line on August 25. Given the substantial gaps in the evidence, this finding was clear error and alone provides a basis for reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are further grounds, however, for reversing the suppression order. Even if Tzannos had proven his first assertion by a preponderance of the evidence, it does not follow that he proved by a preponderance of the evidence that no confidential informant exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Tzannos must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the affiant, Trooper Russolillo, rather than the informant, made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth. \"Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient,\" <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674, as are allegations going to show that the informant relayed misinformation to the affiant, <i>see id.</i> (\"The deliberate falsity or reckless disregard whose impeachment is permitted today is only that of the affiant, not of any nongovernmental informant.\"); <i>United States v. Southard,</i> 700 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1983) (\"<i>Franks'</i> requirements cannot be satisfied by a showing that an informer lied to an unsuspecting affiant, even when the lie was deliberate.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos has not contested the accuracy of any of the substantive information provided by CI-1 to Russolillo, and has not explained how Russolillo would have obtained such detailed and accurate information if CI-1 did not exist. Nor has Tzannos made any showing of why Russolillo would have reason to lie. He thus has not met his burden of showing that Russolillo made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth. To the extent that the district court held otherwise, it committed clear error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We hold that the court erred in suppressing the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Problems with the District Court's Procedure at the</i> Franks <i>Hearing</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also appeals (1) the district court's refusal to hear the government's one-line explanation of why the procedure that the court devised for the <i>Franks</i> hearing was, in the government's view, flawed, and (2) the court's ultimate decision to go forward with the hearing without listening to that explanation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the <i>Franks</i> hearing, when the government asked to explain to the court, in one sentence, what the government argued was a \"fundamental flaw\" in the court's analysis, the court refused to hear the explanation ex parte and in camera, despite the government's entreaties that the way the court structured the proceeding would jeopardize the life of the informant and lead to a miscarriage of justice. The court in essence shifted the burden of proof to the government: short of proving CI-1's existence, there was no way the government could disprove the defendant's allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's position effectively eliminated the privilege the government has under <i>Roviaro v. United States,</i> 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> to protect the identity of confidential informants. The court's refusal to hear the government's explanation and its insistence on going forward with the procedure of its own devising were thus an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In oft-quoted language, <i>Roviaro</i> stated:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is usually referred to as the informer's privilege is in reality the Government's privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law. The purpose of the privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 59, 77 S.Ct. 623 (citations omitted). The privilege, while significant, is not absolute. Thus, \"[w]here the disclosure of an informer's identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\" <i>Id.</i> at 60-61, 77 S.Ct. 623; <i>see also id.</i> at 60, 77 S.Ct. 623 (holding that \"where the disclosure of the contents of a communication will not tend to reveal the identity of an informer, the contents are not privileged,\" and that \"[l]ikewise, once the identity of the informer has been disclosed to those who would have cause to resent the communication, the privilege is no longer applicable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, <i>Roviaro</i> requires a \"balancing [of] the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual's right to prepare his defense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62, 77 S.Ct. 623. \"Whether a proper balance . . . [requires] nondisclosure . . . must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer's testimony, and other relevant factors.\" <i>Id.; see also McCray v. Illinois,</i> 386 U.S. 300, 311, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967). This court has stated that \"when the government informant is not an actual participant or a witness to the offense, disclosure is required only in those exceptional cases where the defendant can point to some concrete circumstance that might justify overriding both the public interest in encouraging the flow of information, and the informant's private interest in his or her own safety.\" <i>United States v. Martinez,</i> 922 F.2d 914, 921 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos, as the party seeking disclosure, bore the burden of persuasion in this analysis. <i>See United States v. Gomez-Genao,</i> 267 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also United States v. Perez,</i> 299 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[T]he law places the burden squarely on the party seeking disclosure (typically, the defendant) to demonstrate that knowledge of the identity of a confidential informant is vital to the proper preparation and presentation of his case.\"). This court has described this burden as a \"heavy\" one. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 144 F.3d 104, 106 (1st Cir.1998). The government argues that Tzannos has failed to meet this burden and that the court abused its discretion in implicitly holding otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his part, Tzannos offers no arguments as to why disclosure of the confidential informant's identity was warranted in this case. Instead, Tzannos puts all of his stock in two arguments, of which we readily dispose. His first argument is that he never asked the court to order the disclosure of CI-1's identity and thus <i>Roviaro</i> does not even apply. The court's procedure, however, placed the government in a Catch-22: it could not participate in the <i>Franks</i> hearing without risking exposing its informant (or suborning perjury), and it could not explain to the court, beyond the other arguments it made, why the court's analysis was flawed without effectively disclosing the identity of its informant. That the court did not require the government to say the actual name of the informant is of little significance; it was requiring the government to provide information that would, for all practical purposes, divulge the informant's identity. \"The privilege identified in <i>Roviaro</i> protects more than just the name of the informant and extends to information that would tend to reveal the identity of the informant.\" <i>United States v. Napier,</i> 436 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos's second argument as to why <i>Roviaro</i> does not apply is that \"if one of the three would-be witnesses turned out to be CI-1, then that witness had voluntarily put himself in the position of having to admit being an informant.\" Tzannos's argument rests on mistaken premises: as we noted above, the <i>Roviaro</i> privilege does not belong to the informant, but rather to the government. Thus, even assuming that CI-1 was one of the three individuals identified by Tzannos, so long as that individual has not voluntarily disclosed his status as an informant to the defendant, the government may still invoke its \"privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law.\" <i>Roviaro,</i> 353 U.S. at 59, 77 S.Ct. 623.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government emphatically argued that the particular circumstances of this case warranted protection of the informant's identity. It repeatedly stressed during the course of the <i>Franks</i> hearing and in its filings that CI-1 would likely be murdered if his identity were publicly disclosed. It also pointed to Russolillo's affidavit, which stated that \"traditional organized crime families (such as La Cosa Nostra or the Mafia) and other organized crime groups (such as the Winter Hill Gang) in the Boston area have been heavily involved in illegal gaming and bookmaking and have maintained a significant degree of control over organized bookmaking operations,\" and that \"compromis[ing] the anonymity of the confidential reliable informant [would] mak[e] him/her susceptible to physical harm and/or retribution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against the government's interest in protecting the identity of the informant, we must balance \"the fundamental requirements of fairness\" and Tzannos's right to prepare his defense. <i>Roviaro,</i> 353 U.S. at 60, 77 S.Ct. 623. Generally, the defendant's competing interests are of a lesser magnitude at the suppression stage than at trial. <i>See United States v. Jackson,</i> 918 F.2d 236, 240 (1st Cir.1990) (citing <i>United States v. Raddatz,</i> 447 U.S. 667, 679, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980)); <i>cf. McCray,</i> 386 U.S. at 312, 87 S.Ct. 1056 (\"[T]he Court in the exercise of its power to formulate evidentiary rules for federal criminal cases has consistently declined to hold that an informer's identity need always be disclosed in a federal criminal trial, let alone in a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause for an arrest or search.\"). These interests are especially weak here, where the informant is not \"the sole participant, other than the accused, in the transaction charged,\" <i>Robinson,</i> 144 F.3d at 106; was not \"the only witness in a position to amplify or contradict the testimony of government witnesses,\" <i>Roviaro,</i> 353 U.S. at 64, 77 S.Ct. 623; and in fact had no involvement whatsoever in the crime charged &#8212; to wit, possession of firearms and ammunition by a felon, <i>see United States v. Gray,</i> 47 F.3d 1359, 1365 (4th Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Bender,</i> 5 F.3d 267, 270 (7th Cir.1993).

Brown,</i> 3 F.3d 673, 679 (3d Cir. 1993) (\"A defendant who merely hopes (without showing a likelihood) that disclosure will lead to evidence supporting suppression has not shown that disclosure will be `relevant and helpful to the defense . . . or is essential to a fair determination[.]'\" (omission in original) (quoting <i>Roviaro,</i> 353 U.S. at 60-61, 77 S.Ct. 623)); <i>United States v. Barone,</i> 787 F.2d 811, 814-15 (2d Cir.1986).

Russolillo included a fourteen-page affidavit in support of the application. The affidavit made the following assertions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russolillo and another state trooper knew Gregory Tzannos to be involved in the bookmaking business from information from past investigations \"coupled with intelligence from other informants\" as well as from the confidential informant central to this case. In early July of 2003, Russolillo and another state trooper spoke to the confidential informant, \"CI-1.\" CI-1 agreed to provide information to the troopers only if his<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> identity was not revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CI-1 told the troopers that he was placing illegal bets on sporting events with Gregory Tzannos via telephone. The informant said he had placed the bets by calling (617) 567-6114 (\"the 6114 line\") and by speaking to Tzannos directly. The officers subpoenaed the telephone company and discovered that that number belonged to Tzannos and that it was unpublished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They also discovered via subpoena that calls to the 6114 line had been forwarded to a separate number, (617) 846-6630, on several days in August. This was significant because bookmakers often used call forwarding to disguise the location of their operations. The officers discovered that the second phone number, (617) 846-6630, was registered to a corporation, DBA: American Eagle Purchasing Agents, at 381 Winthrop Street, Winthrop, Massachusetts. The person listed in state records as the corporation's treasurer and registered agent was Tzannos, who was also listed on the telephone bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russolillo spoke to CI-1 on August 18 and was told that CI-1 had placed \"several wagers\" with Tzannos over the 6114 line on August 16 and 17. On August 20, another officer spoke to CI-1 and was told that CI-1 had placed another bet with Tzannos that day, again on the 6114 line. Troopers subsequently conducted surveillance at 381 Winthrop Street and, on several separate days, observed vehicles registered to a Linda Wagner; this was significant because CI-1 had told police that Tzannos had a girlfriend named \"Linda.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit recounted that on August 25, 2003, CI-1 and Russolillo placed a \"controlled call\" to Tzannos on the 6114 line. This allegation is key to Tzannos's later <i>Franks</i> motion. The affidavit explained that in a controlled call, the police officer dials the number, waits until the target of the investigation answers, hands the phone to the informant, and then watches as the informant speaks to the target. CI-1 told Russolillo that Tzannos was the person who answered the phone during the controlled call, and that Tzannos proceeded to give a rundown of the day's betting lines for baseball.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russolillo's affidavit stated that CI-1 had provided information to Russolillo and other troopers in the past, and the information \"has proven to be reliable and true.\" It said the troopers had known CI-1 for more than two years and that they knew his identity and address. The affidavit also gave extensive details on CI-1's past cooperation, stating, for example, that CI-1 had identified various bookmakers and their identities and telephone numbers, that all of the information had been corroborated by subsequent investigation, and that past information from CI-1 had led to the arrest, prosecution, and conviction of three men for gaming violations. The affidavit stated that CI-1 had also provided general intelligence information regarding other criminal matters, but that the affiant could not detail the particulars of these cases, because doing so would compromise the anonymity of the informant, making him \"susceptible to physical harm and/or retribution.\" It explained that Russolillo had \"learned that traditional organized crime families (such as La Cosa Nostra or the Mafia) and other organized crime groups (such as the Winter Hill Gang) in the Boston area have been heavily involved in illegal gaming and bookmaking and have maintained a significant degree of control over organized bookmaking operations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The State Search Warrant, the Search, and the Federal Indictment</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit asserted that CI-1's information, combined with the officers' investigation, sufficed to create probable cause to believe that Tzannos was violating state laws forbidding certain gaming activities, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167;&#167; 17-17A, and was doing so from the building at 381 Winthrop Street. It sought a warrant to search that address. The magistrate agreed and issued the warrant. Massachusetts state police executed the warrant on August 28, 2003, and found a fully equipped gaming office. Officers seized gaming records, $10,200 in cash, and tape recorders and tapes that had been used to record conversations with customers. In addition, police found and seized a loaded pistol, two loaded revolvers, a sawed-off shotgun, various types of ammunition, three switchblade knives, a pair of brass knuckles, and a blowgun with needles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 2004, a federal grand jury indicted Tzannos on charges of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), which prohibits possession of firearms by convicted felons. The indictment stated that the offense \"involved three to seven firearms\" and that Tzannos possessed at least one of the firearms and at least one piece of ammunition \"in connection with another felony offense, to wit: occupying a place for registering bets in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws[] ch. 271, &#167; 17, a Massachusetts offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" C. <i>The Franks Hearing and the Suppression Order</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 2005, Tzannos asked the district court to conduct a <i>Franks</i> hearing so that he could challenge \"the accuracy and truthfulness of the affidavit.\" In his motion papers, Tzannos argued that the affidavit had to be untruthful because (1) Russolillo swore that the informant placed calls to the 6114 line on four particular days, August 16, 17, 20, and 25, and spoke to Tzannos on each of those days, (2) the defense identified each and every caller to that number on those days and \"ha[d] documentation to back it up,\" and (3) each and every one of those callers had signed a statement denying under oath that he or she was the informant. Tzannos argued that \"[t]he only logical conclusion that one could possibly reach is that there was no informant, or at least that no informant did the things described in the [Russolillo] affidavit.\" Thus, Tzannos argued, if it were not true that the informant made gambling-related calls to Tzannos over the 6114 line on the four days, then it was necessarily true that no informant existed and that Russolillo had lied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos's motion was accompanied by an affidavit of defense counsel, which in turn was supported by several exhibits. Those exhibits included (1) some handwritten ledger sheets, which were seized during the execution of the search warrant at issue, (2) a transcript of one of four audiocassette tapes that were also seized during the search, and (3) signed statements from individuals that Tzannos identified, from the ledger sheets, as having called to place bets with him on the four days in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos focused his challenge on Russolillo's allegation that CI-1 had made a controlled call to Tzannos on August 25, 2003 on the 6114 line. Defense counsel represented that the ledger sheets show that on August 25, only two individuals, \"Jerry\" and \"Norton,\" called to place bets on the 6114 line. Counsel further represented that the tape is a recording of telephone calls made to the 6114 line on August 25, 2003, and that a transcript of that tape shows that only three people, \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton,\" made gaming-related calls that day to the 6114 line. Counsel then attached signed statements from \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton,\" swearing that \"[a]t no time did I cooperate with the police, nor was I a confidential informant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Tzannos's motion, the government argued that he had failed to meet \"the substantial preliminary showing that is a prerequisite to obtaining an evidentiary hearing under <i>Franks.</i>\" Specifically, the government argued in its reply papers (1) that there was no evidence that the police had obtained <i>all</i> the tapes and written records of Tzannos's illegal gambling activities on the days in question; (2) that even if the police had seized every tape and record, \"that would not guarantee (nor does Tzannos clearly assert) that those records reflected every transaction and phone call that occurred on\" those dates; (3) that there was no evidence that the tape on which Tzannos heavily relies &#8212; which had no external markings (other than a Bates number added by the government) &#8212; was actually a recording of <i>all</i> the calls made to him on August 25, 2003 and on the 6114 line; and (4) that even if CI-1 were mistaken about the date or phone line, \"that would be an error on CI-1's part and <i>not</i> any indication of perjury by Trooper Russolillo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also challenged the reliability of the signed statements from the bettors Tzannos identified, arguing, inter alia, that the statements do not reveal the true names of the purported affiants (whose names and signatures were redacted) and do not indicate that those affiants were sworn before anyone authorized by law to administer oaths. Even if the affidavits were genuine, the government argued, \"it would hardly have been surprising if . . . `CI-1' had denied to Tzannos that [he or she] had provided information to the State Police.\" Finally, the government argued that Tzannos provided no reason why Russolillo would have reason to lie and no explanation for how Russolillo could have divined the detailed information set forth in his affidavit &#8212; which Tzannos conceded, and the evidence uncovered during the execution of the search warrant confirmed, was accurate &#8212; if CI-1 did not, in fact, exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reply, Tzannos essentially reiterated his claim that he had \"identified each and every person who could possibly be CI-1\" and that \"each and every one of these people has signed an affidavit[] denying . . . that s/he is Russolillo's informant.\" He offered in further support of this claim his own conclusory affidavit, which simply asserted that the police \"seized every single paper and record from the third floor of my home\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and \"also seized each and every audio cassette from August[] 2003, as well as all of the tape recorders I had.\" His affidavit also stated that he \"did not draft any of the papers that were submitted to the [c]ourt on [his] behalf.\" His reply papers were also accompanied by a second affidavit of defense counsel, which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. I personally drafted each and every one of those affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">16. I listened to the tapes produced by the prosecution. The vast majority of the tapes are blank. As for the tapes that do contain recordings, I, with assistance from Mr. Tzannos, was able to determine the dates of each tape by comparing the conversations on the tapes to the documents that were seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">17. I was able to determine which tapes recorded incoming calls on particular telephone numbers because the affidavits state which people called each number. For example, I know from the affidavits which people called . . . (617) 567-6114 . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Tzannos's affidavit nor that of his counsel stated that the records and tapes that were seized reflected every gambling-related transaction and phone call that occurred on the four days in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discussion with the parties at a status conference on July 6, 2005, the district court granted Tzannos's motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing. The court did not articulate its reasons for granting the hearing and did not make any specific findings of fact at this time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum filed on September 23, 2005, the government renewed its objection to the <i>Franks</i> hearing. It reiterated its earlier argument that there was no evidence that Russolillo had lied. It also explained that it could not divulge the identity of CI-1 publicly because doing so would endanger the informant's life. It represented that it was not authorized to disclose the informant's name without permission from the Department of Justice or the state Attorney General. The government offered instead to prove the veracity of Russolillo's affidavit and the existence of CI-1 in an ex parte, in camera proceeding, in which it would offer, inter alia, testimony of Russolillo revealing the identity of CI-1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reply, Tzannos agreed to an in camera proceeding, but objected to the court's allowing such a proceeding to take place ex parte. Tzannos also requested that the <i>Franks</i> hearing be structured as a \"full evidentiary hearing,\" in which defense counsel would have \"the opportunity to cross[-]examine the very affiant whose allegations are at issue.\" Finally, Tzannos stated that it was his intention to show at the hearing, inter alia, that \"as a matter of practice, he recorded each and every incoming call,\" and that \"[a]fter a week's books were settled, he would erase the tapes and record over them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened the <i>Franks</i> hearing on September 28, 2005. At the start of the hearing, the district court announced a procedure that neither party had proposed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ccording to the defendant's proffer of evidence, there are three people [who] spoke [to Tzannos on August 25, 2003]: Paulie, Jerry[,] and Norton. So Paulie, Jerry[,] and Norton at the worst come in and testify that they are not the confidential informant. And I don't have to hear from anybody claiming to be the confidential informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And if it turns out that I think that [the controlled] call was not made to [the 6114] line on August 25, 2003, I can determine that there is no basis for whatever exists and allow a motion to suppress, without violating the identity of the confidential informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos made no objections to the procedure; indeed, he indicated that the three individuals had already been summoned and that they were outside the courtroom at that moment and ready to testify. The government, however, was far less enthusiastic. It raised two main objections to the procedure. First, it argued that the procedure placed it in a double bind: if one of the three individuals were, in fact, CI-1, but testified on the stand to the contrary, the government would be placed in a position where it would be forced either to knowingly elicit and condone perjurious testimony or to \"out\" an informant and expose him or her to mortal danger. As a corollary of that argument, the government also noted that \"if one of [the three] is the informant and tells the truth, then the Court is eliciting a statement that may get the person killed,\" which is \"not [a] procedure that the government is prepared to participate in.\" Second, the government argued that there was a \"fundamental flaw\" in the procedure, which it could not explain in open court without providing information that would necessarily divulge CI-1's identity, but which it could explain \"in one sentence ex parte [and] in camera.\" The government stressed that \"the Court would not come out with the truthful and just result if the Court follow[ed] the procedure that the Court outlined.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court refused to hear the government's explanation ex parte and in camera. It also refused the government's original proposal, which was to provide to the court evidence of the existence and identity of the informant ex parte and in camera. The court stated that \"[t]here are two things I don't want\": \"one, I don't want to do an ex parte hearing,\" and \"two, I don't want to know who the confidential informant is.\" It also explained: There is nothing absolute about the confidential informant and confidentiality. I mean, it has to be weighed under all the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think my suggest[ed procedure] is a good one. I don't even want to know who the confidential informant is.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I just want to know are these three people going to take the stand and say they are not. And if they take the stand and say they are not, then that is the end of it. I am not going to say who is it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court went further. It stated:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f it turns out that the defendant puts three people on the stand and the tapes verify that only these three people made phone calls and that's it, and none of the three is the confidential informant, that is it as far as I am concerned. I don't have to hear any more. I will allow the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the government's argument that \"[t]he issue here is not whether the confidential informant gave somewhat incorrect or incomplete or any other degree of defective evidence\" but \"whether Trooper Russolillo lied under oath,\" the court stated: \"I don't think I have to find that he lied. I can find that none of those three people is the confidential informant and that no other calls were made that day and that, therefore, there is no basis for whatever it was and then I am going to suppress it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unwilling to go along with the court's proposed procedure, the government submitted a written request that the court reconsider its rejection of the government's request to proceed ex parte and in camera.

In the ensuing colloquy, the court said that it was willing to allow the three individuals to testify, in part so that a record could be created for the appeal. The government again objected, stating that it could not cross-examine the three individuals. It then agreed to stipulate that if the three individuals were called to testify, they would each testify that he had called Tzannos on August 25, 2003, and that he had never been a confidential informant or made a controlled call for Russolillo. The government emphasized, however, that it was making this stipulation \"with the understanding that for the reasons previously explained the government cannot cross-examine these individuals to bring out the truth,\" and that \"the government is not conceding the truth.\" The court then suppressed the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bypass the question of whether Tzannos made the \"substantial preliminary showing\" necessary to invoke a <i>Franks</i> hearing. <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 156-57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We also evaluate, for abuse of discretion, the procedure the district court used at the <i>Franks</i> hearing and the district court's refusal to hear, ex parte and in camera, the government's explanation of why that procedure was flawed. <i>Cf.

That Russolillo made the false statement knowingly and intelligently is shown, defendant says, by his having stated that he was present at the controlled call made by CI-1 to Tzannos on August 25, 2003 to the 6114 line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision to suppress the fruits of the search would be proper only if it found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Tzannos proved three assertions. First, Tzannos must show that only \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton\" made gaming-related calls to Tzannos on the 6114 line on August 25, 2003, and that therefore CI-1 had to be one of the three. To do so, he must show that the audiocassette tape on which he relied was a recording of calls made to him on the 6114 line, that the recording was of calls made on August 25, 2003, that <i>all</i> calls made to the 6114 line on August 25 were in fact recorded on that tape, and that the transcript entered into evidence was accurate and complete. Second, even if each of these assertions were proven, it does not follow that CI-1 does not exist; Tzannos still must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that each of the three individuals is telling the truth in denying being CI-1 and, further, that the real CI-1 did not provide misinformation, whether inadvertently or purposefully, to Russolillo. Third and ultimately, Tzannos must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Trooper Russolillo made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the first of the three assertions Tzannos must prove. Tzannos did not show that the tape on which he relied was actually of calls made to the 6114 line on August 25, 2003. The tape itself was unmarked, and nothing in the transcript supplied by Tzannos identifies what number the callers dialed or on what date they called. The only proffer Tzannos made relating the three conversations he transcribed off of that tape to the particular line and date of the controlled call were his own affidavit, two affidavits of counsel, and their accompanying exhibits. Counsel's second affidavit stated that, with Tzannos's help, counsel determined the date of the tape by comparing the recorded conversations to the ledgers that were seized, and determined the line on which those conversations had taken place by looking to the signed statements she solicited from the bettors. Nothing in the record establishes that the bettors' statements were truthful or accurate, or that the seized documents completely and accurately recorded all betting-related transactions. Indeed, what Tzannos asserted is the ledger from August 25 stated only that \"Jerry\" and \"Norton\" called to place bets; it made no reference to \"Paulie\" or to individuals who called to discuss betting lines without placing a bet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Tzannos has failed to show (1) that he recorded every gambling-related call, on every line, and on every date as a matter of course, (2) that the four tapes identified in his counsel's affidavit contained every call to the 6114 line that Tzannos recorded on August 25, and (3) that the one transcript Tzannos provided of calls allegedly made on August 25 to the 6114 line was complete and accurate. Indeed, while Tzannos stated in his pre-trial memorandum that he would prove at the <i>Franks</i> hearing that he routinely taped every incoming call, he never made that showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tzannos largely disproved his own argument. He admitted in that same pre-trial memorandum that after a week's books were settled, it was his practice to erase the tapes and to record over them. He did not say on which day of the week he did so, or whether the practice was irregular. Most of the tapes seized during the search were blank or unintelligible, tending to disprove his assertion that the tapes are accurate evidence of the calls he received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> He did not show that the tapes contained each and every call made to him on the four dates in question, let alone on August 25. In fact, defense counsel's affidavit made reference to three other tapes, allegedly of incoming calls made by a number of other callers \"on several days, including August 25, 2003.\" Tzannos did not provide transcripts of any of these other tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did he prove the accuracy of the one transcript he did provide. The transcript itself appears to end mid-conversation, thus suggesting that either the transcript was incomplete or that the tape stopped recording in the middle of a call. These inconsistencies substantially undercut Tzannos's showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not make any explicit findings of fact at the <i>Franks</i> hearing. Nonetheless, it must implicitly have found that Tzannos's evidence was sufficient to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that only \"Paulie,\" \"Jerry,\" and \"Norton\" made gambling-related calls to Tzannos on the 6114 line on August 25. Given the substantial gaps in the evidence, this finding was clear error and alone provides a basis for reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are further grounds, however, for reversing the suppression order.

He thus has not met his burden of showing that Russolillo made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.

Instead, Tzannos puts all of his stock in two arguments, of which we readily dispose. His first argument is that he never asked the court to order the disclosure of CI-1's identity and thus <i>Roviaro</i> does not even apply. The court's procedure, however, placed the government in a Catch-22: it could not participate in the <i>Franks</i> hearing without risking exposing its informant (or suborning perjury), and it could not explain to the court, beyond the other arguments it made, why the court's analysis was flawed without effectively disclosing the identity of its informant. That the court did not require the government to say the actual name of the informant is of little significance; it was requiring the government to provide information that would, for all practical purposes, divulge the informant's identity. \"The privilege identified in <i>Roviaro</i> protects more than just the name of the informant and extends to information that would tend to reveal the identity of the informant.\" <i>United States v.

Thus, even assuming that CI-1 was one of the three individuals identified by Tzannos, so long as that individual has not voluntarily disclosed his status as an informant to the defendant, the government may still invoke its \"privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law.\" <i>Roviaro,</i> 353 U.S. at 59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105484\"><a href=\"/opinion/105484/roviaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It repeatedly stressed during the course of the <i>Franks</i> hearing and in its filings that CI-1 would likely be murdered if his identity were publicly disclosed. It also pointed to Russolillo's affidavit, which stated that \"traditional organized crime families (such as La Cosa Nostra or the Mafia) and other organized crime groups (such as the Winter Hill Gang) in the Boston area have been heavily involved in illegal gaming and bookmaking and have maintained a significant degree of control over organized bookmaking operations,\" and that \"compromis[ing] the anonymity of the confidential reliable informant [would] mak[e] him/her susceptible to physical harm and/or retribution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against the government's interest in protecting the identity of the informant, we must balance \"the fundamental requirements of fairness\" and Tzannos's right to prepare his defense. <i>Roviaro,</i> 353 U.S. at 60, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105484\"><a href=\"/opinion/105484/roviaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
