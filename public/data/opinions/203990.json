Maguette Faye, of Senegal, petitions\n\nfor review of the Board of Immigration Appeals's (\"BIA\") denial of\n\nher application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder   the    Convention   Against      Torture      (\"CAT\").      We   deny   her\n\npetition.\n\n                                        I.\n\n              Maguette Faye entered the United States on October 22,\n\n2000,    on    a   six-month    tourist       visa,   which   she    overstayed.\n\nImmigration authorities issued a Notice to Appear on July 10, 2003.\n\nFaye    admitted    the   facts    in   the    Notice    to   Appear,    and    the\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") found her removable.\n\n              Faye filed for asylum on January 18, 2005, after the one-\n\nyear filing deadline.          She claimed she would be persecuted in\n\nSenegal for her religious beliefs and because she is a member of a\n\npersecuted social group in Senegal.                Specifically, she claimed\n\nmembership in the following alleged social group: \"women who had a\n\nchild out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave\n\nbirth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by\n\ntheir husbands.\"      A.R. 4.     Faye also sought withholding of removal\n\nand protection under the CAT on the same grounds or, alternatively,\n\nvoluntary departure.\n\n              We summarize Faye's testimony before the IJ.               Faye and\n\nher family are Muslims.        Faye testified that she first experienced\n\npersecution when she gave birth to a child out of wedlock in 1990.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fWhen her father learned she was pregnant, he left the family and\n\ndid not return until after the baby was born.        Her mother and\n\nbrothers blamed her for his departure and for disgracing the\n\nfamily, and they beat her during her pregnancy to punish her.    Faye\n\ndid not report this abuse to any government authorities because the\n\nabusers were family members. Her family, however, allowed Faye and\n\nher child to live in their house for ten more years, and she did\n\nnot say the beatings continued.\n\n          In 1996 Faye's father forced her to marry her first\n\ncousin, Ibrahima Seck.    Faye disliked Seck but feared her family\n\nwould beat her or evict her if she refused.      Seck forced her to\n\nhave sex with him throughout their marriage.     When Faye resisted,\n\nSeck, a large man, beat, slapped, or choked her.          Faye never\n\nreported Seck to the police because he was \"of my family.\"       Faye\n\nand Seck had a son, her second child, in 1997.         Faye wanted a\n\ndivorce, but Seck would not agree.\n\n          Once she left Senegal, Faye called Seck, told him she was\n\nin the United States, and asked again for a divorce.    Seck visited\n\nthe United States for a week in December 2002.   Faye allowed him to\n\nsleep two nights in her living room because she hoped he would\n\nagree to a divorce.   During his visit, Seck again raped Faye.   Faye\n\ndid not report the rape to police because she feared consequences,\n\nincluding on her status in the United States.         Faye and Seck\n\ndivorced in 2003.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           Faye became pregnant during Seck's visit to the United\n\nStates, but when she told Seck, he denied he could be the father\n\nafter only one sexual encounter.            Faye admitted she was still\n\nmarried to Seck in 2002 and that the child, her third, was not born\n\nout of wedlock.       According to Faye, however, her family and\n\nSenegalese society would believe Seck, not Faye, and consequently\n\nwould view the child as illegitimate and Faye as an adulterer.\n\nFaye testified that in Senegal, families punish adulterers by\n\nbeating or killing them; she also feared her family would evict her\n\nif she returned.    Faye did not believe she could avoid her family\n\nby moving elsewhere in Senegal because they would find her when she\n\nreunited with her children.\n\n           Faye also presented a one-page State Department country\n\nreport from Senegal that stated 87 percent of 515 women interviewed\n\nwere domestic violence victims.            The report found that victims\n\nrarely reported abuse and police were reluctant to intervene in\n\ndomestic   matters.     It   noted    that      \"[w]omen   faced   pervasive\n\ndiscrimination,    especially   in    rural     areas   where   Islamic     and\n\ntraditional customs . . . were strongest.\"\n\n           Finally,   Faye   presented      a   psychologist's     report   to\n\nexplain her filing delay.       The psychologist found Faye suffered\n\nfrom generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder,\n\nwhich made her hesitant to make important decisions like filing for\n\nasylum.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           The IJ issued an oral opinion on September 13, 2005.          He\n\nrefused   to   find   Faye's   mental   illness   was   an   \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstance[]\" excusing her delay,          8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(2)(D)\n\n(2006), and so he held her asylum claim was pretermitted.           The IJ\n\nalso rejected her withholding of removal claim.              He found Faye\n\ncredible but found no \"persuasive evidence\" that Faye would face\n\npersecution if she returned to Senegal.           The IJ saw no evidence\n\nthat Faye would be considered an adulterer for having her third\n\nchild while married to Seck; even if her family did consider her an\n\nadulterer, they did not evict her after she had her first child out\n\nof wedlock.     He also concluded Faye could avoid her family by\n\nmoving to another part of Senegal.        Finally, the IJ rejected her\n\nclaim under the CAT, holding that no evidence showed the Senegalese\n\ngovernment would torture her or consent to her being tortured. The\n\nIJ granted Faye's request for voluntary departure.\n\n           On August 1, 2009, the BIA reversed the IJ's ruling that\n\nFaye's asylum claim was pretermitted, holding Faye demonstrated an\n\n\"exceptional circumstance\" excusing her delay, a mental disability.\n\nBut it determined the error was harmless because Faye failed to\n\nprove she had been or would be persecuted based on membership in a\n\nprotected social group.         Although the country report observed\n\nwidespread domestic abuse, the BIA noted the report did not treat\n\nwomen who were adulterers or had children out of wedlock as\n\nparticularly persecuted; in fact, the report did not mention them.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fThe BIA also affirmed the IJ's dismissal of Faye's CAT claim\n\nbecause no evidence showed the Senegalese government would torture\n\nher or permit her to be tortured.       It granted Faye voluntary\n\ndeparture.\n\n          Faye petitioned for review.       This court granted the\n\ngovernment's unopposed motion to remand the case to the BIA to\n\nfurther consider whether Faye was a member of a protected social\n\ngroup.\n\n          The BIA issued a new decision, from which this petition\n\nfor review is taken, on January 16, 2009.   It again excused Faye's\n\nfiling delay but ruled that Faye had not proven membership in a\n\nlegally protected social group, to wit, \"women who had a child out\n\nof wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave birth to a\n\nchild allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by their\n\nhusbands.\"   The BIA explained that a social group has (1) shared\n\ncharacteristics making it socially visible and (2) particular and\n\nwell-defined boundaries. It held Faye's proposed group failed this\n\ntest for several reasons, of which we mention only a few.   First,\n\nthe BIA held the proposed group was too \"amorphous\" because society\n\nwould not generally recognize Faye as an adulterer or a woman who\n\nhad a child out of wedlock.   Second, the group of \"women who had a\n\nchild out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave\n\nbirth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\ftheir    husbands\"     did   not    provide    well-defined      boundaries    for\n\ndetermining the group's membership.\n\n            The BIA also denied Faye's asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval claims because Faye could avoid further harm by moving away\n\nfrom her family when she returned to Senegal.                   Finally, the BIA\n\ndenied Faye's claim under the CAT because she failed to demonstrate\n\n\"she    would   be    tortured     by   or   with    the   acquiescence   of   the\n\nSenegalese      government[].\"          It   again    granted    Faye   voluntary\n\ndeparture.      Faye timely petitioned for review.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            We review the BIA's findings of fact for substantial\n\nevidence, accepting those findings as long as they are \"supported\n\nby reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"            Shahari v. Gonzรกles, 407 F.3d 467, 473\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v. Elias Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                 When the BIA adopts\n\nparts of the IJ's opinion, we also review those parts of the IJ's\n\nopinion.    Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            We review the BIA's legal interpretations de novo, but we\n\ngive \"substantial deference to the BIA's interpretations of the\n\nunderlying statutes and regulations according to administrative law\n\nprinciples.\"         Scatambuli v. Holder, 558 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).    When statutes are silent or ambiguous, we uphold the BIA's\n\nreasonable interpretation of them. Id.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f           Aliens seeking asylum must prove they have suffered past\n\npersecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\nbecause of their \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular   social   group,   or   political   opinion.\"   8   U.S.C.   ยง\n\n1101(a)(42)(A); id. ยง 1231(b)(3)(A); Ratnasingam v. Holder, 556\n\nF.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 2009). Aliens seeking withholding of removal\n\nmust meet a higher burden of proof; they must show that it is more\n\nlikely than not they will suffer persecution because of a protected\n\nground.   Datau v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Faye seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on two\n\nprotected grounds, religion and membership in a social group.        She\n\nspecifically claims membership in the social group, \"women who had\n\na child out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave\n\nbirth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by\n\ntheir husbands.\"      The Immigration and Nationality Act does not\n\ndefine \"social group,\" and the term is unclear.       See In re C-A-, 23\n\nI. & N. Dec. 951, 955-57 (B.I.A. 2006) (describing disagreement\n\namong courts and the United Nations).           We therefore show some\n\ndeference to the BIA's interpretation of the term.\n\n           The BIA has held that members of a social group must\n\nshare a common, immutable characteristic, either innate or based on\n\npast experiences.      Ruiz v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).    That characteristic should make the group (1) generally\n\nrecognizable in the community and (2) sufficiently particular to\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fdefine the group's membership.     In re A-M-E & J-G-U, 24 I.& N. Dec.\n\n69, 74 (B.I.A. 2007); Scatambuli, 558 F.3d at 59.          Whether a group\n\nmeets the first test, the \"social visibility\" test, depends on the\n\ncountry and the persecution feared.        In re A-M-E & J-G-U-, 24 I.&\n\nN. Dec. at 74; see also Scatambuli, 558 F.3d at 60 (holding\n\ninformants who feared retaliation by two private individuals were\n\nnot sufficiently visible in Brazilian society). \"Although a social\n\ngroup cannot be defined exclusively by the fact that its members\n\nhave been subjected to harm,\" courts may consider past harm when\n\nconsidering a group's social visibility.        In re A-M-E & J-G-U-, 24\n\nI.& N. Dec. at 74.\n\n           In In re A-M-E & J-G-U-, for example, the BIA ruled that\n\n\"affluent Guatemalans\" were not a social group because they failed\n\nboth the social visibility and particularity tests.             A country\n\nreport   found   widespread   violence     against   Guatemalans     of   all\n\neconomic   classes,   and   the   BIA    concluded   no   evidence   showed\n\n\"societal perception would be otherwise.\"       Id. at 75.    The BIA also\n\nfound terms like \"wealthy\" and \"affluent\" were \"too amorphous to\n\nprovide an adequate benchmark for determining group membership.\"\n\nId. at 76.\n\n           Substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that\n\nFaye similarly failed to show her proposed group is socially\n\nvisible and sufficiently particular.          Faye presented almost no\n\nevidence of how Senegalese society views her proposed group.              Her\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ftestimony focused, rather, on how her family would view her because\n\nSeck denies he is the father of her third child.             But she did not\n\nexplain how Senegalese society generally would perceive her and\n\nwomen in a similar position.            She did not describe experiences\n\nbeing persecuted or shunned by anyone in Senegal other than her\n\nfamily; indeed, Faye admitted she told no one that her family and\n\nSeck were abusing her.\n\n            Even the one page from the country report she submitted,\n\nas the BIA pointed out, does not mention women perceived as\n\nadulterers or mothers of children born out of wedlock. This report\n\nis simply too general to provide evidence that \"women who had a\n\nchild out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave\n\nbirth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by\n\ntheir husbands\" is a recognized social group in Senegal.\n\n            We cannot displace the BIA's determination that Faye's\n\nproposed    group   is   not   sufficiently     particular   because   it   is\n\ndifficult    to     identify    women    whom    society     would   consider\n\n\"adulterers\" who \"had a child out of wedlock.\"                 Faye's story\n\ndemonstrates how these terms are ambiguous.           She admits that her\n\nsecond and third children were not born out of wedlock.              It would\n\nbe difficult to determine when similar women are nevertheless\n\nperceived in Senegalese society as adulterers with illegitimate\n\nchildren.    We affirm the BIA's decision that Faye failed to meet\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fher   burden    of    showing      she   is    eligible         for    asylum    based     on\n\nmembership in a social group.\n\n              Turning     to    Faye's   asylum         claim    alleging      persecution\n\nbecause of her religious beliefs, we also have no basis to reverse\n\nthe   BIA's    decision.         Nothing      in    the    record      discusses      Faye's\n\nbeliefs,      and   she   has     presented        no    evidence      showing    she      was\n\npersecuted because of them.\n\n              The BIA's denial of Faye's claim under the CAT also\n\nstands.    Applicants for protection under the CAT must show it is\n\nmore likely than not they will be tortured if removed to their\n\ndestination country.            8 C.F.R. ยง 208.16.             Torture is \"severe pain\n\nor suffering\" that a government official inflicts or consents or\n\nacquiesces to.        8 C.F.R. ยง 208.18(a)(1).\n\n              The    IJ   and    BIA   concluded        Faye     failed   to    prove      the\n\nSenegalese     government        would   torture         her    or    permit    her   to   be\n\ntortured if she returned to Senegal.                Faye did not report her abuse\n\nto authorities, and the report's cursory observation that the\n\ngovernment is reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes is not a\n\nsufficient link to the Senegalese government. See, e.g., Dianie v.\n\nU.S. Att'y General, 293 Fed. App'x 170, 174 (3d Cir. 2008) (finding\n\nno \"pattern or practice of governmental acquiescence to domestic\n\nabuse\" despite evidence, including U.S. government reports, showing\n\n\"the judicial procedure is skewed against women who complain of\n\ndomestic abuse\") (internal quotation marks omitted.\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                    -12-\n\f",

We deny her petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> I.</h2>\n<p>Maguette Faye entered the United States on October 22, 2000, on a six-month tourist visa, which she overstayed. Immigration authorities issued a Notice to Appear on July 10, 2003. Faye admitted the facts in the Notice to Appear, and the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found her removable.</p>\n<p>Faye filed for asylum on January 18, 2005, after the one-year filing deadline. She claimed she would be persecuted in Senegal for her religious beliefs and because she is a member of a persecuted social group in Senegal. Specifically, she claimed membership in the following alleged social group: \"women who had a child out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave birth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by their husbands.\" A.R. 4. Faye also sought withholding of removal and protection under the CAT on the same grounds or, alternatively, voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>We summarize Faye's testimony before the IJ. Faye and her family are Muslims. Faye testified that she first experienced persecution when she gave birth to a child out of wedlock in 1990. When her father learned she was pregnant, he left the family and did not return until after the baby was born. Her mother and brothers blamed her for his departure and for disgracing the family, and they beat her during her pregnancy to punish her. Faye did not report this abuse to any government authorities because the abusers were family members. Her family, however, allowed Faye and her child to live in their house for ten more years, and she did not say the beatings continued.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Faye's father forced her to marry her first cousin, Ibrahima Seck. Faye disliked Seck but feared her family would beat her or evict her if she refused. Seck forced her to have sex with him throughout their marriage. When Faye resisted, Seck, a large man, beat, slapped, or choked her. Faye never reported Seck to the police because he was \"of my family.\" Faye and Seck had a son, her second child, in 1997. Faye wanted a divorce, but Seck would not agree.</p>\n<p>Once she left Senegal, Faye called Seck, told him she was in the United States, and asked again for a divorce. Seck visited the United States for a week in December 2002. Faye allowed him to sleep two nights in her living room because she hoped he would agree to a divorce. During his visit, Seck again raped Faye. Faye did not report the rape to police because she feared consequences, including on her status in the United States. Faye and Seck divorced in 2003.</p>\n<p>Faye became pregnant during Seck's visit to the United States, but when she told Seck, he denied he could be the father after only one sexual encounter. Faye admitted she was still married to Seck in 2002 and that the child, her third, was not born out of wedlock. According to Faye, however, her family and Senegalese society would believe Seck, not Faye, and consequently would view the child as illegitimate and Faye as an adulterer. Faye testified that in Senegal, families punish adulterers by beating or killing them; she also feared her family would evict her if she returned. Faye did not believe she could avoid her family by moving elsewhere in Senegal because they would find her when she reunited with her children.</p>\n<p>Faye also presented a one-page State Department country report from Senegal that stated 87 percent of 515 women interviewed were domestic violence victims.

He refused to find Faye's mental illness was an \"extraordinary circumstance[]\" excusing her delay, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(2)(D) (2006), and so he held her asylum claim was pretermitted. The IJ also rejected her withholding of removal claim. He found Faye credible but found no \"persuasive evidence\" that Faye would face persecution if she returned to Senegal. The IJ saw no evidence that Faye would be considered an adulterer for having her third child while married to Seck; even if her family did consider her an adulterer, they did not evict her after she had her first child out of wedlock. He also concluded Faye could avoid her family by moving to another part of Senegal. Finally, the IJ rejected her claim under the CAT, holding that no evidence showed the Senegalese government would torture her or consent to her being tortured. The IJ granted Faye's request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>On August 1, 2007, the BIA reversed the IJ's ruling that Faye's asylum claim was pretermitted, holding Faye demonstrated an \"exceptional circumstance\" excusing her delay, a mental disability. But it determined the error was harmless because Faye failed to prove she had been or would be persecuted based on membership in a protected social group. Although the country report observed widespread domestic abuse, the BIA noted the report did not treat women who were adulterers or had children out of wedlock as particularly persecuted; in fact, the report did not mention them. The BIA also affirmed the IJ's dismissal of Faye's CAT claim because no evidence showed the Senegalese government would torture her or permit her to be tortured. It granted Faye voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>Faye petitioned for review. This court granted the government's unopposed motion to remand the case to the BIA to further consider whether Faye was a member of a protected social group.</p>\n<p>The BIA issued a new decision, from which this petition for review is taken, on January 16, 2009. It again excused Faye's filing delay but ruled that Faye had not proven membership in a legally protected social group, to wit, \"women who had a child out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave birth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by their husbands.\" The BIA explained that a social group has (1) shared characteristics making it socially visible and (2) particular and well-defined boundaries. It held Faye's proposed group failed this test for several reasons, of which we mention only a few. First, the BIA held the proposed group was too \"amorphous\" because society would not generally recognize Faye as an adulterer or a woman who had a child out of wedlock. Second, the group of \"women who had a child out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave birth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by their husbands\" did not provide well-defined boundaries for determining the group's membership.</p>\n<p>The BIA also denied Faye's asylum and withholding of removal claims because Faye could avoid further harm by moving away from her family when she returned to Senegal. Finally, the BIA denied Faye's claim under the CAT because she failed to demonstrate \"she would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> Senegalese government[ ].\" It again granted Faye voluntary departure. Faye timely petitioned for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the BIA's findings of fact for substantial evidence, accepting those findings as long as they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Sharari v.

When the BIA adopts parts of the IJ's opinion, we also review those parts of the IJ's opinion. <i>Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>We review the BIA's legal interpretations de novo, but we give \"substantial deference to the BIA's interpretations of the underlying statutes and regulations according to administrative law principles.\" <i>Scatambuli v.

When statutes are silent or ambiguous, we uphold the BIA's reasonable interpretation of them. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Aliens seeking asylum must prove they have suffered past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution because of their \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>id.</i> ยง 1231(b)(3)(A); <i>Ratnasingam v.

Aliens seeking withholding of removal must meet a higher burden of proof; they must show that it is more likely than not they will suffer persecution because of a protected ground. <i>Datau v. Mukasey,</i> 540 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Faye seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on two protected grounds, religion and membership in a social group. She specifically claims membership in the social group, \"women who had a child out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave birth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by their husbands.\" The Immigration and Nationality Act does not define \"social group,\" and the term is unclear. <i>See </i><i>In re C-A-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 951, 955-57 (B.I.A.2006) (describing disagreement among courts and the United Nations). We therefore show some deference to the BIA's interpretation of the term.</p>\n<p>The BIA has held that members of a social group must share a common, immutable characteristic, either innate or based on past experiences. <i>Ruiz v. Mukasey,</i> 526 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.2008). That characteristic should make the group (1) generally recognizable in the community and (2) sufficiently particular to define the group's membership. <i>In re A-M-E &amp; J-G-U,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 69, 74 (B.I.A. 2007); <i>Scatambuli,</i> 558 F.3d at 59. Whether a group meets the first test, the \"social visibility\" test, depends on the country and the persecution feared. <i>In re A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 74; <i>see also </i><i>Scatambuli,</i> 558 F.3d at 60 (holding informants who feared retaliation by two private individuals were not sufficiently visible in Brazilian society). \"Although a social group cannot be defined exclusively by the fact that its members have been subjected to harm,\" courts may consider past harm when considering a group's social visibility. <i>In re A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 74.</p>\n<p>In <i>In re A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-,</i> for example, the BIA ruled that \"affluent Guatemalans\" were not a social group because they failed both the social visibility and particularity tests. A country report found widespread violence against Guatemalans of all economic classes, and the BIA concluded no evidence showed \"societal perception would be otherwise.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75. The BIA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> also found terms like \"wealthy\" and \"affluent\" were \"too amorphous to provide an adequate benchmark for determining group membership.\" <i>Id.</i> at 76.</p>\n<p>Substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that Faye similarly failed to show her proposed group is socially visible and sufficiently particular. Faye presented almost no evidence of how Senegalese society views her proposed group. Her testimony focused, rather, on how her family would view her because Seck denies he is the father of her third child. But she did not explain how Senegalese society generally would perceive her and women in a similar position. She did not describe experiences being persecuted or shunned by anyone in Senegal other than her family; indeed, Faye admitted she told no one that her family and Seck were abusing her.</p>\n<p>Even the one page from the country report she submitted, as the BIA pointed out, does not mention women perceived as adulterers or mothers of children born out of wedlock. This report is simply too general to provide evidence that \"women who had a child out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave birth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by their husbands\" is a recognized social group in Senegal.</p>\n<p>We cannot displace the BIA's determination that Faye's proposed group is not sufficiently particular because it is difficult to identify women whom society would consider \"adulterers\" who \"had a child out of wedlock.\" Faye's story demonstrates how these terms are ambiguous. She admits that her second and third children were not born out of wedlock. It would be difficult to determine when similar women are nevertheless perceived in Senegalese society as adulterers with illegitimate children. We affirm the BIA's decision that Faye failed to meet her burden of showing she is eligible for asylum based on membership in a social group.</p>\n<p>Turning to Faye's asylum claim alleging persecution because of her religious beliefs, we also have no basis to reverse the BIA's decision. Nothing in the record discusses Faye's beliefs, and she has presented no evidence showing she was persecuted because of them.</p>\n<p>The BIA's denial of Faye's claim under the CAT also stands. Applicants for protection under the CAT must show it is more likely than not they will be tortured if removed to their destination country. 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.16. Torture is \"severe pain or suffering\" that a government official inflicts or consents or acquiesces to. 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p>The IJ and BIA concluded Faye failed to prove the Senegalese government would torture her or permit her to be tortured if she returned to Senegal. Faye did not report her abuse to authorities, and the report's cursory observation that the government is reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes is not a sufficient link to the Senegalese government. <i>See, e.g., Dianie v. U.S. Att'y General,</i> 293 Fed. Appx. 170, 174 (3d Cir.2008) (finding no \"pattern or practice of governmental acquiescence to domestic abuse\" despite evidence, including U.S. government reports, showing \"the judicial procedure is skewed against women who complain of domestic abuse\") (internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n</div>",

We deny her petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> I.</h2>\n<p>Maguette Faye entered the United States on October 22, 2000, on a six-month tourist visa, which she overstayed. Immigration authorities issued a Notice to Appear on July 10, 2003. Faye admitted the facts in the Notice to Appear, and the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found her removable.</p>\n<p>Faye filed for asylum on January 18, 2005, after the one-year filing deadline. She claimed she would be persecuted in Senegal for her religious beliefs and because she is a member of a persecuted social group in Senegal. Specifically, she claimed membership in the following alleged social group: \"women who had a child out of wedlock/are considered adulterers because they gave birth to a child allegedly not their husband's/have been abused by their husbands.\" A.R. 4. Faye also sought withholding of removal and protection under the CAT on the same grounds or, alternatively, voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>We summarize Faye's testimony before the IJ. Faye and her family are Muslims. Faye testified that she first experienced persecution when she gave birth to a child out of wedlock in 1990. When her father learned she was pregnant, he left the family and did not return until after the baby was born. Her mother and brothers blamed her for his departure and for disgracing the family, and they beat her during her pregnancy to punish her. Faye did not report this abuse to any government authorities because the abusers were family members. Her family, however, allowed Faye and her child to live in their house for ten more years, and she did not say the beatings continued.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Faye's father forced her to marry her first cousin, Ibrahima Seck. Faye disliked Seck but feared her family would beat her or evict her if she refused. Seck forced her to have sex with him throughout their marriage. When Faye resisted, Seck, a large man, beat, slapped, or choked her. Faye never reported Seck to the police because he was \"of my family.\" Faye and Seck had a son, her second child, in 1997. Faye wanted a divorce, but Seck would not agree.</p>\n<p>Once she left Senegal, Faye called Seck, told him she was in the United States, and asked again for a divorce. Seck visited the United States for a week in December 2002. Faye allowed him to sleep two nights in her living room because she hoped he would agree to a divorce. During his visit, Seck again raped Faye. Faye did not report the rape to police because she feared consequences, including on her status in the United States. Faye and Seck divorced in 2003.</p>\n<p>Faye became pregnant during Seck's visit to the United States, but when she told Seck, he denied he could be the father after only one sexual encounter. Faye admitted she was still married to Seck in 2002 and that the child, her third, was not born out of wedlock. According to Faye, however, her family and Senegalese society would believe Seck, not Faye, and consequently would view the child as illegitimate and Faye as an adulterer.
