After carefully considering the record and the\n\nappellant's briefs in these consolidated appeals, we affirm the\n\njudgments below.\n\n      The   appellant    appeals    from     the   denial   of   a     preliminary\n\ninjunction and from the dismissal of his suit for failure to\n\nexhaust administrative remedies.            The preliminary injunction was\n\nproperly denied because the appellant failed to show likely success\n\non the merits.      Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n      The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice\n\nbecause the appellant failed to exhaust administrative remedies\n\nbefore filing suit.      42 U.S.C. ยง 1997(e)(a).        The appellant argues\n\nthat the complaint should not have been dismissed because he\n\nexhausted administrative remedies while the suit was pending.                       We\n\nhave held,    however,    that     belated    exhaustion     will      not   save    a\n\ncomplaint from dismissal.        Medina-Claudio v. Rodriguez-Mateo, 292\n\nF.3d 31 (1st Cir. 2002).      Finally, the appellant's assertion that\n\nthe   exhaustion    requirement     is   inapplicable       to   his    claims      is\n\nuntenable.    Exhaustion is mandatory for all actions concerning\n\nprison conditions under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 or any other federal law.\n\nPorter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002).\n\n      Affirmed.    Loc.
