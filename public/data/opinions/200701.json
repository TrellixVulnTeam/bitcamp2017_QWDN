Janice   R.   Perry\n\nappeals the district court’s dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6) of her action to recover long-term disability\n\nbenefits, statutory penalties, and attorneys’ fees pursuant to the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1001-1461 (“ERISA”).     Perry applied for but was denied\n\ndisability benefits under the Group Long-Term Disability Plan\n\n(“Plan”) maintained by her employer New England Business Service,\n\nInc. (“NEBS”) and insured by Hartford Life Insurance Companies,\n\nInc. (“Hartford”).     The district court dismissed the complaint\n\nbecause under the terms of the Plan only active full-time employees\n\nare eligible for benefits and Perry had been on a leave of absence\n\nfor six years when she applied.    We must decide whether under the\n\nterms of the Plan an employee on leave of absence on account of a\n\nwork-related injury ceases to be a participant in the Plan.\n\n          The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1331 and 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) and we have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.    For the reasons discussed below we\n\naffirm.\n\n                FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n          On review of a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the\n\nfactual allegations of the complaint and construe all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom in favor of Perry.     See Beddall v. State St.\n\nBank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\f            Perry alleges that she became a full-time employee of\n\nNEBS on May 20, 1991, and vested under the Plan on September 16,\n\n1991. She worked full time until October 15, 1992, when she became\n\ndisabled    by   a   hand   injury   for   which   she   received   workers’\n\ncompensation benefits.        Perry further alleges that although the\n\nhand injury initially rendered her disabled and unable to perform\n\nher usual duties, what has caused her to be totally and permanently\n\ndisabled since October 1992 is her progressively worsening Type 1\n\nDiabetes Mellitus of long duration and associated impairments.\n\nPerry applied for long-term disability benefits under the Plan on\n\nApril 10, 1998, about the time when her workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits terminated.        On March 25, 1999, Hartford denied Perry’s\n\nappeal from its denial of benefits, stating that because “the\n\ninjury that caused you to stop working was sustained at work, any\n\nresulting Disabling condition is excluded from coverage under [the\n\npolicy].”   By letter of April 27, 2001, counsel for NEBS concurred\n\nin Hartford’s decision, stating that “the plan disqualifies from\n\nbenefit eligibility all employees disabled due to work-related\n\ninjury.”\n\n            Perry filed this action on August 30, 2001.\n\n                            THE TERMS OF THE PLAN\n\n            The Plan provides long-term disability benefits to all\n\n“active full-time employees” of NEBS.          Sec. I.     The Plan states\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthat “you will be paid a monthly benefit if . . . you become\n\nDisabled while insured under this plan.”          Sec. V.\n\n           The   Plan   defines    disability   as   “any    nonoccupational\n\naccidental bodily injury . . . [or] nonoccupational                sickness.”\n\nSec. II.\n\n           Under the Plan,\n\n           insurance will terminate on the earliest to\n           occur of the following dates:\n                  . . .\n                  (5)the date your employment terminates\n                  or your eligibility for this plan\n                  terminates.         Your    eligibility\n                  terminates on the date you cease to be\n                  an Active Full-time Employee:\n                  . . .\n                        (b)due to temporary layoff, leave\n                        of absence or a general work\n                        stoppage (including a strike or\n                        lockout).\n\nSec. IV.\n\n           The   Plan   provides    for    continuation     of   insurance   as\n\nfollows:\n\n           If you are disabled and you cease to be an\n           Active Full-time Employee, your insurance will\n           be continued:\n                  (1) during the Elimination Period1\n                  while you remain totally disabled by\n                  the same disability; and\n                  (2) after the Elimination Period for as\n                  long as you are entitled to benefits\n                  under the Policy.\n\nSec. IV.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Elimination Period is the period of time an employee must\nbe totally disabled before benefits become payable. Sec. II.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f                             DISCUSSION\n\n            We review the district court’s dismissal de novo.    See\n\nBeddall, 137 F.3d at 16.\n\n            An action for benefits under a plan established under\n\nERISA may be brought only by a “participant,” defined as an\n\nemployee who is or may become eligible to receive benefits under\n\nthe plan.   29 U.S.C. §§ 1132(a)(1), 1002(7).     Perry contends that\n\nthe district court erred in holding that she was ineligible for\n\nbenefits under the Plan.2   She argues that while she was disabled\n\nand on a medical leave of absence for the injury to her hand, her\n\nstatus was protected as an active employee and therefore she was\n\nentitled to receive disability benefits.\n\n            Perry’s argument flies in the face of the unambiguous\n\nterms of the Plan.    Under Section IV an employee’s “eligibility\n\nterminates on the date [she] cease[s] to be an Active Full-Time\n\nEmployee . . . due to . . . leave of absence.”    Section IV provides\n\nthat insurance will be continued if the employee is disabled and\n\nceases to be an active full-time employee.       But disability under\n\nthe Plan is limited to nonoccupational injury or sickness.      Thus,\n\n\n\n     2\n      Perry’s argument that the district court, in considering the\nterms of the Plan, improperly treated the motion to dismiss as one\nof summary judgment is not well-taken. Where, as here, “a\ncomplaint’s factual allegations are expressly linked to—and\nadmittedly dependent upon—a document (the authenticity of which is\nnot challenged), that document effectively merges into the\npleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to\ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).” Beddall, 137 F.3d at 17.\n\n                                -5-\n\finsurance will continue only if the employee is disabled due to a\n\nnonoccupational injury or sickness.        Because, as alleged in the\n\ncomplaint, Perry worked full time until she became disabled by a\n\nwork-related hand injury, her disability leave was the result of an\n\noccupational injury and thus had the effect of terminating her\n\ninsurance   and   rendering   her    ineligible   for   continuation   of\n\ncoverage.    Her application for benefits submitted in 1998 upon\n\ntermination of her workers’ compensation benefits was therefore\n\nproperly rejected.\n\n            “Where, as here, the words of an insurance policy are\n\nplain, we will ‘refrain from conjuring up ambiguities’ and likewise\n\n‘abjure unnecessary mental gymnastics which give the terms of the\n\npolicy a forced or distorted construction.’”        Burnham v. Guardian\n\nLife Ins. Co., 873 F.2d 486, 490-91 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting\n\nTaylor v. Aetna Cas. & Surety Co., 867 F.2d 705, 706 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)).     Giving the straightforward language in the Plan its\n\nnatural meaning, see id. at 489, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not err in holding that Perry was not a participant and\n\ntherefore failed to state a claim against Hartford or NEBS.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      That NEBS may for other purposes have continued to regard\nPerry as an employee cannot alter the clear and unambiguous terms\nof the Plan. See Sprague v. General Motors Corp.,133 F.3d 388, 404\n(6th Cir. 1998) (en banc); Miller v. Coastal Corp.,978 F.2d 622,\n624 (10th Cir. 1992) (stating that “an employee benefit plan cannot\nbe modified . . . by informal communications.”)\n\n                                    -6-\n\f          Our conclusion that Perry ceased to be a Plan participant\n\nmakes it unnecessary to address Perry’s claim for breach of duty of\n\ndisclosure and attorneys’ fees.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Perry applied for but was denied disability benefits under the Group Long-Term Disability Plan (\"Plan\") maintained by her employer New England Business Service, Inc. (\"NEBS\") and insured by Hartford Life Insurance Companies, Inc. (\"Hartford\"). The district court dismissed the complaint because under the terms of the Plan only active full-time employees are eligible for benefits and Perry had been on a leave of absence for six years when she applied.

She worked full time until October 15, 1992, when she became disabled by a hand injury for which she received workers' compensation benefits. Perry further alleges that although the hand injury initially rendered her disabled and unable to perform her usual duties, what has caused her to be totally and permanently disabled since October 1992 is her progressively worsening Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus of long duration and associated impairments. Perry applied for long-term disability benefits under the Plan on April 10, 1998, about the time when her workers' compensation benefits terminated. On March 25, 1999, Hartford denied Perry's appeal from its denial of benefits, stating that because \"the injury that caused you to stop working was sustained at work, any resulting Disabling condition is excluded from coverage under [the policy].\" By letter of April 27, 2001, counsel for NEBS concurred in Hartford's decision, stating that \"the plan disqualifies from benefit eligibility all employees disabled due to work-related injury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry filed this action on August 30, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE TERMS OF THE PLAN</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan provides long-term disability benefits to all \"active full-time employees\" of NEBS.

Perry contends that the district court erred in holding that she was ineligible for benefits under the Plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She argues that while she was disabled and on a medical leave of absence for the injury to her hand, her status was protected as an active employee and therefore she was entitled to receive disability benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry's argument flies in the face of the unambiguous terms of the Plan. Under Section IV an employee's \"eligibility terminates on the date [she] cease[s] to be an Active Full-Time Employee ... due to ... leave of absence.\" Section IV provides that insurance will be continued if the employee is disabled and ceases to be an active full-time employee. But disability under the Plan is limited to nonoccupational injury or sickness. Thus, insurance will continue only if the employee is disabled due to a nonoccupational injury or sickness. Because, as alleged in the complaint, Perry worked full time until she became disabled by a work-related hand injury, her disability leave was the result of an occupational injury and thus had the effect of terminating her insurance and rendering her ineligible for continuation of coverage. Her application for benefits submitted in 1998 upon termination of her workers' compensation benefits was therefore properly rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Where, as here, the words of an insurance policy are plain, we will `refrain from conjuring up ambiguities' and likewise `abjure unnecessary mental gymnastics which give the terms of the policy a forced or distorted construction.'\" <i>Burnham v.
