Bennett\n\nchallenges two mid-trial evidentiary rulings of the district court:\n\n(i) the exclusion of so-called comparator evidence anent Ralph\n\nDiNapoli and Joseph Garcia, and (ii) the admission of evidence\n\nregarding the criminality of Bennett's conduct in surreptitiously\n\nrecording a conversation.1\n\n          It is black-letter law that a district court possesses\n\nbroad discretion in connection with the admission or exclusion of\n\nevidence, and that its determinations in that wise are reviewed\n\nonly for abuse of discretion.       Udemba v. Nicoli, 237 F.3d 8, 14\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir.\n\n1999). We have carefully reviewed the rulings at issue here and we\n\nare satisfied that the trial court, in both instances, acted well\n\nwithin the encincture of its discretion.      Given the fact-specific\n\n\n     1\n      Bennett elaborates on this assignment of error by attacking\n(i) the trial court's willingness to take judicial notice of the\napplicable criminal statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, ยง 99, and\n(ii) the jury instructions related to this evidence.      We have\nconsidered and rejected both theories.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fnature   of   both    the   case   and   the    disputed   rulings,   further\n\ndiscussion    would   serve   no   useful      purpose.
