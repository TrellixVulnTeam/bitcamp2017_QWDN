Constancy is a virtue, and he who\n\nvacillates often pays a price for his indecision.                 This sentencing\n\nappeal illustrates the point.\n\n            We extract the relevant facts from the plea agreement,\n\nthe change-of-plea colloquy, the transcript of the disposition\n\nhearing, and the documents in the record.                   See United States v.\n\nMartinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d 245, 247 (1st Cir. 2003); United States\n\nv. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            Defendant-appellant Ivan Vazquez-Alomar has a history of\n\ntrouble with the law.      Pertinently, he pled guilty to federal drug\n\ntrafficking and money laundering charges on June 11, 1999.                        The\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nsentenced him to serve a 70-month incarcerative term in a federal\n\ncorrectional facility.      On May 24, 2000, he pled guilty in the same\n\ncourt to additional drug-trafficking violations and to transporting\n\nfirearms.       He    received    a    78-month      sentence,    to    be    served\n\nconcurrently with his previous sentence.\n\n            The charges underlying this appeal stem from a protracted\n\ninvestigation    by    federal    agents      into    the   laundering       of   drug\n\nproceeds.    This probe revealed that for a period of roughly ten\n\nmonths   commencing      around       December       of   1998,   the    appellant\n\nparticipated in the laundering of drug money within the United\n\nStates and abroad.        On August 21, 2000, a federal grand jury\n\nsitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned an indictment\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fcharging the appellant (who was then incarcerated as a result of\n\nthe sentences imposed in June 1999 and May 2000) with money\n\nlaundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956-1957.\n\n             Immurement did not check the appellant's penchant for\n\ncriminal activity.       In November of 2000, while still incarcerated,\n\nhe engaged in telephone conversations concerning money laundering\n\nand the importation and distribution of multi-kilogram quantities\n\nof   cocaine.       He   did    not    inform      the     authorities       of   these\n\nconversations, as federal law requires.                  See id. § 4.\n\n           On     November     21,    2001,     the   grand     jury       returned   a\n\nsuperseding indictment that charged the appellant with, inter alia,\n\nconspiracy to commit money laundering.1               Id. §§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(i),\n\n1956(a)(2)(A), 1956(h), 1957.                After initially proclaiming his\n\ninnocence,    the   appellant     entered      a   guilty     plea    to    the   money\n\nlaundering count on May 1, 2002.             On the same date, the government\n\ncharged him, by information, with misprision of a felony, id. § 4\n\n— a charge based on the in-prison telephone calls.                    The appellant\n\npled guilty to that charge as well.\n\n           Coincident with these developments, the parties entered\n\ninto a non-binding plea agreement (the Agreement).                      See Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(e)(1)(C).        The Agreement spelled out certain proposed\n\noffense   level     adjustments       and,    based      on   those   stipulations,\n\n\n     1\n      The indictment also contained drug-related charges, but those\ncharges were later dismissed. Accordingly, they need not concern\nus.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fmemorialized an agreement \"that the appropriate disposition of this\n\ncase\" would be a sentence of 135 months' imprisonment.                  The length\n\nof this proposed sentence derived from the following calculation\n\n(made by the government, acquiesced in by the appellant, and\n\neventually adopted by the district court). The calculation started\n\nwith the base offense level for laundering monetary instruments:\n\nlevel      23.      USSG   §2S1.1(a)(1).2       The    base   offense   level   was\n\nincreased by six levels because the funds in question exceeded\n\n$2,000,000. Id. §2S1.1(b)(2)(G). Three more levels were added due\n\nto   the    appellant's      knowledge   that    the    funds   represented     the\n\nproceeds of an unlawful activity involving the distribution of\n\ncontrolled substances.          Id. §2S1.1(b)(1).        That subtotal (32) was\n\nreduced by three levels for acceptance of responsibility.                   Id. §\n\n3E1.1.       Given the appellant's adjusted offense level (29) and\n\ncriminal history category (III), the projected guideline sentencing\n\nrange was 108-135 months.         The sentence that the parties agreed to\n\nrecommend to the court reflected the top of that range.\n\n                 The parties also agreed (i) that the government would\n\nrequest that the two new sentences (one for money laundering and\n\nthe other for misprision) be served concurrently;3 (ii) that \"no\n\n\n      2\n      All references to the sentencing guidelines are to the\nNovember 2000 edition, which was in effect when the instant\noffenses were committed. See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d\n1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).\n      3\n      The relevant section of the Agreement states that \"[t]he\nUnited States will request at the time of sentencing that the\n\n                                         -4-\n\ffurther adjustments or departures to the base offense level would\n\nbe sought;\" and (iii) that \"any request by [the appellant] for any\n\nfurther guideline adjustments . . . will be considered by the\n\nUnited States as a breach of this [Agreement].\"                The Agreement\n\nneither referred to the appellant's previous crimes nor mentioned\n\nhis existing incarceration.\n\n              At the time that he signed the Agreement, the appellant\n\nwas   represented         by   two   experienced   defense    lawyers.    He\n\nsubsequently retained yet a third attorney, José R. Franco-Rivera,\n\nto work in conjunction with them.             If two were company, three\n\nproved to be a crowd: on September 3, 2002, Franco-Rivera, without\n\nthe assent of his two co-counsels, filed a motion seeking to have\n\nthe new sentence run concurrently with the unexpired portions of\n\nthe appellant's existing sentences.          In this motion, the appellant\n\nargued      that   USSG    §5G1.3(b)   required    that   result.4   In   the\n\n\nsentence imposed in Criminal No. 00-692(CCC) [money laundering] be\nimposed concurrent with that in Criminal No. 01-379 (JAF)\n[misprision of a felony].\"      Because the sentence for money\nlaundering substantially exceeded the sentence for misprision, we\nhenceforth refer to the former as \"the new sentence.\"\n      4\n          USSG § 5G1.3 provides in pertinent part:\n\n      (a)   If the instant offense was committed while the\n      defendant was serving a term of imprisonment . . . the\n      sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run\n      consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.\n\n      (b)    If subsection (a) does not apply, and the\n      undischarged   term   of   imprisonment   resulted   from\n      offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the\n      determination of the offense level for the instant\n\n                                       -5-\n\fappellant's view, his previous drug-trafficking convictions had\n\nbeen fully taken into account in the determination of the offense\n\nlevel for his new sentence by reason of the three-level enhancement\n\nfor his knowledge that the laundered funds were drug proceeds.\n\n          The disposition hearing took place on September 4, 2002.\n\nThe appellant's three attorneys were present to represent their\n\ncommon client.\n\n          The    district   court   first   addressed    the   September   3\n\nmotion.   The    court   quickly    ascertained   that   the   appellant's\n\noriginal lawyers, Marlene Aponte Cabrera and Rafael Castro Lang,\n\nhad no input into the filing of that motion.         Aponte then stated\n\nthat she believed the motion contravened the Agreement.             Castro\n\nconcurred with that assessment. The court asked the appellant what\n\nhe wished to do in view of the fact that the motion was deemed\n\ninadvisable by two of his three attorneys.        The appellant replied\n\nthat he desired to \"withdraw the motion . . . [and] proceed with\n\nthe sentencing.\"\n\n\n\n\n     offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be\n     imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of\n     imprisonment.\n\n     (c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence\n     for the instant offense may be imposed to run\n     concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to\n     the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a\n     reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\n\nUSSG §5G1.3.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f             Despite          this     blunt    disavowal,        the     district     judge\n\nconducted a thorough inquiry. She questioned the government on its\n\ninterpretation of the Agreement, heard again from the appellant,\n\nand listened to his battery of attorneys.                        In the end, the judge\n\nnoted     that    the     only       mention    of    concurrent        sentences    in    the\n\nAgreement        was    the     linkage    between        the    money    laundering       and\n\nmisprision charges, see supra note 3, and that the Agreement made\n\nno reference to other criminal cases or sentences.                              The judge\n\nconcluded that, under the circumstances, granting the motion would\n\nbe   an    \"unwarranted         modification         of   the    plea    agreement\"       and,\n\ntherefore, denied it.\n\n             From        that     point    forward,        the    disposition        hearing\n\nproceeded smoothly. In line with the Agreement, the district court\n\nsentenced the appellant to a 135-month incarcerative term for money\n\nlaundering and a 36-month incarcerative term for misprision of a\n\nfelony.      The court ordered those terms to run concurrently with\n\neach other but consecutive to the undischarged portions of the\n\nearlier sentences.\n\n             On September 12, 2002, the appellant filed a timely\n\nnotice of appeal.             In this venue, he argues that his motion for the\n\nimposition of concurrent sentences should not have been denied\n\nbecause the Agreement did not speak to this aspect of the matter\n\nand,      therefore,          granting    the        motion     would     not   have      been\n\ninconsistent           with    the    Agreement.          Moreover,       the   applicable\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\fprovisions    of   the   sentencing      guidelines   mandated   running   the\n\nsentences concurrently.         See USSG §5G1.3, quoted supra note 4.\n\n             The government's first line of defense is that the\n\nappellant     waived     this   claim.      Waiver    is   the   \"intentional\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\"            United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993) (citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S.\n\n458, 464 (1938)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d\n\n435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).       What constitutes a waiver depends in the\n\nfirst instance on the nature of the right at issue.              See New York\n\nv. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 114 (2000).           Criminal defendants may waive\n\nmost rights as long as they do so \"voluntarily and with knowledge\n\nof the general nature and consequences of the waiver.\"                United\n\nStates v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2001).           When a criminal\n\ndefendant identifies an issue and then declines to pursue it, he\n\nnormally will be deemed to have waived that issue for the purpose\n\nof appellate review. See Rodriguez, 311 F.3d at 437; United States\n\nv. Ross, 77 F.3d 1525, 1542 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n            The record here is transparently clear that the September\n\n3 motion brought the possibility of a broadly concurrent sentence\n\n— one that would have encompassed both the new sentence and the\n\nundischarged portions of the earlier terms — squarely before the\n\ndistrict court.        Having raised the issue, however, the appellant\n\nthen retreated and stated unequivocally that he wished to withdraw\n\nhis motion.    The appellant's trio of attorneys acquiesced in this\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdecision (indeed, two of them had opposed the filing of the motion\n\nfrom the moment that they learned of it, and the third — the\n\nmotion's original proponent — ultimately agreed with this course of\n\naction).\n\n           The withdrawal of the motion constituted an express\n\nwaiver, and the appellant is bound by that waiver.   See Rodriguez,\n\n311 F.3d at 437; United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).   His appeal therefore fails.\n\n           We hasten to add that, even if we were willing to\n\noverlook the waiver, the appeal would not bear fruit.   Stripped of\n\nrhetorical flourishes, the appellant's position is that the lower\n\ncourt had the duty to make his new sentence run concurrently with\n\nthe unexpired portions of his earlier sentences.   This position is\n\nsimply wrong.\n\n           The Agreement is silent (and, therefore, not dispositive)\n\nas to how the appellant's new sentence should be aligned with the\n\nunexpired portions of his earlier sentences. For present purposes,\n\nhowever, the important fact is that nothing in the Agreement\n\ndemands that the court run the sentences concurrently.      By like\n\ntoken, nothing in the sentencing guidelines requires such an\n\noutcome.   We explain briefly.\n\n           The new sentence was based on the appellant's money\n\nlaundering conviction. See supra note 3. The appellant's argument\n\ndepends on the notion that the new sentence gave full effect to the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdrug trafficking that formed the basis for his earlier sentences.\n\nWe   disagree:     the   three-level   upward   adjustment   under   USSG\n\n§2S1.1(b)(1) was grounded not on the appellant's involvement per se\n\nin drug trafficking, but, rather, on his knowledge of illegal\n\nactivity.5    See United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez, 318 F.3d 268,\n\n278-79 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Bierd, 217 F.3d 15, 23\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); cf. United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 571\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (holding that mail fraud and money laundering\n\nconvictions should not be grouped even though offense level for\n\nmoney laundering was increased based on defendant's knowledge that\n\nfunds were proceeds of mail fraud).         It is, therefore, readily\n\nevident that the earlier sentences did not result from conduct that\n\nhad been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the\n\noffense level for the [offense of conviction].\"       USSG §5G1.3(b).\n\n             In situations, like this one, that are not covered by the\n\nfirst two subsections of USSG §5G1.3, subsection (c) applies.\n\nUnder this proviso, the court, in its discretion, may impose a\n\nsentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively.\n\nSee id. §5G1.3(c), cmt. (n.3).           The end result need only be\n\n\"reasonable.\"     United States v. Caraballo, 200 F.3d 20, 28 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).      The default rule in such situations is for the\n\n\n      5\n      The relevant guideline provides that \"[i]f the defendant knew\nor believed that the [laundered] funds were the proceeds of an\nunlawful activity involving the manufacture, importation, or\ndistribution of narcotics,\" the sentencing court should boost the\noffense level by three levels. USSG §2S1.1(b)(1).\n\n                                  -10-\n\fsentences to run consecutively.      See 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a); see also\n\nUnited States v. Quinones, 26 F.3d 213, 216-17 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Flowers, 995 F.2d 315, 316-17 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           In this instance, the district court hardly can be\n\nfaulted for following the default rule.         After all, the court had\n\ngood reason to conclude that granting the concurrent sentence\n\nmotion   would   impugn   the   spirit,   if   not   the   letter,   of   the\n\nAgreement. The Agreement mentioned only the offenses of conviction\n\n(money laundering and misprision of a felony) and provided that the\n\nsentences for those two crimes should run concurrently with each\n\nother.   Given that level of specificity, it was reasonable for the\n\ndistrict court to conclude that the parties did not intend to have\n\nthose sentences run concurrently with the unexpired portion of any\n\nprevious sentence.\n\n           This conclusion is bolstered by three facts.         First, the\n\nAgreement included a standard integration clause signifying that it\n\ncontained the entire agreement among the parties and their counsel.\n\nSecond, the Agreement explicitly warned that \"[t]he United States\n\nhas made no promises or representations except as set forth in\n\nwriting in this plea agreement and den[ies] the existence of any\n\nother term . . . not stated here.\"        Third, the concurrent sentence\n\nmotion, if granted, would have resulted, as a practical matter, in\n\na considerably more lenient sentence than that called for by the\n\nAgreement — a result that would seem odd given the government's\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fextraction of a promise that the appellant would seek no further\n\nguideline adjustments or departures.\n\n            To say more would be to paint the lily.        USSG §5G1.3(c)\n\ngoverns here, and the district court had discretion as to whether\n\nto make the new sentence run concurrently or consecutively vis-à-\n\nvis the undischarged portions of the earlier sentences.            On this\n\nrecord, the sentencing court had ample reason to deny the motion\n\nand hold the appellant to the spirit of the Agreement.           Any claim\n\nthat the court abused its discretion in following that course would\n\nbe an exercise in futility.\n\n            We need go no further.          The record reveals that the\n\ndistrict court appropriately questioned the appellant and his\n\nphalanx of attorneys regarding the concurrent sentence motion and\n\ngave the appellant a choice as to how to proceed.           The appellant\n\nelected to withdraw the motion.

Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Ivan Vazquez-Alomar has a history of trouble with the law. Pertinently, he pled guilty to federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges on June 11, 1999. The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico sentenced him to serve a 70-month incarcerative term in a federal correctional facility. On May 24, 2000, he pled guilty in the same court to additional drug-trafficking violations and to transporting firearms. He received a 78-month sentence, to be served concurrently with his previous sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charges underlying this appeal stem from a protracted investigation by federal agents into the laundering of drug proceeds. This probe revealed that for a period of roughly ten months commencing around December of 1998, the appellant participated in the laundering of drug money within the United States and abroad. On August 21, 2000, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned an indictment charging the appellant (who was then incarcerated as a result of the sentences imposed in June 1999 and May 2000) with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956-1957.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immurement did not check the appellant's penchant for criminal activity. In November of 2000, while still incarcerated, he engaged in telephone conversations concerning money laundering and the importation and distribution of multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine. He did not inform the authorities of these conversations, as federal law requires. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2001, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment that charged the appellant with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit money laundering.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), 1956(a)(2)(A), 1956(h), 1957. After initially proclaiming his innocence, the appellant entered a guilty plea to the money laundering count on May 1, 2002. On the same date, the government charged him, by information, with misprision of a felony, <i>id.</i> &#167; 4 &#8212; a charge based on the in-prison telephone calls. The appellant pled guilty to that charge as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coincident with these developments, the parties entered into a non-binding plea agreement (the Agreement). <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C). The Agreement spelled out certain proposed offense level adjustments and, based on those stipulations, memorialized an agreement \"that the appropriate disposition of this case\" would be a sentence of 135 months' imprisonment. The length of this proposed sentence derived from the following calculation (made by the government, acquiesced in by the appellant, and eventually adopted by the district court). The calculation started with the base offense level for laundering monetary instruments: level 23. USSG &#167; 2S1.1(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The base offense level was increased by six levels because the funds in question exceeded $2,000,000. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(G). Three more levels were added due to the appellant's knowledge that the funds represented the proceeds of an unlawful activity involving the distribution of controlled substances. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1). That subtotal (32) was reduced by three levels for acceptance of responsibility. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1. Given the appellant's adjusted offense level (29) and criminal history category (III), the projected guideline sentencing range was 108-135 months. The sentence that the parties agreed to recommend to the court reflected the top of that range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also agreed (i) that the government would request that the two new sentences (one for money laundering and the other for misprision) be served concurrently;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (ii) that \"no further adjustments or departures to the base offense level would be sought;\" and (iii) that \"any request by [the appellant] for any further guideline adjustments ... will be considered by the United States as a breach of this [Agreement].\" The Agreement neither referred to the appellant's previous crimes nor mentioned his existing incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that he signed the Agreement, the appellant was represented by two experienced defense lawyers. He subsequently retained yet a third attorney, Jos&#233; R. Franco-Rivera, to work in conjunction with them. If two were company, three proved to be a crowd: on September 3, 2002, Franco-Rivera, without the assent of his two co-counsels, filed a motion seeking to have the new sentence run concurrently with the unexpired portions of the appellant's existing sentences. In this motion, the appellant argued that USSG &#167; 5G1.3(b) required that result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In the appellant's view, his previous drug-trafficking convictions had been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for his new sentence by reason of the three-level enhancement for his knowledge that the laundered funds were drug proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disposition hearing took place on September 4, 2002. The appellant's three attorneys were present to represent their common client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first addressed the September 3 motion. The court quickly ascertained that the appellant's original lawyers, Marlene Aponte Cabrera and Rafael Castro Lang, had no input into the filing of that motion. Aponte then stated that she believed the motion contravened the Agreement. Castro concurred with that assessment. The court asked the appellant what he wished to do in view of the fact that the motion was deemed inadvisable by two of his three attorneys. The appellant replied that he desired to \"withdraw the motion ... [and] proceed with the sentencing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this blunt disavowal, the district judge conducted a thorough inquiry. She questioned the government on its interpretation of the Agreement, heard again from the appellant, and listened to his battery of attorneys. In the end, the judge noted that the only mention of concurrent sentences in the Agreement was the linkage between the money laundering and misprision charges, <i>see supra</i> note 3, and that the Agreement made no reference to other criminal cases or sentences. The judge concluded that, under the circumstances, granting the motion would be an \"unwarranted modification of the plea agreement\" and, therefore, denied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that point forward, the disposition hearing proceeded smoothly. In line with the Agreement, the district court sentenced the appellant to a 135-month incarcerative term for money laundering and a 36-month incarcerative term for misprision of a felony. The court ordered those terms to run concurrently with each other but consecutive to the undischarged portions of the earlier sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2002, the appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. In this venue, he argues that his motion for the imposition of concurrent sentences should not have been denied because the Agreement did not speak to this aspect of the matter and, therefore, granting the motion would not have been inconsistent with the Agreement. Moreover, the applicable provisions of the sentencing guidelines mandated running the sentences concurrently. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 5G1.3, quoted <i>supra</i> note 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's first line of defense is that the appellant waived this claim. Waiver is the \"intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (citing <i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)); <i>see also United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002). What constitutes a waiver depends in the first instance on the nature of the right at issue. <i>See New York v. Hill,</i> 528 U.S. 110, 114, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000). Criminal defendants may waive most rights as long as they do so \"voluntarily and with knowledge of the general nature and consequences of the waiver.\" <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2001). When a criminal defendant identifies an issue and then declines to pursue it, he normally will be deemed to have waived that issue for the purpose of appellate review. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d at 437; <i>United States v. Ross,</i> 77 F.3d 1525, 1542 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here is transparently clear that the September 3 motion brought the possibility of a broadly concurrent sentence &#8212; one that would have encompassed both the new sentence and the undischarged portions of the earlier terms &#8212; squarely before the district court. Having raised the issue, however, the appellant then retreated and stated unequivocally that he wished to withdraw his motion. The appellant's trio of attorneys acquiesced in this decision (indeed, two of them had opposed the filing of the motion from the moment that they learned of it, and the third &#8212; the motion's original proponent &#8212; ultimately agreed with this course of action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The withdrawal of the motion constituted an express waiver, and the appellant is bound by that waiver. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d at 437; <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir.1996). His appeal therefore fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that, even if we were willing to overlook the waiver, the appeal would not bear fruit. Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, the appellant's position is that the lower court had the duty to make his new sentence run concurrently with the unexpired portions of his earlier sentences. This position is simply wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement is silent (and, therefore, not dispositive) as to how the appellant's new sentence should be aligned with the unexpired portions of his earlier sentences. For present purposes, however, the important fact is that nothing in the Agreement demands that the court run the sentences concurrently. By like token, nothing in the sentencing guidelines requires such an outcome. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new sentence was based on the appellant's money laundering conviction. <i>See supra</i> note 3. The appellant's argument depends on the notion that the new sentence gave full effect to the drug trafficking that formed the basis for his earlier sentences. We disagree: the three-level upward adjustment under USSG &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1) was grounded not on the appellant's involvement per se in drug trafficking, but, rather, on his knowledge of illegal activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 318 F.3d 268, 278-79 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Bierd,</i> 217 F.3d 15, 23 (1st Cir.2000); <i>cf. United States v. Lombardi,</i> 5 F.3d 568, 571 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that mail fraud and money laundering convictions should not be grouped even though offense level for money laundering was increased based on defendant's knowledge that funds were proceeds of mail fraud). It is, therefore, readily evident that the earlier sentences did not result from conduct that had been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the [offense of conviction].\" USSG &#167; 5G1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In situations, like this one, that are not covered by the first two subsections of USSG &#167; 5G1.3, subsection (c) applies. Under this proviso, the court, in its discretion, may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 5G1.3(c), cmt. (n.3). The end result need only be \"reasonable.\" <i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> 200 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir.1999). The default rule in such situations is for the sentences to run consecutively. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(a); <i>see also United States v. Quinones,</i> 26 F.3d 213, 216-17 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Flowers,</i> 995 F.2d 315, 316-17 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court hardly can be faulted for following the default rule. After all, the court had good reason to conclude that granting the concurrent sentence motion would impugn the spirit, if not the letter, of the Agreement. The Agreement mentioned only the offenses of conviction (money laundering and misprision of a felony) and provided that the sentences for those two crimes should run concurrently with each other. Given that level of specificity, it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that the parties did not intend to have those sentences run concurrently with the unexpired portion of any previous sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is bolstered by three facts. First, the Agreement included a standard integration clause signifying that it contained the entire agreement among the parties and their counsel. Second, the Agreement explicitly warned that \"[t]he United States has made no promises or representations except as set forth in writing in this plea agreement and den[ies] the existence of any other term ... not stated here.\" Third, the concurrent sentence motion, if granted, would have resulted, as a practical matter, in a considerably more lenient sentence than that called for by the Agreement &#8212; a result that would seem odd given the government's extraction of a promise that the appellant would seek no further guideline adjustments or departures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be to paint the lily. USSG &#167; 5G1.3(c) governs here, and the district court had discretion as to whether to make the new sentence run concurrently or consecutively vis-&#224;-vis the undischarged portions of the earlier sentences. On this record, the sentencing court had ample reason to deny the motion and hold the appellant to the spirit of the Agreement. Any claim that the court abused its discretion in following that course would be an exercise in futility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The record reveals that the district court appropriately questioned the appellant and his phalanx of attorneys regarding the concurrent sentence motion and gave the appellant a choice as to how to proceed. The appellant elected to withdraw the motion. Given that explicit election, the doctrine of waiver bars the appellant's belated attempt to resurrect the issue on appeal. In any event, the lower court acted well within the realm of its discretion in refusing to shape its sentence to fit the contours proposed in the concurrent sentence motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The indictment also contained drug-related charges, but those charges were later dismissed.

On the same date, the government charged him, by information, with misprision of a felony, <i>id.</i> &#167; 4 &#8212; a charge based on the in-prison telephone calls. The appellant pled guilty to that charge as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coincident with these developments, the parties entered into a non-binding plea agreement (the Agreement). <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C). The Agreement spelled out certain proposed offense level adjustments and, based on those stipulations, memorialized an agreement \"that the appropriate disposition of this case\" would be a sentence of 135 months' imprisonment. The length of this proposed sentence derived from the following calculation (made by the government, acquiesced in by the appellant, and eventually adopted by the district court). The calculation started with the base offense level for laundering monetary instruments: level 23. USSG &#167; 2S1.1(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The base offense level was increased by six levels because the funds in question exceeded $2,000,000. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2S1.1(b)(2)(G). Three more levels were added due to the appellant's knowledge that the funds represented the proceeds of an unlawful activity involving the distribution of controlled substances. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1). That subtotal (32) was reduced by three levels for acceptance of responsibility. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1. Given the appellant's adjusted offense level (29) and criminal history category (III), the projected guideline sentencing range was 108-135 months. The sentence that the parties agreed to recommend to the court reflected the top of that range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also agreed (i) that the government would request that the two new sentences (one for money laundering and the other for misprision) be served concurrently;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (ii) that \"no further adjustments or departures to the base offense level would be sought;\" and (iii) that \"any request by [the appellant] for any further guideline adjustments ... will be considered by the United States as a breach of this [Agreement].\" The Agreement neither referred to the appellant's previous crimes nor mentioned his existing incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that he signed the Agreement, the appellant was represented by two experienced defense lawyers. He subsequently retained yet a third attorney, Jos&#233; R. Franco-Rivera, to work in conjunction with them. If two were company, three proved to be a crowd: on September 3, 2002, Franco-Rivera, without the assent of his two co-counsels, filed a motion seeking to have the new sentence run concurrently with the unexpired portions of the appellant's existing sentences. In this motion, the appellant argued that USSG &#167; 5G1.3(b) required that result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In the appellant's view, his previous drug-trafficking convictions had been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for his new sentence by reason of the three-level enhancement for his knowledge that the laundered funds were drug proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disposition hearing took place on September 4, 2002. The appellant's three attorneys were present to represent their common client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first addressed the September 3 motion. The court quickly ascertained that the appellant's original lawyers, Marlene Aponte Cabrera and Rafael Castro Lang, had no input into the filing of that motion. Aponte then stated that she believed the motion contravened the Agreement. Castro concurred with that assessment. The court asked the appellant what he wished to do in view of the fact that the motion was deemed inadvisable by two of his three attorneys. The appellant replied that he desired to \"withdraw the motion ... [and] proceed with the sentencing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this blunt disavowal, the district judge conducted a thorough inquiry. She questioned the government on its interpretation of the Agreement, heard again from the appellant, and listened to his battery of attorneys. In the end, the judge noted that the only mention of concurrent sentences in the Agreement was the linkage between the money laundering and misprision charges, <i>see supra</i> note 3, and that the Agreement made no reference to other criminal cases or sentences. The judge concluded that, under the circumstances, granting the motion would be an \"unwarranted modification of the plea agreement\" and, therefore, denied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that point forward, the disposition hearing proceeded smoothly. In line with the Agreement, the district court sentenced the appellant to a 135-month incarcerative term for money laundering and a 36-month incarcerative term for misprision of a felony. The court ordered those terms to run concurrently with each other but consecutive to the undischarged portions of the earlier sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2002, the appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. In this venue, he argues that his motion for the imposition of concurrent sentences should not have been denied because the Agreement did not speak to this aspect of the matter and, therefore, granting the motion would not have been inconsistent with the Agreement. Moreover, the applicable provisions of the sentencing guidelines mandated running the sentences concurrently. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 5G1.3, quoted <i>supra</i> note 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's first line of defense is that the appellant waived this claim.

What constitutes a waiver depends in the first instance on the nature of the right at issue. <i>See New York v.

When a criminal defendant identifies an issue and then declines to pursue it, he normally will be deemed to have waived that issue for the purpose of appellate review. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d at 437; <i>United States v. Ross,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714125\"><a href=\"/opinion/714125/united-states-v-thomas-s-ross-and-john-collori/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1525</span></a></span>, 1542 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here is transparently clear that the September 3 motion brought the possibility of a broadly concurrent sentence &#8212; one that would have encompassed both the new sentence and the undischarged portions of the earlier terms &#8212; squarely before the district court. Having raised the issue, however, the appellant then retreated and stated unequivocally that he wished to withdraw his motion. The appellant's trio of attorneys acquiesced in this decision (indeed, two of them had opposed the filing of the motion from the moment that they learned of it, and the third &#8212; the motion's original proponent &#8212; ultimately agreed with this course of action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The withdrawal of the motion constituted an express waiver, and the appellant is bound by that waiver. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d at 437; <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196797\"><a href=\"/opinion/196797/united-states-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 807 (1st Cir.1996). His appeal therefore fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that, even if we were willing to overlook the waiver, the appeal would not bear fruit. Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, the appellant's position is that the lower court had the duty to make his new sentence run concurrently with the unexpired portions of his earlier sentences. This position is simply wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement is silent (and, therefore, not dispositive) as to how the appellant's new sentence should be aligned with the unexpired portions of his earlier sentences. For present purposes, however, the important fact is that nothing in the Agreement demands that the court run the sentences concurrently. By like token, nothing in the sentencing guidelines requires such an outcome. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new sentence was based on the appellant's money laundering conviction. <i>See supra</i> note 3. The appellant's argument depends on the notion that the new sentence gave full effect to the drug trafficking that formed the basis for his earlier sentences. We disagree: the three-level upward adjustment under USSG &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1) was grounded not on the appellant's involvement per se in drug trafficking, but, rather, on his knowledge of illegal activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200334\"><a href=\"/opinion/200334/united-states-v-rivera-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 278-79 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Bierd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198986\"><a href=\"/opinion/198986/united-states-v-bierd/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2000); <i>cf. United States v. Lombardi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 571 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that mail fraud and money laundering convictions should not be grouped even though offense level for money laundering was increased based on defendant's knowledge that funds were proceeds of mail fraud). It is, therefore, readily evident that the earlier sentences did not result from conduct that had been \"fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the [offense of conviction].\" USSG &#167; 5G1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In situations, like this one, that are not covered by the first two subsections of USSG &#167; 5G1.3, subsection (c) applies. Under this proviso, the court, in its discretion, may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 5G1.3(c), cmt. (n.3). The end result need only be \"reasonable.\" <i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198786\"><a href=\"/opinion/198786/united-states-v-caraballo/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1999). The default rule in such situations is for the sentences to run consecutively. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(a); <i>see also United States v. Quinones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672030\"><a href=\"/opinion/672030/united-states-v-jesus-m-quinones-aka-jesus-m-quinones-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 216-17 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Flowers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608835\"><a href=\"/opinion/608835/united-states-v-john-g-flowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 316-17 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court hardly can be faulted for following the default rule. After all, the court had good reason to conclude that granting the concurrent sentence motion would impugn the spirit, if not the letter, of the Agreement. The Agreement mentioned only the offenses of conviction (money laundering and misprision of a felony) and provided that the sentences for those two crimes should run concurrently with each other. Given that level of specificity, it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that the parties did not intend to have those sentences run concurrently with the unexpired portion of any previous sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is bolstered by three facts. First, the Agreement included a standard integration clause signifying that it contained the entire agreement among the parties and their counsel. Second, the Agreement explicitly warned that \"[t]he United States has made no promises or representations except as set forth in writing in this plea agreement and den[ies] the existence of any other term ... not stated here.\" Third, the concurrent sentence motion, if granted, would have resulted, as a practical matter, in a considerably more lenient sentence than that called for by the Agreement &#8212; a result that would seem odd given the government's extraction of a promise that the appellant would seek no further guideline adjustments or departures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be to paint the lily. USSG &#167; 5G1.3(c) governs here, and the district court had discretion as to whether to make the new sentence run concurrently or consecutively vis-&#224;-vis the undischarged portions of the earlier sentences. On this record, the sentencing court had ample reason to deny the motion and hold the appellant to the spirit of the Agreement. Any claim that the court abused its discretion in following that course would be an exercise in futility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The record reveals that the district court appropriately questioned the appellant and his phalanx of attorneys regarding the concurrent sentence motion and gave the appellant a choice as to how to proceed. The appellant elected to withdraw the motion. Given that explicit election, the doctrine of waiver bars the appellant's belated attempt to resurrect the issue on appeal. In any event, the lower court acted well within the realm of its discretion in refusing to shape its sentence to fit the contours proposed in the concurrent sentence motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The indictment also contained drug-related charges, but those charges were later dismissed.
