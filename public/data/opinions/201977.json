We have before us an application by\n\nthe National Labor Relations Board (\"the Board\" or \"NLRB\") for\n\nenforcement of the order it issued against a grain processing\n\ncompany, Pan American.1          Pan American cross-petitions to set aside\n\nportions of the Board's order.\n\n                 Pan American is a Puerto Rican company that manufactures\n\nanimal feed and processes rice for human consumption. Congresso de\n\nUniones Industriales de Puerto Rico (\"the Union\") has been the\n\ncollective-bargaining representative of Pan American's production\n\nand maintenance employees for many years, but the last collective-\n\nbargaining agreement between the Union and Pan American expired in\n\n2000       for   two   Pan   American   facilities   (the   Amelia   and   Corujo\n\nfacilities) and 2002 for the other (the Arroz Rico facility).\n\n                 From 1996 to 2002, Pan American undertook a long-term\n\nproject designed to modernize and automate some of its facilities;\n\nit initiated this project to help offset the cost of complying with\n\nan Environmental Protection Agency consent decree.              These upgrades\n\ncaused the company's staffing needs gradually to decline, and Pan\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Pan American is two corporate entities, Pan American Grain\nCo., Inc. and Pan American Grain Mfg. Co., Inc., whose brief states\nthat they are \"affiliated business enterprises with common\nofficers, directors, management and supervision, formulating and\nadministering a common policy affecting operations.\"\n\n                                         -2-\n\fAmerican laid off one or two employees each year during the\n\nmodernization.\n\n           In January 2002, employees at the Amelia and Corujo\n\nfacilities went on strike.       The strike caused a decline in sales.\n\nThe following month, the company president met with two managers\n\nand the group decided that, because of the decline in sales and the\n\nincreased efficiency resulting from the modernization, fifteen\n\nemployees should be permanently laid off.         On February 27, 2002,\n\nPan American told fifteen of the striking employees that their\n\npositions had been permanently eliminated.        Pan American was later\n\ncharged with committing various unfair labor practices in violation\n\nof the National Labor Relations Act (\"the Act\" or \"NLRA\"), 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 151 et seq. (2000).\n\n           In the proceedings that followed, the NLRB found that Pan\n\nAmerican had engaged in numerous unfair labor practices, but the\n\nonly such finding challenged on petition to this court was that Pan\n\nAmerican had violated section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 158(a)(5), (1), by failing to give the Union notice and an\n\nopportunity to bargain as to the layoff decision and its effects\n\nbefore   laying   off   these   fifteen   employees.2   To   remedy   this\n\n\n     2\n      As Pan American did not contest the other findings by the\nBoard, the Board is entitled to summary enforcement of those\nportions of its order related to these findings. See E.C. Waste,\nInc. v. NLRB, 359 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                    -3-\n\fviolation, the Board ordered Pan American to reinstate the fifteen\n\nemployees and compensate them with back pay.\n\n           Pan American challenges the Board's finding as to the\n\nsection   8(a)(5)   and   (1)   violation   and   the   remedy   imposed   in\n\nconnection with this violation.       It argues first that it was not\n\nrequired to bargain with the dismissed employees regarding the\n\ndecision to dismiss them, conceding that it was required to bargain\n\nregarding the effects of the layoff decision. Second, Pan American\n\nasserts that in light of its limited bargaining duty, the remedy of\n\nreinstatement and full back pay was improper, and under Board\n\nprecedent in Transmarine Navigation Corp., 170 N.L.R.B. 389 (1968),\n\nonly limited back pay could be required.\n\n           The Board asserts that Pan American is precluded from\n\nmaking its first argument on this petition because it did not\n\npresent it to the Board in the proceedings below.                As for Pan\n\nAmerican's second argument, the Board urges that we should dispose\n\nof it by finding that the facts of this case do not warrant the\n\nlimited remedy Pan American seeks. We conclude that Pan American's\n\narguments are interrelated, were presented to the Board, and cannot\n\nbe resolved without further explanation by the Board.\n\n           To understand both the waiver argument and the merits of\n\nthe case requires a brief explanation of the background law. Under\n\nsection 8(a)(5) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5), an employer's\n\n                                    -4-\n\f\"refus[al] to bargain collectively with the representatives of his\n\nemployees\" constitutes an \"unfair labor practice\"; section 8(d) of\n\nthe   Act,    id.     §   158(d),    specifies   that   the    duty   \"to   bargain\n\ncollectively\" includes the obligation to \"confer in good faith with\n\nrespect      to    wages,   hours,    and   other   terms     and   conditions   of\n\nemployment.\" Absent contrary provisions in a collective bargaining\n\nagreement, there are thus some decisions as to which a unionized\n\nemployer must bargain with the union (e.g., wages and hours);\n\nothers as to which it normally need not, \"such as choice of\n\nadvertising and promotion, product type and design, and financing\n\narrangements,\" which \"have only an indirect and attenuated impact\n\non the employment relationship,\" First Nat'l Maint. Corp. v. NLRB,\n\n452 U.S. 666, 676-77 (1981); and yet others entailing obligations\n\nthat fall somewhere in between.\n\n              The present case may or may not fall in this \"in between\"\n\ncategory.         In certain situations, a decision to order layoffs may\n\nbe the prerogative of management but an obligation may still exist\n\nto bargain with the union as to \"effects\" of the layoffs; in other\n\nwords, management may have to bargain about whether and to what\n\nextent to provide severance to the laid-off employees even though\n\nit may not have to discuss whether to make the layoffs.                     Both the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fcourts (e.g., Providence Hospital)3 and the Board (notably in\n\nTransmarine)4    have   endorsed   such   a   qualified   duty   in   certain\n\ncircumstances.\n\n          Before the Board, Pan American argued that it did not\n\nhave to bargain with the Union at all so no relief was proper; but\n\nin the alternative it argued that at most its bargaining obligation\n\nwas limited to the \"effects\" of the layoffs and therefore back pay\n\nfor a limited period would be the most that should be awarded.            The\n\nlatter argument depends upon two elements: that only effects\n\nbargaining was required in this case, and that where only effects\n\nbargaining is required, the limited back pay remedy prescribed in\n\nTransmarine is appropriate for a breach of the bargaining duty\n\n(because reinstatement would defeat the layoff prerogative).\n\n          Pan American made this alternative two-part argument both\n\nin its exceptions to the findings of the administrative law judge\n\n     3\n      See Providence Hosp. v. NLRB, 93 F.3d 1012, 1018 (1st Cir.\n1996) (\"[U]nions generally enjoy the right to bargain over the\neffects of decisions which are not themselves mandatory subjects of\ncollective bargaining.\"); NLRB v. New England Newspapers, Inc., 856\nF.2d 409, 413 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"Although the employer is not\nobligated to bargain regarding the decision to sell its business,\nthe effects of that sale are . . . a mandatory subject of\nbargaining . . . .\").\n     4\n      Transmarine, 170 N.L.R.B. at 390 (requiring employer to\nbargain over effects of shutdown, and imposing \"a limited backpay\nrequirement\"); see also Melody Toyota, 325 N.L.R.B. 846, 846 (1998)\n(noting that the ALJ's order \"provides, inter alia, for the Board's\nstandard backpay remedy in effects bargaining cases as modeled\nafter the remedy set forth in Transmarine Navigation Corp.\").\n\n                                    -6-\n\f(\"ALJ\") and in its request for rehearing before the Board.             In its\n\nexceptions,    for   example,   Pan   American    sought     to   qualify   its\n\nbargaining obligation, focusing on the difference between a layoff\n\ndecision for \"economic reasons\" and a layoff decision resulting\n\nfrom   a   successful   modernization       program.   Pan    American      then\n\nconcluded its argument against the ALJ's remedy by stating:\n\n            [W]e contend that inasmuch as the record does\n            show that the layoffs were an effect of an\n            employer's   decision,   based  primarily   on\n            operational reasons as well as staffing needs,\n            the determination was related to the scope and\n            direction of business and accordingly the\n            proper remedy would be that of a limited back\n            pay.   See Transmarine Navigation Corp., 170\n            NLRB 389 (1968).\n\n            A petitioner is barred from making in court arguments not\n\npresented to the Board.     NLRB v. Saint-Gobain Abrasives, Inc., 426\n\nF.3d 455 (1st Cir. 2005), explained that under section 10(e) of the\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 160(e), the reviewing court has jurisdiction to\n\ndecide an issue on a petition to set aside an NLRB order only if an\n\nobjection made below, \"fairly read, apprises the Board that the\n\nobjector intended to pursue the issue later presented to the\n\ncourt.\" Saint-Gobain, 426 F.3d at 459 (citing Marshall Field & Co.\n\nv. NLRB, 318 U.S. 253, 255 (1943) (per curiam)).\n\n            However, we cannot agree with the Board's brief that Pan\n\nAmerican failed to make its argument to the Board.            The \"scope and\n\ndirection of business\" language and the attempted distinction\n\n                                      -7-\n\fbetween \"economic\" and \"modernization\" reasons for discharge bear\n\ndirectly on the extent of the employer's duty to bargain.        Indeed,\n\nthe   scope-and-direction   phrase   resembles   language   in   Justice\n\nStewart's oft-cited concurrence in Fibreboard Paper Prods. Corp. v.\n\nNLRB, 379 U.S. 203, 223 (1964) (Stewart, J., concurring), dealing\n\nwith just such line-drawing as to the extent of the duty to\n\nbargain.\n\n           Furthermore, Transmarine is the common citation for the\n\nview that a limited back pay remedy is the proper answer where the\n\nemployer breached only a duty to bargain about effects.            E.g.,\n\nMelody Toyota, 325 N.L.R.B. 846, 846 (1998); see also NLRB v.\n\nEmsing's Supermarket, Inc., 872 F.2d 1279, 1289-91 (7th Cir. 1989).\n\nTo rely on Transmarine, as Pan American did, for the view that \"the\n\nproper remedy would be that of a limited back pay\" makes sense only\n\nif the predicate is the employer's claim that its duty to bargain\n\nwas limited (i.e., because the layoffs were assertedly a management\n\nprerogative).   The two elements are parts of an embracing claim\n\nthat there was only a limited duty warranting only a limited\n\nremedy.\n\n           We agree that Pan American could have done a better job\n\nat the Board level in clarifying its position.          In part, Pan\n\nAmerican invited confusion by arguing (permissibly--but perhaps not\n\nwith perfect lucidity) that it had no duty to bargain at all but,\n\n                                 -8-\n\fif it did, it was a limited duty justifying only the Transmarine\n\nremedy.     Yet contributing to the confusion is the fact that the\n\nBoard has not made clear where the full duty to bargain leaves off\n\nand the limited \"effects\" duty supercedes it.              Anyway, enough was\n\nsaid to alert the Board to the employer objection that only a\n\nlimited duty and the Transmarine remedy applied in this case.\n\n            No answer to the objection is provided in the Board's\n\ndecision.     In rejecting a claim of retaliatory firings under\n\nsection 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3), (1), the\n\nALJ had explicitly credited Pan American's claim that the layoff of\n\nthe fifteen employees was motivated (at least in part) by the\n\nmodernization     and    automation    project    dating    from   1996.    In\n\nsummarizing his factual findings on this question, the ALJ stated:\n\n            The evidence substantiating [Pan American's]\n            position that an ongoing modernization and\n            automation project had reduced staffing needs\n            was detailed, plausible, and uncontroverted;\n            it outweighs the evidence casting doubt on the\n            veracity of [Pan American's] explanation.\n            [Pan American] has shown that it more likely\n            than not would have decided to implement its\n            February 2002 layoff because its staffing\n            needs decreased, even absent the employees'\n            protected activities.\n\nThe ALJ also found that another possible motivation for the layoffs\n\nwas a \"dip in sales.\"\n\n            Yet   when   the   ALJ    discussed   the   failure    to   bargain\n\ncharges, he simply said that \"layoff decisions are a mandatory\n\n                                       -9-\n\fsubject of bargaining,\" failure to bargain violates the Act, and\n\n\"the traditional and appropriate Board remedy for an unlawful\n\nunilateral layoff based on legitimate economic concerns\" includes\n\nreinstatement and full back pay.   He did not so much as mention the\n\nissue of the possible motivation of the layoffs as pertinent to\n\nwhether full reinstatement or only the limited back pay remedy\n\nshould be adopted.\n\n          Pan American responded, as described and quoted above, by\n\narguing to the Board that Pan American's rationale for the layoffs-\n\n-accepted by the ALJ himself–warranted at most only the Transmarine\n\nremedy of limited back pay.   The Board, faced with Pan American's\n\nobjection, explained the difference between the full and limited\n\nback pay remedies and then continued with two sentences that\n\nexplain very little:\n\n          Here, we have found that [Pan American's]\n          decision to lay off employees was a mandatory\n          subject of bargaining, and that [Pan American]\n          violated Section 8(a)(5) and (1) by failing to\n          satisfy its obligation to bargain both over\n          the decision and its effects. Accordingly, we\n          find that the full backpay and reinstatement\n          remedy is appropriate.\n\n          In substance the Board treats a breached obligation to\n\nbargain over the decision as well as its effects as warranting the\n\n\"full\" (as opposed to the Transmarine) remedy.   What is missing is\n\nany explanation why, in light of the ALJ's own factual findings,\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fPan American's \"decision to lay off employees was a mandatory\n\nsubject of [full scale] bargaining\" rather than bargaining solely\n\nabout effects.          Yet some explanation is needed precisely because\n\nwhere the line should be drawn is far from clear.\n\n            Justice Stewart's concurrence in Fibreboard eschewed\n\nmandatory    bargaining        for     decisions      that      \"lie    at    the     core    of\n\nentrepreneurial         control,\"      such    as    \"[d]ecisions         concerning         the\n\ncommitment    of    investment         capital      and    the    basic      scope     of    the\n\nenterprise.\"            Fibreboard,      379        U.S.   at     223        (Stewart,       J.,\n\nconcurring).       It was followed by First Nat'l, a case involving a\n\npartial shutdown of an employer's business, which offered three\n\nseparate categories of managerial decisions and a balancing test,\n\nnoting   that    \"other        types    of    management         decisions\"--including\n\n\"automation\"--\"are to be considered on their particular facts.\"\n\nFirst Nat'l, 452 U.S. at 667, 676-79, 686 n.22.\n\n            We     do    not   know     whether      the    NLRB       now    views    layoff\n\ndecisions prompted by modernization to be mandatory subjects of\n\nbargaining, resolving the issue seemingly left open in First Nat'l,\n\nand, if so, why, or whether it decided this case on its \"particular\n\nfacts,\" and, if so, what those facts were.                        Possibly, the Board\n\nattributed importance to the fact that the layoffs owed something\n\nto the loss of business due to the strike but, if so, this too is\n\n\n\n\n                                             -11-\n\funexplained, nor do we know how multiple motives for layoffs should\n\nbe analyzed.\n\n              The issue appears to be one of considerable importance.\n\nTo say that an employer must bargain about whether to make layoffs\n\ncaused   by    modernization      does   not    seem   far   from     saying,   in\n\nsubstance,     that   it   must   bargain      about   whether   to   modernize.\n\nPerhaps there is some reason to distinguish between the two, but it\n\nis easy to see how the two steps are linked in practice.                   Often\n\nenough, an employer who cannot recoup costs of modernizing by\n\nreducing employment will have little reason to invest.\n\n              In all events, we do not understand the Board's rationale\n\nfor classifying this case as one where the employer had (in the\n\nBoard's words) an \"obligation to bargain both over the decision\n\n[the layoffs] and its effects.\"             The result may or may not be\n\nsound, but until we understand its basis, we cannot effectively\n\nreview it.      See NLRB v. Auciello Iron Works, Inc., 980 F.2d 804,\n\n812-13 (1st Cir. 1992).      And if there is an obvious explanation, it\n\nhas not been supplied by the Board's brief on appeal.\n\n              The application of the Board for enforcement of its order\n\nis granted in part, as to paragraphs (1)(a), (b), (d), (e) (except\n\nas it applies to the employees laid off on February 27, 2002), (f),\n\nand (g), and paragraphs (2)(a), (b), (e) (except as it applies to\n\nthe employees laid off on February 27, 2002), (f) (except as it\n\n                                     -12-\n\fapplies to the employees laid off on February 27, 2002), (g), (h),\n\n(i) (except for paragraphs in the notice pledging to bargain with\n\nthe Union as to the February 27, 2002, layoffs, and to reinstate\n\nand make whole the employees laid off on that day), and (j).\n\n            As to paragraphs (1)(c) and (e) (insofar as it applies to\n\nthe employees laid off on February 27, 2002), and paragraphs\n\n(2)(c), (d), (e) (insofar as it applies to the employees laid off\n\non February 27, 2002), (f) (insofar as it applies to the employees\n\nlaid off on February 27, 2002), and those portions of (2)(i)\n\nrequiring the posted notice to include a pledge to bargain with the\n\nUnion as to the February 27, 2002, layoffs, and to reinstate and\n\nmake whole the employees laid off on that day, the order is vacated\n\nand   the   case   remanded   to   the   Board   for   further   proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.        Each side to bear its own costs on\n\nappeal.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              Dissent follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f            STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.     I do not\n\nagree with the majority that Pan American's objections before the\n\nBoard were sufficient to apprise the Board that the company would\n\nlater argue, on appeal, that it had no duty to bargain about the\n\nlayoffs in the first place.      I would hold that Pan American\n\nwaived the bargainability issue by not raising it below, and that\n\nSection 10(e) of the NLRA precludes our entertaining the question\n\nwhether the February 2002 decision to lay off fifteen striking\n\nemployees was a mandatory subject of bargaining.       I therefore\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n          We very recently confirmed that the \"statutory mandate\"\n\nset out in Section 10(e) \"is clear: if a particular objection has\n\nnot been raised before the Board, a reviewing court, in the\n\nabsence of extraordinary circumstances, is without jurisdiction\n\nto consider the issue in a subsequent enforcement proceeding.\"\n\nNLRB v. Saint-Gobain Abrasives, Inc., 426 F.3d 455, 459 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   When it is not immediately apparent whether the objection\n\na party made below is the same as the issue it now seeks to raise\n\non appeal, the critical inquiry \"is whether the objection, fairly\n\nread, apprises the Board that the objector intended to pursue the\n\nissue later presented to the court.\"   Id. (citing Marshall Field\n\n& Co. v. NLRB, 318 U.S. 253, 255 (1943) (per curiam)).      In the\n\npresent case, Pan American argues on appeal that it had no duty\n\n                               -14-\n\fto bargain about the layoffs of fifteen employees in February\n\n2002, but it did not make this objection below in so many words.\n\n             In cases such as this one, \"where a party asserts that\n\nit    has   objected     to   the    Board,   but    the    objection     is    not\n\nunmistakable,\" our review \"must be guided by the purposes of\n\nsection 10(e) and necessarily will be highly fact specific.\"\n\nLocal 900, Int'l Union of Elec., Radio & Mach. Workers (IUE) v.\n\nNLRB, 727 F.2d 1184, 1193 (D.C. Cir. 1984).                The purposes served\n\nby Section 10(e) are twofold.           First, the section \"has a notice\n\nfunction    that    ensures   that    the   Board    has   the    opportunity    to\n\nresolve all issues properly within its jurisdiction.\"                      Id. at\n\n1191.     Second, the section \"insures against repetitive appeals to\n\nthe   courts\"      by   requiring    aggrieved      parties      to   present   all\n\nobjections to the Board in the first instance.                Id.\n\n             Here, Pan American presented two primary objections to\n\nthe Board.5     First, Pan American contended that the ALJ erred in\n\nfinding an unfair labor practice, because the company had, in\n\nfact, given proper notice to the Union and showed its willingness\n\nto bargain, and it was the Union's recalcitrance, rather than any\n\nmisbehavior on Pan American's part, that prevented bargaining\n\n\n\n      5\n      The company also objected to a particular factual finding the\nALJ made: that certain former strikers made an offer to return to\nwork. This point is not at issue on appeal.\n\n                                       -15-\n\ffrom taking place.       This objection, far from intimating that the\n\ncompany had no duty to bargain, assumes that there was such a\n\nduty.    Second, Pan American objected that the ALJ should not have\n\nrecommended a remedy of reinstatement and full back pay for the\n\nfifteen terminated employees.            I simply cannot agree with the\n\nmajority when it states, \"Before the Board, Pan American argued\n\nthat it did not have to bargain with the Union at all so no\n\nrelief was proper, but in the alternative it argued that at most\n\nits bargaining obligation was limited to the 'effects' of the\n\nlayoffs.\"         Slip   Op.   at   6.       This      statement   not     only\n\nmischaracterizes Pan American's arguments before the Board6 but\n\nassumes as plain fact what is actually a fervently contested\n\nissue in this case.\n\n            The    majority    finds      that   Pan     American's      second\n\nobjection, its challenge to the remedy, was sufficient to apprise\n\n\n     6\n      In its first exception, Pan American stated, \"Not only did\nRespondent give proper notice of the future layoffs to the Union,\nbut the latter failed to timely bargain over said issue, thus\nwaiving its right to do so.\" In its second exception, the company\nstated, \"[I]nasmuch as the record does show that the layoffs were\n[the result] of an employer's decision, based primarily on\noperational reasons as well as staffing needs, the determination\nwas related to the scope and direction of business and accordingly\nthe proper remedy would be that of a limited back pay.\" At best,\nthis second exception could be interpreted as raising the\nbargainability issue in a roundabout manner, and that is the\nargument the majority makes.    But it is simply not correct to\nimply, as the majority does, that Pan American raised this\nobjection directly and explicitly, for it did not.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fthe Board that the company would later argue that there was no\n\nduty    to    bargain       about   the     layoffs        in    the    first      place.      I\n\ndisagree.      As the majority recognizes, it is undoubtedly possible\n\nto infer a connection between the question of what kind of remedy\n\nis     appropriate      after       an     employer's           failure      to    engage     in\n\nstatutorily required bargaining and the question of the extent of\n\nthe employer's original duty to bargain.                          The connection arises\n\nfrom    the    fact     that    when       an    employer        violates         the   Act   by\n\nterminating employees without engaging in mandatory bargaining,\n\nthe Board's customary remedy is reinstatement and back pay for\n\nthe terminated employees.                See Saint-Gobain, 426 F.3d at 461.                   In\n\ncontrast,      when    an    employer      is    not   required         to    bargain      about\n\nterminating an employee, but must bargain only about the effects\n\nof   that     termination      (such       as    severance        packages),        the    Board\n\ngenerally imposes a more limited remedy, consisting of back pay\n\ndating       only    from     the   date        of   the    Board's          order,     without\n\nreinstatement.          See Transmarine Navigation Corp., 170 N.L.R.B.\n\n389, 390 (1968).             See also Bridon Cordage, Inc., 329 N.L.R.B.\n\n258, 259 n. 11 (1999) (explaining distinction).\n\n              Thus, the argument goes that a person versed in the\n\ntenets of labor law could infer that, because Pan American sought\n\na limited back pay remedy, the company believed such a remedy was\n\nappropriate         because    it    had        no   duty       to     bargain     about      its\n\n                                            -17-\n\funderlying   decision           to   terminate      the     employees.        I    believe,\n\nhowever, that this court should not have to infer the possible\n\nlegal arguments on which a party's complaints before the Board\n\nmight be based.        For one thing, the Board will be better able to\n\nadminister its work if parties are required to make explicit to\n\nthe Board the reasons for their objections.                          This is because,\n\nwithout   such    a    \"clear        statement      rule,\"    the    disposition      of   a\n\nparticular case will depend on the depths to which a particular\n\nappellate panel is willing to dig in order to uncover a plausible\n\nconnection between the language used in an objection before the\n\nBoard and a theory on which the court might disturb the Board's\n\norder.     What       is   more,      to   allow     parties    to    raise       imprecise\n\nobjections in the hopes of later striking gold with the appeals\n\ncourt    \"would   be       to   set    the    Board    up    for    one   ambush      after\n\nanother,\" Quazite v. NLRB, 87 F.3d 493, 497 (D.C. Cir. 1996),\n\nwith the ambushing party's rate of success varying with the level\n\nof labor law expertise held by the circuit court panel to which\n\nthe appeal is assigned.7\n\n\n     7\n      Of course, a party need not use an impossibly precise\nformulation of words. For example, in IUE, the court found that\nthe union had adequately raised the question of whether a remedy\napplied retroactively, even though the union's objections did not\nmention the word \"retroactive.\"         See 727 F.2d at 1193.\nNevertheless, the court's benchmark remained whether the objection\nprovided sufficient notice to the Board as to the contested issue.\nThe court found that \"in light of the union's objection to the\n\n                                             -18-\n\f           In this case, it is hardly certain that Pan American\n\nchallenged the ALJ's recommended remedy of reinstatement and back\n\npay out of the conviction that the company had no duty to bargain\n\nover the underlying management decision (although that is one\n\npossible   interpretation).     Another   interpretation,   at   least\n\nequally plausible, is that Pan American thought the order of\n\nreinstatement was improper because it no longer had the need for\n\nfifteen additional employees.    In fact, Pan American's notice of\n\nexceptions to the Board confirms that this was precisely the\n\ncompany's position:\n\n            [A] full back pay and reinstatement remedy is\n            not proper in this case inasmuch as it has\n            been proven that Respondent's operations does\n            not harbor the need for the 15 positions that\n            were eliminated as per the modernization and\n            automation of the plant, which resulted in\n            the employees' layoffs.\n\nJust as a general objection to \"the remedies set forth in the\n\n[ALJ's] decision\" does not suffice to raise a later appeal on the\n\ngrounds that the remedy was unduly punitive, see Saint-Gobain,\n\n\n\n\nremedy [and the context thereof]. . . it is inconceivable that the\nBoard did not understand that the union objected on retroactivity\ngrounds and that the union would raise the issue on appeal.\" Id.\nat 1193 (emphasis added). In contrast, in this case, it is far\nfrom inconceivable that the Board could have failed to discern from\nPan American's exceptions that the company intended to raise the\nbargaining issue on appeal. Rather, it is quite possible that Pan\nAmerican did not, in fact, have any such intention at the time of\nits objections before the Board.\n\n                                -19-\n\f426 F.3d at 459,8 Pan American's objection to the remedy imposed\n\nin this case, which could be interpreted in various ways, should\n\nnot suffice to preserve its current argument on appeal that the\n\nremedy   was   inappropriate   because      the       company    had   no   duty   to\n\nbargain.\n\n           I   note   that   this   is    not     a    case     \"[w]here    a   party\n\nexplicitly excepts to a remedy, and offers some explanation for\n\nits objection in its brief\" such that we might hold \"that there\n\nis sufficient notice to the Board to satisfy section 10(e).\"\n\nAlwin Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, 192 F.3d 133, 144 (D.C. Cir. 1999).                        To\n\nthe contrary, in its brief replying to the NLRB General Counsel's\n\nanswer to its objections, Pan American merely reiterated its\n\nargument that the ALJ's remedy was unduly burdensome, stating,\n\n\"[T]he record stands to the fact that the operations at [the\n\nanimal feed production plant] currently do not need 15 additional\n\nemployees in order to operate.           Therefore, an order to reinstate\n\nthe 15 laid off employees . . . is . . . an undue burden on this\n\nparty's operations.\"     This is further evidence that Pan American\n\nwas not even attempting to raise the bargainability issue before\n\nthe Board.9\n\n     8\n      As we noted in Saint-Gobain, \"[t]here is no shortage of other\ncases to the same effect.\" See id. at 460 (collecting cases).\n     9\n     Moreover, the Board's opinion below is entirely consistent\nwith the reasonable view that Pan American's objections were\n\n                                    -20-\n\f          Our review might be different if resolution of the\n\nduty-to-bargain question were straightforward.      But here, the\n\nquestion is complicated and difficult to resolve, and the Board\n\nwould have been justified in concluding, as it evidently did,\n\nthat a party intending to raise the issue would have provided the\n\nBoard with developed argumentation in support of its position.\n\nAs the Supreme Court has said, an employer generally cannot take\n\nunilateral action regarding mandatory subjects of bargaining, but\n\nmust first bargain over them with the union.    NLRB v. Katz, 369\n\nU.S. 736, 738-39 (1962).    Mandatory bargaining subjects include\n\n\"terms and conditions of employment.\"   29 U.S.C. § 158(d).   Thus,\n\n\n\n\nlimited to (a) an assertion that the company met its duty to\nbargain and that it was the Union who refused to cooperate, and (b)\na complaint that the company should not have to reinstate workers\nwhose labor Pan American felt it no longer needed. The Board's\nDecision   and   Order,  in   addition   to  adopting   the   ALJ's\nrecommendations, contained two holdings. First, the Board rejected\nPan American's contention that it complied with the Act by\nproviding the Union an opportunity to bargain. Second, the Board\nheld that, given that Pan American's decision to lay off employees\nwas a mandatory subject of bargaining, the remedy of full back pay\nand reinstatement was appropriate, rather than the limited remedy\nPan American had requested.      Although the Board's failure to\ndiscuss an issue does not necessarily indicate that a party has not\nadequately objected, see IUE, 727 F.2d at 1191, the fact that the\nBoard did not even mention a dispute about whether the layoffs were\nbargainable supports my conclusion that the issue, which is a\ncomplicated one, was not raised. In fact, Pan American's imprecise\nobjection \"may well account for the Board's failure to consider\nthis question in its decision and to make findings with respect to\nit,\" Marshall Field, 318 U.S. at 255, which the majority now\ninstructs the Board to do on remand.\n\n                               -21-\n\fan employer cannot unilaterally change employees' working hours\n\nor   pay   rate,    for   example,    without     first    bargaining      with   the\n\nunion.     Employer decisions such as layoffs, relocations of jobs,\n\nand plant closings, in contrast, are sometimes mandatory subjects\n\nof bargaining and sometimes not, depending on the reasons for the\n\ndecision    and    whether     the   issues     raised    by   the   decision     are\n\namenable to resolution through the bargaining process.                     See First\n\nNat'l Maint. Corp. v. NLRB, 452, U.S. 666, 678 (1981).                     The exact\n\nlocation of the line separating these two categories of employer\n\ndecisions is indistinct.         Compare, e.g., United Food & Commercial\n\nWorkers Int'l Union, Local 150-A v. NLRB, 1 F.3d 24, 31-32, 35\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (endorsing three-part test for exempting certain\n\n\"entrepreneurial control\" decisions from duty to bargain) with\n\nDorsey Trailers, Inc. v. NLRB, 233 F.3d 831, 842-43 (4th Cir.\n\n2000) (holding that as long as employer decision requires capital\n\nexpenditure, decision is outside duty to bargain).\n\n            In short, the issue of mandatory bargaining is not as\n\ninextricably       tied   to   the   question    of   remedy    as   the    majority\n\nbelieves.    If Pan American wished to challenge the ALJ's finding\n\nthat it was required to bargain about the layoffs, it should have\n\nsaid so clearly.          The Board — and this Court — should not be\n\nrequired to connect the dots without aid from the parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\f            I would grant enforcement of the Board's order in its\n\nentirety.\n\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f",

We have before us an application by\n\nthe National Labor Relations Board (\"the Board\" or \"NLRB\") for\n\nenforcement of the order it issued against a grain processing\n\ncompany, Pan American.1          Pan American cross-petitions to set aside\n\nportions of the Board's order.\n\n                 Pan American is a Puerto Rican company that manufactures\n\nanimal feed and processes rice for human consumption. Congresso de\n\nUniones Industriales de Puerto Rico (\"the Union\") has been the\n\ncollective-bargaining representative of Pan American's production\n\nand maintenance employees for many years, but the last collective-\n\nbargaining agreement between the Union and Pan American expired in\n\n2000       for   two   Pan   American   facilities   (the   Amelia   and   Corujo\n\nfacilities) and 2002 for the other (the Arroz Rico facility).\n\n                 From 1996 to 2002, Pan American undertook a long-term\n\nproject designed to modernize and automate some of its facilities;\n\nit initiated this project to help offset the cost of complying with\n\nan Environmental Protection Agency consent decree.              These upgrades\n\ncaused the company's staffing needs gradually to decline, and Pan\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Pan American is two corporate entities, Pan American Grain\nCo., Inc. and Pan American Grain Mfg. Co., Inc., whose brief states\nthat they are \"affiliated business enterprises with common\nofficers, directors, management and supervision, formulating and\nadministering a common policy affecting operations.\"\n\n                                         -2-\n\fAmerican laid off one or two employees each year during the\n\nmodernization.\n\n           In January 2002, employees at the Amelia and Corujo\n\nfacilities went on strike.       The strike caused a decline in sales.\n\nThe following month, the company president met with two managers\n\nand the group decided that, because of the decline in sales and the\n\nincreased efficiency resulting from the modernization, fifteen\n\nemployees should be permanently laid off.         On February 27, 2002,\n\nPan American told fifteen of the striking employees that their\n\npositions had been permanently eliminated.        Pan American was later\n\ncharged with committing various unfair labor practices in violation\n\nof the National Labor Relations Act (\"the Act\" or \"NLRA\"), 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 151 et seq. (2000).\n\n           In the proceedings that followed, the NLRB found that Pan\n\nAmerican had engaged in numerous unfair labor practices, but the\n\nonly such finding challenged on petition to this court was that Pan\n\nAmerican had violated section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 158(a)(5), (1), by failing to give the Union notice and an\n\nopportunity to bargain as to the layoff decision and its effects\n\nbefore   laying   off   these   fifteen   employees.2   To   remedy   this\n\n\n     2\n      As Pan American did not contest the other findings by the\nBoard, the Board is entitled to summary enforcement of those\nportions of its order related to these findings. See E.C. Waste,\nInc. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200878\"><a href=\"/opinion/200878/ec-waste-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                    -3-\n\fviolation, the Board ordered Pan American to reinstate the fifteen\n\nemployees and compensate them with back pay.\n\n           Pan American challenges the Board's finding as to the\n\nsection   8(a)(5)   and   (1)   violation   and   the   remedy   imposed   in\n\nconnection with this violation.       It argues first that it was not\n\nrequired to bargain with the dismissed employees regarding the\n\ndecision to dismiss them, conceding that it was required to bargain\n\nregarding the effects of the layoff decision. Second, Pan American\n\nasserts that in light of its limited bargaining duty, the remedy of\n\nreinstatement and full back pay was improper, and under Board\n\nprecedent in Transmarine Navigation Corp., 170 N.L.R.B. 389 (1968),\n\nonly limited back pay could be required.\n\n           The Board asserts that Pan American is precluded from\n\nmaking its first argument on this petition because it did not\n\npresent it to the Board in the proceedings below.                As for Pan\n\nAmerican's second argument, the Board urges that we should dispose\n\nof it by finding that the facts of this case do not warrant the\n\nlimited remedy Pan American seeks. We conclude that Pan American's\n\narguments are interrelated, were presented to the Board, and cannot\n\nbe resolved without further explanation by the Board.\n\n           To understand both the waiver argument and the merits of\n\nthe case requires a brief explanation of the background law. Under\n\nsection 8(a)(5) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5), an employer's\n\n                                    -4-\n\f\"refus[al] to bargain collectively with the representatives of his\n\nemployees\" constitutes an \"unfair labor practice\"; section 8(d) of\n\nthe   Act,    id.     §   158(d),    specifies   that   the    duty   \"to   bargain\n\ncollectively\" includes the obligation to \"confer in good faith with\n\nrespect      to    wages,   hours,    and   other   terms     and   conditions   of\n\nemployment.\" Absent contrary provisions in a collective bargaining\n\nagreement, there are thus some decisions as to which a unionized\n\nemployer must bargain with the union (e.g., wages and hours);\n\nothers as to which it normally need not, \"such as choice of\n\nadvertising and promotion, product type and design, and financing\n\narrangements,\" which \"have only an indirect and attenuated impact\n\non the employment relationship,\" First Nat'l Maint.

In certain situations, a decision to order layoffs may\n\nbe the prerogative of management but an obligation may still exist\n\nto bargain with the union as to \"effects\" of the layoffs; in other\n\nwords, management may have to bargain about whether and to what\n\nextent to provide severance to the laid-off employees even though\n\nit may not have to discuss whether to make the layoffs.

The\n\nlatter argument depends upon two elements: that only effects\n\nbargaining was required in this case, and that where only effects\n\nbargaining is required, the limited back pay remedy prescribed in\n\nTransmarine is appropriate for a breach of the bargaining duty\n\n(because reinstatement would defeat the layoff prerogative).\n\n          Pan American made this alternative two-part argument both\n\nin its exceptions to the findings of the administrative law judge\n\n     3\n      See Providence Hosp. v.

E.g.,\n\nMelody Toyota, 325 N.L.R.B. 846, 846 (1998); see also NLRB v.\n\nEmsing's Supermarket, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521923\"><a href=\"/opinion/521923/national-labor-relations-board-v-emsings-supermarket-inc-and-rockys/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289-91 (7th Cir. 1989).\n\nTo rely on Transmarine, as Pan American did, for the view that \"the\n\nproper remedy would be that of a limited back pay\" makes sense only\n\nif the predicate is the employer's claim that its duty to bargain\n\nwas limited (i.e., because the layoffs were assertedly a management\n\nprerogative).   The two elements are parts of an embracing claim\n\nthat there was only a limited duty warranting only a limited\n\nremedy.\n\n           We agree that Pan American could have done a better job\n\nat the Board level in clarifying its position.          In part, Pan\n\nAmerican invited confusion by arguing (permissibly--but perhaps not\n\nwith perfect lucidity) that it had no duty to bargain at all but,\n\n                                 -8-\n\fif it did, it was a limited duty justifying only the Transmarine\n\nremedy.     Yet contributing to the confusion is the fact that the\n\nBoard has not made clear where the full duty to bargain leaves off\n\nand the limited \"effects\" duty supercedes it.              Anyway, enough was\n\nsaid to alert the Board to the employer objection that only a\n\nlimited duty and the Transmarine remedy applied in this case.\n\n            No answer to the objection is provided in the Board's\n\ndecision.     In rejecting a claim of retaliatory firings under\n\nsection 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3), (1), the\n\nALJ had explicitly credited Pan American's claim that the layoff of\n\nthe fifteen employees was motivated (at least in part) by the\n\nmodernization     and    automation    project    dating    from   1996.    In\n\nsummarizing his factual findings on this question, the ALJ stated:\n\n            The evidence substantiating [Pan American's]\n            position that an ongoing modernization and\n            automation project had reduced staffing needs\n            was detailed, plausible, and uncontroverted;\n            it outweighs the evidence casting doubt on the\n            veracity of [Pan American's] explanation.\n            [Pan American] has shown that it more likely\n            than not would have decided to implement its\n            February 2002 layoff because its staffing\n            needs decreased, even absent the employees'\n            protected activities.\n\nThe ALJ also found that another possible motivation for the layoffs\n\nwas a \"dip in sales.\"\n\n            Yet   when   the   ALJ    discussed   the   failure    to   bargain\n\ncharges, he simply said that \"layoff decisions are a mandatory\n\n                                       -9-\n\fsubject of bargaining,\" failure to bargain violates the Act, and\n\n\"the traditional and appropriate Board remedy for an unlawful\n\nunilateral layoff based on legitimate economic concerns\" includes\n\nreinstatement and full back pay.   He did not so much as mention the\n\nissue of the possible motivation of the layoffs as pertinent to\n\nwhether full reinstatement or only the limited back pay remedy\n\nshould be adopted.\n\n          Pan American responded, as described and quoted above, by\n\narguing to the Board that Pan American's rationale for the layoffs-\n\n-accepted by the ALJ himself–warranted at most only the Transmarine\n\nremedy of limited back pay.   The Board, faced with Pan American's\n\nobjection, explained the difference between the full and limited\n\nback pay remedies and then continued with two sentences that\n\nexplain very little:\n\n          Here, we have found that [Pan American's]\n          decision to lay off employees was a mandatory\n          subject of bargaining, and that [Pan American]\n          violated Section 8(a)(5) and (1) by failing to\n          satisfy its obligation to bargain both over\n          the decision and its effects. Accordingly, we\n          find that the full backpay and reinstatement\n          remedy is appropriate.\n\n          In substance the Board treats a breached obligation to\n\nbargain over the decision as well as its effects as warranting the\n\n\"full\" (as opposed to the Transmarine) remedy.   What is missing is\n\nany explanation why, in light of the ALJ's own factual findings,\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fPan American's \"decision to lay off employees was a mandatory\n\nsubject of [full scale] bargaining\" rather than bargaining solely\n\nabout effects.          Yet some explanation is needed precisely because\n\nwhere the line should be drawn is far from clear.\n\n            Justice Stewart's concurrence in Fibreboard eschewed\n\nmandatory    bargaining        for     decisions      that      \"lie    at    the     core    of\n\nentrepreneurial         control,\"      such    as    \"[d]ecisions         concerning         the\n\ncommitment    of    investment         capital      and    the    basic      scope     of    the\n\nenterprise.\"            Fibreboard,      379        U.S.   at     223        (Stewart,       J.,\n\nconcurring).       It was followed by First Nat'l, a case involving a\n\npartial shutdown of an employer's business, which offered three\n\nseparate categories of managerial decisions and a balancing test,\n\nnoting   that    \"other        types    of    management         decisions\"--including\n\n\"automation\"--\"are to be considered on their particular facts.\"\n\nFirst Nat'l, 452 U.S. at 667, 676-79, 686 n.22.\n\n            We     do    not   know     whether      the    NLRB       now    views    layoff\n\ndecisions prompted by modernization to be mandatory subjects of\n\nbargaining, resolving the issue seemingly left open in First Nat'l,\n\nand, if so, why, or whether it decided this case on its \"particular\n\nfacts,\" and, if so, what those facts were.                        Possibly, the Board\n\nattributed importance to the fact that the layoffs owed something\n\nto the loss of business due to the strike but, if so, this too is\n\n\n\n\n                                             -11-\n\funexplained, nor do we know how multiple motives for layoffs should\n\nbe analyzed.\n\n              The issue appears to be one of considerable importance.\n\nTo say that an employer must bargain about whether to make layoffs\n\ncaused   by    modernization      does   not    seem   far   from     saying,   in\n\nsubstance,     that   it   must   bargain      about   whether   to   modernize.\n\nPerhaps there is some reason to distinguish between the two, but it\n\nis easy to see how the two steps are linked in practice.                   Often\n\nenough, an employer who cannot recoup costs of modernizing by\n\nreducing employment will have little reason to invest.\n\n              In all events, we do not understand the Board's rationale\n\nfor classifying this case as one where the employer had (in the\n\nBoard's words) an \"obligation to bargain both over the decision\n\n[the layoffs] and its effects.\"             The result may or may not be\n\nsound, but until we understand its basis, we cannot effectively\n\nreview it.

Id.\n\n             Here, Pan American presented two primary objections to\n\nthe Board.5     First, Pan American contended that the ALJ erred in\n\nfinding an unfair labor practice, because the company had, in\n\nfact, given proper notice to the Union and showed its willingness\n\nto bargain, and it was the Union's recalcitrance, rather than any\n\nmisbehavior on Pan American's part, that prevented bargaining\n\n\n\n      5\n      The company also objected to a particular factual finding the\nALJ made: that certain former strikers made an offer to return to\nwork.

This objection, far from intimating that the\n\ncompany had no duty to bargain, assumes that there was such a\n\nduty.    Second, Pan American objected that the ALJ should not have\n\nrecommended a remedy of reinstatement and full back pay for the\n\nfifteen terminated employees.            I simply cannot agree with the\n\nmajority when it states, \"Before the Board, Pan American argued\n\nthat it did not have to bargain with the Union at all so no\n\nrelief was proper, but in the alternative it argued that at most\n\nits bargaining obligation was limited to the 'effects' of the\n\nlayoffs.\"         Slip   Op.   at   6.       This      statement   not     only\n\nmischaracterizes Pan American's arguments before the Board6 but\n\nassumes as plain fact what is actually a fervently contested\n\nissue in this case.\n\n            The    majority    finds      that   Pan     American's      second\n\nobjection, its challenge to the remedy, was sufficient to apprise\n\n\n     6\n      In its first exception, Pan American stated, \"Not only did\nRespondent give proper notice of the future layoffs to the Union,\nbut the latter failed to timely bargain over said issue, thus\nwaiving its right to do so.\" In its second exception, the company\nstated, \"[I]nasmuch as the record does show that the layoffs were\n[the result] of an employer's decision, based primarily on\noperational reasons as well as staffing needs, the determination\nwas related to the scope and direction of business and accordingly\nthe proper remedy would be that of a limited back pay.\" At best,\nthis second exception could be interpreted as raising the\nbargainability issue in a roundabout manner, and that is the\nargument the majority makes.    But it is simply not correct to\nimply, as the majority does, that Pan American raised this\nobjection directly and explicitly, for it did not.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fthe Board that the company would later argue that there was no\n\nduty    to    bargain       about   the     layoffs        in    the    first      place.      I\n\ndisagree.      As the majority recognizes, it is undoubtedly possible\n\nto infer a connection between the question of what kind of remedy\n\nis     appropriate      after       an     employer's           failure      to    engage     in\n\nstatutorily required bargaining and the question of the extent of\n\nthe employer's original duty to bargain.                          The connection arises\n\nfrom    the    fact     that    when       an    employer        violates         the   Act   by\n\nterminating employees without engaging in mandatory bargaining,\n\nthe Board's customary remedy is reinstatement and back pay for\n\nthe terminated employees.                See Saint-Gobain, 426 F.3d at 461.                   In\n\ncontrast,      when    an    employer      is    not   required         to    bargain      about\n\nterminating an employee, but must bargain only about the effects\n\nof   that     termination      (such       as    severance        packages),        the    Board\n\ngenerally imposes a more limited remedy, consisting of back pay\n\ndating       only    from     the   date        of   the    Board's          order,     without\n\nreinstatement.          See Transmarine Navigation Corp., 170 N.L.R.B.\n\n389, 390 (1968).             See also Bridon Cordage, Inc., 329 N.L.R.B.\n\n258, 259 n. 11 (1999) (explaining distinction).\n\n              Thus, the argument goes that a person versed in the\n\ntenets of labor law could infer that, because Pan American sought\n\na limited back pay remedy, the company believed such a remedy was\n\nappropriate         because    it    had        no   duty       to     bargain     about      its\n\n                                            -17-\n\funderlying   decision           to   terminate      the     employees.        I    believe,\n\nhowever, that this court should not have to infer the possible\n\nlegal arguments on which a party's complaints before the Board\n\nmight be based.        For one thing, the Board will be better able to\n\nadminister its work if parties are required to make explicit to\n\nthe Board the reasons for their objections.                          This is because,\n\nwithout   such    a    \"clear        statement      rule,\"    the    disposition      of   a\n\nparticular case will depend on the depths to which a particular\n\nappellate panel is willing to dig in order to uncover a plausible\n\nconnection between the language used in an objection before the\n\nBoard and a theory on which the court might disturb the Board's\n\norder.     What       is   more,      to   allow     parties    to    raise       imprecise\n\nobjections in the hopes of later striking gold with the appeals\n\ncourt    \"would   be       to   set    the    Board    up    for    one   ambush      after\n\nanother,\" Quazite v.

For example, in IUE, the court found that\nthe union had adequately raised the question of whether a remedy\napplied retroactively, even though the union's objections did not\nmention the word \"retroactive.\"         See 727 F.2d at 1193.\nNevertheless, the court's benchmark remained whether the objection\nprovided sufficient notice to the Board as to the contested issue.\nThe court found that \"in light of the union's objection to the\n\n                                             -18-\n\f           In this case, it is hardly certain that Pan American\n\nchallenged the ALJ's recommended remedy of reinstatement and back\n\npay out of the conviction that the company had no duty to bargain\n\nover the underlying management decision (although that is one\n\npossible   interpretation).     Another   interpretation,   at   least\n\nequally plausible, is that Pan American thought the order of\n\nreinstatement was improper because it no longer had the need for\n\nfifteen additional employees.    In fact, Pan American's notice of\n\nexceptions to the Board confirms that this was precisely the\n\ncompany's position:\n\n            [A] full back pay and reinstatement remedy is\n            not proper in this case inasmuch as it has\n            been proven that Respondent's operations does\n            not harbor the need for the 15 positions that\n            were eliminated as per the modernization and\n            automation of the plant, which resulted in\n            the employees' layoffs.\n\nJust as a general objection to \"the remedies set forth in the\n\n[ALJ's] decision\" does not suffice to raise a later appeal on the\n\ngrounds that the remedy was unduly punitive, see Saint-Gobain,\n\n\n\n\nremedy [and the context thereof]. . . it is inconceivable that the\nBoard did not understand that the union objected on retroactivity\ngrounds and that the union would raise the issue on appeal.\" Id.\nat 1193 (emphasis added). In contrast, in this case, it is far\nfrom inconceivable that the Board could have failed to discern from\nPan American's exceptions that the company intended to raise the\nbargaining issue on appeal. Rather, it is quite possible that Pan\nAmerican did not, in fact, have any such intention at the time of\nits objections before the Board.\n\n                                -19-\n\f426 F.3d at 459,8 Pan American's objection to the remedy imposed\n\nin this case, which could be interpreted in various ways, should\n\nnot suffice to preserve its current argument on appeal that the\n\nremedy   was   inappropriate   because      the       company    had   no   duty   to\n\nbargain.\n\n           I   note   that   this   is    not     a    case     \"[w]here    a   party\n\nexplicitly excepts to a remedy, and offers some explanation for\n\nits objection in its brief\" such that we might hold \"that there\n\nis sufficient notice to the Board to satisfy section 10(e).\"\n\nAlwin Mfg.

Cir. 1999).                        To\n\nthe contrary, in its brief replying to the NLRB General Counsel's\n\nanswer to its objections, Pan American merely reiterated its\n\nargument that the ALJ's remedy was unduly burdensome, stating,\n\n\"[T]he record stands to the fact that the operations at [the\n\nanimal feed production plant] currently do not need 15 additional\n\nemployees in order to operate.           Therefore, an order to reinstate\n\nthe 15 laid off employees . . . is . . . an undue burden on this\n\nparty's operations.\"     This is further evidence that Pan American\n\nwas not even attempting to raise the bargainability issue before\n\nthe Board.9\n\n     8\n      As we noted in Saint-Gobain, \"[t]here is no shortage of other\ncases to the same effect.\" See id. at 460 (collecting cases).\n     9\n     Moreover, the Board's opinion below is entirely consistent\nwith the reasonable view that Pan American's objections were\n\n                                    -20-\n\f          Our review might be different if resolution of the\n\nduty-to-bargain question were straightforward.      But here, the\n\nquestion is complicated and difficult to resolve, and the Board\n\nwould have been justified in concluding, as it evidently did,\n\nthat a party intending to raise the issue would have provided the\n\nBoard with developed argumentation in support of its position.\n\nAs the Supreme Court has said, an employer generally cannot take\n\nunilateral action regarding mandatory subjects of bargaining, but\n\nmust first bargain over them with the union.    NLRB v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106406\"><a href=\"/opinion/106406/nlrb-v-katz/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738-39 (1962).    Mandatory bargaining subjects include\n\n\"terms and conditions of employment.\"   29 U.S.C. § 158(d).   Thus,\n\n\n\n\nlimited to (a) an assertion that the company met its duty to\nbargain and that it was the Union who refused to cooperate, and (b)\na complaint that the company should not have to reinstate workers\nwhose labor Pan American felt it no longer needed. The Board's\nDecision   and   Order,  in   addition   to  adopting   the   ALJ's\nrecommendations, contained two holdings. First, the Board rejected\nPan American's contention that it complied with the Act by\nproviding the Union an opportunity to bargain. Second, the Board\nheld that, given that Pan American's decision to lay off employees\nwas a mandatory subject of bargaining, the remedy of full back pay\nand reinstatement was appropriate, rather than the limited remedy\nPan American had requested.      Although the Board's failure to\ndiscuss an issue does not necessarily indicate that a party has not\nadequately objected, see IUE, 727 F.2d at 1191, the fact that the\nBoard did not even mention a dispute about whether the layoffs were\nbargainable supports my conclusion that the issue, which is a\ncomplicated one, was not raised. In fact, Pan American's imprecise\nobjection \"may well account for the Board's failure to consider\nthis question in its decision and to make findings with respect to\nit,\" Marshall Field, 318 U.S. at 255, which the majority now\ninstructs the Board to do on remand.\n\n                               -21-\n\fan employer cannot unilaterally change employees' working hours\n\nor   pay   rate,    for   example,    without     first    bargaining      with   the\n\nunion.     Employer decisions such as layoffs, relocations of jobs,\n\nand plant closings, in contrast, are sometimes mandatory subjects\n\nof bargaining and sometimes not, depending on the reasons for the\n\ndecision    and    whether     the   issues     raised    by   the   decision     are\n\namenable to resolution through the bargaining process.                     See First\n\nNat'l Maint. Corp. v. NLRB, 452, U.S. 666, 678 (1981).                     The exact\n\nlocation of the line separating these two categories of employer\n\ndecisions is indistinct.         Compare, e.g., United Food & Commercial\n\nWorkers Int'l Union, Local 150-A v.

If Pan American wished to challenge the ALJ's finding\n\nthat it was required to bargain about the layoffs, it should have\n\nsaid so clearly.
