Richard G.

Jones on brief pro se.\n     Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and Eva M. Badway,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees Suffolk County\nDistrict Attorney and Suffolk County District Attorney's Office.\n     Kenneth J. Forton, Assistant Corporation Counsel, on brief for\nappellees, City of Boston, John Doe and John Foe.\n\n\n\n\n                              June 14, 2005\n\f                  Per Curiam.     Appellant Erick Jones appeals from the\n\ndismissal of his civil rights complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6) and the district court's denial of his motion to amend his\n\ncomplaint.         For the reasons given below, we affirm.\n\n                   Jones asserts that his federal and state malicious\n\nprosecution claims were timely and that he should have been allowed\n\nto amend his complaint to add related fact allegations.1                     As\n\nindicated below, however, Jones failed to plead specific facts\n\ntending to show that the state criminal proceedings terminated in\n\nhis favor.           As a result, his malicious prosecution claims are\n\nneither presently cognizable (they have not yet accrued), nor\n\nsubstantively viable (one of the prerequisites for that cause of\n\naction is lacking).2            Lambert v. Williams, 223 F.3d 257, 262 n.3\n\n(4th       Cir.    2000)   (discussing   significance   of   failure   to   show\n\nfavorable termination) (relying ultimately on Heck v. Humphrey, 512\n\nU.S. 477, 483-84 (1994)); Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (describing key elements of the common-law cause of\n\naction in Massachusetts).           Hence, we affirm.\n\n\n       1\n      On appeal, Jones concedes that his remaining claims were\nuntimely, and he does not challenge the court's conclusion that his\nsuit against the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office and\nassociated defendants was barred by immunity or otherwise.\n       2\n      For present purposes, we assume that Jones may assert a\nmalicious prosecution claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 based on the\nFourth Amendment. See Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46, 54 (1st\nCir. 2001) (stating that it is an \"open question\" whether the\nConstitution permits the assertion of such a claim)(citations\nomitted).\n\n                                         -2-\n\f            The complaint and proposed amendment thereto made only\n\nconclusory allegations on the favorable termination question.                 On\n\nappeal, Jones explains that the Commonwealth dismissed the criminal\n\ncharges against him, offering a state court docket summary in\n\nsupport.        But he does not allege facts that would permit an\n\ninference that the charges were dismissed because of his innocence\n\nor   the   Commonwealth's      lack    of    reasonable    grounds      for   the\n\nprosecution.       See Wynne v. Rosen, 391 Mass. 797, 800-01 (1984)\n\n(defining the circumstances when a state dismissal of charges\n\nconstitutes a favorable termination).            Moreover, the state court\n\ndocket indicates that the dismissal occurred after Jones completed\n\na period of pretrial probation under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 276, ยง 87.\n\nIf anything, this suggests that dismissal was a compromise solution\n\nas defendants maintain, in which neither party conceded guilt or\n\ninnocence.      See Commonwealth v. Tim T., 437 Mass. 592, 596 (2002)\n\n(describing the implications of pretrial probation when used as a\n\nprelude    to    dismissal).    A     disposition   of    this   kind    is   not\n\n\"favorable.\"      Wynne, 391 Mass. at 801 (agreeing that a dismissal\n\nbased on the parties' compromise bars a malicious prosecution\n\nclaim).\n\n                Jones acknowledges that his attorney assented to his\n\npretrial probation.       But he suggests that neither he nor his\n\nattorney were present at the dismissal hearing and \"thus\" did not\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fconsent to dismissal of the charges.3          An oblique contention of\n\nthis kind is an insufficient basis for a remand to the district\n\ncourt.     See Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (in evaluating a motion to dismiss, the court is\n\nnot       obliged   to   credit    \"bald      assertions,   periphrastic\n\ncircumlocutions,     [or]   unsubstantiated    conclusions\").   For   one\n\nthing, neither the original complaint nor the proposed amendment\n\nalleges affirmatively that Jones did not consent to the dismissal.\n\nIn addition, the course of events described in the state court\n\ndocket all tend to support the opposite conclusion that Jones\n\nacquiesced in the dismissal, if not directly, then through his\n\nattorney.      In any event, this indirect claim of lack of consent\n\ndoes not solve the basic flaw in this case -- Jones' failure to\n\nplead specific facts permitting the inference that the charges\n\nagainst him were dismissed because he was innocent and there were\n\nno reasonable grounds to prosecute him.4\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      The docket shows that Jones was not present at the dismissal\nhearing, but that his attorney was.     To the extent that Jones\nrelied on the docket for his claim that his attorney was not\npresent, he apparently misread the docket.\n      4\n      In fact, Jones' record appendix contains materials which\nseriously undermine his malicious prosecution claims. For example,\na grand jury transcript indicates that the grand jury had access to\na videotaped statement by Jones' alleged victim. Jones claimed\nthat the defendants had withheld that statement from the grand\njury.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
