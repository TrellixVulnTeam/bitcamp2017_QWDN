OSTRANDER, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                                  v.\n\n                   MICHAEL GARDNER AND ROY FURMAN,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n\n              APPEAL FROM THE BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL\n\n                         OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                      Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Melvin S. Hoffman, with whom Pamela A. Harbeson and Looney &\nGrossman LLP were on brief for appellants.\n     David W. Ostrander, with whom Ostrander Law Office was on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 16, 2007\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge. On December 11, 2003, Michael\n\nGardner and Roy Furman, while negotiating to acquire the assets of\n\nMillivision, Inc., loaned Millivision $500,000 with which to pay\n\nits essential debts and avoid an operational shutdown.                The next\n\nday,   Millivision’s     creditors   filed    an   involuntary   chapter    11\n\npetition. Unaware of the chapter 11 filing, Gardner and Furman did\n\nnot record a financing statement relating to their loan until\n\nDecember 16. The bankruptcy court permitted the chapter 11 trustee\n\nto invoke the \"strong-arm\" provision in Bankruptcy Code § 544(a) to\n\navoid the Gardner/Furman unrecorded, unperfected security interest\n\nin the chapter 11 debtor’s assets.           See In re Millivision, Inc.,\n\n331 B.R. 515, 522-23 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2005).                The Bankruptcy\n\nAppellate Panel summarily affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.\n\n           On appeal, Gardner and Furman contend, inter alia, that\n\nthe bankruptcy court’s decision (i) ignores explicit exceptions to\n\nthe trustee’s strong-arm power in Bankruptcy Code § 547(c) and (e),\n\nwhich would permit their December 16 recording to “relate back” to\n\nDecember 11; and (ii) offends the underlying equitable principles\n\nof the Bankruptcy Code by conferring a “windfall” cash infusion\n\nupon Millivision’s creditors.\n\n           We   affirm    the   bankruptcy     court’s   grant   of    summary\n\njudgment to the chapter 11 trustee.          The appellants’ argument that\n\n§ 547(c) and (e) are exceptions to § 544(b)’s avoidance provisions\n\nis foreclosed, since § 547(c) and (e) do not constitute “generally\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fapplicable   [relation-back]   law,”   11   U.S.C.   §   546(b).   See\n\nMillivision, 331 B.R. at 521; H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 371 (1977);\n\nS. Rep. No. 95-989, at 86 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n5787, 5872, 6327 (noting that § 546(b)’s reference to “generally\n\napplicable law” refers to “applicable nonbankruptcy law”) (emphasis\n\nadded); see also In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P’ship, 262 F.3d 1, 9-10\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); In re Moore, No. 06-01311, 2006 WL 3064781, at *2\n\n(Bankr. D. Ariz. Oct. 27, 2006) (noting that bankruptcy law does\n\nnot qualify as “generally applicable law”); In re Microfab, Inc.,\n\n105 B.R. 152, 156-57 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1989).\n\n          In addition, the bankruptcy court appropriately rejected\n\nappellant’s argument that the involuntary chapter 7 case did not\n\n“commence” on December 12, but on January 21, 2004, once an order\n\nfor relief had been entered.     See Millivision, 331 B.R. at 523\n\n(citing 11 U.S.C. § 303(b) (“An involuntary case against a person\n\nis commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition\n\nunder chapter 7 or 11 of this title.”)).\n\n          Finally, with respect to appellants' equitable arguments,\n\nthe bankruptcy court aptly noted that appellants could have avoided\n\ntheir predicament by the simple expedient of recording (thus\n\nperfecting) their security interest in the Millivision assets prior\n\nto advancing the $500,000, see id. at 523 n.15, particularly in\n\nlight of Millivision’s representation that it was so short on cash\n\nthat it might need to cease operations.      “Under long-established\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fprinciples,   petitioner's   lack   of    diligence   precludes   equity's\n\noperation.”   Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 419 (2005); see\n\nCresswell v. Sullivan & Cromwell, 922 F.2d 60, 71 (2d Cir. 1990)\n\n(“[I]n order to obtain the requested equitable relief, a plaintiff\n\nmust show ‘the absence of fault or negligence’ on his own part.”).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
