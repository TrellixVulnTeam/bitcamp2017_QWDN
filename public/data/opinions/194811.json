United States, 371 U.S. 471, 484-86\n                                      \n\n(1963).  We find neither argument convincing.\n\n          The basic facts are the following:\n\n          1.   On  March 20,  1991, a  trained drug-sniffing\n               dog alerted  customs agents  at the  San Juan\n               airport  to the  likely  presence of  illegal\n               drugs  in  several  suitcases  tagged  for  a\n               flight to New York.\n\n          2.   The  agents  put  the  suitcases   through  a\n               Department of Agriculture x-ray machine.  The\n               x-ray revealed several  packages within  that\n               appeared as if they could contain cocaine.\n\n          3.   Using  the  suitcase's luggage  tags (bearing\n               the name  \"Luis  Garcia\"), agents  found  the\n               suitcases' owner, namely  the appellant,  who\n               was sitting  in the New  York bound airplane,\n               which  had not  yet  taken off.   The  agents\n               asked  appellant  to accompany  them  off the\n               airplane, and soon after arrested him.\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\n          4.   One  of  the agents  brought  appellant to  a\n               special customs room, about nine feet by nine\n               feet  in   size.     He  handcuffed  one   of\n               appellant's  hands to a  chair, and  left the\n               door  open.     He  gave   appellant  Miranda\n                                                            \n               warnings, and then began to question him.\n\n          5.   Appellant consented to  a search of  his hand\n               luggage, in  which  the agent  found  luggage\n               claim  checks that matched the suitcase tags.\n               Appellant  also  emptied  his pockets,  which\n               contained  identification  bearing  his  real\n               name,  thereby revealing  that  the  name  of\n               \"Luis Garcia\" written on  the luggage tag was\n               a false name.  \n\n          6.   After  some time  had passed  (perhaps  a few\n               minutes,  but certainly  less than  an hour),\n               the  agent brought  the  suitcases  into  the\n               room, told  appellant about \"the  dog search,\n               the dog  alert\" and \"the x-ray  machine,\" and\n               asked if  he could  open the suitcases.   The\n               appellant  (who,  according  to   the  agent,\n               simply  said \"yes\") \"shrugged  by lifting his\n               shoulders  as  if  admitting  defeat,\"  which\n               action, the district court found, amounted to\n               \"consent.\"   The  agent opened  the suitcases\n               and found the cocaine.\n\n          Appellant does  not now deny that  he consented to\n\nthe  suitcase search;  rather, he  says that  the government\n\n\"coerced\" this consent.   The district court, however, found\n\nto the contrary, and  we must affirm this finding  unless it\n\nis  clearly erroneous.    See, e.g.,  United States  v. Cruz\n                                                            \n\nJim nez, 894 F.2d  1, 7 (1st Cir.  1990).  According to  the\n       \n\nrecord, the appellant was simply questioned by one agent for\n\nless   than  an   hour,  after   Miranda  warnings,   in  an\n                                        \n\napproximately eighty square foot  room with an open  door --\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nalbeit while appellant was  sitting with one hand handcuffed\n\nto  a   chair.     Despite  the  handcuff,   however,  these\n\ncircumstances  fall within  the bounds  of what  courts have\n\ndeemed  valid and  \"voluntary\" consent.   See,  e.g., United\n                                                            \n\nStates v.  Watson, 423 U.S.  411, 424 (1976)  (custody alone\n                 \n\ndoes not  demonstrate  coerced consent  to  search);  United\n                                                            \n\nStates  v. Arango-Correa, 851 F.2d  54, 57-58 (2d Cir. 1988)\n                        \n\n(where   Miranda   warnings   given,  normal   tone-of-voice\n                \n\nquestioning  by  several agents  over  five  hours does  not\n\ndemonstrate  coerced  consent   to  search,  despite   strip\n\nsearch). Cf.  Shriner v. Wainwright, 715  F.2d 1452, 1455-56\n                                   \n\n(11th Cir. 1983), cert. denied,  465 U.S. 1051 (1984) (where\n                              \n\nMiranda   warnings  given,  handcuffs   and  ten   hours  of\n       \n\ndetention,  including five  hours of  intensive questioning,\n\ndoes  not demonstrate that confession was coerced); Stawicki\n                                                            \n\nv. Israel, 778 F.2d  380 (7th Cir. 1985), cert.  denied, 479\n                                                       \n\nU.S.  842 (1986) (where  Miranda warnings given,  5 1/2 hour\n                                \n\ndetention including 1 1/2  hour interrogation did not render\n\nconfession coerced). \n\n          Appellant's  second argument --  the \"fruit of the\n\npoisonous tree\"  -- presents  a somewhat closer  question of\n\nfact, though not  of law.   As in the  very similar case  of\n\nUnited States v. Maldonado-Espinosa,  968 F.2d 101, 103 (1st\n                                   \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nCir. 1992), cert.  denied, 113  S.Ct. 1579  (1993), we  will\n                         \n\nassume without deciding (as did the district court) that the\n\nluggage x-ray was unlawful.  If  the cocaine proves to be  a\n\n\"fruit\" of  that x-ray (i.e., if the  x-ray caused appellant\n                            \n\nto consent  to the  search), then,  given the  assumption we\n\nhave indulged, the law requires its suppression.   Wong Sun,\n                                                           \n\n371 U.S. at 484-86.\n\n          We  concede that the district court's opinion does\n\nnot explicitly  deny a  causal connection between  the x-ray\n              \n\nand appellant's consent.  Yet that  opinion does ask whether\n\nthis  consent   was  the   \"fruit  of  a   poisonous  tree.\"\n\nFurthermore, the  opinion found  the dog  sniffing to  be \"a\n\nlawful   act\"  which  provided  \"an  independent  legitimate\n\nreason\"  for seeking  consent.   Lastly, it  says that  \"the\n\ngovernment cannot use  the x-ray evidence .  . . as a  basis\n\nfor obtaining . .  . consent,\" and that the  (\"unlawful\") x-\n\nray \"results must be suppressed  . . . .\"  Fairly  read, the\n\nopinion indicates  that the  court asked, and  answered, the\n\ncorrect  causal  question in  deciding  whether  to suppress\n\nevidence of consent.\n\n          We also  concede that  the factual question  was a\n\nclose one.  On one hand, the agent's telling appellant about\n\nthe x-ray suggests that the x-ray might have played a causal\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nrole in producing consent.  On the other hand, the dog sniff\n\nalone  provided  the  agents  with  sufficient  grounds  for\n\nobtaining a search  warrant (had they found  it necessary to\n\ndo so), and for seeking appellant's consent.  United  States\n                                                            \n\nv. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 5 (1989); United States v. Race, 529\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 12, 15  (1st Cir.  1976).  Given  this legal fact,  the\n\ncombined factors apart  from the x-ray search -- the agent's\n\ndescription of the dog's  reaction, the baggage tags linking\n\nappellant to the suitcases,  and the discovery of the  false\n\nname --  might well  have convinced appellant  that refusing\n\nconsent  was  pointless,  for   the  bags  would  be  opened\n\neventually anyway.  \n\n          While the factual question on appeal is close, the\n\nlegal  question is  not.   Here again,  the law  directs the\n\ndistrict  court,   not   this   court,   to   make   factual\n\ndeterminations.  How  appellant's mind worked at the time --\n\nwhether  or  not  the  x-ray  significantly  influenced  his\n\ndecision to  consent --  is one such  factual determination.\n\nIn light of the evidence presented to the district court, we\n\ncannot  find  its  conclusion  to  be  \"clearly  erroneous.\"\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (\"Findings of fact . . . shall not be set\n\naside  unless clearly  erroneous,  and due  regard shall  be\n\ngiven  to the opportunity of the district court to judge the\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\ncredibility of the witnesses\").  We therefore reach the same\n\nlegal conclusion  we reached in Maldonado,  which affirmed a\n                                         \n\ndistrict court's determination that  an illegal x-ray search\n\ndid  not play  a significant  role in  obtaining appellant's\n\nconsent  to search his luggage.  There, as here, agents told\n\nappellant  about a  dog  sniff, which  by itself  could have\n\ninduced appellant to accede to the search.  And, we affirmed\n\na district court's determination  that it did so. Maldonado,\n                                                           \n\n968 F.2d at 103-04.  Cf. United States v. Race, 529 F.2d 12,\n                                              \n\n14-15  (1st Cir. 1976) (consent to search of air cargo found\n\nto  contain marijuana was  not tainted by  agent's prior and\n\narguably illegal inspection of  cargo, where dog sniff alone\n\nprovided ample motive to seek consent of cargo's owner).  In\n\nlight of the findings  of fact and the legal  precedent, the\n\ndistrict court judgment is\n\n          Affirmed. \n                  \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n",

The  agents\n               asked  appellant  to accompany  them  off the\n               airplane, and soon after arrested him.\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\n          4.   One  of  the agents  brought  appellant to  a\n               special customs room, about nine feet by nine\n               feet  in   size.     He  handcuffed  one   of\n               appellant's  hands to a  chair, and  left the\n               door  open.     He  gave   appellant  Miranda\n                                                            \n               warnings, and then began to question him.\n\n          5.   Appellant consented to  a search of  his hand\n               luggage, in  which  the agent  found  luggage\n               claim  checks that matched the suitcase tags.\n               Appellant  also  emptied  his pockets,  which\n               contained  identification  bearing  his  real\n               name,  thereby revealing  that  the  name  of\n               \"Luis Garcia\" written on  the luggage tag was\n               a false name.  \n\n          6.   After  some time  had passed  (perhaps  a few\n               minutes,  but certainly  less than  an hour),\n               the  agent brought  the  suitcases  into  the\n               room, told  appellant about \"the  dog search,\n               the dog  alert\" and \"the x-ray  machine,\" and\n               asked if  he could  open the suitcases.   The\n               appellant  (who,  according  to   the  agent,\n               simply  said \"yes\") \"shrugged  by lifting his\n               shoulders  as  if  admitting  defeat,\"  which\n               action, the district court found, amounted to\n               \"consent.\"   The  agent opened  the suitcases\n               and found the cocaine.\n\n          Appellant does  not now deny that  he consented to\n\nthe  suitcase search;  rather, he  says that  the government\n\n\"coerced\" this consent.   The district court, however, found\n\nto the contrary, and  we must affirm this finding  unless it\n\nis  clearly erroneous.    See, e.g.,  United States  v. Cruz\n                                                            \n\nJim nez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535250\"><a href=\"/opinion/535250/united-states-v-jose-m-cruz-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir.  1990).  According to  the\n       \n\nrecord, the appellant was simply questioned by one agent for\n\nless   than  an   hour,  after   Miranda  warnings,   in  an\n                                        \n\napproximately eighty square foot  room with an open  door --\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nalbeit while appellant was  sitting with one hand handcuffed\n\nto  a   chair.

If  the cocaine proves to be  a\n\n\"fruit\" of  that x-ray (i.e., if the  x-ray caused appellant\n                            \n\nto consent  to the  search), then,  given the  assumption we\n\nhave indulged, the law requires its suppression.   Wong Sun,\n                                                           \n\n371 U.S. at 484-86.\n\n          We  concede that the district court's opinion does\n\nnot explicitly  deny a  causal connection between  the x-ray\n              \n\nand appellant's consent.  Yet that  opinion does ask whether\n\nthis  consent   was  the   \"fruit  of  a   poisonous  tree.\"\n\nFurthermore, the  opinion found  the dog  sniffing to  be \"a\n\nlawful   act\"  which  provided  \"an  independent  legitimate\n\nreason\"  for seeking  consent.   Lastly, it  says that  \"the\n\ngovernment cannot use  the x-ray evidence .  . . as a  basis\n\nfor obtaining . .  . consent,\" and that the  (\"unlawful\") x-\n\nray \"results must be suppressed  . . . .\"  Fairly  read, the\n\nopinion indicates  that the  court asked, and  answered, the\n\ncorrect  causal  question in  deciding  whether  to suppress\n\nevidence of consent.\n\n          We also  concede that  the factual question  was a\n\nclose one.  On one hand, the agent's telling appellant about\n\nthe x-ray suggests that the x-ray might have played a causal\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nrole in producing consent.  On the other hand, the dog sniff\n\nalone  provided  the  agents  with  sufficient  grounds  for\n\nobtaining a search  warrant (had they found  it necessary to\n\ndo so), and for seeking appellant's consent.

Given  this legal fact,  the\n\ncombined factors apart  from the x-ray search -- the agent's\n\ndescription of the dog's  reaction, the baggage tags linking\n\nappellant to the suitcases,  and the discovery of the  false\n\nname --  might well  have convinced appellant  that refusing\n\nconsent  was  pointless,  for   the  bags  would  be  opened\n\neventually anyway.  \n\n          While the factual question on appeal is close, the\n\nlegal  question is  not.   Here again,  the law  directs the\n\ndistrict  court,   not   this   court,   to   make   factual\n\ndeterminations.  How  appellant's mind worked at the time --\n\nwhether  or  not  the  x-ray  significantly  influenced  his\n\ndecision to  consent --  is one such  factual determination.\n\nIn light of the evidence presented to the district court, we\n\ncannot  find  its  conclusion  to  be  \"clearly  erroneous.\"\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (\"Findings of fact . . . shall not be set\n\naside  unless clearly  erroneous,  and due  regard shall  be\n\ngiven  to the opportunity of the district court to judge the\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\ncredibility of the witnesses\").  We therefore reach the same\n\nlegal conclusion  we reached in Maldonado,  which affirmed a\n                                         \n\ndistrict court's determination that  an illegal x-ray search\n\ndid  not play  a significant  role in  obtaining appellant's\n\nconsent  to search his luggage.  There, as here, agents told\n\nappellant  about a  dog  sniff, which  by itself  could have\n\ninduced appellant to accede to the search.  And, we affirmed\n\na district court's determination  that it did so. Maldonado,\n                                                           \n\n968 F.2d at 103-04.  Cf. United States v.
