Palomares on brief for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, H.S.\nGarcia, United States Attorney, Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant United\nStates Attorney, and German A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        September 15, 2005\n\f          Per Curiam.       After drugs and guns were seized from\n\ndefendant's house pursuant to his arrest for a local probation\n\nviolation, he was indicted on one count of possessing with intent\n\nto distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and\n\none count of possessing a firearm, including a \"Ruger Mini 14\n\nsemiautomatic   assault   rifle   with   a   black   pistol   grip   and    a\n\nstainless steel folding stock,\" in furtherance of the marijuana\n\noffense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).1          Defendant pled\n\nguilty to those two counts.       In this appeal from his sentence,\n\ndefendant challenges (1) the imposition of a 10-year mandatory\n\nminimum sentence on the assault-weapon charge and (2) the alleged\n\ndelegation to the probation department of the determination of the\n\nnumber of drug tests he must take while on supervised release.\n\nFinding no merit to these challenges, we affirm.\n\n          Defendant's first argument concerning his sentence on the\n\nassault-weapon count is that he was entitled to have a jury\n\ndetermine, beyond a reasonable doubt, whether he possessed an\n\n\"assault weapon\" within the meaning of the applicable statute.             In\n\nsupport of that argument in the district court, he relied on\n\nCastillo v. United States, 530 U.S. 120 (2000), which held, as a\n\n\n     1\n      At all times pertinent here, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(B)(i)\nprovided a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for possessing a\n\"semiautomatic assault weapon\" in furtherance of a drug trafficking\ncrime, Pub. L. No. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796, § 110102(c) (1994).\nThat and the other statutory references to \"semiautomatic assault\nweapons\" cited below were repealed effective September 13, 2004.\nId. § 110105(2).\n\n                                  -2-\n\fmatter of statutory construction, that the references to firearm\n\ntypes in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) define a separate crime (rather than\n\na sentencing factor) that must be proven to a jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.      530 U.S. at 131.     On appeal, he also relies on\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), for the proposition\n\nthat a jury determination on that issue was constitutionally\n\nrequired.2\n\n             The   short   answer   to   defendant's   claim   that   he   was\n\nentitled to a jury determination on the assault-weapon issue--\n\neither on statutory or on constitutional grounds--is that he waived\n\nhis right to jury consideration of that issue by pleading guilty.\n\nUnited States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Although his counsel reserved the right to argue at\n\nsentencing that the Ruger rifle is not an \"assault rifle\" and is\n\nexempt from the applicable statute,           that reservation, taken in\n\ncontext, at most reserved those issues to be decided by a judge at\n\nsentencing, not by a jury.          As the Supreme Court recognized in\n\nBlakely itself: \"When a defendant pleads guilty, the [government]\n\nis free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      In a post-briefing motion to remand, defendant argued that\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), also requires that\nthe firearm type be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, but\nhe declined this court's invitation to submit a supplemental brief\non that issue. His Booker claim is therefore waived. See United\nStates v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d 511, 534 n.7 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdefendant . . . consents to judicial factfinding,\" Blakely, 124 S.\n\nCt. at 2541, which is what occurred here.\n\n           Defendant's next assault-weapon challenge is that the\n\njudge made no finding that the Ruger 14 was an \"assault weapon.\"3\n\nThat contention is defeated by the record.            After listening to\n\ndefendant's objections to the finding, contained in the presentence\n\ninvestigation report, that the Ruger 14 had the characteristics of\n\na   semiautomatic   assault   weapon    set   forth   in   the   statutory\n\ndefinition, the court expressly found \"that at [the] time of the\n\narrest the defendant possessed a Ruger mini 14 semiautomatic\n\nassault weapon [and that] . . . this particular weapon did have the\n\ncharacteristics of an assault weapon for purposes of the statute.\"\n\n           Contrary to defendant's next contention, that finding was\n\namply supported by the evidence in the record, including a report\n\nof the Firearms Technology Branch of the United States Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that the Ruger Mini 14 \"accepts a\n\ndetachable magazine and has a folding stock and a pistol grip that\n\nprotrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon.\"          After\n\nconducting her own investigation, the probation officer reached the\n\nsame conclusions.\n\n\n\n     3\n      \"Semiautomatic assault weapon\" is defined to include \"a\nsemiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a detachable\nmagazine and has at least 2 of--(i) a folding or telescoping stock;\n(ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action\nof the weapon;\" and three other characteristics not relevant here.\n18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30) (1994).\n\n                                  -4-\n\f              The only evidence purportedly to the contrary is a\n\nconclusory statement by defendant's expert that the \"conventional\n\ndesign[] of the mini 14 Sturm Ruger does not represent an assault\n\nweapon.\"       However,    even   if   true,   that   statement     is    rendered\n\nirrelevant by the probation officer's uncontested finding that the\n\nweapon had been altered from its original design to include the\n\nrequisite characteristics.\n\n              Finally,    defendant     challenges     the   district      court's\n\nrejection of his argument that his possession of the weapon was\n\nexempt from liability under section 924(c)(1) because the weapon\n\nwas manufactured before the enactment of the assault weapon ban in\n\n1994.      In support of that argument, defendant relies on 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(v)(2), which exempts from the ban on simple possession of a\n\nsemiautomatic assault weapon, 18 U.S.C. § 922(v)(1), weapons that\n\nwere lawfully possessed before enactment of the ban.                     Defendant\n\nargues that section 922(v)(2), the so-called \"grandfather\" clause,\n\nexempts him from prosecution for possessing a pre-ban assault\n\nweapon in furtherance of a drug offense under section 924(c)(1).\n\nHowever, as other courts have recognized, the most sensible reading\n\nof   the    grandfather    clause,     consistent     with   its   language    and\n\npurpose, is to create an exception for pre-ban weapons only with\n\nrespect to the separate crime of simple possession of such weapons\n\nunder § 922(v)(2).       United States v. Ray, 411 F.3d 900, 905-06 (8th\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fCir. 2005); United States v. Vega, 392 F.3d 1281, 1282-83 (11th\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam).\n\n             The only remaining claim raised by defendant on appeal is\n\nthat the district court impermissibly delegated to the probation\n\ndepartment the determination of the maximum number of drug tests\n\nthe defendant would have to take while on supervised release.               The\n\nshort    answer    to   that   contention    is   that   no   such   delegation\n\noccurred.4        Rather,   the   district   court   itself    required   that\n\ndefendant submit to random drug testing \"not to exceed 104 samples\n\nper year.\"     Although the written judgment--stating that defendant\n\nmust submit to \"at least two\" drug tests after his initial one--\n\ndiffers from that oral pronouncement, the oral version controls.\n\nUnited States v. Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79, 96 n.26 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court\n\nfor the sole purpose of modifying the drug-testing condition set\n\nforth in the written judgment to conform to the condition stated\n\norally at sentencing. In all other respects, the district court's\n\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Because there was no delegation error here, we need not\ndetermine whether this unpreserved claim satisfies the plain error\nstandard articulated in United States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211 (1st\nCir. 2005)(en banc).\n\n                                      -6-\n\f",

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004), for the proposition that a jury determination on that issue was constitutionally required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to defendant's claim that he was entitled to a jury determination on the assault&#8212;weapon issue&#8212; either on statutory or on constitutional grounds&#8212;is that he waived his right to jury consideration of that issue by pleading guilty. <i>United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201470\"><a href=\"/opinion/201470/united-states-v-serrano-beauvaix/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although his counsel reserved the right to argue at sentencing that the Ruger rifle is not an \"assault rifle\" and is exempt from the applicable statute, that reservation, taken in context, at most reserved those issues to be decided by a judge at sentencing, not by a jury. As the Supreme Court recognized in <i>Blakely</i> itself: \"When a defendant pleads guilty, the [government] is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the defendant . . . consents to judicial factfinding,\" <i>Blakely,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2541, which is what occurred here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's next assault-weapon challenge is that the judge made no finding that the Ruger 14 was an \"assault weapon.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That contention is defeated by the record. After listening to defendant's objections to the finding, contained in the presentence investigation report, that the Ruger 14 had the characteristics of a semiautomatic assault weapon set forth in the statutory definition, the court expressly found \"that at [the] time of the arrest the defendant possessed a Ruger mini 14 semiautomatic assault weapon [and that] . . . this particular weapon did have the characteristics of an assault weapon for purposes of the statute.\" Contrary to defendant's next contention, that finding was amply supported by the evidence in the record, including a report of the Firearms Technology Branch of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that the Ruger Mini 14 \"accepts a detachable magazine and has a folding stock and a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon.\" After conducting her own investigation, the probation officer reached the same conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only evidence purportedly to the contrary is a conclusory statement by defendant's expert that the \"conventional design[] of the mini 14 Sturm Ruger does not represent an assault weapon.\" However, even if true, that statement is rendered irrelevant by the probation officer's uncontested finding that the weapon had been altered from its original design to include the requisite characteristics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant challenges the district court's rejection of his argument that his possession of the weapon was exempt from liability under section 924(c)(1) because the weapon was manufactured before the enactment of the assault weapon ban in 1994. In support of that argument, defendant relies on 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(v)(2), which exempts from the ban on simple possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(v)(1), weapons that were lawfully possessed before enactment of the ban. Defendant argues that section 922(v)(2), the so-called \"grandfather\" clause, exempts him from prosecution for possessing a pre-ban assault weapon in furtherance of a drug offense under section 924(c)(1). However, as other courts have recognized, the most sensible reading of the grandfather clause, consistent with its language and purpose, is to create an exception for pre-ban weapons only with respect to the separate crime of simple possession of such weapons under &#167; 922(v)(2). <i>United States v. Ray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790638\"><a href=\"/opinion/790638/united-states-v-charles-william-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span>, 905-06 (8th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Vega,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></span>, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining claim raised by defendant on appeal is that the district court impermissibly delegated to the probation department the determination of the maximum number of drug tests the defendant would have to take while on supervised release. The short answer to that contention is that no such delegation occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Rather, the district court itself required that defendant submit to random drug testing \"not to exceed 104 samples per year.\" Although the written judgment&#8212;stating that defendant must submit to \"at least two\" drug tests after his initial one&#8212; differs from that oral pronouncement, the oral version controls. <i>United States v.

No. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796, &#167; 110102(c) (1994). That and the other statutory references to \"semiautomatic assault weapons\" cited below were repealed effective September 13, 2004<i>Id.</i> &#167; 110105(2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In a post-briefing motion to remand, defendant argued that<i>United States v.
