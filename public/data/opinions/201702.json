Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                             Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Christopher R. Goddu, Assistant Federal Defender on brief for\nappellant.\n     Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant\nU.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               July 15, 2005\n\f     Per Curiam.      Ulises Matos appeals from a sentence imposed\n\nfollowing his guilty plea to seven drug trafficking and firearm\n\ncounts.    He was sentenced as a career offender at the low end of\n\nthe applicable guideline sentencing range, as recommended by the\n\ngovernment pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement.           In his\n\noriginal brief, Matos argued that his sentence was invalid under\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), because the facts that\n\nqualified him as a career offender had not been submitted to a jury\n\nand proved beyond a reasonable doubt.            While his appeal was\n\npending, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005).         At our invitation, the parties\n\nfiled supplemental briefs in light of Booker.        Matos concedes that\n\nthe Blakely/Booker issues he raises on appeal were not preserved\n\nbelow.    Having considered his argument, we conclude that he failed\n\nto   satisfy    the   standard   set    forth   in   United   States    v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     We turn to the dispositive issue: whether Matos has shown that\n\nthere is a \"reasonable probability that the district court would\n\nimpose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under\n\nthe new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\" Id. at 75.               The\n\ncomments made by the district court at sentencing work against\n\nMatos' claim.     The sentencing court found that Matos' criminal\n\nhistory was \"way off the charts\" and that his conduct in this case\n\nwas \"particularly heinous.\"      It specifically determined that the\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fsentence imposed was not too harsh, and that the government would\n\nhave been justified in recommending a \"much higher sentence.\"   In\n\nimposing sentence, the court stated that \"such a lengthy term is\n\nnecessary in order to incapacitate this career drug dealer and to\n\nprotect society from him.\"\n\n     In light of those statements by the sentencing court, Matos'\n\nreliance upon studies critical of the career offender guideline\n\nprovision and his new claims of a troubled upbringing (directly\n\ncontradicting his recounting of his childhood as reported in the\n\npresentence investigation report) are insufficient to demonstrate\n\na \"reasonable probability\" that he would receive a more lenient\n\nsentence under the new advisory guidelines regime.\n\n     Matos' sentence is affirmed.
