This appeal and cross-appeal\n\nrequire us to determine how our recent ruling in Kristian v.\n\nComcast,      Corp.,    446    F.3d   25   (1st    Cir.   2006)      –    in   which   we\n\ndetermined       that     specific     provisions      of     Comcast's        standard\n\narbitration agreement with its cable customers had to be severed\n\nfrom the agreement because they prevented its customers from\n\nvindicating rights in the arbitral forum provided for in state and\n\nfederal antitrust statutes – applies to consumer claims that Carl\n\nAnderson brings against Comcast, which seeks to compel arbitration\n\nunder the same arbitration agreement.1                 In pursuing his claims,\n\nAnderson invoked the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9 (\"Chapter 93A\"), and various common law tort\n\ntheories. Citing Kristian, the district court granted Comcast's\n\nmotion to compel arbitration but only after severing provisions in\n\nthe arbitration agreement prohibiting attorney's fees, double or\n\ntreble damages and a class action remedy in the arbitral forum.                        It\n\nalso       specified    that   \"the   arbitrator      will    have       the   power   to\n\ndetermine the validity and applicability of the agreement's one-\n\nyear statute of limitations.\"\n\n               After carefully analyzing the alleged conflicts between\n\nthe    language    of    the   arbitration        agreement   and        the   statutory\n\n\n\n       1\n       The arbitration agreement is contained within provisions\neight to ten of a larger standard agreement entitled \"Notice to\nCustomers Regarding Policies, Complaint Procedures & Dispute\nResolution.\"\n\n                                           -3-\n\fprovisions at issue under the framework established in Kristian, we\n\nconclude that only the conflict relating to the limitations period\n\nraises a question of arbitrability for the court to decide.                We\n\ntherefore    vacate   that    portion    of   the   district   court's   order\n\ncompelling arbitration of the applicability of the contractual\n\nlimitations    period,       and   we    conclude   that   the    contractual\n\nlimitations period is invalid as it relates to Anderson's Chapter\n\n93A claim.    However, that clause of the arbitration agreement is\n\nseverable under the terms of the agreement; we therefore affirm the\n\norder compelling arbitration of Anderson's claims, absent that\n\nlimitations clause.      We also reverse that portion of the district\n\ncourt's order severing the agreement's class action provision and\n\nits bar on multiple damages awards.           Those provisions did not pose\n\nquestions of arbitrability.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            The facts in this case are undisputed.         Carl Anderson, a\n\nMassachusetts resident, has been a cable service customer of\n\nComcast Corporation since at least May 31, 1994.               Until 2002, he\n\nleased a cable converter box and remote control in connection with\n\nhis cable subscription even though he owned a cable-ready televison\n\nor video cassette recorder. These unnecessary items were billed to\n\nhim at approximately $4.30 per month.\n\n            In November 2005, Anderson filed a putative class action\n\nin Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that the imposition of\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fmonthly    rental      fees      on    customers      with    cable-ready     equipment\n\nviolated Chapter 93A, in addition to violating general common law\n\ntort and contract law principles.                  Chapter 93A provides a cause of\n\naction to consumers who have been injured by an \"[u]nfair method[]\n\nof competition [or] unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\n\nconduct of any trade or commerce,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2.\n\nMassachusetts courts have interpreted the terms of Chapter 93A\n\nbroadly to include practices that \"fall[] 'within at least the\n\npenumbra   of     some      common-law,       statutory,      or   other    established\n\nconcept of unfairness.'\" Lambert v. Fleet Nat'l Bank, 865 N.E.2d\n\n1091, 1097 (Mass. 2007) (quoting Wasserman v. Agnastopoulos, 497\n\nN.E.2d 19, 23 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986)).                  While asserting no federal\n\ncauses of action, Anderson grounds his Chapter 93A unfair trade\n\npractice       claim   on       allegations    that     Comcast:      (1)   violated   a\n\nprovision of the Federal Communications Act requiring that \"[a]\n\ncable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or\n\nequipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by\n\nname,\"    47    U.S.C.      §    543(f),2     and    (2)     failed   to    comply   with\n\nregulations       issued        by    the   Federal    Communications        Commission\n\nrequiring cable providers to unscramble their basic programming\n\nsignals so they can be received by customers with cable-ready\n\n\n\n     2\n       The statute further states that \"a subscriber's failure to\nrefuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or\nequipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such\nservice or equipment.\" 47 U.S.C. § 543(f).\n\n                                             -5-\n\fequipment,     47    C.F.R.      §    76.630(a).        For    the   statutory    claim,\n\nAnderson seeks treble damages and attorney's fees; for the common\n\nlaw   claims,       he   seeks       actual    damages,       punitive   damages,   and\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.\n\n             Shortly after Anderson filed his action, Comcast filed an\n\nunopposed petition for removal to federal court on the basis of\n\ndiversity.3         Once   in    federal       court,   Comcast      moved   to   compel\n\narbitration under the arbitration agreement, which states in part:\n\n             IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE INFORMALLY ANY\n             CLAIM OR DISPUTE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF\n             THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED, WE\n             HAVE AGREED TO BINDING ARBITRATION EXCEPT AS\n             PROVIDED BELOW.4\n\nIn addition to requiring customers to arbitrate their disputes with\n\nComcast, the agreement requires that customers contact Comcast\n\nwithin a year of injury or waive any claim based on that injury; it\n\nrequires customers to pay certain costs of arbitration, including\n\ntheir attorney's fees;5 and it precludes arbitration on a class\n\n\n      3\n       Comcast is a corporation organized under Pennsylvania law,\nwith its principal place of business in Pennsylvania. Anderson is\na citizen of Massachusetts.\n      4\n       The original text of the arbitration agreement is all in\ncapital letters. Throughout this opinion, when we reproduce text\nfrom   the  arbitration   agreement,  we   will  reproduce   its\ncapitalization scheme as well.\n      5\n          The relevant language of the arbitration agreement states:\n\n      The Company will pay for all reasonable arbitration\n      filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses, except\n      that YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS THAT YOU INCUR IN\n      THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR\n\n                                              -6-\n\faction basis and denies customers who prevail in arbitration\n\nmultiple       or   punitive        damages.      Despite     setting     extensive\n\nlimitations on a customer's recovery, the contract contains various\n\nclauses severing any terms that conflict with applicable law.\n\n               Anderson objected to the motion, arguing that arbitration\n\nunder    the    terms   of    the    agreement    would     effectively    deny   to\n\nplaintiffs the ability to vindicate their statutory and common law\n\nrights.    The district court, relying heavily on the framework and\n\nanalysis of Kristian v. Comcast, Corp., 446 F.3d 25 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), granted Comcast's motion to compel arbitration, but only\n\nafter     determining        that     the    agreement's     provisions    barring\n\nattorney's fees,6 class actions, and multiple damages were \"invalid\n\nand severed\" as they related to Anderson's Chapter 93A claim.\n\nHowever, it held that the arbitrator had authority to determine\n\nwhether the agreement's limitations period prevented Anderson from\n\nvindicating his statutory claim under Chapter 93A.\n\n               In its appeal, Comcast argues that the district court\n\nerred in concluding that the arbitration agreement's bar on class\n\nactions and multiple damages awards were invalid as they related to\n\nAnderson's Chapter 93A claim, and it urges us to reverse that\n\nportion of the district court's order severing these provisions\n\n\n\n     EXPERT WITNESSES OR ATTORNEYS.\n     6\n       Comcast does not appeal from the district court's ruling on\nattorney's fees.\n\n                                            -7-\n\ffrom the arbitration agreement.             Anderson cross-appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's order compelling arbitration, arguing that – while\n\nthe court correctly found particular provisions of the arbitration\n\nagreement invalid as they relate to his claims – the court should\n\nhave found the entire arbitration agreement unconscionable and\n\ntherefore    unenforceable.7         In    addition,      he    cross-appeals       the\n\ndistrict court's ruling that the validity of the arbitration\n\nagreement's one-year limitations period should be determined by the\n\narbitrator.      He argues instead that the conflict between that\n\nlimitations    period     and    Chapter        93A's    four-year        statute   of\n\nlimitations creates a direct conflict that must be resolved by the\n\ncourt in favor of the longer statutory period.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            We consider these claims against the backdrop of a strong\n\npro-arbitration policy expressed by Congress and repeatedly upheld\n\nby the courts.    The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the\n\nFederal   Arbitration     Act,   9   U.S.C.      §§     1-16,   as   an    effort   to\n\n\"revers[e]    centuries     of    judicial        hostility       to      arbitration\n\nagreements, . . .       to allow parties to avoid 'the costliness and\n\ndelays of litigation,' and to place arbitration agreements 'upon\n\nthe same footing as other contracts.'\"                  Scherk v. Alberto-Culver\n\nCo., 417 U.S. 506, 510-11 (1974) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 96, 68th\n\n\n\n     7\n       Comcast's appeal and Anderson's cross-appeal are separately\ndocketed as #06-2165 and #06-2203, respectively.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fCong., 1st Sess., 1, 2 (1924)) (footnote omitted); see also Dean\n\nWitter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 221 (1985) (\"The\n\npreeminent concern of Congress in passing the Act was to enforce\n\nprivate agreements into which parties had entered, and that concern\n\nrequires     that      we    rigorously      enforce      agreements       to\n\narbitrate. . . .\").         Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly\n\nupheld arbitration agreements against a variety of attacks, stating\n\nthat \"any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should\n\nbe resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is\n\nthe construction of the contract language itself or an allegation\n\nof waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\"             Moses H.\n\nCone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25\n\n(1983).\n\n            Despite the Court's liberal policy favoring arbitration,\n\nit has made clear that the \"question whether the parties have\n\nsubmitted a particular dispute to arbitration, i.e., the 'question\n\nof arbitrability,' is 'an issue for judicial determination [u]nless\n\nthe parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.'\"              Howsam\n\nv. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 83 (2002) (quoting AT&T\n\nTechs.,    Inc.   v.   Commc'ns   Workers,   475   U.S.   643,   649   (1986)\n\n(alteration in original)).         This judgment – that the question\n\nwhether the parties have submitted a particular disagreement to\n\narbitration is an issue for judicial determination – is based on\n\nthe presumed intent of the contracting parties favoring judicial\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdetermination of such a question.             The Court refers to this\n\npresumed intent as the \"interpretive rule.\" Id.; see also Kristian\n\nv. Comcast, Corp., 446 F.3d 25, 38 (1st Cir. 2006).          But the Court\n\nhas cautioned against an overly expansive application of the\n\ninterpretive rule:\n\n              Linguistically speaking, one might call any\n              potentially dispositive gateway question a\n              \"question of arbitrability,\" for its answer\n              will   determine   whether    the   underlying\n              controversy will proceed to arbitration on the\n              merits. The Court's case law, however, makes\n              clear that, for purposes of applying the\n              interpretive rule, the phrase \"question of\n              arbitrability\" has a far more limited scope.\n              The Court has found the phrase applicable in\n              the   kind  of   narrow   circumstance   where\n              contracting parties would likely have expected\n              a court to have decided the gateway matter,\n              where they are not likely to have thought that\n              they had agreed that an arbitrator would do\n              so, and, consequently, where reference of the\n              gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk\n              of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that\n              they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.\n\nHowsam, 537 U.S. at 83-84 (citation omitted).\n\n              One of the \"narrow circumstances\" that might raise a\n\nquestion of arbitrability involves an allegation by a party to an\n\narbitration agreement that some of the terms in an arbitration\n\nagreement conflict with a statutory right that is not waivable by\n\ncontract.      If that claim withstands analysis, the court will have\n\nto   decide    whether   the   conflict    precludes   enforcement   of   the\n\narbitration agreement. See, e.g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\n\nChrysler-Plymouth, 473 U.S. 614, 628 (1985) (\"Having made the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fbargain to arbitrate, the party should be held to it unless [the\n\nlegislature] itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver\n\nof   judicial    remedies   for   the    statutory   rights   at   issue.\").\n\nAlternatively, a party may challenge the enforceability of an\n\narbitration agreement claiming that the agreement itself or some of\n\nits terms are unconscionable.           See id. at 627 (\"[C]ourts should\n\nremain attuned to well-supported claims that the agreement to\n\narbitrate resulted from the sort of fraud or overwhelming economic\n\npower   that    would   provide   grounds   'for   the   revocation   of   any\n\ncontract.'\") (quoting 9 U.S.C. § 2).\n\n           Anderson primarily raises a vindication of statutory\n\nrights argument as a defense to the obligation to arbitrate,\n\nclaiming that Chapter 93A, and a related statute of limitations\n\nprovision, preclude enforcement of the arbitration agreement. When\n\nfaced with such a defense to the obligation to arbitrate, we must\n\ndetermine whether that defense poses a question of arbitrability\n\nfor the court to decide.      This question, to which we now turn, is\n\nat the heart of our analysis.\n\n                                    III.\n\n           We review the district court's decision de novo, as it\n\nrests entirely on questions of law.         Stuart v. United States, 337\n\nF.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2003).         We use the framework developed in\n\nKristian v. Comcast, Corp., 446 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2006) to first\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdecide whether any of Anderson's challenges to the arbitration\n\nagreement pose questions of arbitrability.\n\nA.   Class Bar\n\n           We    begin   and   end   our    analysis   of    the   arbitration\n\nagreement's class bar by determining whether a conflict exists\n\nbetween the statute and the agreement.          We find no conflict.       With\n\nrespect to class actions, the agreement states:\n\n           THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY\n           CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION OR\n           CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING\n           CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE\n           CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH\n           AS   A  PRIVATE   ATTORNEY   GENERAL),   OTHER\n           SUBSCRIBERS,   OR  OTHER   PERSONS   SIMILARLY\n           SITUATED UNLESS YOUR STATE'S LAWS PROVIDE\n           OTHERWISE.\n\nIn Kristian, where we also assessed the validity of Comcast's bar\n\non class arbitration, neither the state nor federal antitrust\n\nstatute at issue mentioned the right of plaintiffs to proceed on a\n\nclass basis.     As a result, our analysis focused on whether the\n\nnature and purposes of antitrust law suggested a conflict, and we\n\ndetermined that, \"[b]ecause the denial of class arbitration in the\n\npursuit of antitrust claims has the potential to prevent Plaintiffs\n\nfrom   vindicating   their     statutory    rights,\"   id.   at    55,   such   a\n\nconflict did exist.          Here, however, Chapter 93A specifically\n\nprovides for the class action procedure.          It states: \"Any persons\n\nentitled to bring such action may . . . bring the action on behalf\n\nof himself and such other similarly injured and situated persons.\"\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(2).                 Given this explicit statutory\n\nlanguage, the relevant question here is whether Chapter 93A's class\n\naction provision is the kind of provision anticipated by the\n\nagreement's limiting language, \"unless your state's laws provide\n\notherwise.\"      If so, there is no conflict between the arbitration\n\nagreement and the statute because the arbitration agreement, by its\n\nterms, permits arbitration to proceed on a class basis in the face\n\nof state law providing for such actions.\n\n              In these circumstances, we find PacifiCare Health Sys.,\n\nInc. v. Book, 538 U.S. 401, 406-07 (2003), instructive. There, the\n\nSupreme Court faced a potential conflict between an arbitration\n\nagreement that prohibited punitive damages and statutory language\n\nentitling      plaintiff    to    treble       damages.     Reasoning     that   an\n\narbitrator could interpret the agreement to avoid a direct conflict\n\n(i.e.,   by    finding     that       treble    damages   were   not    necessarily\n\n\"punitive\"), the Court found no question of arbitrability and\n\ncompelled arbitration.        Id.       Likewise here, to the extent there is\n\nany ambiguity as to whether Chapter 93A \"provides otherwise,\" the\n\narbitrator must interpret the agreement in the first instance. See\n\nid., at 407 (\"[S]ince we do not know how the arbitrator will\n\nconstrue the remedial limitations, the questions whether they\n\nrender the parties' agreements unenforceable and whether it is for\n\ncourts   or    arbitrators       to    decide    enforceability    in    the   first\n\ninstance are unusually abstract. . . .               [T]he proper course is to\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fcompel arbitration.\"). Thus, in light of the \"unless\" qualifier in\n\nthe class action provision, we reject Anderson's contention that\n\nthis   provision      raises   a   question   of   arbitrability    and   leave\n\ndetermination of the class action question in the first instance to\n\nthe arbitrator.\n\nB.   Multiple Damages\n\n           The     district    court   determined    that   the    agreement's\n\nproscription     of    multiple     damages   also    improperly     prevented\n\nplaintiffs from vindicating statutory rights under Chapter 93A.\n\nThe relevant language of the agreement states:\n\n           IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR EMPLOYEES OR\n           AGENTS HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR PUNITIVE,\n           TREBLE,    EXEMPLARY,    SPECIAL,    INDIRECT,\n           INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING\n           FROM OUR PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE\n           ANY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES TO YOU. . . . SUCH\n           LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES IN ALL\n           CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH\n           DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW,\n           AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS, IF\n           ANY, TO RECOVER ANY SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nAs a prelude to assessing the district court's ruling, we review\n\nour approach to this multiple damages prohibition in Kristian, 446\n\nF.3d at 44-50.         There, we found a clear conflict between the\n\nlanguage of the agreement and the federal antitrust statute, which\n\nrequires that a plaintiff who established an antitrust injury\n\n\"shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained,\" 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 15(a).    Moreover, taking a preliminary look at whether the\n\nremedies provided by the antitrust statute could be contractually\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fwaived, we found no ambiguity on the waiver issue that would\n\nrequire deference to the arbitrator.            Kristian, 446 F.3d at 46-47\n\nn.15. Hence, we decided that the remedy stripping provision of the\n\narbitration agreement posed a question of arbitrability – i.e.,\n\nthat the court rather than the arbitrator should decide in the\n\nfirst   instance   whether   the   conflict      between   the   arbitration\n\nagreement and the statute prevented Kristian from vindicating her\n\nstatutory rights.    Id. at 47-48.\n\n           Addressing that question (which we define as the \"merits\"\n\nin a vindication-of-statutory-rights-defense to a motion to compel\n\narbitration), we first explained why the award of treble damages\n\nunder the federal antitrust statutes could not be waived.            Id.   We\n\nthen noted that this unwaivable conflict suggested plaintiffs\n\nshould prevail on their defense to arbitration.                  Id. at 48.\n\nHowever, we then focused on a \"savings clause\" in the arbitration\n\nagreement specifically providing that, if certain remedies could\n\nnot be contractually waived under applicable law, a plaintiff could\n\nretain those remedies under the agreement despite any contractual\n\nclauses to the contrary.     Id.   That \"savings clause,\" by allowing\n\nseverance of the prohibition on multiple damages as it related to\n\nthe federal antitrust claim, effectively removed the conflict\n\nbetween the language of the arbitration agreement and the federal\n\nantitrust statute on this issue.          Id.     Therefore, we determined\n\nthat, even though the presence of the damages limitation posed a\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fquestion of arbitrability, it did not preclude enforcement of the\n\narbitration agreement.        Id.      We thus ruled that the plaintiffs\n\ncould recover treble damages in arbitration for federal antitrust\n\nviolations.\n\n             When we turned to the state antitrust provision, which\n\nspecifies that \"the court may award up to three times the amount of\n\nactual damages sustained,\" Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, § 12, we\n\nconcluded     that    Kristian   had    not     established     a    question    of\n\narbitrability.        Kristian, 446 F.3d at 50.            In reaching that\n\nconclusion, we explained that even though Massachusetts law used\n\nthe   word    \"may\"     –   indicating        that   multiple       damages     were\n\ndiscretionary – there was still a direct conflict between the\n\nstatutory provision and the arbitration agreement because the\n\narbitration agreement precluded the exercise of discretion to award\n\ntreble damages that the statute granted to the decision maker. Id.\n\nat 49.   We then took a preliminary look at the waiver question –\n\nthat is, whether a plaintiff such as Kristian could contractually\n\nwaive the right to treble damages under Massachusetts law. In that\n\nanalysis, we determined that \"Massachusetts law on this question of\n\nwaiver [was] ambiguous at best\" because the statute made treble\n\ndamages discretionary rather than mandatory and because the case\n\nlaw on whether remedies were contractually waivable under the\n\nstatute was unsettled.      Id. at 50.        We therefore concluded that the\n\narbitrator would have to decide in the first instance whether there\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fwas a conflict between the arbitration agreement and the state law\n\nand   whether     that        conflict      made     the    arbitration     agreement\n\nunenforceable.     Id.\n\n            We now turn to the different damages provision of Chapter\n\n93A, which provides that a successful claimant is entitled to money\n\ndamages, which \"may include double or treble damages,\" Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 93A, § 9(3A) and specifies that \"recovery shall be in the\n\namount of actual damages . . .; or up to three but not less than\n\ntwo times such amount if the court finds . . . a willful or knowing\n\nviolation\" of the consumer protection act. Id. at § 9(3) (emphasis\n\nadded).    We   note     at    the   outset        that    this   provision    differs\n\nsignificantly from both the federal and state antitrust statutes at\n\nissue in Kristian because it neither mandates multiple damages in\n\nall   instances   of     a    violation      (as    does    the   federal   antitrust\n\nstatute), nor does it make multiple damages discretionary in all\n\ncases (as does the Massachusetts antitrust statute).                      Instead, it\n\nrequires    multiple damages only if a fact-finder determines that a\n\n\"willful or knowing violation\" occurred.\n\n            Apparently conceding that the statute and the agreement\n\nconflict,   Comcast      argues      that    this    conflict     does   not   pose   a\n\nquestion of arbitrability for two reasons.                    First, to the extent\n\nthat the Massachusetts legislature made multiple damages permissive\n\nrather than mandatory, Comcast contends that we must follow our\n\nanalysis of the state antitrust statute in Kristian and find that\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fwhether the provision is waivable is \"ambiguous at best.\" We would\n\ntherefore be forced to conclude that this conflict raises no\n\nquestion of arbitrability and that the arbitrator must decide\n\nwaivability in the first instance.            Second, to the extent that\n\nChapter 93A makes multiple damages mandatory if the arbitrator\n\nfinds a willful or knowing violation, Comcast argues that it\n\nremains uncertain whether a conflict between the agreement and the\n\nstatute will arise in this particular case because such a conflict\n\nis dependent upon the arbitrator's factual findings.               In the face\n\nof this factual uncertainty, Comcast argues, there is no question\n\nof arbitrability for the court to decide.\n\n          Comcast is correct on both points.             We have previously\n\nrecognized   that   where   the   existence    of   a   conflict    between   a\n\nprovision in an arbitration agreement and a statute depends upon an\n\narbitrator's factual finding relating to the merits of the dispute,\n\nno question of arbitrability arises.      In Kristian, we found that a\n\npossible conflict between the agreement's limitations period and\n\nthe statute of limitations posed no question of arbitrability where\n\nthe plaintiff alleged an ongoing injury because \"(1) whether\n\nPlaintiffs in fact suffer from an ongoing injury . . .; and (2)\n\nwhether such injury . . . tolls the statute of limitations . . .\n\nwould require an examination of the 'merits of the case,' i.e., the\n\nfacts, the province of the arbitrator.\"             446 F.3d at 44.     Thus,\n\nwhether the conflict between the agreement and the statute posed a\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fquestion of arbitrability depended upon factual determinations\n\nwithin   the   arbitrator's   purview.    Here,   with   respect    to    the\n\nmandatory application of the multiple damages provision of the\n\nstatute, there will be a conflict between that portion of the\n\nstatute and the agreement only if the arbitrator finds a willful or\n\nknowing violation of the statute.\n\n           On the other hand, if the arbitrator finds a violation of\n\nthe statute that is not willful or knowing, there will be a direct\n\nconflict between the agreement and the multiple damages provision\n\nof the statute because a flat prohibition against multiple damages\n\nremoves even the discretion to award them.               See id. at 49.\n\nHowever,   it    is   ambiguous   whether   Anderson's     right     to     a\n\ndiscretionary     multiple    damages    remedy   is     waivable    under\n\nMassachusetts law for the same reasons it was ambiguous whether the\n\nplaintiff in Kristian could waive a discretionary treble damages\n\naward under the Massachusetts antitrust statute.\n\n           In summary, despite the direct conflicts between the\n\nmultiple damages provision of the statute and the multiple damages\n\nprohibition in the arbitration agreement, these conflicts do not\n\npose a question of arbitrability because: (1) the conflict between\n\nthe mandatory portion of the statute and the agreement will only\n\narise if ths arbitrator makes a factual finding (a willful or\n\nknowing violation) that relates to the merits of the dispute; and\n\n(2) if the arbitrator finds a violation of the statute that is not\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fwillful or knowing, the discretionary award of multiple damages may\n\nor may not be waivable under Massachusetts law.             In the absence of\n\na question of arbitrability, the district court erred in ordering\n\nthat the multiple damages provision be severed from the arbitration\n\nagreement.\n\nC.   Statute of Limitations\n\n           1.   The Question of Arbitrability\n\n           Although a four-year statute of limitations applies to\n\nChapter 93A claims under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 260,\n\n§ 5A, the arbitration agreement provides: \"YOU MUST CONTACT US\n\nWITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR\n\nFACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE . . . OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO\n\nPURSUE A CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS OR DISPUTE.\"                     An\n\napparent     conflict    therefore   arises   from   the     text    of   these\n\nprovisions.8\n\n           In Kristian, as just noted, when we faced a similar\n\nconflict     between    an   explicit   statutory    time    limit    and   the\n\narbitration agreement's one-year limitation, we concluded that no\n\nquestion of arbitrability was posed because the question of tolling\n\nrequired an examination of facts relating to the merits of the\n\n\n\n     8\n       We note that Comcast renews its argument that the one-year\nprovision in the arbitration agreement merely imposes a notice\nobligation on customers rather than a deadline for filing claims\nand therefore does not conflict with the statutory time limit. Our\nrejection of this argument in Kristian, 446 F.3d at 43, is\ncontrolling here.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fdispute   –    a    responsibility      that    belongs     to   the      arbitrator.\n\nKristian,     446    F.3d    at   44.    Comcast    suggests       that    there    are\n\nequivalent factual disputes in this case regarding when Anderson\n\ndiscovered that he was being overcharged and whether Comcast\n\nfraudulently        concealed     the   charges    that    might    eliminate       the\n\nconflict by bringing him within the agreement's one-year statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n              This argument is unpersuasive.         Anderson alleges that he\n\nreturned his cable box to Comcast in 2002 but did not file suit\n\nuntil   2005.        Anderson's     complaint      can    only   be    read    as   an\n\nacknowledgment        that   he   did   not    comply     with   the      arbitration\n\nagreement's one-year notice of claim provision.                    The portions of\n\nAnderson's complaint on which Comcast relies in attempting to\n\nestablish a factual dispute do not purport to make a tolling\n\nargument and Comcast cannot impose one on Anderson for its own\n\npurposes.      We therefore agree that Anderson has established a\n\ndirect conflict between the statutory provision and the agreement.\n\n              In the face of this direct conflict, we next make the\n\npreliminary waivability inquiry, as we did in Kristian, id. at 46-\n\n47 & n.15, i.e., we assess whether there is ambiguity on the\n\nquestion whether the statute of limitations can be contractually\n\nshortened. If there is ambiguity, the waivability question must be\n\ndetermined by the arbitrator in the first instance.                           For the\n\nreasons that we explain more fully below, we find that there is not\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fsuch ambiguity and we therefore conclude that this conflict between\n\nthe arbitration agreement and the statute of limitations raises a\n\nquestion of arbitrability.\n\n           2.   Waivability\n\n           Seeking to convince us that the limitations period that\n\napplies to Chapter 93A claims can be contractually shortened,\n\nComcast points out that Massachusetts permits the reduction of\n\nfour-year statutes of limitation to one year in certain contexts\n\n(e.g.,   sale   and   lease    contracts     under   the   provisions   of   the\n\nMassachusetts Uniform Commercial Code, (\"MUCC\"), Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 106, §§ 2-725(1), 2A-506(1)).            In addition, it notes that we\n\nhave previously recognized this authority in the context of a claim\n\nbrought under Chapter 93A, § 11.        See Hays v. Mobil Oil Corp., 930\n\nF.2d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[A] one-year contractual limitations\n\nperiod, although brief, is valid and enforceable.\").               Section 11\n\nallows \"[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or\n\ncommerce\" to bring suit for unfair trade practices.                Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 93A, § 11.           It is thus the commercial analog to the\n\nconsumer remedy provided by Chapter 93A, § 9.\n\n           Anderson     seeks    to   distinguish      between    the   MUCC's\n\nallowance of a truncated statute of limitations and Hays on the one\n\nhand, and consumer claims on the other, by pointing out that the\n\nMUCC provisions apply only to contracts for sale and defaults under\n\na lease and Hays involved a transaction between commercial parties.\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fThe distinction between commercial and consumer claims is important\n\nin many contexts.     Indeed, § 9 was adopted in 1969 to provide an\n\neffective private remedy to consumers, see Slaney v. Westwood Auto,\n\nInc., 322 N.E.2d 768, 775-77 (Mass. 1975); § 11 was adopted in\n\n1972, in part to eliminate anticompetitive activity, see Levings v.\n\nForbes & Wallace, Inc., 396 N.E.2d 149, 152-53 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1979).     Given   their   different     origins   and   purposes,   what   is\n\nwaivable under one section might not be waivable under the other.\n\n           Chapter   93A    does   not    itself   contain   a   statute    of\n\nlimitations provision.     Instead, the four-year period is specified\n\nin Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 260, § 5A, which creates a\n\nfour-year statute of limitations for \"[a]ctions arising on account\n\nof violations of any law intended for the protection of consumers,\n\nincluding . . . chapter ninety-three A.\"                 This provision was\n\nenacted in 1975, several years after both § 9 and § 11 were\n\nadopted.    Chapter 93A claims such as Anderson's were originally\n\nsubject to a two-year statute of limitations, which was extended to\n\nthree years in 1973 before § 5A finally extended it to four years\n\nin 1975.   See Baldassari v. Pub. Fin. Trust, 337 N.E.2d 701, 708\n\n(Mass. 1975).      The Massachusetts courts have interpreted the\n\nenactment of § 5A as part of a broader legislative scheme to\n\n\"remedy the imbalance which exists primarily because of a lack of\n\nparity in bargaining power between the consumer and the provider of\n\nconsumer goods and services.\"      Mahoney v. Baldwin, 543 N.E.2d 435,\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\f437 (Mass. App. Ct. 1989).             The progressive lengthening of the\n\nstatute of limitations, and the statutory language emphasizing the\n\ncentrality     of   consumer    protection,    strongly    suggest    that   the\n\nMassachusetts legislature did not intend this limitations period to\n\nbe shortened by contract.\n\n              In addressing the waivability of statutory remedies under\n\n§ 11, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated in dicta that\n\nit \"ordinarily would not effectuate a consumer's waiver of rights\n\nunder Chapter 93A.\"      Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.,\n\n548 N.E.2d 182, 187 (Mass. 1990). When we assessed the waivability\n\nof the discretionary multiple damages remedy under the state\n\nantitrust statute in Kristian, 446 F.3d at 49-50, we characterized\n\nthis language from Canal as \"hinting that waiver of statutory\n\nremedies will not be allowed in situations involving a consumer\n\nplaintiff and/or antitrust claims,\" id. at 50.              However, because\n\nthe statutory remedy at issue in that analysis was discretionary,\n\nwe concluded that \"Massachusetts law on [the] question of waiver\n\n[was] ambiguous at best.\"        Id.    Here, where the progression of the\n\nlaw suggests that the Massachusetts legislature was concerned that\n\na longer statute of limitations was required to allow consumers to\n\neffectuate their private cause of action under Chapter 93A, we find\n\nno such ambiguity.\n\n              Our Hays case is readily distinguishable from the instant\n\ncase   both    because   it    involved   a   contract    between    commercial\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fparties, and also because the court in that case never mentioned\n\nthe applicability of the four-year statute of limitations arising\n\nfrom   §   5A.     Moreover,   unlike   a   discretionary   damages   remedy\n\nprovided by statute, a statute of limitations often determines\n\nwhether the consumer can seek any remedy at all.            If that statute\n\nof limitations can be reduced from four years to one by agreement,\n\nthe consumer loses a protection that is basic to all other consumer\n\nremedies.        Given the language of the Supreme Judicial Court in\n\nCanal, and the importance accorded to the four-year statute of\n\nlimitations for consumers by the legislature, we conclude that this\n\nfour-year statute of limitations was not waivable by Anderson in\n\nhis agreement with Comcast. The one-year statute of limitations in\n\nthe agreement is thus incompatible with his statutory rights under\n\nChapter 93A.\n\n            3.     Severance\n\n            This unwaivable conflict between the statute and the\n\narbitration agreement precludes enforcement of the agreement only\n\nif the problematic provision cannot be severed from it.                  See\n\nKristian, 446 F.3d at 48.        The dispute resolution section of the\n\narbitration agreement makes clear that the limitations period is\n\nseverable:\n\n            If any portion of . . . this dispute\n            resolution section[] is determined to be\n            illegal or unenforceable, then that provision\n            may be deleted or modified and the remainder\n            of . . . this dispute resolution section[]\n            shall be given full force and effect.\n\n                                    -25-\n\fSevering the one-year limitation provision – as the agreement\n\nallows us to do – preserves the viability of the arbitral forum.\n\nPut another way, arbitration can go forward, subject to the four-\n\nyear statute of limitations.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n            In his cross-appeal, Anderson also urges us to find the\n\narbitration agreement unconscionable and therefore unenforceable as\n\nto both his statutory and common law claims.               Anderson's primary\n\nunconscionability argument is inextricably bound to his vindication\n\nof statutory rights argument. That is, he argues that the conflict\n\nbetween numerous provisions of the agreement and Chapter 93A, and\n\nits related statute of limitations, demonstrates the agreement's\n\none-sided nature and Comcast's determination to extinguish the\n\nprocedural and substantive rights of its customers.\n\n            We must reject this argument because of its faulty\n\npremise.    We have found a direct, unwaivable conflict only between\n\nthe four-year statute of limitations for consumer claims related to\n\nChapter    93A    and   the     one-year    limitation     provision      of   the\n\narbitration      agreement.       With     its   severance     provision,      the\n\narbitration agreement itself anticipated such a possible conflict\n\nand explicitly stated that arbitration should go forward without\n\nthe offending term.           The district court found the prohibition\n\nagainst    attorney's    fees    unenforceable     in    the   arbitral    forum.\n\nComcast did not appeal that determination.              For the reasons stated\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fabove, there is uncertainty whether the class action and multiple\n\ndamages bars of the arbitration agreement will be enforceable or\n\neven implicated in the arbitration proceedings.               Under these\n\ncircumstances, there is no basis for finding the arbitration\n\nagreement unconscionable.\n\n           To the extent that Anderson presents an unconscionability\n\nargument   under    Massachusetts    law   that   is   distinct   from   his\n\nvindication of statutory rights argument, we find that argument so\n\nundeveloped as to be waived. See United States v. Rosario-Peralta,\n\n199 F.3d 552, 563 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                     V.\n\n           In summary, we make the following rulings.         On Comcast's\n\nappeal (docket #06-2165), we vacate that portion of the order\n\ndeclaring the class action bar of the arbitration agreement invalid\n\nand severing it from the arbitration agreement; and we vacate that\n\nportion of the order declaring the multiple damages provision of\n\nthe   arbitration   agreement   invalid     and   severing   it   from   the\n\narbitration agreement.      On Anderson's cross-appeal (docket #06-\n\n2203), we vacate the order requiring the arbitrator to decide the\n\nenforceability of the arbitration agreement's one-year limitation\n\nprovision; arbitration can only go forward with that provision\n\nsevered from the agreement.     We affirm the district court's order\n\ngranting Comcast's motion to compel arbitration.             We remand for\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\ffurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

Comcast, Corp.,</i> 446 F.3d 25 (1st Cir.2006)  in which we determined that specific provisions of Comcast's standard arbitration agreement with its cable customers had to be severed from the agreement because they prevented its customers from vindicating rights in the arbitral forum provided for in state and federal antitrust statutes  applies to consumer claims that Carl Anderson brings against Comcast, which seeks to compel arbitration under the same arbitration agreement.<sup>[1]</sup> In pursuing his claims, Anderson invoked the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9 (\"Chapter 93A\"), and various common law tort theories. Citing <i>Kristian,</i> the district court granted Comcast's motion to compel arbitration but only after severing provisions in the arbitration agreement prohibiting attorney's fees, double or treble damages and a class action remedy in the arbitral forum. It also specified that \"the arbitrator will have the power to determine the validity and applicability of the agreement's one-year statute of limitations.\"</p>\n<p>After carefully analyzing the alleged conflicts between the language of the arbitration agreement and the statutory provisions at issue under the framework established in <i>Kristian,</i> we conclude that only the conflict relating to the limitations period raises a question of arbitrability for the court to decide. We therefore vacate that portion of the district court's order compelling arbitration of the applicability of the contractual limitations period, and we conclude that the contractual limitations period is invalid as it relates to Anderson's Chapter 93A claim. However, that clause of the arbitration agreement is severable under the terms of the agreement; we therefore affirm the order compelling arbitration of Anderson's claims, absent that limitations clause. We also reverse that portion of the district court's order severing the agreement's class action provision and its bar on multiple damages awards. Those provisions did not pose questions of arbitrability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The facts in this case are undisputed. Carl Anderson, a Massachusetts resident, has been a cable service customer of Comcast Corporation since at least May 31, 1994. Until 2002, he leased a cable converter box and remote control in connection with his cable subscription even though he owned a cable-ready television or video cassette recorder. These unnecessary items were billed to him at approximately $4.30 per month.</p>\n<p>In November 2005, Anderson filed a putative class action in Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that the imposition of monthly rental fees on customers with cable-ready equipment violated Chapter 93A, in addition to violating general common law tort and contract law principles. Chapter 93A provides a cause of action to consumers who have been injured by an \"[u]nfair method[] of competition [or] unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2. Massachusetts courts have interpreted the terms of Chapter 93A broadly to include practices that \"fall[] `within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness.'\" <i>Lambert</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> <i>v. Fleet Nat'l Bank,</i> 449 Mass. 119, 865 N.E.2d 1091, 1097 (2007) (quoting <i>Wasserman v. Agnastopoulos,</i> 22 Mass. App.Ct. 672, 497 N.E.2d 19, 23 (1986)). While asserting no federal causes of action, Anderson grounds his Chapter 93A unfair trade practice claim on allegations that Comcast: (1) violated a provision of the Federal Communications Act requiring that \"[a] cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name,\" 47 U.S.C. § 543(f),<sup>[2]</sup> and (2) failed to comply with regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission requiring cable providers to unscramble their basic programming signals so they can be received by customers with cable-ready equipment, 47 C.F.R. § 76.630(a). For the statutory claim, Anderson seeks treble damages and attorney's fees; for the common law claims, he seeks actual damages, punitive damages, and declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Anderson filed his action, Comcast filed an unopposed petition for removal to federal court on the basis of diversity.<sup>[3]</sup> Once in federal court, Comcast moved to compel arbitration under the arbitration agreement, which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote>IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE INFORMALLY ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED, WE HAVE AGREED TO BINDING ARBITRATION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW.<sup>[4]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to requiring customers to arbitrate their disputes with Comcast, the agreement requires that customers contact Comcast within a year of injury or waive any claim based on that injury; it requires customers to pay certain costs of arbitration, including their attorney's fees;<sup>[5]</sup> and it precludes arbitration on a class action basis and denies customers who prevail in arbitration multiple or punitive damages. Despite setting extensive limitations on a customer's recovery, the contract contains various clauses severing any terms that conflict with applicable law.</p>\n<p>Anderson objected to the motion, arguing that arbitration under the terms of the agreement would effectively deny to plaintiffs the ability to vindicate their statutory and common law rights. The district court, relying heavily on the framework and analysis of <i>Kristian v. Comcast, Corp.,</i> 446 F.3d 25 (1st Cir.2006), granted Comcast's motion to compel arbitration, but only after determining that the agreement's provisions barring attorney's fees,<sup>[6]</sup> class actions, and multiple damages were \"invalid and severed\" as they related to Anderson's Chapter 93A claim. However, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> it held that the arbitrator had authority to determine whether the agreement's limitations period prevented Anderson from vindicating his statutory claim under Chapter 93A.</p>\n<p>In its appeal, Comcast argues that the district court erred in concluding that the arbitration agreement's bar on class actions and multiple damages awards were invalid as they related to Anderson's Chapter 93A claim, and it urges us to reverse that portion of the district court's order severing these provisions from the arbitration agreement. Anderson cross-appeals from the district court's order compelling arbitration, arguing that  while the court correctly found particular provisions of the arbitration agreement invalid as they relate to his claims  the court should have found the entire arbitration agreement unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.<sup>[7]</sup> In addition, he cross-appeals the district court's ruling that the validity of the arbitration agreement's one-year limitations period should be determined by the arbitrator. He argues instead that the conflict between that limitations period and Chapter 93A's four-year statute of limitations creates a direct conflict that must be resolved by the court in favor of the longer statutory period.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We consider these claims against the backdrop of a strong pro-arbitration policy expressed by Congress and repeatedly upheld by the courts. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as an effort to \"revers[e] centuries of judicial hostility to arbitration agreements, . . . to allow parties to avoid `the costliness and delays of litigation,' and to place arbitration agreements `upon the same footing as other contracts.'\" <i>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co.,</i> 417 U.S. 506, 510-11, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 2 (1924)) (footnote omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd,</i> 470 U.S. 213, 221, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985) (\"The preeminent concern of Congress in passing the Act was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered, and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate. . . .\"). Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld arbitration agreements against a variety of attacks, stating that \"any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\" <i>Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n<p>Despite the Court's liberal policy favoring arbitration, it has made clear that the \"question whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration, i.e., the `question of arbitrability,' is `an issue for judicial determination [u]nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.'\" <i>Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S. 79, 83, 123 S.Ct. 588, 154 L.Ed.2d 491 (2002) (quoting <i>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. v. Commc'ns Workers of America,</i> 475 U.S. 643, 649, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986) (alteration in original)). This judgment  that the question whether the parties have submitted a particular disagreement to arbitration is an issue for judicial determination  is based on the presumed intent of the contracting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> parties favoring judicial determination of such a question. The Court refers to this presumed intent as the \"interpretive rule.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Kristian v. Comcast, Corp.,</i> 446 F.3d 25, 38 (1st Cir.2006). But the Court has cautioned against an overly expansive application of the interpretive rule:</p>\n<blockquote>Linguistically speaking, one might call any potentially dispositive gateway question a \"question of arbitrability,\" for its answer will determine whether the underlying controversy will proceed to arbitration on the merits. The Court's case law, however, makes clear that, for purposes of applying the interpretive rule, the phrase \"question of arbitrability\" has a far more limited scope. The Court has found the phrase applicable in the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter, where they are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so, and, consequently, where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Howsam,</i> 537 U.S. at 83-84, 123 S.Ct. 588 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>One of the \"narrow circumstances\" that might raise a question of arbitrability involves an allegation by a party to an arbitration agreement that some of the terms in an arbitration agreement conflict with a statutory right that is not waivable by contract. If that claim withstands analysis, the court will have to decide whether the conflict precludes enforcement of the arbitration agreement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth,</i> 473 U.S. 614, 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985) (\"Having made the bargain to arbitrate, the party should be held to it unless [the legislature] itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.\"). Alternatively, a party may challenge the enforceability of an arbitration agreement claiming that the agreement itself or some of its terms are unconscionable. <i>See id.</i> at 627 (\"[C]ourts should remain attuned to well-supported claims that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from the sort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would provide grounds `for the revocation of any contract.'\") (quoting 9 U.S.C. § 2).</p>\n<p>Anderson primarily raises a vindication of statutory rights argument as a defense to the obligation to arbitrate, claiming that Chapter 93A, and a related statute of limitations provision, preclude enforcement of the arbitration agreement. When faced with such a defense to the obligation to arbitrate, we must determine whether that defense poses a question of arbitrability for the court to decide. This question, to which we now turn, is at the heart of our analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's decision de novo, as it rests entirely on questions of law. <i>Stuart v. United States,</i> 337 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir.2003). We use the framework developed in <i>Kristian v. Comcast, Corp.,</i> 446 F.3d 25 (1st Cir.2006) to first decide whether any of Anderson's challenges to the arbitration agreement pose questions of arbitrability.</p>\n<p>A. Class Bar</p>\n<p>We begin and end our analysis of the arbitration agreement's class bar by determining whether a conflict exists between the statute and the agreement. We find no conflict. With respect to class actions, the agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote>THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED UNLESS YOUR STATE'S LAWS PROVIDE OTHERWISE.</blockquote>\n<p>In <i>Kristian,</i> where we also assessed the validity of Comcast's bar on class arbitration, neither the state nor federal antitrust statute at issue mentioned the right of plaintiffs to proceed on a class basis. As a result, our analysis focused on whether the nature and purposes of antitrust law suggested a conflict, and we determined that, \"[b]ecause the denial of class arbitration in the pursuit of antitrust claims has the potential to prevent Plaintiffs from vindicating their statutory rights,\" <i>id.</i> at 55, such a conflict did exist. Here, however, Chapter 93A specifically provides for the class action procedure. It states: \"Any persons entitled to bring such action may . . . bring the action on behalf of himself and such other similarly injured and situated persons.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(2). Given this explicit statutory language, the relevant question here is whether Chapter 93A's class action provision is the kind of provision anticipated by the agreement's limiting language, \"unless your state's laws provide otherwise.\" If so, there is no conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute because the arbitration agreement, by its terms, permits arbitration to proceed on a class basis in the face of state law providing for such actions.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances, we find <i>PacifiCare Health Sys., Inc. v. Book,</i> 538 U.S. 401, 406-07, 123 S.Ct. 1531, 155 L.Ed.2d 578 (2003), instructive. There, the Supreme Court faced a potential conflict between an arbitration agreement that prohibited punitive damages and statutory language entitling plaintiff to treble damages. Reasoning that an arbitrator could interpret the agreement to avoid a direct conflict (i.e., by finding that treble damages were not necessarily \"punitive\"), the Court found no question of arbitrability and compelled arbitration. <i>Id.</i> Likewise here, to the extent there is any ambiguity as to whether Chapter 93A \"provides otherwise,\" the arbitrator must interpret the agreement in the first instance. <i>See id.,</i> at 407, 123 S.Ct. 1531 (\"[S]ince we do not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations, the questions whether they render the parties' agreements unenforceable and whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance are unusually abstract. . . . [T]he proper course is to compel arbitration.\"). Thus, in light of the \"unless\" qualifier in the class action provision, we reject Anderson's contention that this provision raises a question of arbitrability and leave determination of the class action question in the first instance to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>B. Multiple Damages</p>\n<p>The district court determined that the agreement's proscription of multiple damages also improperly prevented plaintiffs from vindicating statutory rights under Chapter 93A. The relevant language of the agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR PUNITIVE, TREBLE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM OUR PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ANY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES TO YOU. . . . SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> APPLIES IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS, IF ANY, TO RECOVER ANY SUCH DAMAGES.</blockquote>\n<p>As a prelude to assessing the district court's ruling, we review our approach to this multiple damages prohibition in <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 44-50. There, we found a clear conflict between the language of the agreement and the federal antitrust statute, which requires that a plaintiff who established an antitrust injury \"shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained,\" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). Moreover, taking a preliminary look at whether the remedies provided by the antitrust statute could be contractually waived, we found no ambiguity on the waiver issue that would require deference to the arbitrator. <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 46-47 n. 15. Hence, we decided that the remedy stripping provision of the arbitration agreement posed a question of arbitrability  i.e., that the court rather than the arbitrator should decide in the first instance whether the conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute prevented Kristian from vindicating her statutory rights. <i>Id.</i> at 47-48.</p>\n<p>Addressing that question (which we define as the \"merits\" in a vindication of statutory rights defense to a motion to compel arbitration), we first explained why the award of treble damages under the federal antitrust statutes could not be waived. <i>Id.</i> We then noted that this unwaivable conflict suggested plaintiffs should prevail on their defense to arbitration. <i>Id.</i> at 48. However, we then focused on a \"savings clause\" in the arbitration agreement specifically providing that, if certain remedies could not be contractually waived under applicable law, a plaintiff could retain those remedies under the agreement despite any contractual clauses to the contrary. <i>Id.</i> That \"savings clause,\" by allowing severance of the prohibition on multiple damages as it related to the federal antitrust claim, effectively removed the conflict between the language of the arbitration agreement and the federal antitrust statute on this issue. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, we determined that, even though the presence of the damages limitation posed a question of arbitrability, it did not preclude enforcement of the arbitration agreement. <i>Id.</i> We thus ruled that the plaintiffs could recover treble damages in arbitration for federal antitrust violations.</p>\n<p>When we turned to the state antitrust provision, which specifies that \"the court may award up to three times the amount of actual damages sustained,\" Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, § 12, we concluded that Kristian had not established a question of arbitrability. <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 50. In reaching that conclusion, we explained that even though Massachusetts law used the word \"may\"  indicating that multiple damages were discretionary  there was still a direct conflict between the statutory provision and the arbitration agreement because the arbitration agreement precluded the exercise of discretion to award treble damages that the statute granted to the decision maker. <i>Id.</i> at 49. We then took a preliminary look at the waiver question  that is, whether a plaintiff such as Kristian could contractually waive the right to treble damages under Massachusetts law. In that analysis, we determined that \"Massachusetts law on this question of waiver [was] ambiguous at best\" because the statute made treble damages discretionary rather than mandatory and because the case law on whether remedies were contractually waivable under the statute was unsettled. <i>Id.</i> at 50. We therefore concluded that the arbitrator <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> would have to decide in the first instance whether there was a conflict between the arbitration agreement and the state law and whether that conflict made the arbitration agreement unenforceable. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We now turn to the different damages provision of Chapter 93A, which provides that a successful claimant is entitled to money damages, which \"may include double or treble damages,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3A) and specifies that \"recovery <i>shall</i> be in the amount of actual damages . . .; or up to three but not less than two times such amount if the court finds . . . a willful or knowing violation\" of the consumer protection act. <i>Id.</i> at § 9(3) (emphasis added). We note at the outset that this provision differs significantly from both the federal and state antitrust statutes at issue in <i>Kristian</i> because it neither mandates multiple damages in all instances of a violation (as does the federal antitrust statute), nor does it make multiple damages discretionary in all cases (as does the Massachusetts antitrust statute). Instead, it requires multiple damages only if a fact-finder determines that a \"willful or knowing violation\" occurred.</p>\n<p>Apparently conceding that the statute and the agreement conflict, Comcast argues that this conflict does not pose a question of arbitrability for two reasons. First, to the extent that the Massachusetts legislature made multiple damages permissive rather than mandatory, Comcast contends that we must follow our analysis of the state antitrust statute in <i>Kristian</i> and find that whether the provision is waivable is \"ambiguous at best.\" We would therefore be forced to conclude that this conflict raises no question of arbitrability and that the arbitrator must decide waivability in the first instance. Second, to the extent that Chapter 93A makes multiple damages mandatory if the arbitrator finds a willful or knowing violation, Comcast argues that it remains uncertain whether a conflict between the agreement and the statute will arise in this particular case because such a conflict is dependent upon the arbitrator's factual findings. In the face of this factual uncertainty, Comcast argues, there is no question of arbitrability for the court to decide.</p>\n<p>Comcast is correct on both points. We have previously recognized that where the existence of a conflict between a provision in an arbitration agreement and a statute depends upon an arbitrator's factual finding relating to the merits of the dispute, no question of arbitrability arises. In <i>Kristian,</i> we found that a possible conflict between the agreement's limitations period and the statute of limitations posed no question of arbitrability where the plaintiff alleged an ongoing injury because \"(1) whether Plaintiffs in fact suffer from an ongoing injury . . .; and (2) whether such injury . . . tolls the statute of limitations . . . would require an examination of the `merits of the case,' i.e., the facts, the province of the arbitrator.\" 446 F.3d at 44. Thus, whether the conflict between the agreement and the statute posed a question of arbitrability depended upon factual determinations within the arbitrator's purview. Here, with respect to the mandatory application of the multiple damages provision of the statute, there will be a conflict between that portion of the statute and the agreement only if the arbitrator finds a willful or knowing violation of the statute.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the arbitrator finds a violation of the statute that is not willful or knowing, there will be a direct conflict between the agreement and the multiple damages provision of the statute because a flat prohibition against multiple damages removes even the discretion to award them. <i>See id.</i> at 49. However, it is ambiguous whether Anderson's right to a discretionary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> multiple damages remedy is waivable under Massachusetts law for the same reasons it was ambiguous whether the plaintiff in <i>Kristian</i> could waive a discretionary treble damages award under the Massachusetts antitrust statute.</p>\n<p>In summary, despite the direct conflicts between the multiple damages provision of the statute and the multiple damages prohibition in the arbitration agreement, these conflicts do not pose a question of arbitrability because: (1) the conflict between the mandatory portion of the statute and the agreement will only arise if the arbitrator makes a factual finding (a willful or knowing violation) that relates to the merits of the dispute; and (2) if the arbitrator finds a violation of the statute that is not willful or knowing, the discretionary award of multiple damages may or may not be waivable under Massachusetts law. In the absence of a question of arbitrability, the district court erred in ordering that the multiple damages provision be severed from the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>C. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p>1. The Question of Arbitrability</p>\n<p>Although a four-year statute of limitations applies to Chapter 93A claims under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 260, § 5A, the arbitration agreement provides: \"YOU MUST CONTACT U.S. WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE . . . OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE A CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS OR DISPUTE.\" An apparent conflict therefore arises from the text of these provisions.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Kristian,</i> as just noted, when we faced a similar conflict between an explicit statutory time limit and the arbitration agreement's one-year limitation, we concluded that no question of arbitrability was posed because the question of tolling required an examination of facts relating to the merits of the dispute  a responsibility that belongs to the arbitrator. <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 44. Comcast suggests that there are equivalent factual disputes in this case regarding when Anderson discovered that he was being overcharged and whether Comcast fraudulently concealed the charges that might eliminate the conflict by bringing him within the agreement's one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>This argument is unpersuasive. Anderson alleges that he returned his cable box to Comcast in 2002 but did not file suit until 2005. Anderson's complaint can only be read as an acknowledgment that he did not comply with the arbitration agreement's one-year notice of claim provision. The portions of Anderson's complaint on which Comcast relies in attempting to establish a factual dispute do not purport to make a tolling argument and Comcast cannot impose one on Anderson for its own purposes. We therefore agree that Anderson has established a direct conflict between the statutory provision and the agreement.</p>\n<p>In the face of this direct conflict, we next make the preliminary waivability inquiry, as we did in <i>Kristian, id.</i> at 46-47 &amp; n. 15, i.e., we assess whether there is ambiguity on the question whether the statute of limitations can be contractually shortened. If there is ambiguity, the waivability question must be determined by the arbitrator in the first instance. For <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> the reasons that we explain more fully below, we find that there is not such ambiguity and we therefore conclude that this conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute of limitations raises a question of arbitrability.</p>\n<p>2. Waivability</p>\n<p>Seeking to convince us that the limitations period that applies to Chapter 93A claims can be contractually shortened, Comcast points out that Massachusetts permits the reduction of four-year statutes of limitation to one year in certain contexts (e.g., sale and lease contracts under the provisions of the Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code, (\"MUCC\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, §§ 2-725(1), 2A-506(1)). In addition, it notes that we have previously recognized this authority in the context of a claim brought under Chapter 93A, § 11. <i>See </i><i>Hays v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 930 F.2d 96, 100 (1st Cir.1991) (\"[A] one-year contractual limitations period, although brief, is valid and enforceable.\"). Section 11 allows \"[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" to bring suit for unfair trade practices. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 11. It is thus the commercial analog to the consumer remedy provided by Chapter 93A, § 9.</p>\n<p>Anderson seeks to distinguish between the MUCC's allowance of a truncated statute of limitations and <i>Hays</i> on the one hand, and consumer claims on the other, by pointing out that the MUCC provisions apply only to contracts for sale and defaults under a lease and <i>Hays</i> involved a transaction between commercial parties. The distinction between commercial and consumer claims is important in many contexts. Indeed, § 9 was adopted in 1969 to provide an effective private remedy to consumers, <i>see </i><i>Slaney v. Westwood Auto, Inc.,</i> 366 Mass. 688, 322 N.E.2d 768, 775-77 (1975); § 11 was adopted in 1972, in part to eliminate anticompetitive activity, <i>see </i><i>Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc.,</i> 8 Mass.App.Ct. 498, 396 N.E.2d 149, 152-53 (1979). Given their different origins and purposes, what is waivable under one section might not be waivable under the other.</p>\n<p>Chapter 93A does not itself contain a statute of limitations provision. Instead, the four-year period is specified in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 260, § 5A, which creates a four-year statute of limitations for \"[a]ctions arising on account of violations of any law intended for the protection of consumers, including . . . chapter ninety-three A.\" This provision was enacted in 1975, several years after both § 9 and § 11 were adopted. Chapter 93A claims such as Anderson's were originally subject to a two-year statute of limitations, which was extended to three years in 1973 before § 5A finally extended it to four years in 1975. <i>See </i><i>Baldassari v. Pub. Fin. Trust,</i> 369 Mass. 33, 337 N.E.2d 701, 708 (1975). The Massachusetts courts have interpreted the enactment of § 5A as part of a broader legislative scheme to \"remedy the imbalance which exists primarily because of a lack of parity in bargaining power between the consumer and the provider of consumer goods and services.\" <i>Mahoney v. Baldwin,</i> 27 Mass. App.Ct. 778, 543 N.E.2d 435, 437 (1989). The progressive lengthening of the statute of limitations, and the statutory language emphasizing the centrality of consumer protection, strongly suggest that the Massachusetts legislature did not intend this limitations period to be shortened by contract.</p>\n<p>In addressing the waivability of statutory remedies under § 11, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated in dicta that it \"ordinarily would not effectuate a <i>consumer's</i> waiver of rights under Chapter 93A.\" <i>Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> <i>Elec. Corp.,</i> 406 Mass. 369, 548 N.E.2d 182, 187 (1990). When we assessed the waivability of the discretionary multiple damages remedy under the state antitrust statute in <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 49-50, we characterized this language from <i>Canal</i> as \"hinting that waiver of statutory remedies will not be allowed in situations involving a consumer plaintiff and/or antitrust claims,\" <i>id.</i> at 50. However, because the statutory remedy at issue in that analysis was discretionary, we concluded that \"Massachusetts law on [the] question of waiver [was] ambiguous at best.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, where the progression of the law suggests that the Massachusetts legislature was concerned that a longer statute of limitations was required to allow consumers to effectuate their private cause of action under Chapter 93A, we find no such ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Our <i>Hays</i> case is readily distinguishable from the instant case both because it involved a contract between commercial parties, and also because the court in that case never mentioned the applicability of the four-year statute of limitations arising from § 5A. Moreover, unlike a discretionary damages remedy provided by statute, a statute of limitations often determines whether the consumer can seek any remedy at all. If that statute of limitations can be reduced from four years to one by agreement, the consumer loses a protection that is basic to all other consumer remedies. Given the language of the Supreme Judicial Court in <i>Canal,</i> and the importance accorded to the four-year statute of limitations for consumers by the legislature, we conclude that this four-year statute of limitations was not waivable by Anderson in his agreement with Comcast. The one-year statute of limitations in the agreement is thus incompatible with his statutory rights under Chapter 93A.</p>\n<p>3. Severance</p>\n<p>This unwaivable conflict between the statute and the arbitration agreement precludes enforcement of the agreement only if the problematic provision cannot be severed from it. <i>See </i><i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 48. The dispute resolution section of the arbitration agreement makes clear that the limitations period is severable:</p>\n<blockquote>If any portion of . . . this dispute resolution section[] is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision may be deleted or modified and the remainder of . . . this dispute resolution section[] shall be given full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p>Severing the one-year limitation provision  as the agreement allows us to do  preserves the viability of the arbitral forum. Put another way, arbitration can go forward, subject to the four-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>In his cross-appeal, Anderson also urges us to find the arbitration agreement unconscionable and therefore unenforceable as to both his statutory and common law claims. Anderson's primary unconscionability argument is inextricably bound to his vindication of statutory rights argument. That is, he argues that the conflict between numerous provisions of the agreement and Chapter 93A, and its related statute of limitations, demonstrates the agreement's one-sided nature and Comcast's determination to extinguish the procedural and substantive rights of its customers.</p>\n<p>We must reject this argument because of its faulty premise. We have found a direct, unwaivable conflict only between the four-year statute of limitations for consumer claims related to Chapter 93A and the one-year limitation provision of the arbitration agreement. With its severance provision, the arbitration agreement itself <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> anticipated such a possible conflict and explicitly stated that arbitration should go forward without the offending term. The district court found the prohibition against attorney's fees unenforceable in the arbitral forum. Comcast did not appeal that determination. For the reasons stated above, there is uncertainty whether the class action and multiple damages bars of the arbitration agreement will be enforceable or even implicated in the arbitration proceedings. Under these circumstances, there is no basis for finding the arbitration agreement unconscionable.</p>\n<p>To the extent that Anderson presents an unconscionability argument under Massachusetts law that is distinct from his vindication of statutory rights argument, we find that argument so undeveloped as to be waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> 199 F.3d 552, 563 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>In summary, we make the following rulings. On Comcast's appeal (docket # 06-2165), we vacate that portion of the order declaring the class action bar of the arbitration agreement invalid and severing it from the arbitration agreement; and we vacate that portion of the order declaring the multiple damages provision of the arbitration agreement invalid and severing it from the arbitration agreement. On Anderson's cross-appeal (docket # 06-2203), we vacate the order requiring the arbitrator to decide the enforceability of the arbitration agreement's one-year limitation provision; arbitration can only go forward with that provision severed from the agreement. We affirm the district court's order granting Comcast's motion to compel arbitration. We remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The arbitration agreement is contained within provisions eight to ten of a larger standard agreement entitled \"Notice to Customers Regarding Policies, Complaint Procedures &amp; Dispute Resolution.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The statute further states that \"a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.\" 47 U.S.C. § 543(f).</p>\n<p>[3]  Comcast is a corporation organized under Pennsylvania law, with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania. Anderson is a citizen of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>[4]  The original text of the arbitration agreement is all in capital letters. Throughout this opinion, when we reproduce text from the arbitration agreement, we will reproduce its capitalization scheme as well.</p>\n<p>[5]  The relevant language of the arbitration agreement states:\n</p>\n<p>The Company will pay for all reasonable arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses, except that YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS THAT YOU INCUR IN THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR EXPERT WITNESSES OR ATTORNEYS.</p>\n<p>[6]  Comcast does not appeal from the district court's ruling on attorney's fees.</p>\n<p>[7]  Comcast's appeal and Anderson's cross-appeal are separately docketed as # 06-2165 and # 06-2203, respectively.</p>\n<p>[8]  We note that Comcast renews its argument that the one-year provision in the arbitration agreement merely imposes a notice obligation on customers rather than a deadline for filing claims and therefore does not conflict with the statutory time limit. Our rejection of this argument in <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 43, is controlling here.</p>\n\n</div>",

Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9 (\"Chapter 93A\"), and various common law tort theories. Citing <i>Kristian,</i> the district court granted Comcast's motion to compel arbitration but only after severing provisions in the arbitration agreement prohibiting attorney's fees, double or treble damages and a class action remedy in the arbitral forum. It also specified that \"the arbitrator will have the power to determine the validity and applicability of the agreement's one-year statute of limitations.\"</p>\n<p>After carefully analyzing the alleged conflicts between the language of the arbitration agreement and the statutory provisions at issue under the framework established in <i>Kristian,</i> we conclude that only the conflict relating to the limitations period raises a question of arbitrability for the court to decide. We therefore vacate that portion of the district court's order compelling arbitration of the applicability of the contractual limitations period, and we conclude that the contractual limitations period is invalid as it relates to Anderson's Chapter 93A claim. However, that clause of the arbitration agreement is severable under the terms of the agreement; we therefore affirm the order compelling arbitration of Anderson's claims, absent that limitations clause. We also reverse that portion of the district court's order severing the agreement's class action provision and its bar on multiple damages awards. Those provisions did not pose questions of arbitrability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The facts in this case are undisputed. Carl Anderson, a Massachusetts resident, has been a cable service customer of Comcast Corporation since at least May 31, 1994. Until 2002, he leased a cable converter box and remote control in connection with his cable subscription even though he owned a cable-ready television or video cassette recorder. These unnecessary items were billed to him at approximately $4.30 per month.</p>\n<p>In November 2005, Anderson filed a putative class action in Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that the imposition of monthly rental fees on customers with cable-ready equipment violated Chapter 93A, in addition to violating general common law tort and contract law principles. Chapter 93A provides a cause of action to consumers who have been injured by an \"[u]nfair method[] of competition [or] unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2. Massachusetts courts have interpreted the terms of Chapter 93A broadly to include practices that \"fall[] `within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness.'\" <i>Lambert</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> <i>v. Fleet Nat'l Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></span>, 1097 (2007) (quoting <i>Wasserman v. Agnastopoulos,</i> 22 Mass. App.Ct. 672, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2183715\"><a href=\"/opinion/2183715/wasserman-v-agnastopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1986)). While asserting no federal causes of action, Anderson grounds his Chapter 93A unfair trade practice claim on allegations that Comcast: (1) violated a provision of the Federal Communications Act requiring that \"[a] cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name,\" 47 U.S.C. § 543(f),<sup>[2]</sup> and (2) failed to comply with regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission requiring cable providers to unscramble their basic programming signals so they can be received by customers with cable-ready equipment, 47 C.F.R. § 76.630(a). For the statutory claim, Anderson seeks treble damages and attorney's fees; for the common law claims, he seeks actual damages, punitive damages, and declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Anderson filed his action, Comcast filed an unopposed petition for removal to federal court on the basis of diversity.<sup>[3]</sup> Once in federal court, Comcast moved to compel arbitration under the arbitration agreement, which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote>IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE INFORMALLY ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED, WE HAVE AGREED TO BINDING ARBITRATION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW.<sup>[4]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to requiring customers to arbitrate their disputes with Comcast, the agreement requires that customers contact Comcast within a year of injury or waive any claim based on that injury; it requires customers to pay certain costs of arbitration, including their attorney's fees;<sup>[5]</sup> and it precludes arbitration on a class action basis and denies customers who prevail in arbitration multiple or punitive damages. Despite setting extensive limitations on a customer's recovery, the contract contains various clauses severing any terms that conflict with applicable law.</p>\n<p>Anderson objected to the motion, arguing that arbitration under the terms of the agreement would effectively deny to plaintiffs the ability to vindicate their statutory and common law rights. The district court, relying heavily on the framework and analysis of <i>Kristian v. Comcast, Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794138\"><a href=\"/opinion/794138/martha-kristian-and-james-d-masterman-v-comcast-corporation-comcast-mo/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006), granted Comcast's motion to compel arbitration, but only after determining that the agreement's provisions barring attorney's fees,<sup>[6]</sup> class actions, and multiple damages were \"invalid and severed\" as they related to Anderson's Chapter 93A claim. However, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> it held that the arbitrator had authority to determine whether the agreement's limitations period prevented Anderson from vindicating his statutory claim under Chapter 93A.</p>\n<p>In its appeal, Comcast argues that the district court erred in concluding that the arbitration agreement's bar on class actions and multiple damages awards were invalid as they related to Anderson's Chapter 93A claim, and it urges us to reverse that portion of the district court's order severing these provisions from the arbitration agreement. Anderson cross-appeals from the district court's order compelling arbitration, arguing that  while the court correctly found particular provisions of the arbitration agreement invalid as they relate to his claims  the court should have found the entire arbitration agreement unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.<sup>[7]</sup> In addition, he cross-appeals the district court's ruling that the validity of the arbitration agreement's one-year limitations period should be determined by the arbitrator. He argues instead that the conflict between that limitations period and Chapter 93A's four-year statute of limitations creates a direct conflict that must be resolved by the court in favor of the longer statutory period.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We consider these claims against the backdrop of a strong pro-arbitration policy expressed by Congress and repeatedly upheld by the courts. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as an effort to \"revers[e] centuries of judicial hostility to arbitration agreements, . . . to allow parties to avoid `the costliness and delays of litigation,' and to place arbitration agreements `upon the same footing as other contracts.'\" <i>Scherk v.

This judgment  that the question whether the parties have submitted a particular disagreement to arbitration is an issue for judicial determination  is based on the presumed intent of the contracting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> parties favoring judicial determination of such a question. The Court refers to this presumed intent as the \"interpretive rule.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Kristian v. Comcast, Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794138\"><a href=\"/opinion/794138/martha-kristian-and-james-d-masterman-v-comcast-corporation-comcast-mo/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2006). But the Court has cautioned against an overly expansive application of the interpretive rule:</p>\n<blockquote>Linguistically speaking, one might call any potentially dispositive gateway question a \"question of arbitrability,\" for its answer will determine whether the underlying controversy will proceed to arbitration on the merits. The Court's case law, however, makes clear that, for purposes of applying the interpretive rule, the phrase \"question of arbitrability\" has a far more limited scope. The Court has found the phrase applicable in the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter, where they are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so, and, consequently, where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Howsam,</i> 537 U.S. at 83-84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122248\"><a href=\"/opinion/122248/howsam-v-dean-witter-reynolds-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span> (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>One of the \"narrow circumstances\" that might raise a question of arbitrability involves an allegation by a party to an arbitration agreement that some of the terms in an arbitration agreement conflict with a statutory right that is not waivable by contract. If that claim withstands analysis, the court will have to decide whether the conflict precludes enforcement of the arbitration agreement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.

Alternatively, a party may challenge the enforceability of an arbitration agreement claiming that the agreement itself or some of its terms are unconscionable. <i>See id.</i> at 627 (\"[C]ourts should remain attuned to well-supported claims that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from the sort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would provide grounds `for the revocation of any contract.'\") (quoting 9 U.S.C. § 2).</p>\n<p>Anderson primarily raises a vindication of statutory rights argument as a defense to the obligation to arbitrate, claiming that Chapter 93A, and a related statute of limitations provision, preclude enforcement of the arbitration agreement.

We use the framework developed in <i>Kristian v. Comcast, Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794138\"><a href=\"/opinion/794138/martha-kristian-and-james-d-masterman-v-comcast-corporation-comcast-mo/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006) to first decide whether any of Anderson's challenges to the arbitration agreement pose questions of arbitrability.</p>\n<p>A. Class Bar</p>\n<p>We begin and end our analysis of the arbitration agreement's class bar by determining whether a conflict exists between the statute and the agreement. We find no conflict. With respect to class actions, the agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote>THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED UNLESS YOUR STATE'S LAWS PROVIDE OTHERWISE.</blockquote>\n<p>In <i>Kristian,</i> where we also assessed the validity of Comcast's bar on class arbitration, neither the state nor federal antitrust statute at issue mentioned the right of plaintiffs to proceed on a class basis. As a result, our analysis focused on whether the nature and purposes of antitrust law suggested a conflict, and we determined that, \"[b]ecause the denial of class arbitration in the pursuit of antitrust claims has the potential to prevent Plaintiffs from vindicating their statutory rights,\" <i>id.</i> at 55, such a conflict did exist. Here, however, Chapter 93A specifically provides for the class action procedure. It states: \"Any persons entitled to bring such action may . . . bring the action on behalf of himself and such other similarly injured and situated persons.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(2). Given this explicit statutory language, the relevant question here is whether Chapter 93A's class action provision is the kind of provision anticipated by the agreement's limiting language, \"unless your state's laws provide otherwise.\" If so, there is no conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute because the arbitration agreement, by its terms, permits arbitration to proceed on a class basis in the face of state law providing for such actions.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances, we find <i>PacifiCare Health Sys., Inc. v. Book,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127909\"><a href=\"/opinion/127909/pacificare-health-systems-inc-v-book/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 406-07, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127909\"><a href=\"/opinion/127909/pacificare-health-systems-inc-v-book/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span> (2003), instructive. There, the Supreme Court faced a potential conflict between an arbitration agreement that prohibited punitive damages and statutory language entitling plaintiff to treble damages. Reasoning that an arbitrator could interpret the agreement to avoid a direct conflict (i.e., by finding that treble damages were not necessarily \"punitive\"), the Court found no question of arbitrability and compelled arbitration. <i>Id.</i> Likewise here, to the extent there is any ambiguity as to whether Chapter 93A \"provides otherwise,\" the arbitrator must interpret the agreement in the first instance. <i>See id.,</i> at 407, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127909\"><a href=\"/opinion/127909/pacificare-health-systems-inc-v-book/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1531</span></a></span> (\"[S]ince we do not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations, the questions whether they render the parties' agreements unenforceable and whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance are unusually abstract. . . . [T]he proper course is to compel arbitration.\"). Thus, in light of the \"unless\" qualifier in the class action provision, we reject Anderson's contention that this provision raises a question of arbitrability and leave determination of the class action question in the first instance to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>B. Multiple Damages</p>\n<p>The district court determined that the agreement's proscription of multiple damages also improperly prevented plaintiffs from vindicating statutory rights under Chapter 93A. The relevant language of the agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR PUNITIVE, TREBLE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM OUR PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ANY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES TO YOU. . . . SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> APPLIES IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS, IF ANY, TO RECOVER ANY SUCH DAMAGES.</blockquote>\n<p>As a prelude to assessing the district court's ruling, we review our approach to this multiple damages prohibition in <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 44-50. There, we found a clear conflict between the language of the agreement and the federal antitrust statute, which requires that a plaintiff who established an antitrust injury \"shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained,\" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). Moreover, taking a preliminary look at whether the remedies provided by the antitrust statute could be contractually waived, we found no ambiguity on the waiver issue that would require deference to the arbitrator. <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 46-47 n. 15. Hence, we decided that the remedy stripping provision of the arbitration agreement posed a question of arbitrability  i.e., that the court rather than the arbitrator should decide in the first instance whether the conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute prevented Kristian from vindicating her statutory rights. <i>Id.</i> at 47-48.</p>\n<p>Addressing that question (which we define as the \"merits\" in a vindication of statutory rights defense to a motion to compel arbitration), we first explained why the award of treble damages under the federal antitrust statutes could not be waived. <i>Id.</i> We then noted that this unwaivable conflict suggested plaintiffs should prevail on their defense to arbitration. <i>Id.</i> at 48. However, we then focused on a \"savings clause\" in the arbitration agreement specifically providing that, if certain remedies could not be contractually waived under applicable law, a plaintiff could retain those remedies under the agreement despite any contractual clauses to the contrary. <i>Id.</i> That \"savings clause,\" by allowing severance of the prohibition on multiple damages as it related to the federal antitrust claim, effectively removed the conflict between the language of the arbitration agreement and the federal antitrust statute on this issue. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, we determined that, even though the presence of the damages limitation posed a question of arbitrability, it did not preclude enforcement of the arbitration agreement. <i>Id.</i> We thus ruled that the plaintiffs could recover treble damages in arbitration for federal antitrust violations.</p>\n<p>When we turned to the state antitrust provision, which specifies that \"the court may award up to three times the amount of actual damages sustained,\" Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, § 12, we concluded that Kristian had not established a question of arbitrability. <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 50. In reaching that conclusion, we explained that even though Massachusetts law used the word \"may\"  indicating that multiple damages were discretionary  there was still a direct conflict between the statutory provision and the arbitration agreement because the arbitration agreement precluded the exercise of discretion to award treble damages that the statute granted to the decision maker. <i>Id.</i> at 49. We then took a preliminary look at the waiver question  that is, whether a plaintiff such as Kristian could contractually waive the right to treble damages under Massachusetts law. In that analysis, we determined that \"Massachusetts law on this question of waiver [was] ambiguous at best\" because the statute made treble damages discretionary rather than mandatory and because the case law on whether remedies were contractually waivable under the statute was unsettled. <i>Id.</i> at 50. We therefore concluded that the arbitrator <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> would have to decide in the first instance whether there was a conflict between the arbitration agreement and the state law and whether that conflict made the arbitration agreement unenforceable. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We now turn to the different damages provision of Chapter 93A, which provides that a successful claimant is entitled to money damages, which \"may include double or treble damages,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3A) and specifies that \"recovery <i>shall</i> be in the amount of actual damages . . .; or up to three but not less than two times such amount if the court finds . . . a willful or knowing violation\" of the consumer protection act. <i>Id.</i> at § 9(3) (emphasis added). We note at the outset that this provision differs significantly from both the federal and state antitrust statutes at issue in <i>Kristian</i> because it neither mandates multiple damages in all instances of a violation (as does the federal antitrust statute), nor does it make multiple damages discretionary in all cases (as does the Massachusetts antitrust statute). Instead, it requires multiple damages only if a fact-finder determines that a \"willful or knowing violation\" occurred.</p>\n<p>Apparently conceding that the statute and the agreement conflict, Comcast argues that this conflict does not pose a question of arbitrability for two reasons. First, to the extent that the Massachusetts legislature made multiple damages permissive rather than mandatory, Comcast contends that we must follow our analysis of the state antitrust statute in <i>Kristian</i> and find that whether the provision is waivable is \"ambiguous at best.\" We would therefore be forced to conclude that this conflict raises no question of arbitrability and that the arbitrator must decide waivability in the first instance. Second, to the extent that Chapter 93A makes multiple damages mandatory if the arbitrator finds a willful or knowing violation, Comcast argues that it remains uncertain whether a conflict between the agreement and the statute will arise in this particular case because such a conflict is dependent upon the arbitrator's factual findings. In the face of this factual uncertainty, Comcast argues, there is no question of arbitrability for the court to decide.</p>\n<p>Comcast is correct on both points. We have previously recognized that where the existence of a conflict between a provision in an arbitration agreement and a statute depends upon an arbitrator's factual finding relating to the merits of the dispute, no question of arbitrability arises. In <i>Kristian,</i> we found that a possible conflict between the agreement's limitations period and the statute of limitations posed no question of arbitrability where the plaintiff alleged an ongoing injury because \"(1) whether Plaintiffs in fact suffer from an ongoing injury . . .; and (2) whether such injury . . . tolls the statute of limitations . . . would require an examination of the `merits of the case,' i.e., the facts, the province of the arbitrator.\" 446 F.3d at 44. Thus, whether the conflict between the agreement and the statute posed a question of arbitrability depended upon factual determinations within the arbitrator's purview. Here, with respect to the mandatory application of the multiple damages provision of the statute, there will be a conflict between that portion of the statute and the agreement only if the arbitrator finds a willful or knowing violation of the statute.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the arbitrator finds a violation of the statute that is not willful or knowing, there will be a direct conflict between the agreement and the multiple damages provision of the statute because a flat prohibition against multiple damages removes even the discretion to award them. <i>See id.</i> at 49. However, it is ambiguous whether Anderson's right to a discretionary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> multiple damages remedy is waivable under Massachusetts law for the same reasons it was ambiguous whether the plaintiff in <i>Kristian</i> could waive a discretionary treble damages award under the Massachusetts antitrust statute.</p>\n<p>In summary, despite the direct conflicts between the multiple damages provision of the statute and the multiple damages prohibition in the arbitration agreement, these conflicts do not pose a question of arbitrability because: (1) the conflict between the mandatory portion of the statute and the agreement will only arise if the arbitrator makes a factual finding (a willful or knowing violation) that relates to the merits of the dispute; and (2) if the arbitrator finds a violation of the statute that is not willful or knowing, the discretionary award of multiple damages may or may not be waivable under Massachusetts law. In the absence of a question of arbitrability, the district court erred in ordering that the multiple damages provision be severed from the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>C. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p>1. The Question of Arbitrability</p>\n<p>Although a four-year statute of limitations applies to Chapter 93A claims under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 260, § 5A, the arbitration agreement provides: \"YOU MUST CONTACT U.S. WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE . . . OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE A CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH EVENT, FACTS OR DISPUTE.\" An apparent conflict therefore arises from the text of these provisions.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Kristian,</i> as just noted, when we faced a similar conflict between an explicit statutory time limit and the arbitration agreement's one-year limitation, we concluded that no question of arbitrability was posed because the question of tolling required an examination of facts relating to the merits of the dispute  a responsibility that belongs to the arbitrator. <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 44. Comcast suggests that there are equivalent factual disputes in this case regarding when Anderson discovered that he was being overcharged and whether Comcast fraudulently concealed the charges that might eliminate the conflict by bringing him within the agreement's one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>This argument is unpersuasive. Anderson alleges that he returned his cable box to Comcast in 2002 but did not file suit until 2005. Anderson's complaint can only be read as an acknowledgment that he did not comply with the arbitration agreement's one-year notice of claim provision. The portions of Anderson's complaint on which Comcast relies in attempting to establish a factual dispute do not purport to make a tolling argument and Comcast cannot impose one on Anderson for its own purposes. We therefore agree that Anderson has established a direct conflict between the statutory provision and the agreement.</p>\n<p>In the face of this direct conflict, we next make the preliminary waivability inquiry, as we did in <i>Kristian, id.</i> at 46-47 &amp; n. 15, i.e., we assess whether there is ambiguity on the question whether the statute of limitations can be contractually shortened. If there is ambiguity, the waivability question must be determined by the arbitrator in the first instance. For <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> the reasons that we explain more fully below, we find that there is not such ambiguity and we therefore conclude that this conflict between the arbitration agreement and the statute of limitations raises a question of arbitrability.</p>\n<p>2. Waivability</p>\n<p>Seeking to convince us that the limitations period that applies to Chapter 93A claims can be contractually shortened, Comcast points out that Massachusetts permits the reduction of four-year statutes of limitation to one year in certain contexts (e.g., sale and lease contracts under the provisions of the Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code, (\"MUCC\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, §§ 2-725(1), 2A-506(1)). In addition, it notes that we have previously recognized this authority in the context of a claim brought under Chapter 93A, § 11. <i>See </i><i>Hays v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558942\"><a href=\"/opinion/558942/william-c-hays-etc-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 100 (1st Cir.1991) (\"[A] one-year contractual limitations period, although brief, is valid and enforceable.\"). Section 11 allows \"[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" to bring suit for unfair trade practices. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 11. It is thus the commercial analog to the consumer remedy provided by Chapter 93A, § 9.</p>\n<p>Anderson seeks to distinguish between the MUCC's allowance of a truncated statute of limitations and <i>Hays</i> on the one hand, and consumer claims on the other, by pointing out that the MUCC provisions apply only to contracts for sale and defaults under a lease and <i>Hays</i> involved a transaction between commercial parties. The distinction between commercial and consumer claims is important in many contexts. Indeed, § 9 was adopted in 1969 to provide an effective private remedy to consumers, <i>see </i><i>Slaney v. Westwood Auto, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2241832\"><a href=\"/opinion/2241832/slaney-v-westwood-auto-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2241832\"><a href=\"/opinion/2241832/slaney-v-westwood-auto-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span>, 775-77 (1975); § 11 was adopted in 1972, in part to eliminate anticompetitive activity, <i>see </i><i>Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc.,</i> 8 Mass.App.Ct. 498, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240417\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240417/levings-v-forbes-wallace-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 152-53 (1979). Given their different origins and purposes, what is waivable under one section might not be waivable under the other.</p>\n<p>Chapter 93A does not itself contain a statute of limitations provision. Instead, the four-year period is specified in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 260, § 5A, which creates a four-year statute of limitations for \"[a]ctions arising on account of violations of any law intended for the protection of consumers, including . . . chapter ninety-three A.\" This provision was enacted in 1975, several years after both § 9 and § 11 were adopted. Chapter 93A claims such as Anderson's were originally subject to a two-year statute of limitations, which was extended to three years in 1973 before § 5A finally extended it to four years in 1975. <i>See </i><i>Baldassari v. Pub. Fin. Trust,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2111246\"><a href=\"/opinion/2111246/baldassari-v-public-finance-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2111246\"><a href=\"/opinion/2111246/baldassari-v-public-finance-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>, 708 (1975). The Massachusetts courts have interpreted the enactment of § 5A as part of a broader legislative scheme to \"remedy the imbalance which exists primarily because of a lack of parity in bargaining power between the consumer and the provider of consumer goods and services.\" <i>Mahoney v. Baldwin,</i> 27 Mass. App.Ct. 778, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098266\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098266/mahoney-v-baldwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 437 (1989). The progressive lengthening of the statute of limitations, and the statutory language emphasizing the centrality of consumer protection, strongly suggest that the Massachusetts legislature did not intend this limitations period to be shortened by contract.</p>\n<p>In addressing the waivability of statutory remedies under § 11, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated in dicta that it \"ordinarily would not effectuate a <i>consumer's</i> waiver of rights under Chapter 93A.\" <i>Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> <i>Elec. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2208480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2208480/canal-electric-co-v-westinghouse-electric-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2208480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2208480/canal-electric-co-v-westinghouse-electric-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 187 (1990). When we assessed the waivability of the discretionary multiple damages remedy under the state antitrust statute in <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 49-50, we characterized this language from <i>Canal</i> as \"hinting that waiver of statutory remedies will not be allowed in situations involving a consumer plaintiff and/or antitrust claims,\" <i>id.</i> at 50. However, because the statutory remedy at issue in that analysis was discretionary, we concluded that \"Massachusetts law on [the] question of waiver [was] ambiguous at best.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, where the progression of the law suggests that the Massachusetts legislature was concerned that a longer statute of limitations was required to allow consumers to effectuate their private cause of action under Chapter 93A, we find no such ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Our <i>Hays</i> case is readily distinguishable from the instant case both because it involved a contract between commercial parties, and also because the court in that case never mentioned the applicability of the four-year statute of limitations arising from § 5A. Moreover, unlike a discretionary damages remedy provided by statute, a statute of limitations often determines whether the consumer can seek any remedy at all. If that statute of limitations can be reduced from four years to one by agreement, the consumer loses a protection that is basic to all other consumer remedies. Given the language of the Supreme Judicial Court in <i>Canal,</i> and the importance accorded to the four-year statute of limitations for consumers by the legislature, we conclude that this four-year statute of limitations was not waivable by Anderson in his agreement with Comcast. The one-year statute of limitations in the agreement is thus incompatible with his statutory rights under Chapter 93A.</p>\n<p>3. Severance</p>\n<p>This unwaivable conflict between the statute and the arbitration agreement precludes enforcement of the agreement only if the problematic provision cannot be severed from it. <i>See </i><i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 48. The dispute resolution section of the arbitration agreement makes clear that the limitations period is severable:</p>\n<blockquote>If any portion of . . . this dispute resolution section[] is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision may be deleted or modified and the remainder of . . . this dispute resolution section[] shall be given full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p>Severing the one-year limitation provision  as the agreement allows us to do  preserves the viability of the arbitral forum. Put another way, arbitration can go forward, subject to the four-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>In his cross-appeal, Anderson also urges us to find the arbitration agreement unconscionable and therefore unenforceable as to both his statutory and common law claims. Anderson's primary unconscionability argument is inextricably bound to his vindication of statutory rights argument. That is, he argues that the conflict between numerous provisions of the agreement and Chapter 93A, and its related statute of limitations, demonstrates the agreement's one-sided nature and Comcast's determination to extinguish the procedural and substantive rights of its customers.</p>\n<p>We must reject this argument because of its faulty premise. We have found a direct, unwaivable conflict only between the four-year statute of limitations for consumer claims related to Chapter 93A and the one-year limitation provision of the arbitration agreement. With its severance provision, the arbitration agreement itself <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> anticipated such a possible conflict and explicitly stated that arbitration should go forward without the offending term. The district court found the prohibition against attorney's fees unenforceable in the arbitral forum. Comcast did not appeal that determination. For the reasons stated above, there is uncertainty whether the class action and multiple damages bars of the arbitration agreement will be enforceable or even implicated in the arbitration proceedings. Under these circumstances, there is no basis for finding the arbitration agreement unconscionable.</p>\n<p>To the extent that Anderson presents an unconscionability argument under Massachusetts law that is distinct from his vindication of statutory rights argument, we find that argument so undeveloped as to be waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198440\"><a href=\"/opinion/198440/united-states-v-rosario-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 563 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>In summary, we make the following rulings. On Comcast's appeal (docket # 06-2165), we vacate that portion of the order declaring the class action bar of the arbitration agreement invalid and severing it from the arbitration agreement; and we vacate that portion of the order declaring the multiple damages provision of the arbitration agreement invalid and severing it from the arbitration agreement. On Anderson's cross-appeal (docket # 06-2203), we vacate the order requiring the arbitrator to decide the enforceability of the arbitration agreement's one-year limitation provision; arbitration can only go forward with that provision severed from the agreement. We affirm the district court's order granting Comcast's motion to compel arbitration. We remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The arbitration agreement is contained within provisions eight to ten of a larger standard agreement entitled \"Notice to Customers Regarding Policies, Complaint Procedures &amp; Dispute Resolution.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The statute further states that \"a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.\" 47 U.S.C. § 543(f).</p>\n<p>[3]  Comcast is a corporation organized under Pennsylvania law, with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania. Anderson is a citizen of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>[4]  The original text of the arbitration agreement is all in capital letters. Throughout this opinion, when we reproduce text from the arbitration agreement, we will reproduce its capitalization scheme as well.</p>\n<p>[5]  The relevant language of the arbitration agreement states:\n</p>\n<p>The Company will pay for all reasonable arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses, except that YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS THAT YOU INCUR IN THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR EXPERT WITNESSES OR ATTORNEYS.</p>\n<p>[6]  Comcast does not appeal from the district court's ruling on attorney's fees.</p>\n<p>[7]  Comcast's appeal and Anderson's cross-appeal are separately docketed as # 06-2165 and # 06-2203, respectively.</p>\n<p>[8]  We note that Comcast renews its argument that the one-year provision in the arbitration agreement merely imposes a notice obligation on customers rather than a deadline for filing claims and therefore does not conflict with the statutory time limit. Our rejection of this argument in <i>Kristian,</i> 446 F.3d at 43, is controlling here.</p>\n\n</div>",
