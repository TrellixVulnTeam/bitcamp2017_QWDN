Plaintiffs-Appellants Northern\n\nVoyager Limited Partnership (\"Northern Voyager\") and OneBeacon\n\nAmerica Insurance Company appeal the dismissal of their claims\n\nagainst Defendants-Appellants Cross Sound Ferry (\"Cross Sound\") and\n\nits president, John Wronowski, in litigation related to the 1997\n\nsinking of the F/T NORTHERN VOYAGER (\"NORTHERN VOYAGER\").             The\n\ndistrict court determined that the plaintiffs, who alleged two\n\nviolations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A for unfair trade practices,\n\nfailed to state a claim for which relief can be granted.         We agree.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            The NORTHERN VOYAGER sank off the coast of Gloucester,\n\nMassachusetts on November 2, 1997.       The sinking was the result of\n\nan allegedly faulty rudder dropping out of the vessel, causing\n\nsevere flooding aboard the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n            The NORTHERN VOYAGER, and a sister ship, the F/T NORTHERN\n\nTRAVELER (\"NORTHERN TRAVELER\") were managed by Atlantic Trawlers,\n\nInc., principally by its employee, Jerry Shervo.        At some point in\n\n1997, Shervo contacted Thames Shipyard & Repair Company (\"Thames\")\n\nto have repair work performed on the two vessels.       Thames is owned\n\nand operated by John Wronowski, who also owns Cross Sound.         Thames\n\nagreed to perform repair work on the NORTHERN VOYAGER and NORTHERN\n\nTRAVELER;    the   repair   work   included,    among    other    things,\n\nwithdrawing, refurbishing and reinstalling both rudders in each\n\nvessel.   During the course of these repairs, the appellants allege\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthat two separate incidents occurred which constituted unfair trade\n\npractices by the appellees.       For clarity's sake, we will present\n\nthe appellants' two factual scenarios separately and then assess\n\nwhether either scenario is sufficient to support a claim under\n\nChapter 93A.\n\n          1.        Cross Sound's Subordination of the\n                    NORTHERN VOYAGER's Service Needs\n\n          The NORTHERN VOYAGER and NORTHERN TRAVELER were delivered\n\nto Thames's shipyard in May and June of 1997 and were raised on\n\ndrydock together with a third vessel, the NEW LONDON.            The NEW\n\nLONDON is a passenger and freight ferry owned and operated by\n\nWronowski and Cross Sound.        To remove a vessel from drydock, a\n\ndrydock must be flooded to permit the vessel to float free of the\n\ndock.   Consequently, when vessels share a drydock, none of the\n\nvessels can be returned to service until the repair work for all of\n\nthem is complete, since prematurely flooding the drydock would also\n\nflood any vessel that still had holes in its hull.\n\n          Thames completed its repairs of the NEW LONDON prior to\n\ncompleting   work   on   the   NORTHERN   VOYAGER.   According   to   the\n\nappellants, Wronowski and Cross Sound diverted work away from the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER in favor of completing work on the NEW LONDON.\n\nFurther, the appellants claim that appellees caused the work on the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER to be hastened to allow the drydock to be flooded,\n\nso that Wronowski could return the NEW LONDON to service more\n\nquickly. According to appellants, the appellees' haste resulted in\n\n                                   -3-\n\fimproper   performance   on    the   work    of   the    NORTHERN      VOYAGER's\n\nstarboard rudder.     Therefore, under the appellants' theory, the\n\nsubordination of NORTHERN VOYAGER's interests to those of the NEW\n\nLONDON should be deemed an unfair business practice that eventually\n\nresulted in the loss of the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n           2.      Failure to Disclose Information Relevant\n                   to the Condition of the NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\n           The   appellees    performed     similar     rudder   work    on   the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER's sister ship, the NORTHERN TRAVELER, a few weeks\n\nprior to the repairs on the NORTHERN VOYAGER.           In October 1997, the\n\nNORTHERN TRAVELER began to experience steering problems.                   Cross\n\nSound supervisor Tom Shaughnessy was sent out to investigate.                  It\n\nturned out that the steering problem was caused by the loosening of\n\na retaining nut on the vessel's port rudder. The nut had loosened\n\nto the point that the NORTHERN TRAVELER's rudder was on the verge\n\nof dropping out of the vessel.\n\n           Shaughnessy   notified      Wronowski        about    the    NORTHERN\n\nTRAVELER's rudder problem.       Wronowski dispatched Brian Laffey, a\n\nCross Sound employee, to correct the problem.             Laffey boarded the\n\nNORTHERN TRAVELER, raised the rudder, tightened the rudder nut, and\n\nsecured it by welding it into place.\n\n           When Shervo became aware that the rudder nut had been\n\nimproperly secured by Thames during the May repairs, he asked\n\nShaughnessy if he should arrange to bring the NORTHERN VOYAGER into\n\nport to have her rudders checked.          Shaughnessy told him that this\n\n                                     -4-\n\fwas unnecessary because the problem with the NORTHERN TRAVELER's\n\nport rudder was a one-time anomaly.\n\n           Nevertheless, despite Shaughnessy's reassurances, there\n\nis some evidence that he and Laffey considered the rudder-nut\n\nproblem to be more than a mere one-time anomaly.                     Laffey had\n\nconcerns about the NORTHERN TRAVELER's other rudder.                As a result,\n\nhe sought permission from Shaughnessy to inspect the NORTHERN\n\nTRAVELER's     starboard   rudder.         Shaughnessey        authorized    the\n\ninspection and Laffey tightened and rewelded the starboard rudder\n\nnut to prevent it from loosening.\n\n           The    appellants   claim   that   no    one      from   Thames   ever\n\ninformed   them   of   Laffey's   concerns.        It   is    the   appellants'\n\ncontention that Cross Sound and Wronowski had a duty to inform\n\nShervo of the likelihood that the NORTHERN VOYAGER was at risk of\n\nexperiencing the same rudder problem as the NORTHERN TRAVELER.\n\nAccordingly, the appellants argue that Shaughnessy's statement that\n\nthe rudder nut problem was a one-time anomaly, combined with his\n\nfailure to notify Shervo of the additional repair work performed by\n\nLaffey, deprived the appellants of the opportunity to perform the\n\nsame preventative maintenance on the NORTHERN VOYAGER's rudders as\n\nhad been performed on the NORTHERN TRAVELER's starboard rudder.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             We review the district court's findings of fact for clear\n\nerror and its conclusions of law de novo.           E.g., Commercial Union\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fIns. Co. v. Seven Provinces Ins. Co., 217 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). While the question of \"whether a particular set of acts, in\n\ntheir factual setting, is unfair or deceptive is a question of\n\nfact, the boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a\n\n[Chapter 93A] violation is a question of law.\" Saint-Gobain Indus.\n\nCeramics   v.   Wellons,   Inc.,   246    F.3d   64,   73   (1st   Cir.   2001)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n           1.      Chapter 93A Standard\n\n           Chapter 93A grants a cause of action to persons engaged\n\nin commerce who suffer a loss because of \"[u]nfair methods of\n\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\n\nconduct of any trade or commerce.\"         Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, ยง 2.\n\nThough the statute does not define the term \"unfair,\" courts\n\napplying Chapter 93A have established that a claimant must show\n\n\"objectionable conduct [that] must attain a level of rascality that\n\nwould raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of\n\nthe world of commerce.\"      Saint-Gobain, 246 F.3d at 73 (quotation\n\nomitted); Leings v. Forbes & Wallace, Inc., 396 N.E.2d 149, 153\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1979).        Mere negligence is not sufficient to\n\ntrigger liability under the statute; instead, the statute was\n\nenacted to punish \"truly inequitable marketplace behavior\" that\n\n\"unmistakably reeks of callousness.\"         Vmark Software, Inc. v. EMC\n\nCorp., 642 N.E.2d 587, 597 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (quotations and\n\ncitations omitted).    Thus, in order to prevail under the statute,\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fa claimant must show that the defendant's conduct falls \"'within at\n\nleast   the    penumbra      of   some   common-law,   statutory,   or   other\n\nestablished concept of unfairness' or is 'immoral, oppressive or\n\nunscrupulous'\" PMP Assoc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 321 N.E.2d 915,\n\n917 (1975), (quoted in Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 85\n\nF.3d 752, 769 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n              2.      Discussion\n\n              The district court concluded that neither of the factual\n\nscenarios described by the appellant set forth facts sufficient to\n\nsupport a claim under Chapter 93A.             We agree.    While the repair\n\nwork performed on the two vessels obviously left much to be\n\ndesired, nothing in the record or in either of the appellants' two\n\nscenarios demonstrates any conduct by Wronowski or Cross Sound that\n\nrises   to    the    level   of   \"rascality,\"    \"callousness,\"    or   \"truly\n\ninequitable marketplace behavior\" required by the statute.\n\n              Even   assuming     that   the   appellants   subordinated   the\n\ninterests of the NORTHERN VOYAGER in favor of the NEW LONDON by\n\nrushing the former's repair schedule, this is not the type of\n\nbehavior Chapter 93A was intended to punish.            The statute does not\n\ncreate a cause of action for a breach of contract alone unless it\n\nrises to the level of \"commercial extortion\" or a similar degree of\n\nculpable conduct. Commercial Union, 217 F.3d at 40.                 Likewise,\n\n\"breach of warranty alone does not necessarily give rise to a\n\nChapter 93A violation.\"           Saint-Gobain, 246 F.3d at 73.      At most,\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthe appellants' subordination scenario may support a possible\n\ninterference with contractual relations claim; however, even if the\n\nappellants could establish an interference claim, we concur with\n\nthe district court that they have not carried their burden of\n\nshowing callousness or truly inequitable marketplace behavior.\n\n             Likewise, vague allegations of the appellees' duty to\n\ndisclose the possible rudder problem on the NORTHERN VOYAGER do not\n\nrise to the necessary level of rascality required by the statute.\n\nWhile the incident may have proved a basis for a negligence claim\n\nagainst Wronowski or Thames, negligence alone is insufficient to\n\ncreate liability under the statute.        Vmark Software, 642 N.E.2d at\n\n597.\n\n           Finally, appellants also allege that the district court\n\nabused   its   discretion   by   denying   their   motion   to   amend   the\n\ncomplaint.     Having considered appellants' arguments and reviewed\n\nthe record, we find that the court's decision was entirely within\n\nits discretion.    See LaRocca v. Borden, Inc., 276 F.3d 22, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n                                   III.\n\n           Because Northern Voyager and OneBeacon have not carried\n\ntheir burden under the statute, we do not find that any of the\n\nappellees' conduct constitutes unfair trade practices under Chapter\n\n93A.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

Plaintiffs-Appellants Northern\n\nVoyager Limited Partnership (\"Northern Voyager\") and OneBeacon\n\nAmerica Insurance Company appeal the dismissal of their claims\n\nagainst Defendants-Appellants Cross Sound Ferry (\"Cross Sound\") and\n\nits president, John Wronowski, in litigation related to the 1997\n\nsinking of the F/T NORTHERN VOYAGER (\"NORTHERN VOYAGER\").             The\n\ndistrict court determined that the plaintiffs, who alleged two\n\nviolations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A for unfair trade practices,\n\nfailed to state a claim for which relief can be granted.         We agree.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            The NORTHERN VOYAGER sank off the coast of Gloucester,\n\nMassachusetts on November 2, 1997.       The sinking was the result of\n\nan allegedly faulty rudder dropping out of the vessel, causing\n\nsevere flooding aboard the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n            The NORTHERN VOYAGER, and a sister ship, the F/T NORTHERN\n\nTRAVELER (\"NORTHERN TRAVELER\") were managed by Atlantic Trawlers,\n\nInc., principally by its employee, Jerry Shervo.        At some point in\n\n1997, Shervo contacted Thames Shipyard & Repair Company (\"Thames\")\n\nto have repair work performed on the two vessels.       Thames is owned\n\nand operated by John Wronowski, who also owns Cross Sound.         Thames\n\nagreed to perform repair work on the NORTHERN VOYAGER and NORTHERN\n\nTRAVELER;    the   repair   work   included,    among    other    things,\n\nwithdrawing, refurbishing and reinstalling both rudders in each\n\nvessel.   During the course of these repairs, the appellants allege\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthat two separate incidents occurred which constituted unfair trade\n\npractices by the appellees.       For clarity's sake, we will present\n\nthe appellants' two factual scenarios separately and then assess\n\nwhether either scenario is sufficient to support a claim under\n\nChapter 93A.\n\n          1.        Cross Sound's Subordination of the\n                    NORTHERN VOYAGER's Service Needs\n\n          The NORTHERN VOYAGER and NORTHERN TRAVELER were delivered\n\nto Thames's shipyard in May and June of 1997 and were raised on\n\ndrydock together with a third vessel, the NEW LONDON.            The NEW\n\nLONDON is a passenger and freight ferry owned and operated by\n\nWronowski and Cross Sound.        To remove a vessel from drydock, a\n\ndrydock must be flooded to permit the vessel to float free of the\n\ndock.   Consequently, when vessels share a drydock, none of the\n\nvessels can be returned to service until the repair work for all of\n\nthem is complete, since prematurely flooding the drydock would also\n\nflood any vessel that still had holes in its hull.\n\n          Thames completed its repairs of the NEW LONDON prior to\n\ncompleting   work   on   the   NORTHERN   VOYAGER.   According   to   the\n\nappellants, Wronowski and Cross Sound diverted work away from the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER in favor of completing work on the NEW LONDON.\n\nFurther, the appellants claim that appellees caused the work on the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER to be hastened to allow the drydock to be flooded,\n\nso that Wronowski could return the NEW LONDON to service more\n\nquickly. According to appellants, the appellees' haste resulted in\n\n                                   -3-\n\fimproper   performance   on    the   work    of   the    NORTHERN      VOYAGER's\n\nstarboard rudder.     Therefore, under the appellants' theory, the\n\nsubordination of NORTHERN VOYAGER's interests to those of the NEW\n\nLONDON should be deemed an unfair business practice that eventually\n\nresulted in the loss of the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n           2.      Failure to Disclose Information Relevant\n                   to the Condition of the NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\n           The   appellees    performed     similar     rudder   work    on   the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER's sister ship, the NORTHERN TRAVELER, a few weeks\n\nprior to the repairs on the NORTHERN VOYAGER.           In October 1997, the\n\nNORTHERN TRAVELER began to experience steering problems.                   Cross\n\nSound supervisor Tom Shaughnessy was sent out to investigate.                  It\n\nturned out that the steering problem was caused by the loosening of\n\na retaining nut on the vessel's port rudder. The nut had loosened\n\nto the point that the NORTHERN TRAVELER's rudder was on the verge\n\nof dropping out of the vessel.\n\n           Shaughnessy   notified      Wronowski        about    the    NORTHERN\n\nTRAVELER's rudder problem.       Wronowski dispatched Brian Laffey, a\n\nCross Sound employee, to correct the problem.             Laffey boarded the\n\nNORTHERN TRAVELER, raised the rudder, tightened the rudder nut, and\n\nsecured it by welding it into place.\n\n           When Shervo became aware that the rudder nut had been\n\nimproperly secured by Thames during the May repairs, he asked\n\nShaughnessy if he should arrange to bring the NORTHERN VOYAGER into\n\nport to have her rudders checked.          Shaughnessy told him that this\n\n                                     -4-\n\fwas unnecessary because the problem with the NORTHERN TRAVELER's\n\nport rudder was a one-time anomaly.\n\n           Nevertheless, despite Shaughnessy's reassurances, there\n\nis some evidence that he and Laffey considered the rudder-nut\n\nproblem to be more than a mere one-time anomaly.                     Laffey had\n\nconcerns about the NORTHERN TRAVELER's other rudder.                As a result,\n\nhe sought permission from Shaughnessy to inspect the NORTHERN\n\nTRAVELER's     starboard   rudder.         Shaughnessey        authorized    the\n\ninspection and Laffey tightened and rewelded the starboard rudder\n\nnut to prevent it from loosening.\n\n           The    appellants   claim   that   no    one      from   Thames   ever\n\ninformed   them   of   Laffey's   concerns.        It   is    the   appellants'\n\ncontention that Cross Sound and Wronowski had a duty to inform\n\nShervo of the likelihood that the NORTHERN VOYAGER was at risk of\n\nexperiencing the same rudder problem as the NORTHERN TRAVELER.\n\nAccordingly, the appellants argue that Shaughnessy's statement that\n\nthe rudder nut problem was a one-time anomaly, combined with his\n\nfailure to notify Shervo of the additional repair work performed by\n\nLaffey, deprived the appellants of the opportunity to perform the\n\nsame preventative maintenance on the NORTHERN VOYAGER's rudders as\n\nhad been performed on the NORTHERN TRAVELER's starboard rudder.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             We review the district court's findings of fact for clear\n\nerror and its conclusions of law de novo.

Discussion\n\n              The district court concluded that neither of the factual\n\nscenarios described by the appellant set forth facts sufficient to\n\nsupport a claim under Chapter 93A.             We agree.    While the repair\n\nwork performed on the two vessels obviously left much to be\n\ndesired, nothing in the record or in either of the appellants' two\n\nscenarios demonstrates any conduct by Wronowski or Cross Sound that\n\nrises   to    the    level   of   \"rascality,\"    \"callousness,\"    or   \"truly\n\ninequitable marketplace behavior\" required by the statute.\n\n              Even   assuming     that   the   appellants   subordinated   the\n\ninterests of the NORTHERN VOYAGER in favor of the NEW LONDON by\n\nrushing the former's repair schedule, this is not the type of\n\nbehavior Chapter 93A was intended to punish.            The statute does not\n\ncreate a cause of action for a breach of contract alone unless it\n\nrises to the level of \"commercial extortion\" or a similar degree of\n\nculpable conduct. Commercial Union, 217 F.3d at 40.                 Likewise,\n\n\"breach of warranty alone does not necessarily give rise to a\n\nChapter 93A violation.\"           Saint-Gobain, 246 F.3d at 73.      At most,\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthe appellants' subordination scenario may support a possible\n\ninterference with contractual relations claim; however, even if the\n\nappellants could establish an interference claim, we concur with\n\nthe district court that they have not carried their burden of\n\nshowing callousness or truly inequitable marketplace behavior.\n\n             Likewise, vague allegations of the appellees' duty to\n\ndisclose the possible rudder problem on the NORTHERN VOYAGER do not\n\nrise to the necessary level of rascality required by the statute.\n\nWhile the incident may have proved a basis for a negligence claim\n\nagainst Wronowski or Thames, negligence alone is insufficient to\n\ncreate liability under the statute.        Vmark Software, 642 N.E.2d at\n\n597.\n\n           Finally, appellants also allege that the district court\n\nabused   its   discretion   by   denying   their   motion   to   amend   the\n\ncomplaint.     Having considered appellants' arguments and reviewed\n\nthe record, we find that the court's decision was entirely within\n\nits discretion.    See LaRocca v.
