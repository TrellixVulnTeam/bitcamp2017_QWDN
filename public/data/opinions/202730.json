William Fryar appeals several\n\nmatters arising from his civil jury trial against Sergeant William\n\nCurtis, a corrections officer at the Suffolk County House of\n\nCorrection (“SCHOC”).       According to the complaint, while Fryar was\n\nincarcerated at SCHOC, Sergeant Curtis physically abused him,\n\nviolating    his   state    and    federal    constitutional     rights    and\n\ncommitting common law assault and battery against him.               The case\n\nstarted as a class action, which involved numerous plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants and numerous incidents that allegedly occurred at SCHOC.\n\nAs ultimately tried, and by agreement of the parties, the trial\n\ndetermined only Fryar’s claims against Curtis individually, and the\n\ntrial resulted in a jury verdict in favor of Curtis.              On appeal,\n\nFryar challenges the district court’s decisions to have the case\n\nproceed against a single defendant, Curtis, and not to instruct the\n\njury or allow comments by counsel on the previous status of the\n\ncase as a class action.      Fryar further challenges the exclusion at\n\ntrial of a report by a special commission that investigated the\n\nprison, for use in general and for purposes of impeachment.                 We\n\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n     Fryar    suffers      from   muscular    dystrophy,     a   progressive\n\ndegenerative genetic disease that affects muscle strength, and\n\nwhich   resulted   in   numerous    sudden    falls.    In   1998,    he   was\n\nincarcerated at SCHOC for the offense of drug possession.              He was\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fhoused in a drug recovery unit known as “the 3-4 Unit.”\n\n       At the time of the incident giving rise to this lawsuit,\n\nSergeant Curtis and two other officers were assigned to the 3-4\n\nUnit.    On June 14, 1998, at 1 p.m., the cell doors were opened by\n\na remote panel to release the inmates for a recreational period.\n\nAfter five minutes, Curtis proceeded to close and secure the doors,\n\npursuant to SCHOC practice.     As he approached cell 7 or cell 8, he\n\nheard five or six loud bangs and proceeded to investigate.      As he\n\napproached cell 12, the cell door opened and two inmates stepped\n\nout.     He told them to “step back inside.”     One of the inmates\n\ncomplied and the other, Fryar, refused.      Without success, Curtis\n\nordered Fryar two additional times to step back into his cell.\n\n       Instead of stepping back, according to Curtis, Fryar put his\n\nhand up towards Curtis’ face.    Curtis closed the cell door and told\n\nFryar to get against the wall, and placed his hand out on Fryar’s\n\nright shoulder blade.      Then, as Curtis testified, Fryar “just\n\nfell.”     When the nurse who arrived on the scene asked what\n\nhappened, Fryar “didn’t say anything else but, ‘I fell down.’”\n\nFryar was taken for emergency medical treatment and was admitted to\n\nthe institutional infirmary.    Curtis’ description of the incident,\n\nas just recounted, is to be contrasted with Fryar's allegation in\n\nthe complaint, that:\n\n       Curtis came into Mr. Fryar's[] room, grabbed him by the\n       hair and drove his face into a wall several times. The\n       force of the beating was tremendous, causing a tooth to\n       be dislodged, another tooth to break apart and his lip to\n\n                                  -3-\n\f     split open. After the beating, . . . Curtis told [the\n     nurse] that Mr. Fryar hurt himself by falling.\n\nOffering this account, Fryar filed suit in Suffolk County Superior\n\nCourt as one of fifty-five former and current inmates in a class\n\naction    against    eighty-six       defendants,      including    individual\n\ncorrections officers and supervisory personnel at SCHOC.                   The\n\nplaintiffs      alleged,    among   other    things,   violations    of   their\n\nconstitutional rights under the state and federal Constitutions,\n\nassault   and    battery,    and    intentional   infliction   of   emotional\n\ndistress.\n\n     On May 15, 2000, the action was removed to federal district\n\ncourt. The plaintiffs thereafter amended their complaint and filed\n\ntwo complaints, the Third Amended Complaint, Part I (the “Class\n\nAction Complaint”) and the Third Amended Complaint, Part II (the\n\n“Individual Plaintiffs’ Complaint”). On May 10, 2005, the district\n\ncourt dismissed the Class Action Complaint with prejudice upon\n\napproval of a settlement agreement.\n\n     On May 25, 2005, the district court held a status conference\n\nand ordered the plaintiffs’ counsel to choose five individual cases\n\nfrom the Individual Plaintiffs’ Complaint, from which the first\n\ncase to be tried would be selected.            The parties submitted final\n\npretrial memoranda memorializing the sole claim to be tried first:\n\nFryar’s claim against Sergeant Curtis arising out of the incident\n\nof June 14, 1998.\n\n     On October 23, 2005, Curtis filed a motion in limine to\n\n                                       -4-\n\fexclude evidence of a commissioned investigative report of the\n\nprison (the “Stern Report”), arguing that the report was hearsay\n\nand not probative.    Fryar’s counsel stated that he did not plan to\n\nadduce evidence of the Stern Report, except potentially indirectly,\n\nand he agreed to inform the court before doing so.\n\n     At the same time, Fryar’s counsel asked that evidence be\n\nadmitted relating to the alleged misconduct of officers other than\n\nCurtis.   Curtis’ counsel argued in response that “[a]ny mention of\n\nthe other 54 plaintiffs and 85 defendants would severely prejudice\n\nthe jury and draw [a] negative inference.”              The district court\n\ninformed the jury:\n\n     Although there were, and are, complaints by other inmates\n     against other corrections officers for incidents during\n     this same general period of time, for you the only\n     question – the only question that you will need to\n     address is whether this corrections officer, Mr. Curtis,\n     did violate this plaintiff, Mr. Fryar’s constitutional\n     rights, okay?\n\nThe court also reiterated its statement that “[t]his case . . .\n\nconcerns one plaintiff, Mr. William Fryar, who complains that one\n\ncorrections   officer,   Mr.    Curtis,      violated   his   constitutional\n\nrights, his rights under the Federal Constitution and his rights\n\nunder the State constitution by hitting his head against the wall\n\nand kicking him.”\n\n     During   the    course    of   trial,    the   defense   called   SCHOC\n\nSuperintendent Gerard Horgan to the stand, who testified to, among\n\nother things, the training of Curtis and other officers at SCHOC.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fThe court sua sponte inquired into the relevance of this testimony.\n\nShortly thereafter, counsel for Fryar requested permission to\n\nimpeach Horgan’s testimony regarding training of the officers and\n\nthe conditions at SCHOC by reference to the Stern Report, and the\n\ndistrict court denied this request.\n\n      On October 28, 2005, in accordance with the verdict, judgment\n\nwas entered in favor of defendant Curtis on all counts, and Fryar\n\nthereafter filed a timely notice of appeal.1\n\nII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      We review for abuse of discretion a district court’s decisions\n\nregarding the admissibility of evidence.    Ramirez v. Debs-Elias,\n\n407 F.3d 444, 449 (1st Cir. 2005); Lubanski v. Coleco Indus., Inc.,\n\n\n      1\n          Fryar’s appellate brief does not comply with Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure 28 and 30, in that, for example, it\ndoes not include “a statement of facts relevant to the issues\nsubmitted for review with appropriate references to the record,”\nFed. R. App. P. 28(a)(7) (emphasis added), and Fryar did not\n\"prepare and file an appendix to the briefs.\"      Fed. R. App. P.\n30(a). Although Fryar filed documents as an addendum to the Blue\nBrief, First Circuit Local Rule (\"L.R.\") 28, which requires\nappellants to file addenda, operates independently of the\nrequirement to file an appendix pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 30.\nSee L.R. 28(a)(1); Fed. R. App. P. 30(a)(1)(A)-(D).\n     Where an appellant has provided defective briefs, “‘the court\nin its discretion . . . may scrutinize the merits of the case\ninsofar as the record permits, or may dismiss the appeal if the\nabsence of a [record] thwarts intelligent review.’” Credit Francais\nInt'l, S.A. v. Bio-Vita, Ltd., 78 F.3d 698, 700 (1st Cir. 1996)\n(quoting Moore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1995))\n(alterations in original). Given the appendix provided by Curtis,\nthere is a sufficient record to reach the merits, see id., and we\nchoose to do so. Because, however, appellant has failed to provide\na compliant statement of facts, we resolve any ambiguities against\nhim.   See Alberty-Velez v. Corporacion de Puerto Rico Para La\nDifusion Publica, 361 F.3d 1, 4 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                -6-\n\f929 F.2d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 1991).              “Erroneous evidentiary rulings\n\nare harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not affect\n\nthe outcome of the case.”         McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8,\n\n19-20   (1st    Cir.   2006).      In    addition,       “[c]hallenges       to   jury\n\ninstructions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.”                         United\n\nStates v. Figueroa-Encarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nIII. FAILURE TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION\n\n      Fryar argues that the district court erred by failing to allow\n\nthe case to proceed against various supervisory officials.                         As\n\nclarified at oral argument, however, Fryar concedes that the case\n\nproceeded only against defendant Curtis, rather than against all of\n\nthe   original    defendants,     by    agreement       of   the   parties.       This\n\naffirmative      agreement   to    proceed     against       Curtis    alone   waived\n\nFryar’s right to review on this issue.                “An issue is waived when a\n\ndefendant intentionally relinquishes or abandons a legal right.”\n\nUnited States v. Hansen, 434 F.3d 92, 101 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding\n\njury instruction issue waived when the defendant indicated, “I am\n\ncontent,”      after   the   district         court     omitted       the   requested\n\ninstruction); see also United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (“‘[A] litigant has an obligation “to spell out its\n\narguments squarely and distinctly,” or else forever hold its\n\npeace.’”) (quoting Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635\n\n(1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n      Even if one assumes that an objection to the decision to\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fproceed against a single defendant was not waived, the decision is\n\nharmless in light of the jury verdict in favor of Curtis.                 See\n\nCalvi v. Knox County, 470 F.3d 422, 429 (1st Cir. 2006) (“It\n\nfollows that the inadequate training of a police officer cannot be\n\na basis for municipal liability . . . unless a constitutional\n\ninjury has been inflicted by the officer or officers whose training\n\nwas allegedly inferior.”); Jordan v. Fournier, 324 F. Supp. 2d 242,\n\n250 (D. Me. 2004) (“If there is no underlying constitutional\n\nviolation by the three arresting officers, Jordan cannot hold the\n\nother defendants liable on theories of failure to supervise or\n\npolicy and custom.”) (citing Gero v. Henault, 740 F.2d 78, 84-85\n\n(1st Cir. 1984)).\n\n     Alternatively, Fryar argues that the jury should nonetheless\n\nhave been informed, through instruction or argument of counsel,\n\nthat his case arose from and was pled as part of a class action.\n\nDespite counsel’s contention that the jury “should have known”\n\nabout this case history and that this history was central to what\n\nthe case was about, Fryar fails to establish how this testimony was\n\nrelevant to whether Curtis assaulted Fryar, which is the specific\n\nissue the trial was intended to assess.        See De Araujo v. Gonzales,\n\n457 F.3d 146, 153 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[C]onclusory statements,\n\nwithout   further   development,   do    not   rise   to   the   level   of   a\n\ncognizable appellate argument.”).         We conclude that because, by\n\nagreement of the parties, the sole issue before the jury was\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fwhether Curtis committed the acts alleged by Fryar, the district\n\ncourt   did   not    abuse   its   discretion   by   foregoing   potentially\n\nconfusing     jury     instructions    and    information   regarding    the\n\nprocedural history of the case that was not probative of the\n\nunderlying factual dispute. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(b) (“The\n\ncourt . . . may order separate trials or make other orders to\n\nprevent delay or prejudice.\"); Buchanan v. Demong, 654 F. Supp.\n\n139, 140 (D. Mass. 1987) (action originally pled as class action\n\nproceeded individually).\n\nIV.    THE STERN REPORT\n\n       Fryar further contended in his brief that the district court\n\nabused its discretion by precluding admission of the Stern Report,\n\nboth in Fryar’s case-in-chief and for impeachment purposes.              At\n\noral argument, Fryar’s counsel clarified that he is not challenging\n\nthe district court’s ruling on the use of the Stern Report in his\n\ncase-in-chief.       Instead, Fryar’s counsel focused on the district\n\ncourt’s decision not to allow Fryar to use the Stern Report to\n\ncontradict Superintendent Horgan’s testimony regarding the training\n\nof corrections officers and the conditions at SCHOC.                Fryar’s\n\ncounsel points to authority that when the defense opens the door to\n\nimpeachment through testimony on direct, the opposing party may try\n\nto establish that this testimony is false through the introduction\n\nof    evidence,     including   otherwise    inadmissible   evidence,   that\n\ncontradicts the direct testimony.            See, e.g., United States v.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fMorla-Trinidad, 100 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1996).                          Therefore,\n\nalthough Fryar concedes, as he must, that the district court\n\npermitted him to cross-examine Horgan, Fryar contends that the\n\nvalue of his right to cross-examine Horgan was substantially\n\ndiminished by being precluded from referencing the Stern Report.\n\n      As this Court has repeatedly observed, however, “a party may\n\nnot   present       extrinsic    evidence     to   impeach      a    witness       by\n\ncontradiction on a collateral matter.” United States v. Beauchamp,\n\n986 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).        As relevant to this case, Beauchamp\n\nprovides the following definition of collateral evidence:\n\n      A matter is considered collateral if “the matter itself\n      is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of\n      consequence, i.e., not relevant for a purpose other than\n      mere contradiction of the in-court testimony of the\n      witness.” 1 McCormack on Evidence § 45, at 169. Stated\n      another way, extrinsic evidence to disprove a fact\n      testified to by a witness is admissible when it satisfies\n      the Rule 403 balancing test and is not barred by any\n      other rule of evidence. See United States v. Tarantino,\n      846 F.2d 1384, 1409 (D.C. Cir. [1988]) (“The ‘specific\n      contradiction’ rule . . . is a particular instance of the\n      trial court’s general power under Fed. R. Evid. 403 to\n      exclude evidence ‘if its probative value is substantially\n      outweighed . . . by considerations of undue delay, [or]\n      waste of time.’”).\n\nId. at 4.\n\n      This   case    involved,   as   the    district   court       put    it,   “one\n\nplaintiff, Mr. William Fryar, who complains that one corrections\n\nofficer,     Mr.    Curtis,     violated     his   constitutional          rights.”\n\nAccordingly, it is, at best, a close question whether additional\n\nevidence regarding the training of officers or the conditions at\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fSCHOC would have assisted the jury.         It seems more likely that such\n\nevidence   would   have   resulted    in    confusion   of    the   issues,   or\n\nmisleading the jury, and the undue consumption of time, as the\n\ndistrict court evidently surmised.          See Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n     Even assuming that evidence of Curtis’ training and acts of\n\nimpropriety by other personnel at SCHOC were facts of consequence\n\nto the question of Curtis’ conduct on June 14, 1998, but see, e.g.,\n\nBeauchamp, 986 F.2d at 3 (finding evidence that defendant lied\n\nabout his address excludable), we need not reach the question of\n\nwhether generalized extrinsic evidence of conditions at a prison is\n\nrelevant to alleged physical abuse by one of its corrections\n\nofficers of an inmate.     Whether or not it was error to exclude the\n\nStern Report for use for impeachment, any error is harmless “if it\n\nis highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the\n\ncase.”   McDonough, 452 F.3d at 19-20.\n\n     Although Fryar’s counsel was not permitted to make use of the\n\nStern    Report    on   cross-examination,       Horgan      was    extensively\n\ncross-examined.     More significantly, Horgan’s testimony did not\n\ninvolve direct observation of the events alleged and, as the\n\ndistrict court noted, was of questionable relevance, especially\n\ngiven the parties’ agreement that the only issue before the jury\n\nwas Curtis’ treatment of Fryar on June 14, 1998.              Therefore, even\n\nif the district court abused its discretion by excluding the Stern\n\nReport and limiting cross-examination on that subject, the error\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fwas harmless.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

The case started as a class action, which involved numerous plaintiffs and defendants and numerous incidents that allegedly occurred at SCHOC.

On June 14, 1998, at 1 p.m., the cell doors were opened by a remote panel to release the inmates for a recreational period. After five minutes, Curtis proceeded to close and secure the doors, pursuant to SCHOC practice. As he approached cell 7 or cell 8, he heard five or six loud bangs and proceeded to investigate. As he approached cell 12, the cell door opened and two inmates stepped out. He told them to \"step back inside.\" One of the inmates complied and the other, Fryar, refused. Without success, Curtis ordered Fryar two additional times to step back into his cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of stepping back, according to Curtis, Fryar put his hand up towards Curtis' face. Curtis closed the cell door and told Fryar to get against the wall, and placed his hand out on Fryar's right shoulder blade. Then, as Curtis testified, Fryar \"just fell.\" When the nurse who arrived on the scene asked what happened, Fryar \"didn't say anything else but, `I fell down.'\" Fryar was taken for emergency medical treatment and was admitted to the institutional infirmary.

The force of the beating was tremendous, causing a tooth to be dislodged, another tooth to break apart and his lip to split open. After the beating, . . . Curtis told [the nurse] that Mr. Fryar hurt himself by falling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Offering this account, Fryar filed suit in Suffolk County Superior Court as one of fifty-five former and current inmates in a class action against eighty-six defendants, including individual corrections officers and supervisory personnel at SCHOC.

STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court's decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence. <i>Ramirez v. Debs-Elias,</i> 407 F.3d 444, 449 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Lubanski v. Coleco Indus., Inc.,</i> 929 F.2d 42, 45 (1st Cir.1991). \"Erroneous evidentiary rulings are harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.\" <i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> 452 F.3d 8, 19-20 (1st Cir.2006). In addition, \"[c]hallenges to jury instructions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. FAILURE TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fryar argues that the district court erred by failing to allow the case to proceed against various supervisory officials. As clarified at oral argument, however, Fryar concedes that the case proceeded only against defendant Curtis, rather than against all of the original defendants, <i>by agreement of the parties.</i> This affirmative agreement to proceed against Curtis alone waived Fryar's right to review on this issue. \"An issue is waived when a defendant intentionally relinquishes or abandons a legal right.\" <i>United States v. Hansen,</i> 434 F.3d 92, 101 (1st Cir.2006) (finding jury instruction issue waived when the defendant indicated, \"I am content,\" after the district court omitted the requested instruction); <i>see also United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"`[A] litigant has an obligation \"to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly,\" or else forever hold its peace.'\") (quoting <i>Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro,</i> 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir.1988)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if one assumes that an objection to the decision to proceed against a single defendant was not waived, the decision is harmless in light of the jury verdict in favor of Curtis. <i>See Calvi v. Knox County,</i> 470 F.3d 422, 429 (1st Cir.2006) (\"It follows that the inadequate training of a police officer cannot be a basis for municipal liability . . . unless a constitutional injury has been inflicted by the officer or officers whose training was allegedly inferior.\"); <i>Jordan v. Fournier,</i> 324 F.Supp.2d 242, 250 (D.Me.2004) (\"If there is no underlying constitutional violation by the three arresting officers, Jordan cannot hold the other defendants liable on theories of failure to supervise or policy and custom.\") (citing <i>Gero v. Henault,</i> 740 F.2d 78, 84-85 (1st Cir.1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Fryar argues that the jury should nonetheless have been informed, through instruction or argument of counsel, that his case arose from and was pled as part of a class action. Despite counsel's contention that the jury \"should have known\" about this case history and that this history was central to what the case was about, Fryar fails to establish how this testimony was relevant to whether Curtis assaulted Fryar, which is the specific issue the trial was intended to assess. <i>See De Araujo v. Gonzales,</i> 457 F.3d 146, 153 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[C]onclusory statements, without further development, do not rise to the level of a cognizable appellate argument.\"). We conclude that because, by agreement of the parties, the sole issue before the jury was whether Curtis committed the acts alleged by Fryar, the district court did not abuse its discretion by foregoing potentially confusing jury instructions and information regarding the procedural history of the case that was not probative of the underlying factual dispute. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 20(b) (\"The court . . . may order separate trials or make other orders to prevent delay or prejudice.\"); <i>Buchanan v. Demong,</i> 654 F.Supp. 139, 140 (D.Mass.1987) (action originally pled as class action proceeded individually).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE STERN REPORT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fryar further contended in his brief that the district court abused its discretion by precluding admission of the Stern Report, both in Fryar's case-in-chief and for impeachment purposes. At oral argument, Fryar's counsel clarified that he is not challenging the district court's ruling on the use of the Stern Report in his case-in-chief. Instead, Fryar's counsel focused on the district court's decision not to allow Fryar to use the Stern Report to contradict Superintendent Horgan's testimony regarding the training of corrections officers and the conditions at SCHOC. Fryar's counsel points to authority that when the defense opens the door to impeachment through testimony on direct, the opposing party may try to establish that this testimony is false through the introduction of evidence, including otherwise inadmissible evidence, that contradicts the direct testimony. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Morla-Trinidad,</i> 100 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1996). Therefore, although Fryar concedes, as he must, that the district court permitted him to cross-examine Horgan, Fryar contends that the value of his right to cross-examine Horgan was substantially diminished by being precluded from referencing the Stern Report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this Court has repeatedly observed, however, \"a party may not present extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction on a collateral matter.\" <i>United States v. Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993). As relevant to this case, <i>Beauchamp</i> provides the following definition of collateral evidence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A matter is considered collateral if \"the matter itself is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence, i.e., not relevant for a purpose other than mere contradiction of the in-court testimony of the witness.\" 1 McCormack on Evidence &#167; 45, at 169. Stated another way, extrinsic evidence to disprove a fact testified to by a witness is admissible when it satisfies the Rule 403 balancing test and is not barred by any other rule of evidence. <i>See United States v. Tarantino,</i> 846 F.2d 1384, 1409 (D.C.Cir.[1988]) (\"The `specific contradiction' rule . . . is a particular instance of the trial court's general power under Fed.R.Evid. 403 to exclude evidence `if its probative value is substantially outweighed . . . by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involved, as the district court put it, \"one plaintiff, Mr. William Fryar, who complains that one corrections officer, Mr. Curtis, violated his constitutional rights.\" Accordingly, it is, at best, a close question whether additional evidence regarding the training of officers or the conditions at SCHOC would have assisted the jury. It seems more likely that such evidence would have resulted in confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, and the undue consumption of time, as the district court evidently surmised. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that evidence of Curtis' training and acts of impropriety by other personnel at SCHOC were facts of consequence to the question of Curtis' conduct on June 14, 1998, <i>but see, e.g., Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 3 (finding evidence that defendant lied about his address excludable), we need not reach the question of whether generalized extrinsic evidence of conditions at a prison is relevant to alleged physical abuse by one of its corrections officers of an inmate. Whether or not it was error to exclude the Stern Report for use for impeachment, any error is harmless \"if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.\" <i>McDonough,</i> 452 F.3d at 19-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Fryar's counsel was not permitted to make use of the Stern Report on cross-examination, Horgan was extensively cross-examined. More significantly, Horgan's testimony did not involve direct observation of the events alleged and, as the district court noted, was of questionable relevance, especially given the parties' agreement that the only issue before the jury was Curtis' treatment of Fryar on June 14, 1998. Therefore, even if the district court abused its discretion by excluding the Stern Report and limiting cross-examination on that subject, the error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fryar's appellate brief does not comply with Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 28 and 30, in that, for example, it does not include \"a statement of facts relevant to the issues submitted for review<i>with appropriate references to the record,</i>\" Fed.

According to the complaint, while Fryar was incarcerated at SCHOC, Sergeant Curtis physically abused him, violating his state and federal constitutional rights and committing common law assault and battery against him. The case started as a class action, which involved numerous plaintiffs and defendants and numerous incidents that allegedly occurred at SCHOC. As ultimately tried, and by agreement of the parties, the trial determined only Fryar's claims against Curtis individually, and the trial resulted in a jury verdict in favor of Curtis. On appeal, Fryar challenges the district court's decisions to have the case proceed against a single defendant, Curtis, and not to instruct the jury or allow comments by counsel on the previous status of the case as a class action. Fryar further challenges the exclusion at trial of a report by a special commission that investigated the prison, for use in general and for purposes of impeachment.

FAILURE TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fryar argues that the district court erred by failing to allow the case to proceed against various supervisory officials. As clarified at oral argument, however, Fryar concedes that the case proceeded only against defendant Curtis, rather than against all of the original defendants, <i>by agreement of the parties.</i> This affirmative agreement to proceed against Curtis alone waived Fryar's right to review on this issue. \"An issue is waived when a defendant intentionally relinquishes or abandons a legal right.\" <i>United States v. Hansen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202016\"><a href=\"/opinion/202016/united-states-v-hansen/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 101 (1st Cir.2006) (finding jury instruction issue waived when the defendant indicated, \"I am content,\" after the district court omitted the requested instruction); <i>see also United States v.

Knox County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202546\"><a href=\"/opinion/202546/calvi-v-knox-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 429 (1st Cir.2006) (\"It follows that the inadequate training of a police officer cannot be a basis for municipal liability . . . unless a constitutional injury has been inflicted by the officer or officers whose training was allegedly inferior.\"); <i>Jordan v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 250 (D.Me.2004) (\"If there is no underlying constitutional violation by the three arresting officers, Jordan cannot hold the other defendants liable on theories of failure to supervise or policy and custom.\") (citing <i>Gero v. Henault,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439209\"><a href=\"/opinion/439209/dale-j-gero-v-richard-a-henault-dale-j-gero-v-richard-a-henault/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 84-85 (1st Cir.1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Fryar argues that the jury should nonetheless have been informed, through instruction or argument of counsel, that his case arose from and was pled as part of a class action. Despite counsel's contention that the jury \"should have known\" about this case history and that this history was central to what the case was about, Fryar fails to establish how this testimony was relevant to whether Curtis assaulted Fryar, which is the specific issue the trial was intended to assess. <i>See De Araujo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>, 153 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[C]onclusory statements, without further development, do not rise to the level of a cognizable appellate argument.\"). We conclude that because, by agreement of the parties, the sole issue before the jury was whether Curtis committed the acts alleged by Fryar, the district court did not abuse its discretion by foregoing potentially confusing jury instructions and information regarding the procedural history of the case that was not probative of the underlying factual dispute. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 20(b) (\"The court . . . may order separate trials or make other orders to prevent delay or prejudice.\"); <i>Buchanan v. Demong,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1689633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1689633/buchanan-v-demong/\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 140 (D.Mass.1987) (action originally pled as class action proceeded individually).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE STERN REPORT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fryar further contended in his brief that the district court abused its discretion by precluding admission of the Stern Report, both in Fryar's case-in-chief and for impeachment purposes. At oral argument, Fryar's counsel clarified that he is not challenging the district court's ruling on the use of the Stern Report in his case-in-chief. Instead, Fryar's counsel focused on the district court's decision not to allow Fryar to use the Stern Report to contradict Superintendent Horgan's testimony regarding the training of corrections officers and the conditions at SCHOC. Fryar's counsel points to authority that when the defense opens the door to impeachment through testimony on direct, the opposing party may try to establish that this testimony is false through the introduction of evidence, including otherwise inadmissible evidence, that contradicts the direct testimony. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Morla-Trinidad,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197073\"><a href=\"/opinion/197073/united-states-v-morla-trinidad/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1996). Therefore, although Fryar concedes, as he must, that the district court permitted him to cross-examine Horgan, Fryar contends that the value of his right to cross-examine Horgan was substantially diminished by being precluded from referencing the Stern Report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this Court has repeatedly observed, however, \"a party may not present extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction on a collateral matter.\" <i>United States v. Beauchamp,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600392\"><a href=\"/opinion/600392/united-states-v-michael-w-beauchamp/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1993). As relevant to this case, <i>Beauchamp</i> provides the following definition of collateral evidence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A matter is considered collateral if \"the matter itself is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence, i.e., not relevant for a purpose other than mere contradiction of the in-court testimony of the witness.\" 1 McCormack on Evidence &#167; 45, at 169. Stated another way, extrinsic evidence to disprove a fact testified to by a witness is admissible when it satisfies the Rule 403 balancing test and is not barred by any other rule of evidence. <i>See United States v. Tarantino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506169\"><a href=\"/opinion/506169/united-states-v-john-c-tarantino-united-states-of-america-v-robert-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1384</span></a></span>, 1409 (D.C.Cir.[1988]) (\"The `specific contradiction' rule . . . is a particular instance of the trial court's general power under Fed.R.Evid. 403 to exclude evidence `if its probative value is substantially outweighed . . . by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involved, as the district court put it, \"one plaintiff, Mr. William Fryar, who complains that one corrections officer, Mr. Curtis, violated his constitutional rights.\" Accordingly, it is, at best, a close question whether additional evidence regarding the training of officers or the conditions at SCHOC would have assisted the jury. It seems more likely that such evidence would have resulted in confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, and the undue consumption of time, as the district court evidently surmised. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that evidence of Curtis' training and acts of impropriety by other personnel at SCHOC were facts of consequence to the question of Curtis' conduct on June 14, 1998, <i>but see, e.g., Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 3 (finding evidence that defendant lied about his address excludable), we need not reach the question of whether generalized extrinsic evidence of conditions at a prison is relevant to alleged physical abuse by one of its corrections officers of an inmate. Whether or not it was error to exclude the Stern Report for use for impeachment, any error is harmless \"if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.\" <i>McDonough,</i> 452 F.3d at 19-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Fryar's counsel was not permitted to make use of the Stern Report on cross-examination, Horgan was extensively cross-examined. More significantly, Horgan's testimony did not involve direct observation of the events alleged and, as the district court noted, was of questionable relevance, especially given the parties' agreement that the only issue before the jury was Curtis' treatment of Fryar on June 14, 1998. Therefore, even if the district court abused its discretion by excluding the Stern Report and limiting cross-examination on that subject, the error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fryar's appellate brief does not comply with Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 28 and 30, in that, for example, it does not include \"a statement of facts relevant to the issues submitted for review<i>with appropriate references to the record,</i>\" Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(7) (emphasis added), and Fryar did not \"prepare and file an appendix to the briefs.\" Fed. R.App. P. 30(a). Although Fryar filed documents as an addendum to the Blue Brief, First Circuit Local Rule (\"L.R.\") 28, which requires appellants to file addenda, operates independently of the requirement to file an appendix pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 30. <i>See</i> L.R. 28(a)(1); Fed. R.App. P. 30(a)(1)(A)-(D).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Where an appellant has provided defective briefs, \"`the court in its discretion . . . may scrutinize the merits of the case insofar as the record permits, or may dismiss the appeal if the absence of a [record] thwarts intelligent review.'\" <i>Credit Francais Int'l, S.A. v.
