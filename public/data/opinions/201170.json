Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n          Torruella, Selya, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n    Anibal Lugo Miranda for appellant.\n\n    Roberto O. Maldonado Nieves for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        August 3, 2004\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Appellant Sara de la Vega filed an\n\nage discrimination claim against her employer, The San Juan Star\n\n(the Star), pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 621-634, and Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination\n\nlaw, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146-151, also known as \"Law 100.\"\n\nAfter discovery was completed, the Star filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment.    De la Vega failed to respond within the time allowed\n\nunder the local rules.       On that basis alone, the district court\n\nentered summary judgment for the Star.      Although de la Vega twice\n\nrequested reconsideration of the judgment, the district court\n\ndenied each motion.\n\n            We hold that the district court erred when it entered\n\nsummary judgment as a sanction.     Nevertheless, on the basis of our\n\nown analysis of the summary judgment record, we affirm the grant of\n\nsummary judgment to the Star because de la Vega failed to establish\n\na prima facie case of age discrimination.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            We glean the following facts from the summary judgment\n\nrecord.     We   recount   additional   facts   in   the   course   of   our\n\ndiscussion where appropriate.\n\n            The Star is a newspaper with circulation throughout\n\nPuerto Rico.     In May of 1994, the Star hired Sara de la Vega as its\n\nPersonnel Director.        She was 54 years old at the time of her\n\nhiring.     In 1996, de la Vega was promoted to the position of\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fExecutive Assistant to the President.            In this new position, her\n\nduties     included    oversight    of     the     personnel   department,\n\nadministration of vacation and sick leave policies, administration\n\nof the health plan, compliance with the collective bargaining\n\nagreement,     negotiation   with   union    representatives,     and    any\n\nadditional responsibilities allocated to her by the President of\n\nthe Star, Gerardo Angulo.       During the period from 1994 to 1998, de\n\nla   Vega's     compensation     package    gradually     increased     from\n\napproximately $40,000 per year to $100,000 per year.\n\n             In 1997, the Star hired Salvador Hasbun as a Marketing\n\nDirector.     On April 28, 1998, the Star promoted Hasbun to the newly\n\ncreated position of General Manager, which required him to oversee\n\nthe production and sales departments of the Star.                Prior to\n\ncreating     this   position,    Angulo    had    been   overseeing     those\n\ndepartments in addition to his duties as President and CEO. Hasbun\n\nwas 41 years old at the time of this promotion.\n\n             In her complaint, de la Vega claimed that her duties were\n\neffectively transferred to Hasbun after his promotion, and that she\n\nwas \"stripped of essentially all authority and/or decision making\n\npower.\"     She alleged that Hasbun was \"less qualified\" to perform\n\nthese duties and that he was entrusted with them because he was a\n\n\"much younger person.\"       She further claimed, without citing any\n\nspecific instance, that members of the Star staff attempted to \"get\n\nrid\" of her by submitting her to \"humiliating and discriminatory\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\ftreatment.\" Despite these claims, de la Vega retained the title of\n\nExecutive Assistant to the President and received the same pay and\n\nbenefits package that she had received prior to Hasbun's promotion.\n\n           On September 2, 2000, de la Vega submitted a letter of\n\nresignation to Angulo.    The letter did not state a reason for her\n\ndeparture, and it made no reference to perceived discrimination or\n\nto dissatisfaction with her working conditions. Angulo asked de la\n\nVega to withdraw her resignation and to continue working for the\n\nStar.    At first she agreed to continue her employment, but on\n\nNovember 13, 2000, she submitted a second letter of resignation.\n\nIt stated:\n\n           The environment and supervision style you have\n           shown in our work interaction, more or less\n           during the last months, do not permit me to\n           continue [working for the Star]. On multiple\n           occasions I have sat down with you and we have\n           spoken about this matter.      Nevertheless[,]\n           during the last months it has intensified and\n           it reached its optimum level on Thursday,\n           November 9.1\n\nAgain, Angulo asked de la Vega to withdraw her resignation, and\n\nagain de la Vega agreed to continue working for the Star.\n\n             Finally, on February 5, 2001, de la Vega submitted her\n\nthird and final letter of resignation.   In that letter she related\n\nan incident occurring on February 2, 2001, in which Angulo had\n\nreprimanded her in front of several senior members of the Star's\n\n\n\n     1\n      Neither this letter, nor de la Vega's complaint, specified\nthe events of November 9 to which de la Vega referred.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fstaff after she interrupted a meeting.            She referred to past\n\ninstances in which she had asked Angulo to address such matters in\n\nprivate to avoid embarrassment.            She further referred to the\n\n\"constant hostile confrontation level that you had been showing\n\ntoward me during the last two years.\"          For a third time, Angulo\n\nasked de la Vega to return to her duties at the Star.              This time,\n\nhowever, de la Vega refused.        In a letter dated April 1, 2001,\n\nAngulo reluctantly accepted de la Vega's resignation as Executive\n\nAssistant to the President and suggested that she might continue to\n\nwork for the Star as a consultant.2\n\n          On or about May 4, 2001, de la Vega filed an age\n\ndiscrimination charge with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the\n\nPuerto   Rico    Department   of   Labor    and   the    Equal     Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC).        After receiving \"right to sue\"\n\nletters, she brought this action in district court.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          De la Vega filed her complaint on February 26, 2002,\n\nalleging that the Star had constructively discharged her from her\n\nemployment in violation of the ADEA and Puerto Rico's Law 100.             The\n\nStar filed its response on May 22, 2002.                The district court\n\nscheduled a trial date of May 28, 2003, and the parties undertook\n\ndiscovery.      On February 11, 2003, the Star filed a motion for\n\n\n\n     2\n      The record does not indicate whether               de   la   Vega   ever\nperformed consulting work for the Star.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fsummary judgment. Pursuant to local rule 7.1(b) of the District of\n\nPuerto Rico, de la Vega's response to this motion was due by\n\nFebruary 21, 2003.3         She did not file a timely response, and the\n\nStar filed a motion requesting entry of judgment on February 27,\n\n2003.4\n\n                On March 4, 2003, the district court granted the Star's\n\nunopposed motion for summary judgment.             On March 5, 2003, de la\n\nVega filed a motion requesting reconsideration of the judgment; on\n\nMarch 14, 2003, she filed an opposition to the Star's motion for\n\nsummary judgment.         On March 18, 2003, the district court denied de\n\nla   Vega's      motion   for   reconsideration,   admonishing   plaintiff's\n\ncounsel for failing to meet the filing deadline and failing to\n\nrequest an extension of time.         On March 21, 2003, de la Vega filed\n\na second motion requesting reconsideration of the judgment; on\n\nApril 3, 2003, the district court denied that motion without\n\ncomment.\n\n\n\n      3\n            D.P.R. R. 7.1(b) (formerly rule 311.5) provides in relevant\npart:\n                Unless within ten (10) days after the service\n                of a motion the opposing party files written\n                objection thereto, incorporating a memorandum\n                of law, the opposing party shall be deemed to\n                have waived objection.\n        4\n      According to de la Vega's counsel, he had prepared a motion\nasking for an enlargement of time to file a response to the summary\njudgment motion, but had inadvertently failed to file the motion\nwith the court. Counsel also claims that he did not learn of the\nStar's February 27 motion requesting entry of judgment until March\n10, 2003.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f          De la Vega now appeals from the district court's order of\n\nMarch 4, 2003, entering summary judgment in favor of the Star.    She\n\nargues on appeal that, even when unopposed, the district court may\n\ngrant a motion for summary judgment only if it concludes that there\n\nis no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.         In this case, she\n\ncontends that the district court never undertook this required\n\nanalysis and instead granted the Star's motion as a sanction\n\nagainst de la Vega for failing to meet the filing deadline for a\n\nresponse to the Star's summary judgment motion.         Further, she\n\ncontends that the Star's motion did not establish its entitlement\n\nto summary judgment as a matter of law.       We take each of these\n\narguments in turn.5\n\n                               III.\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \"A fact\n\nis material if it carries with it the potential to affect the\n\n\n     5\n      In addition, de la Vega argues that her failure to file a\ntimely opposition to the Star's motion for summary judgment was not\nthe kind of inexcusable neglect or egregious conduct that would\nwarrant an entry of judgment in favor of the opposing party.\nBecause we hold that the district court improperly granted the\nStar's summary judgment motion as a sanction against de la Vega, we\ndo not address this argument.\n\n                               -7-\n\foutcome of the suit under the applicable law.\"   One Nat'l Bank v.\n\nAntonellis, 80 F.3d 606, 608 (1st Cir. 1996) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).   We review the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment de novo.   Id.\n\n          Rule 56(e) governs the obligations of adverse parties to\n\nrespond to a summary judgment motion.     It provides in relevant\n\npart:\n\n          When a motion for summary judgment is made and\n          supported as provided in this rule, an adverse\n          party may not rest upon the mere allegations\n          or denials of the adverse party's pleading,\n          but the adverse party's response . . . must\n          set forth specific facts showing that there is\n          a genuine issue for trial.     If the adverse\n          party does not so respond, summary judgment,\n          if appropriate, shall be entered against the\n          adverse party.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (emphasis added).        We have previously\n\nemphasized the import of the last quoted sentence:\n\n          It is well-settled, however, that [the\n          language of Rule 56(e)] does not mean that a\n          moving party is automatically entitled to\n          summary judgment if the opposing party does\n          not respond. . . . [T]he district court cannot\n          grant a motion for summary judgment merely for\n          lack of any response by the opposing party,\n          since the district court must review the\n          motion and the supporting papers to determine\n          whether they establish the absence of a\n          genuine issue of material fact. . . .\n                 . . . The court must first inquire\n          whether the moving party has met its burden to\n          demonstrate undisputed facts entitling it to\n          summary judgment as a matter of law.\n\nJaroma v. Massey, 873 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam)\n\n(citations omitted);   see also NEPSK, Inc. v. Town of Houlton, 283\n\n                                  -8-\n\fF.3d   1,   7-8   (1st    Cir.     2002)   (\"[A]   district       court    may    not\n\nautomatically grant a motion for summary judgment simply because\n\nthe opposing party failed to comply with a local rule requiring a\n\nresponse within a certain number of days.\").\n\n            In this case, the district court issued three rulings,\n\nnone   of   which   determined       whether    the     Star     had   established\n\nundisputed facts entitling it to summary judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   On March 4, 2003, the district court entered a judgment\n\nstating in its entirety: \"Plaintiff has failed to respond to\n\nDefendant's motion for summary judgment.               Accordingly, Defendant's\n\nmotion is granted and judgment is hereby entered dismissing all\n\nclaims in favor of the Defendant.\"           On March 18, 2003, the district\n\ncourt denied de la Vega's first motion for reconsideration, stating\n\nthat \"there is absolutely no excuse for a party to miss a court\n\nmandated    deadline     without    submitting     a    simple    motion    for    an\n\nextension of time.\" (emphasis in original).                The court suggested\n\nthat the episode should \"be a reminder to Plaintiff's counsel that\n\n[t]he law ministers to the vigilant not to those who sleep upon\n\nperceptible rights.         [A] litigant . . . cannot be routinely\n\nrewarded for somnolence and lassitude.\"                 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)           Finally, the court's ruling on de la\n\nVega's second motion for reconsideration consisted of a single\n\nword: \"Denied.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           We have noted that \"it is within the district court's\n\ndiscretion to dismiss an action based on a party's unexcused\n\nfailure to respond to a dispositive motion when such a response is\n\nrequired by a local rule.\"     Town of Houlton, 283 F.3d at 7.       \"It is\n\nequally clear, however, that a district court cannot enforce its\n\nlocal rules in a way that conflicts with the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.\"    Id.   In this case, the district court did not comply\n\nwith Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).     Rather, the district court appears to\n\nhave entered summary judgment for the Star solely as a sanction for\n\nde la Vega's failure to file a timely response to the Star's\n\nsummary   judgment   motion.     Rule    56   does   not   permit   such   a\n\ndisposition.   The district court's entry of summary judgment as a\n\nsanction was an error of law.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n           Although the district court erred in entering summary\n\njudgment as a sanction, the court did not have to accept de la\n\nVega's late filing.    We have previously laid out the consequences\n\nto parties who do not timely file an opposition to a motion for\n\nsummary judgment:\n\n           [T]he opposing party, by failing to file [a\n           response] as required by the rule, waives the\n           right to controvert the facts asserted by the\n           moving party in the motion for summary\n           judgment   and   the   supporting   materials\n           accompanying it.   The court will accept as\n           true all material facts set forth by the\n           moving party with appropriate record support.\n           If those facts entitle the moving party to\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment\n            will be granted.\n\nJaroma, 873 F.2d at 21.     Thus, the district court had the authority\n\nto   rule   on   the   record   as   developed    by   the   parties'   timely\n\nsubmissions, taking as true the facts asserted in the summary\n\njudgment motion of the Star so long as they were adequately\n\nsupported by the record.         See, e.g., Mendez v. Banco Popular de\n\nP.R., 900 F.2d 4, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1990) (affirming a summary judgment\n\nruling where the district court based its analysis only on the\n\ntimely filings).\n\n            We have before us on appeal the elements of the record\n\nthat the district court should have considered in analyzing the\n\nsummary judgment motion under Rule 56.           Since our review of such a\n\nsummary judgment decision would be de novo, we see no purpose in\n\nremanding this case to the district court to conduct the proper\n\nanalysis. Moreover, \"[a]n appellate panel is not restricted to the\n\ndistrict court's reasoning but can affirm a summary judgment on any\n\nindependently sufficient ground.\"           Mesnick v. General Elec. Co.,\n\n950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991).          Therefore, we will address the\n\nmerits of the Star's summary judgment motion.6\n\n            The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer \"to discharge\n\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual\n\n\n\n      6\n      Still, we would always prefer to have the benefit of the\ndistrict court's analysis of the merits of a party's summary\njudgment motion.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fwith respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions or privileges\n\nof employment, because of such individual's age.\"               29 U.S.C. §\n\n623(a)(1).   To prevail on a claim under the ADEA, a plaintiff must\n\nfirst establish a prima facie case. This requires the plaintiff to\n\nshow that \"(1) she was at least forty years of age; (2) her job\n\nperformance met the employer's legitimate expectations; (3) the\n\nemployer subjected her to an adverse employment action (e.g., an\n\nactual or constructive discharge); and (4) the employer had a\n\ncontinuing   need   for   the   services    [the     claimant    rendered].\"\n\nGonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 68 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(citing to Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           De la Vega contends that the \"adverse employment action\"\n\nshe suffered was a constructive discharge.7          See Suarez, 229 F.3d\n\nat 54 (\"Just as the ADEA bars an employer from dismissing an\n\nemployee because of his age, so too it bars an employer from\n\nengaging in a calculated, age-inspired effort to force an employee\n\nto quit.     Accordingly, a constructive discharge can ground an\n\nemployment   discrimination     claim.\").      \"To     prove    constructive\n\ndischarge,   a   plaintiff   must    usually   'show    that    her   working\n\nconditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person\n\n\n\n     7\n      Neither the Star nor de la Vega disputes that she was at\nleast forty years of age, that she met the Star's reasonable\nemployment expectations, or that the Star had a continuing need for\nthe services that de la Vega provided while employed at the Star.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fin [her] shoes would have felt compelled to resign.'\"       Lee-Crespo\n\nv.

(citation omitted).\n\n          De la Vega's complaint alleged that:\n\n          [O]n or about June 6, 1997, [de la Vega] was\n          substituted by a less qualified and much\n          younger person.8      Thereafter, [her] job\n          performance was subject to a vicious and\n          unreasonable attack.    Although her title as\n          Executive   Assistant   and   Human  Resources\n          Manager remained the same, [de la Vega] was\n          stripped of essentially all authority and/or\n          decision making power.      [The Star] was so\n          eager to get rid of [de la Vega] that on more\n          than one occasion she was humiliated before\n          other employees of [the Star]. As a result of\n          this humiliating and discriminatory treatment\n          by [the Star], [de la Vega] was forced to\n          resign involuntarily from her employment\n          effective February 5, 2002.\n\nDespite   its   reference    to   \"humiliating    and   discriminatory\n\ntreatment,\" the complaint does not set out any specific instance of\n\nworkplace harassment.       Other than the promotion of Hasbun to\n\nGeneral Manager, and the resulting alleged reduction in de la\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      The reference to June 6, 1997, appears to be an error. Mr.\nHasbun was promoted to the position of General Manager on April 28,\n1998. De la Vega has not alleged that the hiring or promotion of\nany other person at the Star caused her to lose authority or\ndecision-making power.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fVega's authority, the complaint does not set out a single specific\n\nallegation of discriminatory conduct.9\n\n               The Star's summary judgment motion sets out several facts\n\nthat,     if   true,      adequately   refute   de    la   Vega's   allegations.10\n\nHasbun's affidavit states that, as general manager, he did not\n\nsupervise de la Vega, did not oversee her work, and did not become\n\ninvolved       in   the    personnel   issues   for    which   de    la   Vega   was\n\nresponsible.        It further states that he did not become involved in\n\nany of de la Vega's duties after de la Vega resigned in February of\n\n2001.     Angulo's affidavit states that, during de la Vega's time at\n\nthe Star, she was never subject to demotion or adverse disciplinary\n\naction and was never threatened with termination.                   He states that\n\nHasbun was hired to oversee the production and sales departments at\n\nthe Star, duties for which Angulo himself had previously been\n\nresponsible.         He states that, at all times during de la Vega's\n\n\n     9\n      We recognize that a non-moving party cannot rely upon\nallegations in a complaint to contest a motion for summary\njudgment. See, e.g., Kelly v. United States, 924 F.3d 355, 357\n(1st Cir. 1991) (stating that, in a summary judgment motion, \"the\nnonmovant may not rest upon mere allegations in . . . an unverified\ncomplaint or lawyer's brief\"). We cite the complaint here only to\nexplain the nature of de la Vega's constructive discharge claim.\n     10\n      The Star also asserts in its summary judgment motion that de\nla Vega's claim is time barred because she knew or should have\nknown of the adverse employment action when Hasbun was promoted in\nApril of 1998, and therefore had to file her complaint within 300\ndays after that promotion.     See 29 U.S.C. § 626(d); American\nAirlines v. Cardoza-Rodriguez, 133 F.3d 111, 122-23 (1st Cir. 1998)\n(discussing timeliness of ADEA claims). Because we find that de la\nVega has not established a prima facie case under the ADEA, we do\nnot reach the issue of timeliness.\n\n                                        -14-\n\femployment, she had a larger office than Hasbun and had two\n\nassistants while Hasbun had none.            Finally, Angulo states that he\n\nnever discriminated against de la Vega on the basis of her age or\n\nfor any other reason.\n\n           The    Star     also   offers   de     la   Vega's   own    letters   of\n\nresignation to refute her claim of age discrimination.                   While two\n\nof the letters mention generally that de la Vega found Angulo's\n\nmanagerial style to be troublesome, they do not recount the kind or\n\nnumber of events necessary to show \"harassment so severe and\n\noppressive that staying on the job while seeking redress . . . is\n\n'intolerable.'\" Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc., 333 F.3d 27, 33 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (citation omitted) (discussing the requirements for\n\nconstructive discharge). Only the final letter recounts a specific\n\ninstance   of    alleged    harassment:      an   occasion      on   which   Angulo\n\nallegedly reprimanded de la Vega in front of other employees for\n\ninterrupting a meeting.           Moreover, none of the letters alleges\n\ndiscriminatory conduct based on de la Vega's age.                     Finally, the\n\nparties agree that, after each resignation, Angulo asked de la Vega\n\nto return to work.       This conduct belies any intention by Angulo to\n\nforce de la Vega to resign by creating a hostile work environment.\n\n           To be sure, de la Vega tells a different story in the\n\nlate filed opposition to the Star's motion for summary judgment.\n\nHowever, as stated above, in the absence of a timely response from\n\nde la Vega, the district court could \"accept as true all material\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\ffacts set     forth   by   the   moving   party   with   appropriate   record\n\nsupport.\"     Jaroma, 873 F.2d at 21.        On appeal, pursuant to our de\n\nnovo review, we can do the same.          Therefore, on the alleged ground\n\nof constructive termination, we conclude that de la Vega cannot\n\nsustain a prima facie case of age discrimination under the ADEA.\n\nThe Star is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on de\n\nla Vega's ADEA claim.\n\n            \"Law 100 is the Puerto Rico equivalent of the federal\n\nADEA, providing for civil liability in age discrimination actions.\"\n\nCardona Jimenez v. Bancomercio de P.R., 174 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   \"Under Law 100, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case\n\nof age discrimination by (1) demonstrating that [she] was actually\n\nor constructively discharged, and (2) alleging that the decision\n\nwas discriminatory.\"       Baralt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 251 F.3d\n\n10, 16 (1st Cir. 2001).          Thus, like the ADEA, Law 100 requires a\n\nplaintiff to demonstrate an actual or constructive discharge as\n\npart of a prima facie case of age discrimination.\n\n            As stated above, the Star established in its summary\n\njudgment motion facts that adequately refute de la Vega's claim of\n\nconstructive termination.         Because de la Vega fails to demonstrate\n\nthat she was constructively terminated, she cannot establish a\n\nprima facie case of age discrimination under Law 100.            Therefore,\n\nfor the same reason that her ADEA claim fails, her Law 100 claim\n\nalso fails.    See Gonzalez, 304 F.3d at 73 n.7 (\"The district court\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\forder dismissing the Law 100 claim must be affirmed as well, since\n\nthe merits of the age-discrimination claims asserted under the ADEA\n\nand Law 100 are coterminous.\") (citation omitted).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f",

In May of 1994, the Star hired Sara de la Vega as its Personnel Director. She was 54 years old at the time of her hiring. In 1996, de la Vega was promoted to the position of Executive Assistant to the President. In this new position, her duties included oversight of the personnel department, administration of vacation and sick leave policies, administration of the health plan, compliance with the collective bargaining agreement, negotiation with union representatives, and any additional responsibilities allocated to her by the President of the Star, Gerardo Angulo. During the period from 1994 to 1998, de la Vega's compensation package gradually increased from approximately $40,000 per year to $100,000 per year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the Star hired Salvador Hasbun as a Marketing Director. On April 28, 1998, the Star promoted Hasbun to the newly created position of General Manager, which required him to oversee the production and sales departments of the Star. Prior to creating this position, Angulo had been overseeing those departments in addition to his duties as President and CEO. Hasbun was 41 years old at the time of this promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her complaint, de la Vega claimed that her duties were effectively transferred to Hasbun after his promotion, and that she was \"stripped of essentially all authority and/or decision making power.\" She alleged that Hasbun was \"less qualified\" to perform these duties and that he was entrusted with them because he was a \"much younger person.\" She further claimed, without citing any specific instance, that members of the Star staff attempted to \"get rid\" of her by submitting her to \"humiliating and discriminatory treatment.\" Despite these claims, de la Vega retained the title of Executive Assistant to the President and received the same pay and benefits package that she had received prior to Hasbun's promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 2000, de la Vega submitted a letter of resignation to Angulo. The letter did not state a reason for her departure, and it made no reference to perceived discrimination or to dissatisfaction with her working conditions. Angulo asked de la Vega to withdraw her resignation and to continue working for the Star. At first she agreed to continue her employment, but on November 13, 2000, she submitted a second letter of resignation. It stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The environment and supervision style you have shown in our work interaction, more or less during the last months, do not permit me to continue [working for the Star].

In that letter she related an incident occurring on February 2, 2001, in which Angulo had reprimanded her in front of several senior members of the Star's staff after she interrupted a meeting. She referred to past instances in which she had asked Angulo to address such matters in private to avoid embarrassment. She further referred to the \"constant hostile confrontation level that you had been showing toward me during the last two years.\" For a third time, Angulo asked de la Vega to return to her duties at the Star. This time, however, de la Vega refused. In a letter dated April 1, 2001, Angulo reluctantly accepted de la Vega's resignation as Executive Assistant to the President and suggested that she might continue to work for the Star as a consultant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about May 4, 2001, de la Vega filed an age discrimination charge with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

The Star filed its response on May 22, 2002. The district court scheduled a trial date of May 28, 2003, and the parties undertook discovery. On February 11, 2003, the Star filed a motion for summary judgment. Pursuant to local rule 7.1(b) of the District of Puerto Rico, de la Vega's response to this motion was due by February 21, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> She did not file a timely response, and the Star filed a motion requesting entry of judgment on February 27, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 2003, the district court granted the Star's unopposed motion for summary judgment. On March 5, 2003, de la Vega filed a motion requesting reconsideration of the judgment; on March 14, 2003, she filed an opposition to the Star's motion for summary judgment. On March 18, 2003, the district court denied de la Vega's motion for reconsideration, admonishing plaintiff's counsel for failing to meet the filing deadline and failing to request an extension of time. On March 21, 2003, de la Vega filed a second motion requesting reconsideration of the judgment; on April 3, 2003, the district court denied that motion without comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De la Vega now appeals from the district court's order of March 4, 2003, entering summary judgment in favor of the Star. She argues on appeal that, even when unopposed, the district court may grant a motion for summary judgment only if it concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In this case, she contends that the district court never undertook this required analysis and instead granted the Star's motion as a sanction against de la Vega for failing to meet the filing deadline for a response to the Star's summary judgment motion. Further, she contends that the Star's motion did not establish its entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law.

Accordingly, a constructive discharge can ground an employment discrimination claim.\"). \"To prove constructive discharge, a plaintiff must usually `show that her working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in [her] shoes would have felt compelled to resign.'\" <i>Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe, Inc.,</i> 354 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir.2003) (citation omitted). \"It is not enough that the plaintiff suffered `the ordinary slings and arrows that workers routinely encounter in a hard, cold world.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">De la Vega's complaint alleged that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[O]n or about June 6, 1997, [de la Vega] was substituted by a less qualified and much younger person.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Thereafter, [her] job performance was subject to a vicious and unreasonable attack. Although her title as Executive Assistant and Human Resources Manager remained the same, [de la Vega] was stripped of essentially all authority and/or decision making power. [The Star] was so eager to get rid of [de la Vega] that on more than one occasion she was humiliated before other employees of [the Star]. As a result of this humiliating and discriminatory treatment by [the Star], [de la Vega] was forced to resign involuntarily from her employment effective February 5, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite its reference to \"humiliating and discriminatory treatment,\" the complaint does not set out any specific instance of workplace harassment. Other than the promotion of Hasbun to General Manager, and the resulting alleged reduction in de la Vega's authority, the complaint does not set out a single specific allegation of discriminatory conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Star's summary judgment motion sets out several facts that, if true, adequately refute de la Vega's allegations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Hasbun's affidavit states that, as general manager, he did not supervise de la Vega, did not oversee her work, and did not become involved in the personnel issues for which de la Vega was responsible. It further states that he did not become involved in any of de la Vega's duties after de la Vega resigned in February of 2001. Angulo's affidavit states that, during de la Vega's time at the Star, she was never subject to demotion or adverse disciplinary action and was never threatened with termination. He states that Hasbun was hired to oversee the production and sales departments at the Star, duties for which Angulo himself had previously been responsible. He states that, at all times during de la Vega's employment, she had a larger office than Hasbun and had two assistants while Hasbun had none. Finally, Angulo states that he never discriminated against de la Vega on the basis of her age or for any other reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Star also offers de la Vega's own letters of resignation to refute her claim of age discrimination. While two of the letters mention generally that de la Vega found Angulo's managerial style to be troublesome, they do not recount the kind or number of events necessary to show \"harassment so severe and oppressive that staying on the job while seeking redress ... is `intolerable.'\" <i>Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc.,</i> 333 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir.2003) (citation omitted) (discussing the requirements for constructive discharge). Only the final letter recounts a specific instance of alleged harassment: an occasion on which Angulo allegedly reprimanded de la Vega in front of other employees for interrupting a meeting. Moreover, none of the letters alleges discriminatory conduct based on de la Vega's age. Finally, the parties agree that, after each resignation, Angulo asked de la Vega to return to work. This conduct belies any intention by Angulo to force de la Vega to resign by creating a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, de la Vega tells a different story in the late filed opposition to the Star's motion for summary judgment. However, as stated above, in the absence of a timely response from de la Vega, the district court could \"accept as true all material facts set forth by the moving party with appropriate record support.\" <i>Jaroma,</i> 873 F.2d at 21. On appeal, pursuant to our de novo review, we can do the same. Therefore, on the alleged ground of constructive termination, we conclude that de la Vega cannot sustain a prima facie case of age discrimination under the ADEA. The Star is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on de la Vega's ADEA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Law 100 is the Puerto Rico equivalent of the federal ADEA, providing for civil liability in age discrimination actions.\" <i>Cardona Jimenez v. Bancomercio de P.R.,</i> 174 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir .1999). \"Under Law 100, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of age discrimination by (1) demonstrating that [she] was actually or constructively discharged, and (2) alleging that the decision was discriminatory.\" <i>Baralt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 251 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.2001). Thus, like the ADEA, Law 100 requires a plaintiff to demonstrate an actual or constructive discharge as part of a prima facie case of age discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the Star established in its summary judgment motion facts that adequately refute de la Vega's claim of constructive termination. Because de la Vega fails to demonstrate that she was constructively terminated, she cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under Law 100. Therefore, for the same reason that her ADEA claim fails, her Law 100 claim also fails. <i>See Gonzalez, 304 F.3d at 73 n. 7</i> (\"The district court order dismissing the Law 100 claim must be affirmed as well, since the merits of the age-discrimination claims asserted under the ADEA and Law 100 are coterminous.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Neither this letter, nor de la Vega's complaint, specified the events of November 9 to which de la Vega referred</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record does not indicate whether de la Vega ever performed consulting work for the Star</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> D.P.R.

In May of 1994, the Star hired Sara de la Vega as its Personnel Director. She was 54 years old at the time of her hiring. In 1996, de la Vega was promoted to the position of Executive Assistant to the President. In this new position, her duties included oversight of the personnel department, administration of vacation and sick leave policies, administration of the health plan, compliance with the collective bargaining agreement, negotiation with union representatives, and any additional responsibilities allocated to her by the President of the Star, Gerardo Angulo. During the period from 1994 to 1998, de la Vega's compensation package gradually increased from approximately $40,000 per year to $100,000 per year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the Star hired Salvador Hasbun as a Marketing Director. On April 28, 1998, the Star promoted Hasbun to the newly created position of General Manager, which required him to oversee the production and sales departments of the Star. Prior to creating this position, Angulo had been overseeing those departments in addition to his duties as President and CEO. Hasbun was 41 years old at the time of this promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her complaint, de la Vega claimed that her duties were effectively transferred to Hasbun after his promotion, and that she was \"stripped of essentially all authority and/or decision making power.\" She alleged that Hasbun was \"less qualified\" to perform these duties and that he was entrusted with them because he was a \"much younger person.\" She further claimed, without citing any specific instance, that members of the Star staff attempted to \"get rid\" of her by submitting her to \"humiliating and discriminatory treatment.\" Despite these claims, de la Vega retained the title of Executive Assistant to the President and received the same pay and benefits package that she had received prior to Hasbun's promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 2000, de la Vega submitted a letter of resignation to Angulo. The letter did not state a reason for her departure, and it made no reference to perceived discrimination or to dissatisfaction with her working conditions. Angulo asked de la Vega to withdraw her resignation and to continue working for the Star. At first she agreed to continue her employment, but on November 13, 2000, she submitted a second letter of resignation. It stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The environment and supervision style you have shown in our work interaction, more or less during the last months, do not permit me to continue [working for the Star].

In that letter she related an incident occurring on February 2, 2001, in which Angulo had reprimanded her in front of several senior members of the Star's staff after she interrupted a meeting. She referred to past instances in which she had asked Angulo to address such matters in private to avoid embarrassment. She further referred to the \"constant hostile confrontation level that you had been showing toward me during the last two years.\" For a third time, Angulo asked de la Vega to return to her duties at the Star. This time, however, de la Vega refused. In a letter dated April 1, 2001, Angulo reluctantly accepted de la Vega's resignation as Executive Assistant to the President and suggested that she might continue to work for the Star as a consultant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about May 4, 2001, de la Vega filed an age discrimination charge with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

The Star filed its response on May 22, 2002. The district court scheduled a trial date of May 28, 2003, and the parties undertook discovery. On February 11, 2003, the Star filed a motion for summary judgment. Pursuant to local rule 7.1(b) of the District of Puerto Rico, de la Vega's response to this motion was due by February 21, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> She did not file a timely response, and the Star filed a motion requesting entry of judgment on February 27, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 2003, the district court granted the Star's unopposed motion for summary judgment. On March 5, 2003, de la Vega filed a motion requesting reconsideration of the judgment; on March 14, 2003, she filed an opposition to the Star's motion for summary judgment. On March 18, 2003, the district court denied de la Vega's motion for reconsideration, admonishing plaintiff's counsel for failing to meet the filing deadline and failing to request an extension of time. On March 21, 2003, de la Vega filed a second motion requesting reconsideration of the judgment; on April 3, 2003, the district court denied that motion without comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De la Vega now appeals from the district court's order of March 4, 2003, entering summary judgment in favor of the Star. She argues on appeal that, even when unopposed, the district court may grant a motion for summary judgment only if it concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In this case, she contends that the district court never undertook this required analysis and instead granted the Star's motion as a sanction against de la Vega for failing to meet the filing deadline for a response to the Star's summary judgment motion. Further, she contends that the Star's motion did not establish its entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law.

[A] litigant... cannot be routinely rewarded for somnolence and lassitude.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) Finally, the court's ruling on de la Vega's second motion for reconsideration consisted of a single word: \"Denied.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted that \"it is within the district court's discretion to dismiss an action based on a party's unexcused failure to respond to a dispositive motion when such a response is required by a local rule.\" <i>Town of Houlton,</i> 283 F.3d at 7. \"It is equally clear, however, that a district court cannot enforce its local rules in a way that conflicts with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> In this case, the district court did not comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Rather, the district court appears to have entered summary judgment for the Star solely as a sanction for de la Vega's failure to file a timely response to the Star's summary judgment motion. Rule 56 does not permit such a disposition.

Thus, the district court had the authority to rule on the record as developed by the parties' timely submissions, taking as true the facts asserted in the summary judgment motion of the Star so long as they were adequately supported by the record. <i>See, e.g., Mendez v.

Although her title as Executive Assistant and Human Resources Manager remained the same, [de la Vega] was stripped of essentially all authority and/or decision making power. [The Star] was so eager to get rid of [de la Vega] that on more than one occasion she was humiliated before other employees of [the Star]. As a result of this humiliating and discriminatory treatment by [the Star], [de la Vega] was forced to resign involuntarily from her employment effective February 5, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite its reference to \"humiliating and discriminatory treatment,\" the complaint does not set out any specific instance of workplace harassment. Other than the promotion of Hasbun to General Manager, and the resulting alleged reduction in de la Vega's authority, the complaint does not set out a single specific allegation of discriminatory conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Star's summary judgment motion sets out several facts that, if true, adequately refute de la Vega's allegations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Hasbun's affidavit states that, as general manager, he did not supervise de la Vega, did not oversee her work, and did not become involved in the personnel issues for which de la Vega was responsible. It further states that he did not become involved in any of de la Vega's duties after de la Vega resigned in February of 2001. Angulo's affidavit states that, during de la Vega's time at the Star, she was never subject to demotion or adverse disciplinary action and was never threatened with termination. He states that Hasbun was hired to oversee the production and sales departments at the Star, duties for which Angulo himself had previously been responsible. He states that, at all times during de la Vega's employment, she had a larger office than Hasbun and had two assistants while Hasbun had none. Finally, Angulo states that he never discriminated against de la Vega on the basis of her age or for any other reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Star also offers de la Vega's own letters of resignation to refute her claim of age discrimination. While two of the letters mention generally that de la Vega found Angulo's managerial style to be troublesome, they do not recount the kind or number of events necessary to show \"harassment so severe and oppressive that staying on the job while seeking redress ... is `intolerable.'\" <i>Reed v. MBNA Mktg.

Only the final letter recounts a specific instance of alleged harassment: an occasion on which Angulo allegedly reprimanded de la Vega in front of other employees for interrupting a meeting. Moreover, none of the letters alleges discriminatory conduct based on de la Vega's age. Finally, the parties agree that, after each resignation, Angulo asked de la Vega to return to work. This conduct belies any intention by Angulo to force de la Vega to resign by creating a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, de la Vega tells a different story in the late filed opposition to the Star's motion for summary judgment. However, as stated above, in the absence of a timely response from de la Vega, the district court could \"accept as true all material facts set forth by the moving party with appropriate record support.\" <i>Jaroma,</i> 873 F.2d at 21. On appeal, pursuant to our de novo review, we can do the same. Therefore, on the alleged ground of constructive termination, we conclude that de la Vega cannot sustain a prima facie case of age discrimination under the ADEA. The Star is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on de la Vega's ADEA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Law 100 is the Puerto Rico equivalent of the federal ADEA, providing for civil liability in age discrimination actions.\" <i>Cardona Jimenez v.

Because de la Vega fails to demonstrate that she was constructively terminated, she cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under Law 100. Therefore, for the same reason that her ADEA claim fails, her Law 100 claim also fails. <i>See Gonzalez, 304 F.3d at 73 n. 7</i> (\"The district court order dismissing the Law 100 claim must be affirmed as well, since the merits of the age-discrimination claims asserted under the ADEA and Law 100 are coterminous.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Neither this letter, nor de la Vega's complaint, specified the events of November 9 to which de la Vega referred</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record does not indicate whether de la Vega ever performed consulting work for the Star</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> D.P.R.
