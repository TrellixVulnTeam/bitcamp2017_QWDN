Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Gerald F.

Following a jury trial,\n\nplaintiff-appellant Eileen Crowley prevailed on civil rights claims\n\nagainst defendant-appellee L.L. Bean, Inc.                 Several weeks after\n\nthis court affirmed the judgment, Crowley applied to the district\n\ncourt    for    attorneys'    fees.      The    district    court    denied     the\n\napplication, finding it to be untimely, and held that Crowley had\n\ncomplied neither with its own order nor with Maine Local Rule 54.2.\n\nWe affirm the district court's denial of attorneys' fees.\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n               In June, 2000, Crowley asserted several civil rights\n\nclaims against her employer, L.L. Bean.               On June 14, 2001, after a\n\njury trial, the district court awarded judgment to Crowley.\n\n               On June 26, 2001, L.L. Bean filed a renewed motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law or, if denied, a motion for a new\n\ntrial.    On October 24, 2001, before any ruling on L.L. Bean's\n\nmotion had issued, Crowley filed a document titled \"Request for\n\nClarification on Filing of Attorneys' Fees Application.\"                   In that\n\nsubmission, Crowley asked for \"clarification on when the Court\n\nwould like plaintiff to file her application for attorneys' fees as\n\nthe prevailing party in this matter.\" That day, the district court\n\nentered an order stating: \"It is hereby ordered the attorneys' fees\n\napplication      be   filed   with    this    Court   within   30   days   of   the\n\ndisposition of any appeal.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f             On November 8, 2001, the district court denied L.L.\n\nBean's motion for a new trial and amended its judgment in favor of\n\nCrowley. L.L. Bean appealed, and on September 19, 2002, this court\n\naffirmed the judgment below.        Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 303 F.3d\n\n387 (1st Cir. 2002).        The mandate was issued on October 21, 2002;\n\nit was received by the district court on November 4, 2002, and was\n\nfiled in the electronic docket on November 6.\n\n             On January 17, 2003, Crowley filed her petition for\n\nattorneys' fees in district court pursuant to Local Rule 54.2.\n\nThat rule provides the time frame for filing such petitions:\n\n          An application for attorneys' fees in those\n          cases in which fees have been contracted for\n          or in any case in which no notice of appeal\n          has been filed shall be filed within 30 days\n          of the expiration of the time for filing a\n          timely appeal.\n          An application for fees in all other cases\n          shall be filed within 30 days of the filing of\n          the appellate mandate providing for final\n          disposition of any appeal.\n          A claim for fees filed before the final\n          disposition of any appeal shall have no effect\n          and a new application must be filed within the\n          prescribed time as described herein.\nMe. Loc. R. 54.2 (2001).1\n\n             On   January   31,   L.L.   Bean   filed   a   motion   to   strike\n\nCrowley's petition as untimely, which the district court granted.\n\nCrowley then filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         Rule 54.2 has since been amended.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fThereafter, she appealed from the order granting the motion to\n\nstrike.2\n\n                                    II.    ARGUMENT\n\n                  Here, Crowley advances two related arguments: (1) Local\n\nRule       54.2    should   be    construed     to   permit   the   filing   of   her\n\napplication for attorneys' fees, and (2) even if her application\n\nwas untimely under the rule, the district court nonetheless should\n\nhave considered it.\n\n                  Although we typically review the interpretation of a\n\nfederal procedural rule de novo, Blake v. Pellegrino, 329 F.3d 43,\n\n46 (1st Cir. 2003), we accord “a special degree of deference --\n\nabove and beyond the traditional standards of decisionmaking and\n\nappellate oversight -- . . . to a court’s interpretation of its own\n\nlocal rules.”            In re Jarvis, 53 F.3d 416, 422 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nMoreover, we have held that the application of a district court’s\n\nlocal rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion.                     NEPSK, Inc. v.\n\nHoulton, 283 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing CMM Cable Rep, Inc.\n\nv. Ocean Coast Props, Inc., 97 F.3d 1504, 1528 (1st Cir. 1996));\n\nsee also Air Line Pilots Ass’n v. Precision Valley Aviation, 26\n\nF.3d       220,    224   (1st    Cir.   1994)    (applying    “broad   latitude    in\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      Crowley does not appeal from the district court's denial of\nher motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fadministering local rules”).3     While a district court may forgive\n\na party's violation of a local rule, United States v. Diaz-\n\nVillafane, 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1989), we review deferentially\n\nits refusal to do so.   NEPSK, Inc., 283 F.3d at 9.\n\nA.        Whether Crowley's petition for fees was untimely\n\n          Crowley contends that the district court misinterpreted\n\nLocal Rule 54.2, and that her petition for attorneys' fees in fact\n\nwas timely filed.   We begin with the text of the rule.\n\n          As the parties now seem to agree, the first paragraph of\n\nLocal Rule 54.2 does not apply to Crowley's fee application, as\n\nthis is not a case in which fees were contracted for or in which no\n\nnotice of appeal was filed.4    Rather, the timeliness is governed by\n\nthe second paragraph, which states, \"An application for fees in all\n\nother cases shall be filed within 30 days of the filing of the\n\nappellate mandate providing for final disposition of any appeal.\"\n\nL.R. 54.2.\n\n\n     3\n      To the extent that we consider the district court's order\npurporting to clarify the time for applying for attorneys' fees, we\nalso apply a deferential standard of review.       “[D]eference is\nparticularly appropriate where, as here, the correctness of the\ncourt’s   decision   depends   in   large  part   on   the   proper\ncharacterization of its own statements.” Kinton, 284 F.3d at 30;\nsee also Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1987)\n(“uncertainty as to the meaning and intendment of a district court\norder can sometimes best be dispelled by deference to the views of\nthe writing judge”).\n     4\n      In the district court, Crowley contended that the first\nparagraph of the local rule applied to her fee application. She\ndoes not advance that argument here.\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            The   crux   of     the   dispute      lies   in   the   words    \"final\n\ndisposition of any appeal.\"            L.L. Bean contends, consistent with\n\nthe district court's opinion, that this phrase refers to an appeal\n\nto this court.    Crowley filed her petition for fees ten weeks after\n\nthis court issued its appellate mandate and eight weeks after the\n\nmandate     had   been   filed        in    district      court.      Under     this\n\ninterpretation     of    Rule    54.2,       her   petition    was   indisputably\n\nuntimely.\n\n            Crowley, however, reads the phrase \"any appeal\" more\n\nbroadly to include certiorari petitions to the Supreme Court.\n\nSpecifically, she contends that a prevailing plaintiff is required\n\nto file her petition for attorneys' fees within thirty days after\n\nthe \"expiration date\" of the opposing party's right to appeal. The\n\nthirty-day period should not begin, she says, until there has been\n\n(1) express waiver of further review on certiorari; (2) denial of\n\ncertiorari; (3) passage of the deadline to seek certiorari; or (4)\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision, whichever is latest. Here, L.L. Bean\n\nhad ninety days from the filing of the Court of Appeals mandate to\n\nfile for certiorari with the Supreme Court. After that time passed\n\nwith no certiorari filing, Crowley argues, she had an additional\n\nthirty days in which to submit her petition.\n\n            A plain reading of L.R. 54.2, however, indicates that the\n\ndistrict court reasonably interpreted \"any appeal\" to refer solely\n\nto an appeal to this court.                First, the rule makes no explicit\n\n                                           -6-\n\freference to certiorari, only to \"appeals.\"5                   The Supreme Court no\n\nlonger adjudicates \"appeals\" in cases such as this.                        See Pub. L.\n\n100-352, § 1, 102 Stat. 662 (June 22, 1988) (repealing 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1252,       thereby    eliminating    nearly     all     of    the    Supreme   Court's\n\nmandatory appellate jurisdiction).\n\n               Second,    the    Rule's   reference       to    \"appellate      mandate\n\nproviding for final disposition of any appeal\" reasonably refers to\n\naction by this court, not the Supreme Court.                         The Supreme Court\n\ngenerally does not issue appellate mandates.                          If it denies a\n\npetition for certiorari, it does not issue a mandate; rather, the\n\nclerk prepares, signs, and enters an order to that effect.                         See\n\nSup. Ct. R. 45(3).         If the Court instead grants plenary review, \"a\n\nformal       mandate    does    not   issue     unless    specifically       directed;\n\ninstead, the Clerk of [the Supreme] Court will send the clerk of\n\nthe lower court a copy of the opinion or order of [the Supreme]\n\nCourt and a certified copy of the judgment.\"                    Sup. Ct. R. 45(3).6\n\n\n     5\n      By way of contrast, a local rule in this circuit provides:\n\"For purposes of the 30-day limit, a judgment must not be\nconsidered final until the time for filing an appeal or a petition\nfor writ of certiorari has expired, or judgment is entered by the\ncourt of last resort.\" 1st Cir. L. R. 39(b).\n        6\n      Crowley notes correctly that in the courts of appeals,\n\"formal\" mandates similarly do not issue unless directed by the\ncourt. F.R. App. P. 41(a). Rule 41(a) provides, \"Unless the court\ndirects that a formal mandate issue, the mandate consists of a\ncertified copy of the judgment, a copy of the court's opinion, if\nany, and any direction about costs.\" (emphasis added).         This\nlanguage indicates that our post-appeal procedure invariably\ninvolves a \"mandate,\" whether it is formal or not. Hence it is\ndistinguishable from the text of Sup. Ct. R. 45(3), which indicates\n\n                                          -7-\n\fAccordingly, the local rule's reference to \"filing of the appellate\n\nmandate\" can reasonably be construed as pertaining only to action\n\nof this court.\n\n            It is true that in other contexts, the term \"final\n\ndisposition\" has been interpreted to refer to action taken by the\n\nSupreme Court or to additional appeals.     See, e.g., Clay v. United\n\nStates, 123 S. Ct. 1072, 1075 (2003) (holding that for the purpose\n\nof starting the clock on § 2255's one-year limitation period, a\n\njudgment of conviction \"becomes final\" when the time expires for\n\nfiling a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court's\n\naffirmation of the conviction); Adams v. Sec. and Exchange Comm'n,\n\n287 F.3d 183, 187 (D.C. Cir. 2002)(holding that thirty-day period\n\nfor filing for fees pursuant to Equal Access to Justice Act does\n\nnot run until the period in which an appeal can be brought has\n\nexpired).     These   decisions   are   specific   to    legal   contexts\n\nunrelated to those in the case at bar, however.         See, e.g., Clay,\n\n123 S. Ct. at 1075 (\"the relevant context is postconviction relief,\n\na context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning\").\n\nThere is no uniformity of interpretation as to the term \"final\n\ndisposition\" and similar phrases; other cases use these terms to\n\nrefer to judgments of the district court, a reading that plainly is\n\ninapplicable here.    See, e.g., Roell v. Withrow, 123 S. Ct. 1696,\n\n\n\nthat in the Supreme Court, a \"mandate\" is an unusual occurrence\nrequiring that special action be taken.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f1698 (2003);     Cunningham v. Hamilton County, Ohio, 527 U.S. 198,\n\n202-03 (1999);    Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 51\n\n(1995).    Reading the Rule 54.2 as a whole, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict   court's     interpretation           was   not    erroneous,     and   that\n\nCrowley's application for attorneys' fees was untimely.\n\n           Crowley points to the detailed information contained in\n\nher fee petition and maintains that it is improper for the opposing\n\nparty to have access to it before the litigation is complete.                      The\n\nlikelihood of the Supreme Court granting certiorari on any given\n\ncase is exceedingly slim, however.                    The risk of confidential\n\ninformation being shared with an opposing party who might somehow\n\nuse it to its advantage in litigation before the Supreme Court is\n\nminimal, and does not change the result in this case.                     Further, if\n\nsuch a threat arose in a particular case, it could be addressed by\n\nseeking an     extension     on    that    ground     or     requesting    to   submit\n\nsensitive information under seal.\n\nB.         Whether the district court correctly denied Crowley's\n           untimely submission\n\n\n           Crowley contends that even if her fee petition was\n\nuntimely, the district court should have excused her tardiness and\n\naccepted the petition.        In the district court, she argued that her\n\ninterpretation    of    the       local    rule,      even     if   incorrect,     was\n\npermissible:    \"To    the    extent      that    this      Court   disagrees     [with\n\nCrowley's interpretation of Rule 54.2], plaintiff asks that her\n\n                                          -9-\n\fpetition for fees nonetheless be considered, her interpretation of\n\nthe applicable rule being excusable and the result being just.\"\n\nCrowley advanced no other explanation for her tardiness.             Nor did\n\nshe submit an affidavit in support of her excuse.\n\n          We    see   no   excusable        neglect   in   this    situation.\n\nMisinterpretation or misunderstanding of the law does not excuse a\n\nlate filing in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.                See\n\nGraphic Communications Int'l Union, Local 12-N v. Quebecor Printing\n\nProvidence, Inc., 270 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001) (failure to file a\n\ntimely notice    of   appeal   was   not    excused).      No   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances were asserted here.\n\n          On appeal, Crowley references the purported ambiguity of\n\nLocal Rule 54.2 as an explanation for her tardiness.              It appears,\n\nhowever, that she was on notice that the rule was susceptible to\n\nthe interpretation she now disputes. Her Request for Clarification\n\non Filing of Attorneys' Fee Application, submitted to the district\n\ncourt days after this court's mandate issued, stated:\n\n          Historically,   the    clerk's    office   has\n          interpreted Local Rule 54.2 to require that\n          attorneys' fees applications to [sic] be made\n          only after disposition of any appeal. . . .\n          plaintiff requests that the Court's historical\n          practice of requiring that fee petitions not\n          be filed until after the disposition of all\n          appeals be set forth in an order in this case\n          . . . In the alternative, plaintiff requests\n          an extension of time to file a fee petition\n          until the disposition of all appeals in this\n          case.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f(emphasis added).     The district court responded:        \"It is hereby\n\nordered the attorneys' fees application be filed with this Court\n\nwithin 30 days of the disposition of any appeal.\"         Crowley did not\n\nfile a motion for enlargement of time, nor did she seek additional\n\nclarification of the rule.\n\n            Crowley's filing evidenced an awareness that the local\n\nrule might be applied so as to require the application to be filed\n\nwithin thirty days of the disposition of this court's appeal.\n\nAlthough    the   district    court's   response   was   perhaps   not   as\n\nilluminating as it could have been, it provided additional notice\n\nto Crowley that she would be wise to file her application within\n\nthirty days of this court's mandate.       Accordingly, Crowley may not\n\nrely on her ignorance or misunderstanding of the rule as an excuse\n\nfor her late filing.\n\n            As did the district court, we recognize the harshness of\n\nthe result in this case.      Forfeiting as much as $180,000 in fees is\n\na steep price to pay for missing a filing deadline.          There is no\n\nevidence of prejudice to L.L. Bean as a result of the delay.             It\n\ncertainly    would   have    been   permissible,   and   perhaps    indeed\n\nappropriate, for the district court to have considered the fee\n\napplication notwithstanding its tardiness.\n\n            That decision was committed to the district court's\n\ndiscretion, however.         Citing the essential nature of \"uniform\n\nenforcement of the rules,\" the district court permissibly (if\n\n                                    -11-\n\fsomewhat rigidly) exercised its case management duties.                 See Top\n\nEntertainment Inc. v. Ortega, 285 F.3d 115, 117 (1st Cir. 2002),\n\nand cases cited.      \"Rules of procedure are vitally important in\n\njudges' efforts to manage burgeoning caseloads with some semblance\n\nof   efficiency.     Within    wide    limits,   it    is   for   courts,   not\n\nlitigants, to decide what rules are desirable and how rigorously to\n\nenforce them.\"     Air Line Pilots Ass’n, 26 F.3d at 224.          In light of\n\nCrowley's apparent awareness of the strong possibility that the\n\ncourt would interpret the local rule as it did, the court did not\n\nabuse     its   discretion    to   enforce   the      deadline    and    impose\n\nconsequences for her tardiness.7        Under the specific facts of this\n\ncase, therefore, we will not disturb the court's decision to deny\n\nconsideration of the fee application.\n\n            For the reasons set forth supra, we AFFIRM the district\n\ncourt's denial of attorneys' fees.\n                              Dissent follows.\n\n\n\n      7\n      Our decision in United States v. Fraya, 145 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n1998) does not affect the result here. In Fraya, we held that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in rejecting appellant's\nopposition to summary judgment as untimely on the ground that there\nwas ambiguity in the interplay between two Puerto Rico Local Rules\nas to the applicable deadline. Id. at 5. Fraya is substantively\ndistinguishable from the case at bar, however, in that it does not\npertain to the concepts of \"appeal\" and \"final disposition.\" More\nimportantly, in Fraya we based our determination of abuse of\ndiscretion squarely on the ambiguity in the applicable rules. Id.\nHere we hold that Local Rule 54.2 was not ambiguous, and that in\nany event, Crowley could not have been blindsided by the district\ncourt's interpretation of the rule in light of her motion to\nclarify it.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting). Both the majority\n\nand the district court \"recognize the harshness of the result in\n\nthis case.\"   Ante at 12.     That need not be.        I agree with the\n\nmajority that \"[i]t certainly would have been permissible, and\n\nperhaps   indeed   appropriate,   for    the    district   court   to   have\n\nconsidered the fee application notwithstanding its tardiness.\" Id.\n\nWhile the decision to accept what I will assume was a late\n\napplication is committed to the district court's discretion, I\n\ncannot agree with the majority that the district court acted within\n\nits discretion in requiring the forfeiture of nearly $180,000 in\n\nfees in the name of the \"uniform enforcement of the rules.\"\n\n           The majority recognizes that L.L. Bean was not prejudiced\n\nby the late filing.    Instead, it rests its holding on \"Crowley's\n\napparent awareness of the strong possibility that the court would\n\ninterpret the local rule as it did.\"      Id.    Support for that finding\n\ncomes from the text of Crowley's Request for Clarification on\n\nFiling of Attorneys' Fee Application.           Crowley asked that \"the\n\nCourt's historical practice of requiring that fee petitions not be\n\nfiled until after the disposition of all appeals be set forth in an\n\norder in this case.\" Should the district court determine that this\n\nwould not be its practice, Crowley asked \"[i]n the alternative\n\n. . . [for] an extension of time to file a fee petition until the\n\ndisposition of all appeals in this case.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f            The district court did not address Crowley's alternative\n\nrequest for an extension of time, but rather responded that \"It is\n\nhereby ordered the attorneys' fees application be filed with this\n\nCourt within 30 days of the disposition of any appeal.\"          Replacing\n\n\"all appeals\" in the request with \"any appeal\" in the answer\n\neliminated, albeit subtly, the possibility that the local rule's\n\ntime clock would not start ticking until the second or third or\n\nwhichever was last in a string of appeals concluded, assuming\n\nappeals can be considered discretely.\n\n            Nothing in the court's order, however, clarified when an\n\nappeal reaches its final disposition, an expression the majority\n\nindicates can vary in meaning.     See ante at 8-9.    A party looking\n\nto our local rules for guidance, for example, might find relevant\n\nthis language in Rule 39, Fee Applications: \"For purposes of the\n\n30-day limit, a judgment must not be considered final until the\n\ntime for filing an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari\n\nhas expired . . . .\"    1st Cir. L. R. 39.      In short, I do not find\n\nsufficient evidence that Crowley \"was on notice that the rule was\n\nsusceptible to the interpretation she now disputes.\"           Ante at 11.\n\nBecause I conclude that Crowley was conscientious in mistakenly\n\nadhering to the wrong deadline, I believe the district court not\n\nonly could have -- as the majority recognizes -- but should have\n\navoided   this   unbecoming   forfeiture   by   allowing   a    late   fees\n\npetition.\n\n            I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f",

On June 14, 2001, after a jury trial, the district court awarded judgment to Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 2001, L.L. Bean filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or, if denied, a motion for a new trial. On October 24, 2001, before any ruling on L.L. Bean's motion had issued, Crowley filed a document titled \"Request for Clarification on Filing of Attorneys' Fees Application.\" In that submission, Crowley asked for \"clarification on when the Court would like plaintiff to file her application for attorneys' fees as the prevailing party in this matter.\" That day, the district court entered an order stating: \"It is hereby ordered the attorneys' fees application be filed with this Court within 30 days of the disposition of any appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 2001, the district court denied L.L. Bean's motion for a new trial and amended its judgment in favor of Crowley. L.L. Bean appealed, and on September 19, 2002, this court affirmed the judgment below. <i>Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 387 (1st Cir.2002). The mandate was issued on October 21, 2002; it was received by the district court on November 4, 2002, and was filed in the electronic docket on November 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 2003, Crowley filed her petition for attorneys' fees in district court pursuant to Local Rule 54.2.

Thereafter, she appealed from the order granting the motion to strike.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>ARGUMENT</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Crowley advances two related arguments: (1) Local Rule 54.2 should be construed to permit the filing of her application for attorneys' fees, and (2) even if her application was untimely under the rule, the district court nonetheless should have considered it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we typically review the interpretation of a federal procedural rule <i>de novo, Blake v. Pellegrino,</i> 329 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.2003), we accord \"a special degree of deference &#8212; above and beyond the traditional standards of decisionmaking and appellate oversight &#8212; ... to a court's interpretation of its own local rules.\" <i>In re Jarvis,</i> 53 F.3d 416, 422 (1st Cir.1995). Moreover, we have held that the application of a district court's local rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>NEPSK, Inc. v. Houlton,</i> 283 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>CMM Cable Rep, Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc.,</i> 97 F.3d 1504, 1528 (1st Cir.1996)); <i>see also Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation,</i> 26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.1994) (applying \"broad latitude in administering local rules\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While a district court may forgive a party's violation of a local rule, <i>United States v. Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir.1989), we review deferentially its refusal to do so. <i>NEPSK, Inc.,</i> 283 F.3d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Whether Crowley's petition for fees was untimely</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley contends that the district court misinterpreted Local Rule 54.2, and that her petition for attorneys' fees in fact was timely filed. We begin with the text of the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the parties now seem to agree, the first paragraph of Local Rule 54.2 does not apply to Crowley's fee application, as this is not a case in which fees were contracted for or in which no notice of appeal was filed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Rather, the timeliness is governed by the second paragraph, which states, \"An application for fees in all other cases shall be filed within 30 days of the filing of the appellate mandate providing for final disposition of any appeal.\" L.R. 54.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of the dispute lies in the words \"final disposition of any appeal.\" L.L. Bean contends, consistent with the district court's opinion, that this phrase refers to an appeal to this court. Crowley filed her petition for fees ten weeks after this court issued its appellate mandate and eight weeks after the mandate had been filed in district court. Under this interpretation of Rule 54.2, her petition was indisputably untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley, however, reads the phrase \"any appeal\" more broadly to include certiorari petitions to the Supreme Court. Specifically, she contends that a prevailing plaintiff is required to file her petition for attorneys' fees within thirty days after the \"expiration date\" of the opposing party's right to appeal. The thirty-day period should not begin, she says, until there has been (1) express waiver of further review on certiorari; (2) denial of certiorari; (3) passage of the deadline to seek certiorari; or (4) the Supreme Court's decision, whichever is latest. Here, L.L. Bean had ninety days from the filing of the Court of Appeals mandate to file for certiorari with the Supreme Court. After that time passed with no certiorari filing, Crowley argues, she had an additional thirty days in which to submit her petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plain reading of L.R. 54.2, however, indicates that the district court reasonably interpreted \"any appeal\" to refer solely to an appeal to this court. First, the rule makes no explicit reference to certiorari, only to \"appeals.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Supreme Court no longer adjudicates \"appeals\" in cases such as this. <i>See</i> Pub.L. 100-352, &#167; 1, 102 Stat. 662 (June 22, 1988) (repealing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1252, thereby eliminating nearly all of the Supreme Court's mandatory appellate jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Rule's reference to \"appellate mandate providing for final disposition of any appeal\" reasonably refers to action by this court, not the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court generally does not issue appellate mandates. If it denies a petition for certiorari, it does not issue a mandate; rather, the clerk prepares, signs, and enters an order to that effect. <i>See</i> Sup.Ct. R. 45(3). If the Court instead grants plenary review, \"a formal mandate does not issue unless specifically directed; instead, the Clerk of [the Supreme] Court will send the clerk of the lower court a copy of the opinion or order of [the Supreme] Court and a certified copy of the judgment.\" Sup.Ct. R. 45(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Accordingly, the local rule's reference to \"filing of the appellate mandate\" can reasonably be construed as pertaining only to action of this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that in other contexts, the term \"final disposition\" has been interpreted to refer to action taken by the Supreme Court or to additional appeals. <i>See, e.g., Clay v. United States,</i> 537 U.S. 522, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 1075, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003) (holding that for the purpose of starting the clock on &#167; 2255's one-year limitation period, a judgment of conviction \"becomes final\" when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court's affirmation of the conviction); <i>Adams v. Sec. and Exchange Comm'n,</i> 287 F.3d 183, 187 (D.C.Cir.2002)(holding that thirty-day period for filing for fees pursuant to Equal Access to Justice Act does not run until the period in which an appeal can be brought has expired). These decisions are specific to legal contexts unrelated to those in the case at bar, however. <i>See, e.g., Clay,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1075 (\"the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning\"). There is no uniformity of interpretation as to the term \"final disposition\" and similar phrases; other cases use these terms to refer to judgments of the district court, a reading that plainly is inapplicable here. <i>See, e.g., Roell v. Withrow,</i> 538 U.S. 580, 123 S.Ct. 1696, 1698, 155 L.Ed.2d 775 (2003); <i>Cunningham v. Hamilton County, Ohio,</i> 527 U.S. 198, 202-03, 119 S.Ct. 1915, 144 L.Ed.2d 184 (1999); <i>Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 35, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995). Reading the Rule 54.2 as a whole, we conclude that the district court's interpretation was not erroneous, and that Crowley's application for attorneys' fees was untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley points to the detailed information contained in her fee petition and maintains that it is improper for the opposing party to have access to it before the litigation is complete. The likelihood of the Supreme Court granting certiorari on any given case is exceedingly slim, however. The risk of confidential information being shared with an opposing party who might somehow use it to its advantage in litigation before the Supreme Court is minimal, and does not change the result in this case. Further, if such a threat arose in a particular case, it could be addressed by seeking an extension on that ground or requesting to submit sensitive information under seal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Whether the district court correctly denied Crowley's untimely submission</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley contends that even if her fee petition was untimely, the district court should have excused her tardiness and accepted the petition. In the district court, she argued that her interpretation of the local rule, even if incorrect, was permissible: \"To the extent that this Court disagrees [with Crowley's interpretation of Rule 54.2], plaintiff asks that her petition for fees nonetheless be considered, her interpretation of the applicable rule being excusable and the result being just.\" Crowley advanced no other explanation for her tardiness. Nor did she submit an affidavit in support of her excuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no excusable neglect in this situation. Misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the law does not excuse a late filing in the absence of extraordinary circumstances. <i>See Graphic Communications Int'l Union, Local 12-N v. Quebecor Printing Providence, Inc.,</i> 270 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001) (failure to file a timely notice of appeal was not excused). No extraordinary circumstances were asserted here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Crowley references the purported ambiguity of Local Rule 54.2 as an explanation for her tardiness. It appears, however, that she was on notice that the rule was susceptible to the interpretation she now disputes. Her Request for Clarification on Filing of Attorneys' Fee Application stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, the clerk's office has interpreted Local Rule 54.2 to require that attorneys' fees applications to [sic] be made only after disposition of any appeal.... plaintiff requests that the Court's historical practice of requiring that fee petitions not be filed until after the disposition of <i>all</i> appeals be set forth in an order in this case ... In the alternative, plaintiff requests an extension of time to file a fee petition until the disposition of all appeals in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). The district court responded: \"It is hereby ordered the attorneys' fees application be filed with this Court within 30 days of the disposition of any appeal.\" Crowley did not file a motion for enlargement of time, nor did she seek additional clarification of the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley's filing evidenced an awareness that the local rule might be applied so as to require the application to be filed within thirty days of the disposition of this court's appeal. Although the district court's response was perhaps not as illuminating as it could have been, it provided additional notice to Crowley that she would be wise to file her application within thirty days of this court's mandate. Accordingly, Crowley may not rely on her ignorance or misunderstanding of the rule as an excuse for her late filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As did the district court, we recognize the harshness of the result in this case. Forfeiting as much as $180,000 in fees is a steep price to pay for missing a filing deadline. There is no evidence of prejudice to L.L. Bean as a result of the delay. It certainly would have been permissible, and perhaps indeed appropriate, for the district court to have considered the fee application notwithstanding its tardiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That decision was committed to the district court's discretion, however. Citing the essential nature of \"uniform enforcement of the rules,\" the district court permissibly (if somewhat rigidly) exercised its case management duties. <i>See Top Entertainment Inc. v. Ortega,</i> 285 F.3d 115, 117 (1st Cir.2002), and cases cited. \"Rules of procedure are vitally important in judges' efforts to manage burgeoning caseloads with some semblance of efficiency. Within wide limits, it is for courts, not litigants, to decide what rules are desirable and how rigorously to enforce them.\" <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n,</i> 26 F.3d at 224. In light of Crowley's apparent awareness of the strong possibility that the court would interpret the local rule as it did, the court did not abuse its discretion to enforce the deadline and impose consequences for her tardiness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Under the specific facts of this case, therefore, we will not disturb the court's decision to deny consideration of the fee application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth <i>supra,</i> we <i>AFFIRM</i> the district court's denial of attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rule 54.2 has since been amended</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Crowley does not appeal from the district court's denial of her motion for reconsideration</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To the extent that we consider the district court's order purporting to clarify the time for applying for attorneys' fees, we also apply a deferential standard of review. \"[D]eference is particularly appropriate where, as here, the correctness of the court's decision depends in large part on the proper characterization of its own statements.\"<i>Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d at 30; <i>see also Lefkowitz v.

F.R.App. P. 41(a). Rule 41(a) provides, \"Unless the court directs that a formal mandate issue,<i>the mandate consists of</i> a certified copy of the judgment, a copy of the court's opinion, if any, and any direction about costs.\" (emphasis added). This language indicates that our post-appeal procedure invariably involves a \"mandate,\" whether it is formal or not. Hence it is distinguishable from the text of Sup.Ct.

In <i>Fraya,</i> we held that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting appellant's opposition to summary judgment as untimely on the ground that there was ambiguity in the interplay between two Puerto Rico Local Rules as to the applicable deadline. <i>Id.</i> at 5. <i>Fraya</i> is substantively distinguishable from the case at bar, however, in that it does not pertain to the concepts of \"appeal\" and \"final disposition.\" More importantly, in <i>Fraya</i> we based our determination of abuse of discretion squarely on the ambiguity in the applicable rules. <i>Id.</i> Here we hold that Local Rule 54.2 was not ambiguous, and that in any event, Crowley could not have been blindsided by the district court's interpretation of the rule in light of her motion to clarify it.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the majority and the district court \"recognize the harshness of the result in this case.\" <i>Ante</i> at 28. That need not be. I agree with the majority that \"[i]t certainly would have been permissible, and perhaps indeed appropriate, for the district court to have considered the fee application notwithstanding its tardiness.\" <i>Id.</i> While the decision to accept what I will assume was a late application is committed to the district court's discretion, I cannot agree with the majority that the district court acted within its discretion in requiring the forfeiture of nearly $180,000 in fees in the name of the \"uniform enforcement of the rules.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority recognizes that L.L. Bean was not prejudiced by the late filing. Instead, it rests its holding on \"Crowley's apparent awareness of the strong possibility that the court would interpret the local rule as it did.\" <i>Id.</i> Support for that finding comes from the text of Crowley's Request for Clarification on Filing of Attorneys' Fee Application. Crowley asked that \"the Court's historical practice of requiring that fee petitions not be filed until after the disposition of <i>all</i> appeals be set forth in an order in this case.\" Should the district court determine that this would not be its practice, Crowley asked \"[i]n the alternative ... [for] an extension of time to file a fee petition until the disposition of all appeals in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not address Crowley's alternative request for an extension of time, but rather responded that \"It is hereby ordered the attorneys' fees application be filed with this Court within 30 days of the disposition of any appeal.\" Replacing \"all appeals\" in the request with \"any appeal\" in the answer eliminated, albeit subtly, the possibility that the local rule's time clock would not start ticking until the second or third or whichever was last in a string of appeals concluded, assuming appeals can be considered discretely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the court's order, however, clarified when an appeal reaches its final disposition, an expression the majority indicates can vary in meaning. <i>See ante</i> at 27. A party looking to our local rules for guidance, for example, might find relevant this language in Rule 39, Fee Applications: \"For purposes of the 30-day limit, a judgment must not be considered final until the time for filing an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari has expired....\" 1st Cir. L.R. 39. In short, I do not find sufficient evidence that Crowley \"was on notice that the rule was susceptible to the interpretation she now disputes.\" <i>Ante</i> at 28. Because I conclude that Crowley was conscientious in mistakenly adhering to the wrong deadline, I believe the district court not only could have &#8212; as the majority recognizes &#8212; but should have avoided this unbecoming forfeiture by allowing a late fees petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

We begin with the text of the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the parties now seem to agree, the first paragraph of Local Rule 54.2 does not apply to Crowley's fee application, as this is not a case in which fees were contracted for or in which no notice of appeal was filed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Rather, the timeliness is governed by the second paragraph, which states, \"An application for fees in all other cases shall be filed within 30 days of the filing of the appellate mandate providing for final disposition of any appeal.\" L.R. 54.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of the dispute lies in the words \"final disposition of any appeal.\" L.L. Bean contends, consistent with the district court's opinion, that this phrase refers to an appeal to this court. Crowley filed her petition for fees ten weeks after this court issued its appellate mandate and eight weeks after the mandate had been filed in district court. Under this interpretation of Rule 54.2, her petition was indisputably untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley, however, reads the phrase \"any appeal\" more broadly to include certiorari petitions to the Supreme Court. Specifically, she contends that a prevailing plaintiff is required to file her petition for attorneys' fees within thirty days after the \"expiration date\" of the opposing party's right to appeal. The thirty-day period should not begin, she says, until there has been (1) express waiver of further review on certiorari; (2) denial of certiorari; (3) passage of the deadline to seek certiorari; or (4) the Supreme Court's decision, whichever is latest. Here, L.L. Bean had ninety days from the filing of the Court of Appeals mandate to file for certiorari with the Supreme Court. After that time passed with no certiorari filing, Crowley argues, she had an additional thirty days in which to submit her petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plain reading of L.R. 54.2, however, indicates that the district court reasonably interpreted \"any appeal\" to refer solely to an appeal to this court. First, the rule makes no explicit reference to certiorari, only to \"appeals.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Supreme Court no longer adjudicates \"appeals\" in cases such as this. <i>See</i> Pub.L. 100-352, &#167; 1, 102 Stat. 662 (June 22, 1988) (repealing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1252, thereby eliminating nearly all of the Supreme Court's mandatory appellate jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Rule's reference to \"appellate mandate providing for final disposition of any appeal\" reasonably refers to action by this court, not the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court generally does not issue appellate mandates. If it denies a petition for certiorari, it does not issue a mandate; rather, the clerk prepares, signs, and enters an order to that effect. <i>See</i> Sup.Ct. R. 45(3). If the Court instead grants plenary review, \"a formal mandate does not issue unless specifically directed; instead, the Clerk of [the Supreme] Court will send the clerk of the lower court a copy of the opinion or order of [the Supreme] Court and a certified copy of the judgment.\" Sup.Ct. R. 45(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Accordingly, the local rule's reference to \"filing of the appellate mandate\" can reasonably be construed as pertaining only to action of this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that in other contexts, the term \"final disposition\" has been interpreted to refer to action taken by the Supreme Court or to additional appeals. <i>See, e.g., Clay v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122265\"><a href=\"/opinion/122265/clay-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122265\"><a href=\"/opinion/122265/clay-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These decisions are specific to legal contexts unrelated to those in the case at bar, however. <i>See, e.g., Clay,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1075 (\"the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning\"). There is no uniformity of interpretation as to the term \"final disposition\" and similar phrases; other cases use these terms to refer to judgments of the district court, a reading that plainly is inapplicable here. <i>See, e.g., Roell v.

Reading the Rule 54.2 as a whole, we conclude that the district court's interpretation was not erroneous, and that Crowley's application for attorneys' fees was untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley points to the detailed information contained in her fee petition and maintains that it is improper for the opposing party to have access to it before the litigation is complete. The likelihood of the Supreme Court granting certiorari on any given case is exceedingly slim, however. The risk of confidential information being shared with an opposing party who might somehow use it to its advantage in litigation before the Supreme Court is minimal, and does not change the result in this case. Further, if such a threat arose in a particular case, it could be addressed by seeking an extension on that ground or requesting to submit sensitive information under seal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

In the district court, she argued that her interpretation of the local rule, even if incorrect, was permissible: \"To the extent that this Court disagrees [with Crowley's interpretation of Rule 54.2], plaintiff asks that her petition for fees nonetheless be considered, her interpretation of the applicable rule being excusable and the result being just.\" Crowley advanced no other explanation for her tardiness. Nor did she submit an affidavit in support of her excuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no excusable neglect in this situation. Misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the law does not excuse a late filing in the absence of extraordinary circumstances. <i>See Graphic Communications Int'l Union, Local 12-N v.

It appears, however, that she was on notice that the rule was susceptible to the interpretation she now disputes. Her Request for Clarification on Filing of Attorneys' Fee Application stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, the clerk's office has interpreted Local Rule 54.2 to require that attorneys' fees applications to [sic] be made only after disposition of any appeal.... plaintiff requests that the Court's historical practice of requiring that fee petitions not be filed until after the disposition of <i>all</i> appeals be set forth in an order in this case ... In the alternative, plaintiff requests an extension of time to file a fee petition until the disposition of all appeals in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). The district court responded: \"It is hereby ordered the attorneys' fees application be filed with this Court within 30 days of the disposition of any appeal.\" Crowley did not file a motion for enlargement of time, nor did she seek additional clarification of the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley's filing evidenced an awareness that the local rule might be applied so as to require the application to be filed within thirty days of the disposition of this court's appeal. Although the district court's response was perhaps not as illuminating as it could have been, it provided additional notice to Crowley that she would be wise to file her application within thirty days of this court's mandate. Accordingly, Crowley may not rely on her ignorance or misunderstanding of the rule as an excuse for her late filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As did the district court, we recognize the harshness of the result in this case. Forfeiting as much as $180,000 in fees is a steep price to pay for missing a filing deadline. There is no evidence of prejudice to L.L. Bean as a result of the delay. It certainly would have been permissible, and perhaps indeed appropriate, for the district court to have considered the fee application notwithstanding its tardiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That decision was committed to the district court's discretion, however. Citing the essential nature of \"uniform enforcement of the rules,\" the district court permissibly (if somewhat rigidly) exercised its case management duties. <i>See Top Entertainment Inc. v. Ortega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199912\"><a href=\"/opinion/199912/top-entertainment-co-v-ortega/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 117 (1st Cir.2002), and cases cited. \"Rules of procedure are vitally important in judges' efforts to manage burgeoning caseloads with some semblance of efficiency. Within wide limits, it is for courts, not litigants, to decide what rules are desirable and how rigorously to enforce them.\" <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n,</i> 26 F.3d at 224. In light of Crowley's apparent awareness of the strong possibility that the court would interpret the local rule as it did, the court did not abuse its discretion to enforce the deadline and impose consequences for her tardiness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Under the specific facts of this case, therefore, we will not disturb the court's decision to deny consideration of the fee application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth <i>supra,</i> we <i>AFFIRM</i> the district court's denial of attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rule 54.2 has since been amended</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Crowley does not appeal from the district court's denial of her motion for reconsideration</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To the extent that we consider the district court's order purporting to clarify the time for applying for attorneys' fees, we also apply a deferential standard of review. \"[D]eference is particularly appropriate where, as here, the correctness of the court's decision depends in large part on the proper characterization of its own statements.\"<i>Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d at 30; <i>see also Lefkowitz v.

L.R. 39(b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Crowley notes correctly that in the courts of appeals, \"formal\" mandates similarly do not issue unless directed by the court. F.R.App. P. 41(a). Rule 41(a) provides, \"Unless the court directs that a formal mandate issue,<i>the mandate consists of</i> a certified copy of the judgment, a copy of the court's opinion, if any, and any direction about costs.\" (emphasis added). This language indicates that our post-appeal procedure invariably involves a \"mandate,\" whether it is formal or not. Hence it is distinguishable from the text of Sup.Ct. R. 45(3), which indicates that in the Supreme Court, a \"mandate\" is an unusual occurrence requiring that special action be taken.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Our decision in<i>United States v.

In <i>Fraya,</i> we held that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting appellant's opposition to summary judgment as untimely on the ground that there was ambiguity in the interplay between two Puerto Rico Local Rules as to the applicable deadline. <i>Id.</i> at 5. <i>Fraya</i> is substantively distinguishable from the case at bar, however, in that it does not pertain to the concepts of \"appeal\" and \"final disposition.\" More importantly, in <i>Fraya</i> we based our determination of abuse of discretion squarely on the ambiguity in the applicable rules. <i>Id.</i> Here we hold that Local Rule 54.2 was not ambiguous, and that in any event, Crowley could not have been blindsided by the district court's interpretation of the rule in light of her motion to clarify it.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the majority and the district court \"recognize the harshness of the result in this case.\" <i>Ante</i> at 28. That need not be. I agree with the majority that \"[i]t certainly would have been permissible, and perhaps indeed appropriate, for the district court to have considered the fee application notwithstanding its tardiness.\" <i>Id.</i> While the decision to accept what I will assume was a late application is committed to the district court's discretion, I cannot agree with the majority that the district court acted within its discretion in requiring the forfeiture of nearly $180,000 in fees in the name of the \"uniform enforcement of the rules.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority recognizes that L.L. Bean was not prejudiced by the late filing. Instead, it rests its holding on \"Crowley's apparent awareness of the strong possibility that the court would interpret the local rule as it did.\" <i>Id.</i> Support for that finding comes from the text of Crowley's Request for Clarification on Filing of Attorneys' Fee Application. Crowley asked that \"the Court's historical practice of requiring that fee petitions not be filed until after the disposition of <i>all</i> appeals be set forth in an order in this case.\" Should the district court determine that this would not be its practice, Crowley asked \"[i]n the alternative ... [for] an extension of time to file a fee petition until the disposition of all appeals in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not address Crowley's alternative request for an extension of time, but rather responded that \"It is hereby ordered the attorneys' fees application be filed with this Court within 30 days of the disposition of any appeal.\" Replacing \"all appeals\" in the request with \"any appeal\" in the answer eliminated, albeit subtly, the possibility that the local rule's time clock would not start ticking until the second or third or whichever was last in a string of appeals concluded, assuming appeals can be considered discretely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the court's order, however, clarified when an appeal reaches its final disposition, an expression the majority indicates can vary in meaning. <i>See ante</i> at 27. A party looking to our local rules for guidance, for example, might find relevant this language in Rule 39, Fee Applications: \"For purposes of the 30-day limit, a judgment must not be considered final until the time for filing an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari has expired....\" 1st Cir. L.R. 39. In short, I do not find sufficient evidence that Crowley \"was on notice that the rule was susceptible to the interpretation she now disputes.\" <i>Ante</i> at 28. Because I conclude that Crowley was conscientious in mistakenly adhering to the wrong deadline, I believe the district court not only could have &#8212; as the majority recognizes &#8212; but should have avoided this unbecoming forfeiture by allowing a late fees petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
