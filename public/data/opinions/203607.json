Scadron, Assistant Director, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                        December 23, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f              LYNCH, Chief Judge.       Petitioner Contha Ouk was ordered\n\nremoved to his native Cambodia when he did not appear at his\n\nJanuary 22, 2004 removal hearing.              He had filed, in May 2003, an\n\napplication for asylum and supporting documents through a supposed\n\nparalegal, whom Ouk identifies variously as Sok Sombath and Mr.\n\nSokhom. Notice of the hearing was sent to Ouk's address of record.\n\nThe order of removal was sent to the same address, but was\n\nreturned.\n\n              In July 2006, Ouk filed a motion to reopen, well beyond\n\nthe 180-day limit that is permitted \"if the alien demonstrates that\n\n[his] failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.\"\n\n8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).           He claimed Sombath had mislead him.\n\nThe Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") rejected the motion on August 14,\n\n2006, finding, inter alia, that Ouk had been given proper notice\n\nand that Ouk had not established ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\nand thus had failed to show exceptional circumstances.\n\n              The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed in a\n\nshort opinion.        It concurred with the IJ's conclusion that Ouk had\n\nreceived proper notice.        It added that even if Ouk had established\n\nthat he received ineffective assistance from Sombath, Ouk had\n\nfailed   to    show    he   exercised    the    due   diligence   necessary   to\n\nequitably     toll    the   deadline    beyond    180   days.     Ouk   provided\n\ninsufficient information as to what steps he took to keep track of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fhis case prior to July 2006, particularly in the period after he\n\nhad discovered the alleged ineffectiveness of Sombath.\n\n            Ouk petitions for review of the BIA's decision denying\n\nhis motion to reopen, presenting two arguments: (1) that there was\n\nerror in the finding that he had received proper notice; and (2)\n\nthat the BIA otherwise abused its discretion in not allowing him to\n\nreopen because it should have applied equitable tolling principles.\n\n            This court does have jurisdiction to review the notice\n\nfinding.    There was more than substantial evidence to support the\n\nfinding.   See Shah v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 25, 27-28 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            We also have jurisdiction to review the finding that Ouk\n\ndid not show exceptional circumstances.           See Berrio-Barrera v.\n\nGonzales, 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Because the BIA\n\nadopted    and   affirmed   the   IJ's    decision,    but   also   added   an\n\nadditional ground, this court reviews the IJ's decision as though\n\nit were the BIA's to the extent of the adoption, and the BIA's\n\ndecision as to the additional ground.\"); see also Beltre-Veloz v.\n\nMukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2008).           We need not reach this\n\nissue, however, because even if exceptional circumstances were\n\nestablished, Ouk's claims would fail in the absence of equitable\n\ntolling.   See Fustaguio do Nascimento v. Mukasey, No. 07-2608, ___\n\nF.3d ___, 2008 WL 5050169, at *3 (1st Cir. Dec. 1, 2008).\n\n            To the extent Ouk is arguing that the BIA should have\n\ngranted equitable tolling, we rely on the discussion of the issue\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fin our recent decision in Fustaguio do Nascimento.     The agency\n\nbased its decision on the factual determination that Ouk had not\n\nexercised due diligence, which is a precondition to equitable\n\ntolling, if tolling is even available in these circumstances.   Id.\n\nat *5.   We, accordingly, lack jurisdiction to review this claim.\n\nId.\n\n          The petition for review is denied in part and dismissed\n\nin part for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
