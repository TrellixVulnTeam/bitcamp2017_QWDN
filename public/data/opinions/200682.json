Overview.\n\n     A jury trial before the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict   of   Massachusetts   resulted    in   a   judgment   directing\n\nWestfield Gage Co., Inc. (“Westfield”) to pay $582,225 to Anita J.\n\nHorney (“Horney”) in damages and attorney’s fees on account of\n\nvarious claims under Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.), the\n\nEqual Pay Act (26 U.S.C. § 206(d)), and a Massachusetts employment\n\ndiscrimination statute (Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B).         A co-defendant,\n\nEdward Woodis, was ordered to pay $25,000 in damages for sexually\n\nharassing Horney. Following the jury’s verdict, the district court\n\nreduced the jury’s $750,000 award on the gender discrimination\n\nclaim to $187,500 and denied Woodis’s request that his post-verdict\n\nsettlement agreement with Horney be invalidated.\n\n     Westfield and Woodis, collectively “Appellants,” appeal the\n\ndistrict court’s disposition of their post-verdict motions for\n\njudgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, a new trial.        Woodis\n\nalso appeals the denial of his motion concerning the settlement\n\nagreement.   Horney cross-appeals, requesting that we find error in\n\nthe district court’s decision at trial to dismiss her claims for\n\npunitive damages.\n\n     We will uphold the jury’s verdict finding that Woodis and\n\nWestfield had sexually harassed Horney by subjecting her to a\n\n                                  -2-\n\fhostile and abusive working environment in violation of Title VII\n\nand Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B.               We will also affirm the district\n\ncourt’s refusal to invalidate the settlement agreement between\n\nHorney and Woodis.       However, we will reverse the judgment against\n\nWestfield    to    the    extent    it      is    based     on   Horney’s   gender\n\ndiscrimination claim and will remand for a new trial on that claim.\n\nRespecting Horney’s cross-appeal, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt erred in dismissing Horney’s claims for punitive damages and\n\nwill    remand    the    matter    to    the     district    court   for    further\n\nproceedings on those claims consistent with this opinion.\n\n       The parties are familiar with the factual setting of this\n\nmatter and with the evidence submitted at trial.                   Since we write\n\nonly for them, we do not provide a narrative summary of that\n\nevidence.    We will address in turn each of the assigned errors in\n\nthe appeals and the cross-appeal and will there refer to the\n\nevidence where necessary to explain the court’s disposition.\n\n                              II.       The Appeals.\n\n1. The liability verdict on the hostile work environment claims is\nnot supported by the record.\n\n       In order to be successful on a hostile work environment claim\n\nunder Title VII, a plaintiff must establish:\n\n       (1) that she (or he) is a member of a protected class;\n       (2) that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual\n       harassment; (3) that the harassment was based upon sex;\n       (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or\n\n                                         -3-\n\f     pervasive so as to alter the conditions of plaintiff's\n     employment and create an abusive work environment; (5)\n     that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively\n     and subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable person\n     would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact\n     did perceive it to be so; and (6) that some basis for\n     employer liability has been established.\n\nCrowley   v.    L.L.       Bean,    Inc.,    303     F.3d   387,    395   (1st   Cir.\n\n2002)(quotations omitted).\n\n     Pursuant to Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B § 4(16A), it is unlawful\n\n“[f]or any employer, personally or through its agents, to sexually\n\nharass any employee.”              Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B § 1(18) defines\n\n“sexual harassment” as:\n\n     sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other\n     verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when (a)\n     submission to or rejection of such advances, requests or\n     conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or\n     condition of employment or as a basis for employment\n     decisions; (b) such advances, requests or conduct have\n     the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an\n     individual's    work   performance    by   creating    an\n     intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive\n     work environment. Discrimination on the basis of sex\n     shall include, but not be limited to, sexual harassment.\n\nTo establish a claim based on this statute, a “plaintiff [is]\n\nrequired to demonstrate that she worked in a sexually hostile\n\nenvironment         that    unreasonably           interfered      with   her    work\n\nperformance.” Muzzy v. Cahillane Motors, Inc., 749 N.E.2d 691, 694\n\n(Mass. 2001).         To sustain this burden, the plaintiff needs to\n\n“establish that the conduct alleged was sufficiently severe and\n\npervasive      to     interfere       with     a     reasonable      person’s    work\n\n                                         -4-\n\fperformance.”       Id.     “‘To constitute actionable harassment, the\n\nclaimed       conduct    must   be   both     objectively      and     subjectively\n\noffensive.’”       Id. at 695 n.2 (quoting Messina v. Araserve, Inc.,\n\n906 F. Supp. 34, 36 (D. Mass. 1995)).\n\n     Appellants attack the subjective element of the hostile work\n\nenvironment      test.      They     assert    that   Horney     was    a   willful\n\nparticipant in much of the complained of conduct and, therefore,\n\nthe conduct at Westfield was not unwelcome.              They also assert that\n\nthe conduct was not, as a matter of law, sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to constitute a hostile environment.\n\n        Based on our review of the evidence at trial, and drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the jury’s verdict, we find that\n\nthere    is    sufficient   evidence     to    sustain   the    verdict     against\n\nAppellants on the hostile work environment claims.                   In particular,\n\nwe find that there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to\n\nconclude that the complained of conduct was both objectively and\n\nsubjectively offensive and that it was severe and pervasive.\n\n        Testimony at trial indicated that her supervisor, Woodis,\n\nregularly used such terms as “bitch” and “cunt.”                At trial, Horney\n\ntestified that Woodis repeatedly asked her, “[w]hose desk are you\n\nunder?” He had also asked her “[a]re you fucking him now?,” “[y]ou\n\nblowing him?,” and while she was talking to a co-worker he asked\n\nthe co-worker “[w]hat, are you fucking her mother?”                     On another\n\n                                       -5-\n\foccasion, when she remarked that she was anal retentive, he asked\n\nher “[i]s that what your mother taught you to do, lick ass?”\n\nEvidence indicated that another Westfield employee remarked to her\n\nthat “[w]omen are only good at getting fucked up the ass at\n\nWestfield Gage.”     Horney testified that on one occasion Woodis\n\nremarked to her that “[t]hey should have never hired women in this\n\ndepartment,” and “[w]omen don’t belong in the work – machine\n\nshops.”   The evidence further showed that lewd posters, pictures\n\nand other explicit material were common place at Westfield.\n\n     Appellants    argue   that,   because   Horney   concedes    that   she\n\nengaged in some salacious conduct, used obscenities, and regarded\n\nsome of the provocative pictures as “funny,” she cannot, as a\n\nmatter of law, show that the sexually explicit conduct at Westfield\n\nwas subjectively offensive or unwelcome.         We find this argument\n\nunpersuasive.     There was ample evidence that Horney found the\n\nconduct she complained of unwelcome.         She testified, repeatedly,\n\nthat she felt offended      and “humiliated” by the sexual comments\n\nmade by her supervisor, Woodis, and other co-workers.            Judy Gutt,\n\nthe person charged with fielding sexual harassment complaints at\n\nWestfield testified that on several occasions Horney had complained\n\n-- usually informally -- about incidents at Westfield.                   Gutt\n\ntestified that Horney had complained when a co-worker told her that\n\n“[w]omen were only good at getting fucked up the ass at Westfield\n\n                                   -6-\n\fGage.”   She testified that Horney had complained that Woodis had\n\nasked Horney whose desk she was under, and if she “was fucking [a\n\nfellow employee] now.”         Gutt also testified that Horney complained\n\nabout the off-color comment Woodis made about her mother, and about\n\nWoodis having asked her on a regular basis who she was blowing.\n\n     Horney’s expert witness, Dr. Lloyd Price, testified that\n\nHorney’s participation in some of the risque conduct “represented\n\nan adaption to an environment in which the use of profanity was\n\nrife.”   Horney’s use of profanity, he indicated, represented both\n\nan   attempt    to   “fit      in”   and   to   adjust,    e.g.   survive    her\n\nenvironment.”     Horney’s attorney asked Dr. Price whether “knowing\n\nthat . . . she would laugh at a joke that might have sexual\n\n[content], does that change your opinion at all about whether or\n\nnot she would be distressed by the workplace?”              Dr. Price replied\n\nthat it would not.\n\n     Horney admits that during her employment at Westfield she used\n\nobscenities and participated in conduct relating to certain sexual\n\njokes and      pictures   at    Westfield.      However,   the    evidence   she\n\nsubmitted supports a finding of threatening and offensive conduct\n\nby Woodis and other co-workers which is distinguishable from the\n\nconduct in which she engaged.              The jury could reasonably have\n\ndistinguished between joking references to sexual material made by\n\nHorney, and her supervisor’s screamed obscenities, offensive and\n\n                                       -7-\n\fderogatory comments regarding whether she or her mother were\n\nengaging in sex acts with particular co-workers, and statements\n\nabout women’s role at Westfield. See Garcez v. Freightliner Corp.,\n\n72 P.3d 78, 86 (Ore. App. 2003) (finding that a reasonable jury\n\ncould     conclude   that   racially    motivated      conduct   and   comments\n\ndirected at the plaintiff were subjectively unwelcome even though\n\nplaintiff     had    engaged   in   some     similar   conduct   as    a   coping\n\nmechanism). Because a reasonable jury could have found the alleged\n\nconduct at issue to be both subjectively offensive/unwelcome and\n\nsevere and pervasive, we will decline to disturb the jury’s verdict\n\nregarding the sexual harassment claim.1\n\n2.   The jury’s award of $250,000 for emotional harm was excessive.\n\n\n\n      1\n      Appellants also argue that they are entitled to a new trial\non the sexual harassment charge because the district court\nimproperly excluded evidence.      Appellants sought to introduce\ntestimony that, in 1993, Horney lifted her shirt, exposing her\nbreasts to the male witness while she was working at the Maple Leaf\nRestaurant. The district court excluded the evidence as being only\nmildly relevant under Federal Rule of Evidence 401 and unduly\nprejudicial under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. This was not an\nabuse of its considerable discretion under Rule 403.\n     Appellants also urge that the court committed reversible error\nby failing to instruct the jury that neither Title VII nor its\nMassachusetts equivalent mandate clean language.      The district\ncourt fully and accurately explained to the jury what was required\nby Title VII and the Massachusetts statute in a sexual harassment\ncase. It was not required to do more. See Poulin v. Greer, 18\nF.3d 979, 983 n.3 (1st Cir. 1994) (“In reviewing a court’s decision\nnot to give a particular instruction, our duty is to determine\nwhether the instructions as given tend to confuse or mislead the\njury with regard to the applicable principles of law.”).\n\n                                       -8-\n\f     “We     rarely   will    override      the    jury’s         judgment    on   the\n\nappropriate amount of damages awarded.                  [T]he jury’s otherwise\n\nsupportable verdict stands unless [it is] grossly excessive or\n\nshocking to the conscience.”          Brown v. Freedman Baking Co., 810\n\nF.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1987) (alterations in original) (internal\n\nquotations omitted).         “We will not disturb an award of damages\n\nbecause it is extremely generous or because we think the damages\n\nare considerably less. . . .         We will only reverse an award if it\n\nis so grossly disproportionate to any injury established by the\n\nevidence as to be unconscionable as a matter of law.”                        Koster v.\n\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 181 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     Here, Horney submitted evidence from an expert psychiatrist\n\ndescribing Horney’s symptoms of sleep disturbances, withdrawal,\n\nnausea and vomiting.          He diagnosed Horney as suffering major\n\ndepression    resulting      from   harassment         in   the    workplace.       He\n\ntestified that she was still significantly symptomatic three-and-\n\none-half years after her employment ended.\n\n     This evidence is similar to other cases where courts have\n\nupheld similar jury awards.         See Koster, 181 F.3d at 36 (finding\n\nthat $250,000 was the maximum recovery for emotional damages in a\n\ncase where the plaintiff had lost his job of 25 years and had\n\ntrouble sleeping, was anxious, and his family life had suffered);\n\nWestinghouse     Elec.    Supply     Corp.        v.    Mass.      Comm’n      Against\n\n                                      -9-\n\fDiscrimination, 9 Mass. L. Rep. 661 (Mass. Super. Ct. Mar. 5, 1999)\n\n(affirming an award of $250,000 for emotional distress where a\n\nplaintiff suffered exacerbated insomnia, constant diarrhea, and\n\nstomach pain (all of which were present to a lesser degree because\n\nof a physical ailment that resulted in his termination)).                      We\n\ndecline to disturb the award of compensatory damages for Horney’s\n\nemotional distress.\n\n3. There is insufficient evidence to support a verdict against\nWestfield on the gender discrimination claim.\n\n       Westfield argues that Horney failed to provide sufficient\n\nevidence of actionable gender discrimination and, therefore, we\n\nmust   direct      that    judgment     be   entered    in   Westfield’s    favor.\n\nAlternatively, Westfield argues that it is entitled to a new trial\n\nbecause the district court failed to meaningfully limit what\n\nconduct the jury could consider actionable gender discrimination.\n\nWestfield    asserts       that   the   jury’s   general     verdict   of   gender\n\ndiscrimination prevents this court from determining whether the\n\nverdict rests on a proper foundation.                    We first turn to the\n\ninsufficiency of evidence argument.\n\n       We   find    that    Horney      presented      sufficient   evidence    of\n\nactionable gender discrimination for a jury to reasonably find in\n\nher favor.      We will, therefore, reject Westfield’s demand that we\n\ndirect the district court to enter judgment in Westfield’s favor.\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f     Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party, a jury could have reasonably concluded that Westfield\n\nengaged in actionable gender discrimination.            At the very least,\n\nHorney showed a prima facie case of gender discrimination regarding\n\nher termination from Westfield.       Neither party disputes whether\n\nHorney is a member of a protected class.            It is undisputed that\n\nHorney offered evidence of at least two adverse employment actions.\n\nHorney argues that she was fired, or, alternatively, that she was\n\nconstructively discharged.    Either action would constitute a well-\n\nestablished adverse employment action under Title VII.            See Benoit\n\nv. Tech. Mfg. Corp., 331 F.3d 166, 173 n.2 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nLandrau-Romero v. Banco Popular De Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 613\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).       Additionally, the environment at Westfield,\n\nincluding   specific   evidence   relating    to   Woodis’s    gender-based\n\ntreatment of Horney, shows that there was sufficient evidence for\n\nHorney to show that she was constructively discharged.            Westfield\n\ndoes not challenge the other elements of Horney’s prima facie case.\n\n     Westfield also correctly contends that its articulation of a\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Horney’s termination,\n\ni.e.,   insubordination,   required      Horney    to   come   forward   with\n\nevidence from which the jury could find pretext.           While we agree,\n\nwe conclude that she met this burden.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f      Showing that similarly situated males were treated differently\n\nis only one way in which a female plaintiff can prove pretext.\n\nKosereis v. Rhode Island, 331 F.3d 207, 213 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nAnother “method is to show that discriminatory comments were made\n\nby the key decisionmaker or those in a position to influence the\n\ndecisionmaker.”     Santiago-Ramos v. Centenial P.R. Wireless Corp.,\n\n217 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 2000).      See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co.,\n\n950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir. 1991) (stating that means to show\n\npretext and discrimination may include “but are by no means limited\n\nto,   statistical   evidence     showing    disparate   treatment    by   the\n\nemployer of members of the protected class, [denigrating] comments\n\nby decisionmakers . . . , [and] the incidence of differential\n\ntreatment in the workplace”) (citations omitted).                 The evidence\n\nproduced at trial was sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that\n\nWestfield’s     proffered     explanation    for   Horney’s   discharge     –\n\ninsubordination – was pretextual and that gender discrimination\n\nmotivated Horney’s discharge.        As Horney’s immediate supervisor,\n\nWoodis was either the decisionmaker regarding the termination or\n\none in   a    position   to   influence    the   decisionmaker.     Evidence\n\nindicated that Woodis had stated that “[w]omen don’t belong in\n\nmachine shops,” and that “[t]hey should never have hired women in\n\nthis department.”        Evidence also included testimony that Woodis\n\ntreated women more harshly than men and would use derogatory terms\n\n                                    -12-\n\fthat uniquely refer to the female gender, such as “bitch” and\n\n“cunt.”\n\n     Finally, when Horney went home, evidence at trial indicated\n\nthat Woodis directed Gutt to “call that drunk and drug crazed bitch\n\nand tell her to get her ass back in here.”       (Emphasis added.)      See\n\nThomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 58 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(stating that a finding that the plaintiff was treated differently\n\nbecause of membership in a protected class can be made even if the\n\nemployer “simply did so because of unthinking stereotypes or\n\nbias”).\n\n4.   A retrial of the gender discrimination claim is required\nbecause the verdict rendered by the jury may rest on an improper\nfoundation.\n\n     Westfield insists that some of Horney’s gender discrimination\n\nclaims    did   not   involve   adverse   employment   actions   that   are\n\nindependently actionable under Title VII.         It asserts that these\n\nnon-actionable claims included, inter alia: (1) Horney’s claim that\n\nWestfield failed to adequately train Horney, when such failure did\n\nnot result in an adverse consequence to the employee; (2) Horney\n\nbeing required to work on New Year’s Eve, 1997; and (3) Horney’s\n\nclaim that male employees were allowed to get coffee during working\n\nhours, while she was only allowed to get coffee during break-time.\n\nWestfield also argues that Horney failed to provide sufficient\n\nevidence that, as a result of gender discrimination, Horney: (1)\n\n                                   -13-\n\fwas denied raises; (2) did not receive adequate training; and (3)\n\nwas required to work on New Years Eve, 1997.        Westfield correctly\n\npoints out that consistent with the court’s charge the jury could\n\nhave based its verdict on one or more of these six grounds.\n\n     Before us, Horney has not addressed or affirmatively contested\n\nWestfield’s arguments that some of her claims were either: (1) not\n\nindependently   actionable   under   Title   VII,    or   (2)   were   not\n\nadequately supported by evidence produced at trial to sustain the\n\njury’s verdict of gender discrimination.2\n\n\n     2\n      Horney does argue that Westfield has waived any objection to\nthe jury instruction by not specifically requesting special\nfindings as to each adverse employment action at trial. We do not\nagree. Westfield Gage’s counsel argued the following at the close\nof evidence:\n\n     Westfield Gage’s Counsel: My understanding of the law, Judge,\n     is you can use this kind of stuff to buttress evidence, but it\n     can’t standing alone constitute discrimination and so –\n\n     The Court:    Well, if somebody is denied overtime because\n     they’re a woman, that would be an adverse action that’s taken,\n     correct?\n\n     Westfield Gage’s Counsel:    Then how is the question framed?\n     Do you find discrimination   by reason of termination (A), do\n     you find discrimination by   reason of overtime denied (B), do\n     you find reason of failure   to support (C)?\n\n     The Court: I was intending to give instructions which make\n     clear that it could be one action alone or –any of those\n     actions standing alone . . .\n\n     Westfield Gage’s Counsel:       Note my objection, please, your\n     Honor.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f     “It is settled law that, when multiple claims are submitted to\n\na jury and only a general verdict is returned, a new trial is\n\nrequired if some of the claims should not have been submitted and\n\nthe jury’s consideration of those claims may have affected the\n\nverdict.”   Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., 99 F.3d 456, 468 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n     “Work places are rarely idyllic retreats, and the mere fact\n\nthat an employee is displeased by an employer’s act or omission\n\ndoes not elevate that act or omission to the level of a materially\n\nadverse employment action.”    Blackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 725\n\n(1st Cir. 1996). “Typically, the employer must either . . . take\n\nsomething of consequence from the employee, say, by discharging or\n\n\n\n     Mr. Ryan: With respect to gender discrimination, your Honor,\n     I’d ask for a breakdown by the Court as to whether the\n     Plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that\n     she was intentionally discriminated against, and then break it\n     down, A, was it constructive discharge.\n\n     The Court:   Noted and overruled.\n\n     ***\n     Mr. Ryan: I’d ask that there be a second question asking the\n     jury to determine whether they found discrimination by means\n     of termination.\n\n     The Court:   Overruled.\n\n     We find that Westfield’s objection at the close of evidence\nadequately preserved its argument that the district court failed to\nremove from the jury’s consideration certain gender discrimination\nclaims that were insufficient as a matter of law.\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fdemoting her, reducing her salary, or divesting her of significant\n\nresponsibilities” or “withhold from the employee an accouterment of\n\nthe employment relationship, say, by failing to follow a customary\n\npractice of considering her for promotion after a particular period\n\nof service.”   Id.\n\n      At trial, Horney complained that she was denied raises on\n\naccount of her gender.   It is apparent that this claim fails as a\n\nmatter of law.   Horney attempted to support this claim by stating\n\nthat she was reprimanded by Woodis when she asked the company\n\npresident for a raise.   Woodis was upset that Horney circumvented\n\nthe line of authority in not asking him for the raise first.\n\nPlaintiff also contends that she was not offered a raise when she\n\nwas promoted to inspector.     However, as Westfield points out,\n\nPlaintiff received and kept the raise offered to her by the company\n\npresident despite Woodis’s verbal reprimand. Also, Horney does not\n\nallege that she asked for a raise when she was transferred to\n\ninspections, she does not identify a company policy to give a raise\n\nwhen moving to inspector, nor does she identify any employee who\n\nreceived such a raise on transfer.    We conclude that the evidence\n\nproduced at trial was insufficient to support a claim that gender\n\ndiscrimination played a part in Horney being denied raises, or that\n\nshe was even denied a raise for that matter.     See Gorski v. New\n\nHampshire Dep’t of Corrs., 290 F.3d 466, 475 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n                               -16-\n\f(finding that plaintiff’s discrimination claim that she was denied\n\na job transfer failed as a matter of law, when there was no actual\n\ndenial of a job transfer and it was undisputed that the plaintiff\n\nnever actually applied for a transfer).\n\n     Horney also insisted at trial that, as a result of gender\n\ndiscrimination, she was denied equal pay when she was hired.                This\n\nclaim would seem to parallel her successful Federal Equal Pay Act\n\nclaim. Horney now concedes that the jury verdict finding Westfield\n\nto have violated the Federal Equal Pay Act is not supported by the\n\nevidence.    This concession would appear to be fatal to this aspect\n\nof her gender discrimination claim.\n\n     On    remand,    the    district    court    should   require    Horney    to\n\nidentify    the    adverse    employment       actions   she   believes   she   is\n\nentitled to submit to the jury as independent bases for gender\n\ndiscrimination liability.          To the extent Westfield contests the\n\nlegal sufficiency of any one or more of these theories of liability\n\nor the sufficiency of the evidence supporting it, the court should\n\nresolve    the    dispute    and   confine     the   jury’s    deliberations    to\n\npermissible theories of recovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f5. The verdict on Horney’s Equal Pay Act claim is not supported by\nthe record.\n\n       Horney’s     brief       concedes    this       point   and,   on   remand,   the\n\ndistrict court will vacate this portion of the judgment against\n\nWestfield.\n\n6. The post-verdict settlement agreement between Horney and Woodis\nmust be rescinded because Woodis entered it based upon a unilateral\nmistake of fact.\n\n       Woodis asserts that he entered into the settlement agreement\n\non the mistaken assumption that Westfield would pay the settlement\n\namount. He argues that enforcing the settlement agreement would be\n\noppressive and unconscionable because he would be personally liable\n\nfor a $25,000 obligation that he never intended to incur.                             He\n\ninsists      that   his     attorney       worked       diligently    to   secure    the\n\ninformation necessary to enter the agreement; thus, he should not\n\nbe held responsible for the mistake.                      Finally, he argues that\n\nvoiding the agreement would not cause Horney or her attorney\n\nsubstantial hardship.\n\n       The   district       court    found      that,     pursuant    to   Restatement\n\n(Second) of Contracts § 154(b), Woodis bore the risk of the mistake\n\nbecause he entered into the agreement with “only limited knowledge\n\nwith   respect      to    the    facts     to   which    the   mistake     relates   but\n\ntreat[ed]     his    limited      knowledge       as    sufficient.”       Restatement\n\n(Second) of Contracts § 154(b).                 The court found that Woodis, by\n\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\frelying on the statement from Ryan “that the settlement terms were\n\nacceptable,” treated his limited knowledge as sufficient to enter\n\ninto the agreement with Horney.     The court also concluded that,\n\npursuant to § 154(c), it was reasonable to allocate the risk of the\n\nmistake to Woodis.   We find no error here.\n\n7.   The award of attorney’s fees must be revisited on remand.\n\n     “[F]ee awards are appropriate only for successful claims;\n\nunsuccessful claims warrant a fee award only if they are connected\n\nto the successful ones.” McMillan v. Mass. Soc. for the Prevention\n\nof Cruelty to Animals, 140 F.3d 288, 311 (1st Cir. 1998).    Here,\n\nattorney’s fees must be reviewed by the district court in light of\n\nHorney’s withdrawal of her complaint under the Federal Equal Pay\n\nAct and our decision to remand Horney’s gender discrimination claim\n\nfor retrial.   The district court should review the award once it\n\nhas determined the extent to which Horney is a prevailing party.\n\nSee Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n2002); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k).\n\n                      III.   The Cross-Appeal\n\n1. The Distsrict Court erred in dismissing Horney’s claims for\npunitive damages.\n\n     Horney asserts that the district court erred in dismissing her\n\nclaims for punitive damages in connection with her hostile work\n\nenvironment claims under Title VII and Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B and\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fher gender discrimination under Title VII.                See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1981a(b); Mass Gen. L. ch. 151B § 9.          All parties agree that the\n\ndistrict court dismissed Horney’s punitive damages claim because\n\nshe   had   failed   to   tender   evidence   of   the   net   worth   of   the\n\ndefendant.     During the trial, Horney asked the controller of\n\nWestfield what the value of the company’s assets were at the time\n\nof trial.    Westfield objected to this question and the objection\n\nwas sustained.\n\n      Horney argues that it was error for the district court to\n\ndismiss the claim for punitive damages because evidence of the net\n\nworth of the defendant is not a necessary predicate for           a punitive\n\ndamages award.       Rather, it is the defendant’s burden to show its\n\nnet worth if it wishes to reduce a potential punitive damages\n\naward.\n\n      Under Federal law, the burden of showing net worth is placed\n\non the defendant.      See Provost v. City of Newburgh, 262 F.3d 146,\n\n163 (2d Cir. 2001) (placing the burden on the defendant to show\n\nevidence of financial condition warranting a limitation in a\n\npunitive damages award); Mason v. Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, 182\n\nF.3d 1212, 1214 (10th Cir. 1999);       Kemezy v. Peters, 79 F.3d 33, 36\n\n(7th Cir. 1996) (rejecting a claim that the plaintiff is required\n\nto show evidence of net worth and placing the burden of producing\n\nsuch evidence on the defendant); Fishman v. Clancy, 763 F.2d 485,\n\n                                    -20-\n\f490 (1st Cir. 1985) (placing the burden of making a record of the\n\ndefendant’s financial condition on the defendant in order to\n\nchallenge a punitive damages award). Placing the burden of showing\n\nevidence of financial condition on the defendant makes sense\n\nbecause it is the defendant who is in the best position to show his\n\nfinancial status.       Additionally, a rule requiring the plaintiff to\n\nprove net worth “would . . . encourage plaintiffs to seek punitive\n\ndamages whether or not justified, in order to be able to put before\n\nthe   jury   evidence    that   the    defendant     has    a   deep   pocket   and\n\ntherefore should be made to pay a large judgment regardless of any\n\nnice calculation of actual culpability.”              Kemezy, 79 F.3d at 36.\n\n      Appellants   cite    State      Farm    Mut.   Automobile    Ins.   Co.   v.\n\nCampbell, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (2003), for the proposition that the\n\nplaintiff must prove the defendant’s financial condition in a\n\npunitive damages case or otherwise the jury will be allowed to\n\naward an arbitrary amount that would exceed the amount necessary to\n\nachieve a reasonable level of punishment.                  Nothing in that case\n\nstands for the proposition that the burden should not be placed on\n\nthe defendant to decide whether to submit evidence of its financial\n\ncondition so that it may limit the punitive damages award.\n\n      The district court erred by placing the burden of showing\n\nWestfield’s financial condition on Horney, and dismissing her\n\npunitive damages claims. Accordingly, Horney is entitled to a jury\n\n                                       -21-\n\fresolution      of    her   punitive      damages    claims      based   on   sexual\n\nharassment and gender discrimination.\n\n      Westfield argues that if the punitive damages claims are\n\nremanded to the district court, the issues relating to sexual\n\nharassment liability and compensatory damages must be retried\n\nbecause   the    punitive       damages    claims    are    so   intertwined    with\n\nliability and emotional distress damages that Westfield cannot\n\nreceive a fair trial limited to punitive damages.                        Hardin v.\n\nCatepillar, Inc., 227 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir. 2000) (remanding for\n\na new trial on all issues because the award of punitive damages is\n\nintertwined with the jury’s view of liability and its award of\n\ndamages for emotional injury), supports this proposition.                         As\n\nWestfield stresses, the court there observed:\n\n      A jury deciding whether to award punitive damages and\n      their amount responds to the evidence of intentional acts\n      essential here to the underlying finding of liability.\n      But intentional acts span a range of intensity, purpose,\n      and foreseeability, a range that oscillates with the\n      perceived level of emotional injury and its appropriate\n      compensation. Many legal systems reflect this linkage of\n      actual and punitive damages in locating caps for punitive\n      awards. It is no answer that liability and damages here\n      come in distinct legal capsules, because it is equally\n      true that their expression in a verdict is a meld, a\n      phenomenon providing essential anchors and focus to the\n      open-ended character of punitive damages.\n\nId.\n\n      However, the Hardin court was explicit in stating that it\n\nreached   its        decision     “without       deciding     that   [the     stated\n\n                                          -22-\n\fconclusions] are inseparable as a matter of law across all cases;\n\nand we do not suggest that punitive damages may not walk alone in\n\nother contexts.”      Id. at 272-73.      Other courts have allowed a\n\nretrial on the issue of punitive damages alone.          See Jannotta v.\n\nSubway Sandwich Shops, Inc., 125 F.3d 503, 516-17 (7th Cir. 1997)\n\n(vacating an award of punitive damages because of a faulty jury\n\ninstruction and remanding for a retrial on that issue only, despite\n\nthe fact that the jury had also awarded the plaintiff compensatory\n\ndamages); Defender Industries, Inc. v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins.\n\nCo., 938 F.2d 502, 507 (4th Cir. 1991) (affirming a district court\n\ndecision to remand for a new trial on punitive damages if his\n\ndecision to grant a J.N.O.V. was reversed).\n\n     We conclude that the district court is in the best position to\n\ndetermine   whether    the   question    of   punitive   damages   is   so\n\nintertwined with the finding of sexual harassment liability and the\n\nsubsequent award for damages based on emotional harm such that the\n\nentire sexual harassment claim must be retried.          Accordingly, we\n\nwill leave this determination to the district court.               If the\n\ndistrict court decides that the punitive damages issue on the\n\nsexual harassment claim should not be retried alone, the district\n\ncourt should so indicate to Horney and        afford her an opportunity\n\nto leave the jury’s verdict of $250,000 intact by not pressing her\n\nrequest for punitive damages on that claim.\n\n                                  -23-\n\f                            IV.   Conclusion.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is reversed and this matter\n\nis   remanded   to   the   district   court   for   further   proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.         All parties shall bear their own\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\f",

Overview.\n\n     A jury trial before the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict   of   Massachusetts   resulted    in   a   judgment   directing\n\nWestfield Gage Co., Inc. (“Westfield”) to pay $582,225 to Anita J.\n\nHorney (“Horney”) in damages and attorney’s fees on account of\n\nvarious claims under Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.), the\n\nEqual Pay Act (26 U.S.C. § 206(d)), and a Massachusetts employment\n\ndiscrimination statute (Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B).         A co-defendant,\n\nEdward Woodis, was ordered to pay $25,000 in damages for sexually\n\nharassing Horney. Following the jury’s verdict, the district court\n\nreduced the jury’s $750,000 award on the gender discrimination\n\nclaim to $187,500 and denied Woodis’s request that his post-verdict\n\nsettlement agreement with Horney be invalidated.\n\n     Westfield and Woodis, collectively “Appellants,” appeal the\n\ndistrict court’s disposition of their post-verdict motions for\n\njudgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, a new trial.        Woodis\n\nalso appeals the denial of his motion concerning the settlement\n\nagreement.   Horney cross-appeals, requesting that we find error in\n\nthe district court’s decision at trial to dismiss her claims for\n\npunitive damages.\n\n     We will uphold the jury’s verdict finding that Woodis and\n\nWestfield had sexually harassed Horney by subjecting her to a\n\n                                  -2-\n\fhostile and abusive working environment in violation of Title VII\n\nand Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B.               We will also affirm the district\n\ncourt’s refusal to invalidate the settlement agreement between\n\nHorney and Woodis.       However, we will reverse the judgment against\n\nWestfield    to    the    extent    it      is    based     on   Horney’s   gender\n\ndiscrimination claim and will remand for a new trial on that claim.\n\nRespecting Horney’s cross-appeal, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt erred in dismissing Horney’s claims for punitive damages and\n\nwill    remand    the    matter    to    the     district    court   for    further\n\nproceedings on those claims consistent with this opinion.\n\n       The parties are familiar with the factual setting of this\n\nmatter and with the evidence submitted at trial.                   Since we write\n\nonly for them, we do not provide a narrative summary of that\n\nevidence.    We will address in turn each of the assigned errors in\n\nthe appeals and the cross-appeal and will there refer to the\n\nevidence where necessary to explain the court’s disposition.\n\n                              II.       The Appeals.\n\n1. The liability verdict on the hostile work environment claims is\nnot supported by the record.\n\n       In order to be successful on a hostile work environment claim\n\nunder Title VII, a plaintiff must establish:\n\n       (1) that she (or he) is a member of a protected class;\n       (2) that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual\n       harassment; (3) that the harassment was based upon sex;\n       (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or\n\n                                         -3-\n\f     pervasive so as to alter the conditions of plaintiff's\n     employment and create an abusive work environment; (5)\n     that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively\n     and subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable person\n     would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact\n     did perceive it to be so; and (6) that some basis for\n     employer liability has been established.\n\nCrowley   v.

They     assert    that   Horney     was    a   willful\n\nparticipant in much of the complained of conduct and, therefore,\n\nthe conduct at Westfield was not unwelcome.              They also assert that\n\nthe conduct was not, as a matter of law, sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to constitute a hostile environment.\n\n        Based on our review of the evidence at trial, and drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the jury’s verdict, we find that\n\nthere    is    sufficient   evidence     to    sustain   the    verdict     against\n\nAppellants on the hostile work environment claims.                   In particular,\n\nwe find that there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to\n\nconclude that the complained of conduct was both objectively and\n\nsubjectively offensive and that it was severe and pervasive.\n\n        Testimony at trial indicated that her supervisor, Woodis,\n\nregularly used such terms as “bitch” and “cunt.”                At trial, Horney\n\ntestified that Woodis repeatedly asked her, “[w]hose desk are you\n\nunder?” He had also asked her “[a]re you fucking him now?,” “[y]ou\n\nblowing him?,” and while she was talking to a co-worker he asked\n\nthe co-worker “[w]hat, are you fucking her mother?”                     On another\n\n                                       -5-\n\foccasion, when she remarked that she was anal retentive, he asked\n\nher “[i]s that what your mother taught you to do, lick ass?”\n\nEvidence indicated that another Westfield employee remarked to her\n\nthat “[w]omen are only good at getting fucked up the ass at\n\nWestfield Gage.”     Horney testified that on one occasion Woodis\n\nremarked to her that “[t]hey should have never hired women in this\n\ndepartment,” and “[w]omen don’t belong in the work – machine\n\nshops.”   The evidence further showed that lewd posters, pictures\n\nand other explicit material were common place at Westfield.\n\n     Appellants    argue   that,   because   Horney   concedes    that   she\n\nengaged in some salacious conduct, used obscenities, and regarded\n\nsome of the provocative pictures as “funny,” she cannot, as a\n\nmatter of law, show that the sexually explicit conduct at Westfield\n\nwas subjectively offensive or unwelcome.         We find this argument\n\nunpersuasive.     There was ample evidence that Horney found the\n\nconduct she complained of unwelcome.         She testified, repeatedly,\n\nthat she felt offended      and “humiliated” by the sexual comments\n\nmade by her supervisor, Woodis, and other co-workers.            Judy Gutt,\n\nthe person charged with fielding sexual harassment complaints at\n\nWestfield testified that on several occasions Horney had complained\n\n-- usually informally -- about incidents at Westfield.                   Gutt\n\ntestified that Horney had complained when a co-worker told her that\n\n“[w]omen were only good at getting fucked up the ass at Westfield\n\n                                   -6-\n\fGage.”   She testified that Horney had complained that Woodis had\n\nasked Horney whose desk she was under, and if she “was fucking [a\n\nfellow employee] now.”         Gutt also testified that Horney complained\n\nabout the off-color comment Woodis made about her mother, and about\n\nWoodis having asked her on a regular basis who she was blowing.\n\n     Horney’s expert witness, Dr. Lloyd Price, testified that\n\nHorney’s participation in some of the risque conduct “represented\n\nan adaption to an environment in which the use of profanity was\n\nrife.”   Horney’s use of profanity, he indicated, represented both\n\nan   attempt    to   “fit      in”   and   to   adjust,    e.g.   survive    her\n\nenvironment.”     Horney’s attorney asked Dr. Price whether “knowing\n\nthat . . . she would laugh at a joke that might have sexual\n\n[content], does that change your opinion at all about whether or\n\nnot she would be distressed by the workplace?”              Dr. Price replied\n\nthat it would not.\n\n     Horney admits that during her employment at Westfield she used\n\nobscenities and participated in conduct relating to certain sexual\n\njokes and      pictures   at    Westfield.      However,   the    evidence   she\n\nsubmitted supports a finding of threatening and offensive conduct\n\nby Woodis and other co-workers which is distinguishable from the\n\nconduct in which she engaged.              The jury could reasonably have\n\ndistinguished between joking references to sexual material made by\n\nHorney, and her supervisor’s screamed obscenities, offensive and\n\n                                       -7-\n\fderogatory comments regarding whether she or her mother were\n\nengaging in sex acts with particular co-workers, and statements\n\nabout women’s role at Westfield.

There is insufficient evidence to support a verdict against\nWestfield on the gender discrimination claim.\n\n       Westfield argues that Horney failed to provide sufficient\n\nevidence of actionable gender discrimination and, therefore, we\n\nmust   direct      that    judgment     be   entered    in   Westfield’s    favor.\n\nAlternatively, Westfield argues that it is entitled to a new trial\n\nbecause the district court failed to meaningfully limit what\n\nconduct the jury could consider actionable gender discrimination.\n\nWestfield    asserts       that   the   jury’s   general     verdict   of   gender\n\ndiscrimination prevents this court from determining whether the\n\nverdict rests on a proper foundation.                    We first turn to the\n\ninsufficiency of evidence argument.\n\n       We   find    that    Horney      presented      sufficient   evidence    of\n\nactionable gender discrimination for a jury to reasonably find in\n\nher favor.      We will, therefore, reject Westfield’s demand that we\n\ndirect the district court to enter judgment in Westfield’s favor.\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f     Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party, a jury could have reasonably concluded that Westfield\n\nengaged in actionable gender discrimination.

Neither party disputes whether\n\nHorney is a member of a protected class.            It is undisputed that\n\nHorney offered evidence of at least two adverse employment actions.\n\nHorney argues that she was fired, or, alternatively, that she was\n\nconstructively discharged.

It is apparent that this claim fails as a\n\nmatter of law.   Horney attempted to support this claim by stating\n\nthat she was reprimanded by Woodis when she asked the company\n\npresident for a raise.   Woodis was upset that Horney circumvented\n\nthe line of authority in not asking him for the raise first.\n\nPlaintiff also contends that she was not offered a raise when she\n\nwas promoted to inspector.     However, as Westfield points out,\n\nPlaintiff received and kept the raise offered to her by the company\n\npresident despite Woodis’s verbal reprimand. Also, Horney does not\n\nallege that she asked for a raise when she was transferred to\n\ninspections, she does not identify a company policy to give a raise\n\nwhen moving to inspector, nor does she identify any employee who\n\nreceived such a raise on transfer.    We conclude that the evidence\n\nproduced at trial was insufficient to support a claim that gender\n\ndiscrimination played a part in Horney being denied raises, or that\n\nshe was even denied a raise for that matter.     See Gorski v. New\n\nHampshire Dep’t of Corrs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199974\"><a href=\"/opinion/199974/gorski-v-new-hampshire-depart/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 475 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n                               -16-\n\f(finding that plaintiff’s discrimination claim that she was denied\n\na job transfer failed as a matter of law, when there was no actual\n\ndenial of a job transfer and it was undisputed that the plaintiff\n\nnever actually applied for a transfer).\n\n     Horney also insisted at trial that, as a result of gender\n\ndiscrimination, she was denied equal pay when she was hired.                This\n\nclaim would seem to parallel her successful Federal Equal Pay Act\n\nclaim. Horney now concedes that the jury verdict finding Westfield\n\nto have violated the Federal Equal Pay Act is not supported by the\n\nevidence.    This concession would appear to be fatal to this aspect\n\nof her gender discrimination claim.\n\n     On    remand,    the    district    court    should   require    Horney    to\n\nidentify    the    adverse    employment       actions   she   believes   she   is\n\nentitled to submit to the jury as independent bases for gender\n\ndiscrimination liability.          To the extent Westfield contests the\n\nlegal sufficiency of any one or more of these theories of liability\n\nor the sufficiency of the evidence supporting it, the court should\n\nresolve    the    dispute    and   confine     the   jury’s    deliberations    to\n\npermissible theories of recovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f5. The verdict on Horney’s Equal Pay Act claim is not supported by\nthe record.\n\n       Horney’s     brief       concedes    this       point   and,   on   remand,   the\n\ndistrict court will vacate this portion of the judgment against\n\nWestfield.\n\n6. The post-verdict settlement agreement between Horney and Woodis\nmust be rescinded because Woodis entered it based upon a unilateral\nmistake of fact.\n\n       Woodis asserts that he entered into the settlement agreement\n\non the mistaken assumption that Westfield would pay the settlement\n\namount. He argues that enforcing the settlement agreement would be\n\noppressive and unconscionable because he would be personally liable\n\nfor a $25,000 obligation that he never intended to incur.                             He\n\ninsists      that   his     attorney       worked       diligently    to   secure    the\n\ninformation necessary to enter the agreement; thus, he should not\n\nbe held responsible for the mistake.                      Finally, he argues that\n\nvoiding the agreement would not cause Horney or her attorney\n\nsubstantial hardship.\n\n       The   district       court    found      that,     pursuant    to   Restatement\n\n(Second) of Contracts § 154(b), Woodis bore the risk of the mistake\n\nbecause he entered into the agreement with “only limited knowledge\n\nwith   respect      to    the    facts     to   which    the   mistake     relates   but\n\ntreat[ed]     his    limited      knowledge       as    sufficient.”       Restatement\n\n(Second) of Contracts § 154(b).                 The court found that Woodis, by\n\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\frelying on the statement from Ryan “that the settlement terms were\n\nacceptable,” treated his limited knowledge as sufficient to enter\n\ninto the agreement with Horney.     The court also concluded that,\n\npursuant to § 154(c), it was reasonable to allocate the risk of the\n\nmistake to Woodis.   We find no error here.\n\n7.

The Cross-Appeal\n\n1. The Distsrict Court erred in dismissing Horney’s claims for\npunitive damages.\n\n     Horney asserts that the district court erred in dismissing her\n\nclaims for punitive damages in connection with her hostile work\n\nenvironment claims under Title VII and Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B and\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fher gender discrimination under Title VII.                See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1981a(b); Mass Gen. L. ch. 151B § 9.          All parties agree that the\n\ndistrict court dismissed Horney’s punitive damages claim because\n\nshe   had   failed   to   tender   evidence   of   the   net   worth   of   the\n\ndefendant.     During the trial, Horney asked the controller of\n\nWestfield what the value of the company’s assets were at the time\n\nof trial.    Westfield objected to this question and the objection\n\nwas sustained.\n\n      Horney argues that it was error for the district court to\n\ndismiss the claim for punitive damages because evidence of the net\n\nworth of the defendant is not a necessary predicate for           a punitive\n\ndamages award.       Rather, it is the defendant’s burden to show its\n\nnet worth if it wishes to reduce a potential punitive damages\n\naward.\n\n      Under Federal law, the burden of showing net worth is placed\n\non the defendant.

Additionally, a rule requiring the plaintiff to\n\nprove net worth “would . . . encourage plaintiffs to seek punitive\n\ndamages whether or not justified, in order to be able to put before\n\nthe   jury   evidence    that   the    defendant     has    a   deep   pocket   and\n\ntherefore should be made to pay a large judgment regardless of any\n\nnice calculation of actual culpability.”              Kemezy, 79 F.3d at 36.\n\n      Appellants   cite    State      Farm    Mut.

Nothing in that case\n\nstands for the proposition that the burden should not be placed on\n\nthe defendant to decide whether to submit evidence of its financial\n\ncondition so that it may limit the punitive damages award.\n\n      The district court erred by placing the burden of showing\n\nWestfield’s financial condition on Horney, and dismissing her\n\npunitive damages claims. Accordingly, Horney is entitled to a jury\n\n                                       -21-\n\fresolution      of    her   punitive      damages    claims      based   on   sexual\n\nharassment and gender discrimination.\n\n      Westfield argues that if the punitive damages claims are\n\nremanded to the district court, the issues relating to sexual\n\nharassment liability and compensatory damages must be retried\n\nbecause   the    punitive       damages    claims    are    so   intertwined    with\n\nliability and emotional distress damages that Westfield cannot\n\nreceive a fair trial limited to punitive damages.

As\n\nWestfield stresses, the court there observed:\n\n      A jury deciding whether to award punitive damages and\n      their amount responds to the evidence of intentional acts\n      essential here to the underlying finding of liability.\n      But intentional acts span a range of intensity, purpose,\n      and foreseeability, a range that oscillates with the\n      perceived level of emotional injury and its appropriate\n      compensation. Many legal systems reflect this linkage of\n      actual and punitive damages in locating caps for punitive\n      awards. It is no answer that liability and damages here\n      come in distinct legal capsules, because it is equally\n      true that their expression in a verdict is a meld, a\n      phenomenon providing essential anchors and focus to the\n      open-ended character of punitive damages.\n\nId.\n\n      However, the Hardin court was explicit in stating that it\n\nreached   its        decision     “without       deciding     that   [the     stated\n\n                                          -22-\n\fconclusions] are inseparable as a matter of law across all cases;\n\nand we do not suggest that punitive damages may not walk alone in\n\nother contexts.”      Id. at 272-73.
