The\npetition largely rehashes arguments that were made to, and rejected\nby, the panel in its earlier opinion.\n\n     One aspect of the petition does require comment.         The\nappellees assert that the panel opinion gives rise to a circuit\nsplit in light of the decision in Libertarian Party of Ohio v.\nBlackwell, 462 F.3d 579 (6th Cir. 2006).        That is plainly\nincorrect: nothing in the panel opinion is inconsistent or\nirreconcilable with Libertarian Party of Ohio.        The timing\nconstraints imposed by the respective state ballot-access schemes\nare sufficiently distinct that the panel's conclusion as to the\nconstitutionality of the Massachusetts scheme is not at odds with\nthe Sixth Circuit's determination as to the constitutionality of\nthe Ohio scheme.\n\n     There, the Sixth Circuit reviewed a state statutory ballot-\naccess scheme that, pertinently, (i) demanded that all parties\nnominate their candidates in the state's March primary in order to\n\n\n*\n    Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fappear on the ballot in the election held the following November\nand (ii) required any party that did not receive at least five\npercent of the vote for its candidate for governor or president in\nthe previous election to file a petition, bearing the number of\nsignatures equal to one percent of the total votes cast in the\nprevious election, 120 days in advance of the March primary in\norder to qualify to participate in it. See id. at 586. Ohio law\npermitted candidates the alternative route of filing a nominating\npetition 75 days prior to the general election.        Id. at 592.\nCandidates who qualified for the ballot in this alternate way were\nnot listed with any party affiliation but, rather, were denominated\n\"independent\" or \"other party\" candidates. Id. (citing Ohio Rev.\nCode ยง 3513.257).\n\n     The Massachusetts scheme at issue in this case is materially\ndifferent.    It allows candidates to ally themselves with a\n\"political designation\" of their choosing even where they access\nthe ballot through the state's alternative petition mechanism.\nMassachusetts requires that such petitions be submitted to local\ncanvassing officials in late July. Rather than requiring that a\nminor party necessarily designate its candidates a full year prior\nto the upcoming presidential election, as was the case under the\nOhio statute if a candidate wished to appear on the ballot with a\nparty designation of any sort, the Massachusetts scheme demands\nthat such a candidate file papers less than four months in advance\nof the election.\n\n     Seen in this light, the panel opinion does not, as the\nappellees now for the first time argue, lead to the conclusion that\n\"minor parties must essentially become major recognized 'political\nparties' . . . in order to gain ballot access.\"          Candidates\naffiliated with minor parties remain entirely free to submit\nnominating petitions bearing the requisite number of signatures up\nuntil the late-July filing deadline. Political organizations not\nformally recognized as \"political parties\" in Massachusetts\ntherefore have the opportunity to appear on the ballot if a\ncandidate aligned with their organization submits the papers\nthrough this procedure.\n\n     The petition for panel rehearing is denied.\n\n                                    By the Court:\n                                    /s/ Margaret Carter, Clerk\n\n\n\ncc: Hon.

Gorton, Ms. Sarah Thornton, Clerk, United\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Ms.\nSpector, Mr. Baltay, Mr. Casey, Mr. Reinstein, Ms. Behr, Ms.\nGoldman, Ms. Wadhera & Mr. Bialas.\n\f",
