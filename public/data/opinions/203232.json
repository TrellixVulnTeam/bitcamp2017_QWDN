Vilches was apprehended for\n\ntrafficking drugs in international waters by the United States\n\nCoast Guard (\"USCG\").       On appeal, he makes numerous arguments.        He\n\nargues that the MDLEA is unconstitutional and that the district\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction. He also challenges the district court's\n\nrefusal to suppress evidence, to grant a motion to dismiss, as well\n\nas the sufficiency of the evidence upon which he was convicted.            He\n\nclaims that his sentence was unreasonable and that the numerous\n\nerrors in the case prejudiced his right to a fair trial.              After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm his conviction and the sentence\n\nimposed by the district court.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Judges Lynch and Howard write the opinion of the court as to the\nissue considered in Part II(A). See infra at 35.\n2\n   At the time of Vilches's conviction, the MDLEA was at 46 U.S.C.\napp. § 1903(a). The MDLEA has since been recodified at 46 U.S.C.\n§§ 70506 - 70507.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                           I.   Background3\n\n          On January 31, 2005, during a routine drug patrol in the\n\neastern Caribbean Sea, USCG Lieutenant Adam Nolen Berkley, whose\n\nboarding team was deployed on the British Royal Fleet's Auxiliary\n\nShip, the Wave Ruler, received information from a maritime patrol\n\naircraft about a vessel of interest in international waters.       A\n\ncargo vessel heading north had smaller vessels coming alongside it,\n\nwhich raised the suspicion of the USCG.       The USCG continued to\n\nmonitor the vessel.\n\n          The next morning, using the British ship's helicopter,\n\nthe USCG identified the vessel, the Babouth, which was flying the\n\nHonduran flag.    As the USCG approached and performed a visual\n\ninspection, it made radio contact with the crew.        Berkley was\n\nsuspicious of the answers to some of his questions.    He noted that\n\nthe vessel had rub marks along the side; furthermore, it was\n\nrocking slowly back and forth.    Berkley knew this to be a sign of\n\na very heavy load.     Additionally, the Babouth had an unusually\n\nlarge number of antennae, indicative of a great deal of electronic\n\nequipment on board for a vessel of this nature.       Based on these\n\nfactors, Berkley believed he had reasonable suspicion to approach\n\nthe vessel.   As he approached the Babouth, he raised the USCG flag,\n\n\n3\n   We recite the facts as found by the district court, consistent\nwith record support. See United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 66\n(1st Cir. 2004); see also United States v. Vilches-Navarrete, 413\nF. Supp. 2d 60, 63-64 (D.P.R. 2006) (district court's factual\nfindings).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fconverting the Wave Ruler into a law enforcement vessel.    Berkley\n\nalso faxed a report to the officer on duty at the USCG, Southern\n\nDistrict, and followed up with a phone call requesting that the\n\nUSCG contact the Honduran government for permission to board and\n\nsearch the Babouth.   Thereafter, the Honduran government granted\n\npermission, first verbally, and later followed by an official,\n\nwritten communication.\n\n          The Babouth was fifty nautical miles west of Grenada,\n\ntraveling in a north, northwesterly direction towards Puerto Rico\n\nand St. Croix when the USCG intercepted it.    This area is a known\n\ndrug trafficking area.   Petty Officer Michael Christopher Acevedo,\n\nwho was familiar with the area and its history of drug trafficking,\n\nboarded the Babouth with the permission of both the Government of\n\nHonduras and Vilches, its captain.    Acevedo remained on the vessel\n\nfor the duration of the search and was the officer in charge.\n\n          Upon inspection, Berkley noticed that the Babouth had too\n\nmuch free board.   He also noticed that the vessel was rusty and\n\nlooked to be in poor repair.   The Babouth also had drums commonly\n\nused by drug traffickers, including a 500-gallon fuel container\n\nthat smelled strongly of, and contained what looked like, gasoline.\n\nVilches told the officers that it was a septic tank for the\n\ntoilets. The officers inspected the tank, and observed that it did\n\nnot lead to a toilet but to the back of the boat and over the side.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f           Acevedo asked Vilches for the registration documents and\n\nmanifest of the Babouth.        Vilches turned over a briefcase with\n\ndocuments for the ship, and provided Acevedo with an affidavit\n\nprepared in Trinidad stating that the registration had been lost.\n\nAcevedo, however, found the vessel's registration in Vilches's\n\nbriefcase; it had expired on December 14, 2004.\n\n           After a safety inspection and a search for weapons, the\n\nofficers looked for indicators that the vessel was being utilized\n\nfor smuggling contraband.            They found freshly painted areas,\n\nspilled concrete, a bag of concrete mix, and fresh welds, all of\n\nwhich are indicators of hidden compartments.          The sweep team also\n\nfound other items which raised their suspicion about the contents\n\nof the vessel and the real purpose for which it was being used.\n\nBerkley and Acevedo found communication devices at the ship's\n\nbridge, similar to those Acevedo had seen in other drug seizure\n\ncases at sea.\n\n           The Babouth contained navigational charts without plot\n\nmarks and a global positioning system (\"GPS\") that was not being\n\nused.   Vilches claimed that he did not use them because he was an\n\nexperienced mariner.     Despite this assertion, while on board the\n\nBabouth, Acevedo noted that Vilches did utilize the charts and the\n\nGPS.\n\n           On   the   third   day,    another   inspection   team   came   to\n\ncomplete a space-accountability inspection. The concrete blocks on\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fboard, which Vilches had described as extremely sturdy, fell apart\n\nas the officers tried to move them.      The inspection team found that\n\nthe bill of lading for the ship's cargo conflicted with the ship's\n\ninvoice.    Vilches could not provide a satisfactory explanation for\n\nthe discrepancy even though the ship's forms carried his seal and\n\nsignature.    In addition, Acevedo asked Vilches why they had been\n\ntraveling so slowly since a cargo vessel would want to deliver its\n\ncargo quickly. Vilches blamed the slowness of the vessel on engine\n\nproblems.    He claimed that there was a hydraulic leak in the jacket\n\nof the water pump.     Acevedo, a qualified mechanic, inspected the\n\nengine and found no hydraulic lines used for the jacket of the\n\nwater pump.\n\n            By February 5, 2005, the Babouth was in U.S. waters, and\n\na task force boarded the vessel and continued the search.      Vilches\n\nconsented to the search.    For safety reasons, the vessel was taken\n\nto the USCG's station in San Juan, Puerto Rico.         On February 7,\n\n2005, while still searching the Babouth at the port, one of the\n\nBabouth's     crew    members,    Luis     Fernando   Piedrahita-Calle\n\n(\"Piedrahita\"), communicated by note that he wanted to speak to the\n\nDEA.\n\n            Piedrahita met with the officers and told them where\n\ndrugs were hidden and how the plan to smuggle the drugs was\n\nexecuted.     Agents reboarded the Babouth and went to the area\n\nidentified by Piedrahita.        Vilches's attitude, which had been\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fcooperative, changed once the agents returned after receiving the\n\nnote from Piedrahita.    As the agents searched the back part of the\n\nvessel, Vilches became assertive and questioned the agents about\n\ntheir search.      Following Piedrahita's instructions, the agents\n\nfound a well-hidden hatch under the linoleum floor.         Under about\n\nsix to ten inches of sand, sawdust, and ammonia, the officers found\n\na bolted manhole cover.     Inside the manhole, they found several\n\nwhite burlap sacks which tested positive for cocaine.           The agents\n\nrecovered thirty-five bales of cocaine, weighing approximately 950\n\nkilograms.4    Earlier, a canine had detected a narcotic odor in the\n\narea later identified by Piedrahita.\n\n          A.    Indictment and Trial\n\n          After the USCG found the drugs on the boat, Vilches was\n\narrested and charged with possession with the intent to distribute\n\nunder the § 70503 of the MDLEA and with conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute under § 70506(b).      On July 26, 2005, Vilches\n\njoined a co-defendant's motions to suppress the evidence and\n\ndismiss the indictment.    The district court denied the motions.\n\n          Mardonio    Chávez-Senti     (\"Chávez\"),   one   of    Vilches's\n\nco-defendants, pled guilty and testified at trial on behalf of the\n\nGovernment.    He provided details of the conspiracy and of the day\n\nthat the Babouth was intercepted by the USCG.\n\n\n4\n   The DEA confirmed that the substance in the bales was in fact\ncocaine with a ninety-one percent purity, valued between $2,500 and\n$16,000 per kilogram (depending on the location of the sale).\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            According to his testimony, Chávez, a naval mechanical\n\nengineer, met with Pedro Valleadares, Antonio Ruiz, Aldo Lara, and\n\nJosé Sandoval, and agreed to participate in the drug trafficking\n\nventure for $30,000.     He testified that Vilches joined them in\n\nHaiti to help prepare for the drug run; the Babouth left Haiti for\n\nTortola to pick up drugs.\n\n            Chávez recounted that at around midnight on January 31,\n\n2005, Vilches called him and told him that they were at the\n\nprearranged point for the drug pick-up, but the boat bringing the\n\ndrugs had not arrived.      About an hour later, a motorboat, which\n\nVilches was in contact with by radio, came up to the hull of the\n\nBabouth and people on the boat passed the bales of drugs up to the\n\ncrew.   The entire crew, with the exception of Vilches, who was\n\npiloting the vessel, participated in loading the drugs. A total of\n\nthirty-five bales were loaded.     The motorboat then left.      Chávez\n\ntestified that the crew hid the bales in an empty water tank under\n\nthe floor of the Babouth.    The crew then informed Vilches that the\n\njob   was   complete.   Vilches   continued   sailing,   but   was   soon\n\nthereafter intercepted by the USCG.\n\n            Vilches was the only defense witness.   He admitted being\n\nthe captain of the Babouth, but denied any knowledge of the drugs\n\non board.     Vilches denied making any satellite phone calls and\n\ndenied any knowledge of a boat coming alongside the Babouth.          He\n\nclaimed that there was no discrepancy as to the number of pallets,\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdespite the difference in quantity on the bill of lading and\n\ninvoices.       Though he admitted to knowing them, Vilches denied\n\nknowing how to contact either Sandoval or Lamberti.                 His address\n\nbook, however, had contact information for both men; their names\n\nwere highlighted in yellow.       Vilches was also confronted with his\n\nfalsified navigation license, for which he gave no satisfactory\n\nexplanation.\n\n            Vilches moved for a Rule 29 dismissal under the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure at the conclusion of the Government's\n\ncase and again at the conclusion of his own case.               The district\n\ncourt denied both motions.       The jury found Vilches guilty on both\n\ncounts.    He did not move to set aside the verdict.\n\n            B.    Sentencing\n\n            Vilches's Pre-Sentencing Report (\"PSR\") grouped the two\n\ncounts and calculated a base offense level of thirty-eight pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1).       Taking into account Vilches's role as\n\ncaptain of the Babouth, the PSR added two levels pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.    §    2D1.1(b)(2),   for   a   total   offense   level    of   forty.\n\nAlthough Vilches had a prior record, the PSR calculated zero\n\ncriminal history points, resulting in a criminal history category\n\nof I, because his convictions fell outside of the time limit for\n\ninclusion.       See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(e)(1).         The PSR calculated an\n\nadvisory guideline range of 292 to 365 months.              The PSR included\n\nthe statutory minimum term of ten years and a maximum of life.                It\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fnoted that Vilches is a Chilean citizen with no legal status in the\n\nUnited States and that he would face removal proceedings upon\n\ncompletion of his sentence.        No objections were filed to the PSR.\n\n            At the sentencing hearing held on May 19, 2006, Vilches's\n\ncounsel requested that the court take into account the 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a) sentencing factors, and argued that a sentence of 292\n\nmonths, the bottom of the Guidelines range, would be adequate\n\nconsidering Vilches's age.        Counsel argued that a higher sentence\n\nfor Vilches's crime, which did not involve violence, \"could be\n\ninterpreted as punishment because he exercised his right to jury\n\ntrial.\"     When Vilches addressed the court, he insisted he was\n\ninnocent. The Government called attention to Vilches's history and\n\ncharacteristics under § 3553(a) and requested a sentence at the top\n\nof the guideline range, 365 months.\n\n            Consistent with the PSR, the district court calculated\n\nVilches's sentence between 292 and 365 months. Taking into account\n\nthe advisory guidelines and the § 3353(a) factors, the district\n\ncourt sentenced Vilches to 365 months for each count, to be served\n\nconcurrently.    The court noted that Vilches's prior drug-related\n\nconvictions were indicative of his recidivism.             The court found\n\nthat   \"a   sentence   at   the   top   of   the   guideline   range   is   the\n\nappropriate and the reasonable sentence.\"             The court imposed an\n\nadditional sentence of concurrent five-year terms of supervised\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\frelease and a mandatory special monetary assessment, and upon\n\nmotion declined to reconsider the sentence.\n\n            Vilches appeals and challenges the constitutionality of\n\nthe MDLEA, the district court's jurisdiction, the district court's\n\nrefusal to suppress evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, and\n\nthe reasonableness of his sentence, and argues for reversal based\n\non a totality of errors.         We address these challenges in turn.\n\n                             II.       Discussion\n\n            A.    Constitutionality of the MDLEA\n\n            Once again, we are asked to decide the constitutionality\n\nof the jurisdictional element of the MDLEA.            See United States v.\n\nGil-Carmona, 497 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir. 2007).            The MDLEA makes it\n\na   crime   for   any   person    on   board   \"a   vessel   subject   to   the\n\njurisdiction of the United States,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1), to\n\n\"knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess\n\nwith intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance,\"\n\n46 U.S.C. § 70503(a).     A \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States\" includes a \"vessel registered in a foreign nation\n\nwhere the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the\n\nenforcement of United States law by the United States.\"                Id. at\n\n§ 70502(c)(1)(C).5\n\n\n5\n    In 1996, Congress amended the MDLEA, with the Coast Guard\nAuthorization Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-324, § 1138(a)(5), 110\nStat. 3901, and deemed jurisdiction over vessels a preliminary\nquestion of law.   See 46 U.S.C. § 70504 (\"Jurisdiction of the\nUnited States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is\n\n                                       -11-\n\f          Although the concurrence feels compelled to resolve this\n\nissue, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance requires us to\n\nrefrain from ruling on the constitutionality of this statute\n\nbecause the posture of this case does not require us to pass upon\n\nthis issue.6   I believe we should not reach the merits of the\n\n\nnot an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising\nunder this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be\ndetermined solely by the trial judge.\").    Since the amendment,\njudges have taken on the task of determining of whether a \"vessel\n[is] subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" Id. at\n§ 70503(a)(1); see also United States v. Cardales, 168 F.3d 548,\n554 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"The MDLEA has since been amended to\neliminate jurisdiction as one of its elements, making it a\nthreshold question for the trial court to resolve.\").\n6\n   The maxim that courts should not decide constitutional issues\nwhen this can be avoided is as old as the Rocky Mountains and\nembedded in our legal culture for about as long. As early as 1885,\nthe Supreme Court said that the Court, \"[i]n the exercise of\n[deciding the constitutionality of laws], . . . is bound by two\nrules, to which it has rigidly adhered: one, never to anticipate a\nquestion of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of\ndeciding it; the other, never to formulate a rule of constitutional\nlaw broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to\nbe applied.\"    Liverpool, N.Y. & Phila. S.S. Co. v. Comm'rs of\nEmigration, 113 U.S. 33, 39 (1885).     The first rule is clearly\napplicable here. See United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 127 S. Ct.\n782, 785 (2007) (\"'It is not the habit of the Court to decide\nquestions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to\na decision of the case.'\" (quoting Ashwander v. Tenn.

I thus disagree\n\nwith the reaching of this issue by the concurring opinion by Judges\n\nLynch and Howard and express no opinion at this time on this\n\nmatter.\n\n            The standard of review for a defendant's claim that his\n\nconstitutional rights were violated by congressional removal of an\n\nelement of a charged offense from the jury's consideration is\n\nordinarily harmless error. See Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1,\n\n15 (1999). Here, however, we apply plain error because Vilches did\n\nnot object to the constitutionality of the statute in the district\n\ncourt.    See United States v. Brown, 510 F.3d 57, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).    Under the plain error standard, Vilches must prove \"(1) an\n\nerror, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights,\"\n\nUnited States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d 253, 263 (1st Cir. 2003))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted), and that the error \"seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\" Id. (quoting United States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Like in Gil-Carmona, the district court record clearly\n\nshows that the jury was presented with evidence that the Babouth\n\nwas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.             At trial,\n\nBerkley   testified   that   while    the   Babouth   was   apprehended   in\n\ninternational waters, he requested and was granted both verbal and\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fwritten permission, through the USCG, Seventh District, by the\n\nGovernment of Honduras to board and search the Babouth pursuant to\n\nthe Honduran-U.S. Counter Drugs Operations bilateral agreement.\n\nSee Certification for the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act Case\n\nInvolving the Vessel Babouth (Honduras). The MDLEA allows for U.S.\n\nofficials to conduct searches on foreign flagged vessels with\n\npermission of the foreign state.   See 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(2)(A),\n\n(B).7    The   Government   presented    the   district   court   with\n\ndocumentation containing the Seal of the United States Department\n\nof State which stated that the Government of Honduras had granted\n\nthe United States permission to enforce U.S. law against the\n\nBabouth, its cargo, and the people on board.    See United States v.\n\nGuerrero, 114 F.3d 332, 340 n.9 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We acknowledge\n\nthat the 1996 amendments to § 1903 provide that the Secretary of\n\nState's certification 'conclusively' proves a foreign nation's\n\nconsent.\").\n\n          Vilches did not object to the Government's arguments\n\nregarding jurisdiction at trial.        His failure to object alone\n\nsuggests that the asserted error was not plain.     Cf. Gil-Carmona,\n\n497 F.3d at 55.   In fact, at trial, Vilches had the opportunity to\n\nquestion the Government's presentation with regard to jurisdiction,\n\n\n7\n   \"Consent or waiver of objection by a foreign nation to the\nenforcement of United States law by the United States . . . may be\nobtained by radio, telephone, or similar or electronic means, and\nis conclusively proved by certification of the Secretary of State\nor the Secretary's designee.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(2)(A).\n\n                                -16-\n\fbut he chose merely to question how long it took between the time\n\nBerkley saw the Honduran flag and when he received permission to\n\nboard the vessel. \"[T]he record establishes beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that jurisdiction over the vessel existed under [§70504].\"\n\nId.    Even if the jury had been expressly presented with the\n\nquestion of jurisdiction, any reasonable jury would have found\n\nVilches guilty.      It cannot be said that any error in failing to\n\nsubmit the question of jurisdiction to the jury \"seriously impaired\n\nthe    fairness,    integrity,   or     public   reputation   of   judicial\n\nproceedings.\"      United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); cf. Gil-Carmona, 497 F.3d at 55; Neder, 527 U.S. at 19.\n\nThere was no plain error.\n\n           B.   Jury Instruction on Jurisdiction\n\n           Vilches argues that the district court's jury instruction\n\nwas erroneous because it \"improperly invaded the province of the\n\njury    determinations    and    violated    the   Apprendi   principle.\"8\n\nNormally, this issue would be subject to de novo review.               See\n\nUnited States v. Bravo, 489 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).             Vilches,\n\nhowever, made no objection below, and we review a claim of error\n\nnot properly preserved below for plain error. See United States v.\n\nv. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 627-29 (2002) (holding that a defendant's\n\n\n8\n   The Supreme Court held in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n(2000), that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact\nthat increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\" Id. at 490.\n\n                                      -17-\n\ffailure to object to Apprendi error at trial requires plain error\n\nreview); United States v. Portes, 505 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           The MDLEA provides that \"[j]urisdictional issues arising\n\nunder   this    chapter   are   preliminary   questions    of    law   to     be\n\ndetermined solely by the trial judge.\"        46 U.S.C. § 70504(a).          The\n\ndistrict   court     correctly     instructed    the      jury    that       the\n\n\"[j]urisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels\n\nsubject to this chapter is not an element of any offense.\"             Id.    In\n\nits jury instruction, the district court plainly said:                   \"I'm\n\ninstructing you that as a matter of law the motor vessel Babouth\n\nwas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\"           This was a\n\ncorrect statement of the law.       See Guerrero, 114 F.3d at 340 n.9\n\n(\"United States jurisdiction over vessels is no longer an element\n\nof an offense, but rather, a preliminary question of law for the\n\ntrial judge\"); United States v. Tinoco, 304 F.3d 1088, 1106 (11th\n\nCir. 2002) (\"The statutory language of the MDLEA now unambiguously\n\nmandates that the jurisdictional requirement be treated only as a\n\nquestion of subject matter jurisdiction for the court to decide.\").\n\nAt the conclusion of the jury instructions the district court asked\n\nwhether there were any objections to the instruction.             Vilches's\n\ncounsel said no.     There was no plain error.\n\n           C.    Motions to Suppress and Dismiss\n\n           \"We apply a mixed standard of review to the district\n\ncourt's denial of a suppression motion, reviewing the court's\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\ffindings of fact for clear error and the application of the law to\n\nthose facts de novo.\"              Bravo, 489 F.3d at 8 (citing Tinoco, 304\n\nF.3d at 1116).\n\n               Vilches argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated because the USCG lacked reasonable suspicion to search\n\nthe Babouth.         Vilches further argues that Rule 5(a) of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure were violated because it took five days\n\nfor the USCG to get the Babouth to port in San Juan.9\n\n               Vilches further contends that he was erroneously denied\n\na    suppression      hearing      and    that      this    error     unconstitutionally\n\nprecluded him from properly developing and supporting his motion to\n\nsuppress.       Vilches also argues that the district court erred in\n\nholding that he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality\n\nof    the     stop    and     seizure.       Vilches       further    argues   that     the\n\nwarrantless detention of his person for several days constituted a\n\nde    facto     arrest      and    that      the    scope     of     the   detention    was\n\nunreasonable. We are unconvinced by any of Vilches's arguments and\n\ntake them in turn.\n\n                         1.    Alleged Fourth Amendment Violation\n\n               As we have said before,              \"the Fourth Amendment does not\n\napply    to    activities         of   the   United        States    against   aliens    in\n\n\n\n9\n   The rule provides that \"any person making arrest without a\nwarrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay\nbefore the nearest available federal magistrate.\" Fed. R. Crim. P.\n5(a).\n\n                                             -19-\n\finternational waters.\"         Bravo, 489 F.3d at 8; see also United\n\nStates v. Verdugo-Urquídez, 494 U.S. 259, 267 (1990) (\"There is\n\n. . . no indication that the Fourth Amendment was understood by\n\ncontemporaries of the Framers to apply to activities of the United\n\nStates   directed    against    aliens      in   foreign    territory   or    in\n\ninternational waters.\").         Vilches is Chilean, and he was not\n\nresiding in the United States. He was in international waters when\n\nhe was approached by the USCG.               The district court properly\n\ndismissed Vilches's Fourth Amendment claim pertaining to the USCG's\n\nactions in international waters.\n\n           The    district   court   also    properly      extended   the    same\n\nreasoning when it dismissed Vilches's Fourth Amendment claim based\n\non the search of the Babouth at the port in San Juan.                         In\n\nVerdugo-Urquídez, the Supreme Court held that the defendant did not\n\nhave constitutional rights based on his presence in the United\n\nStates because constitutional protections only attach to aliens who\n\n\"come within the territory of the United States and developed\n\nsubstantial connections with this country.\"           Verdugo-Urquídez, 494\n\nU.S. at 271.     Vilches can claim no such \"substantial connections.\"\n\nLike Verdugo-Urquídez, who was imprisoned in California and had \"no\n\nprevious significant voluntary connection to the United States,\"\n\nid., Vilches was brought to the United States for the sole purposes\n\nof conducting a safe search of the vessel he captained.                 \"[T]his\n\nsort of presence -- lawful but involuntary -- is not of the sort to\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\findicate any substantial connection with our country.\"               Id.   In\n\nthis case, we are unable to say that Vilches's presence at the port\n\nin San Juan was completely involuntary because he consented to the\n\nsearch and the USCG's docking the Babouth in San Juan.\n\n            But even if Verdugo-Urquídez does not apply, Vilches\n\nlacks standing to challenge the search.          It is \"well settled that\n\na defendant who fails to demonstrate a legitimate expectation of\n\nprivacy in the area searched or the item seized will not have\n\n'standing' to claim that an illegal search or seizure occurred.\"\n\nUnited States v. Mancini, 8 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing\n\nRakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 138-48 (1978)).          In order to make\n\nsuch a showing, Vilches must show that he had both a subjective\n\nexpectation of privacy and that society accepts that expectation as\n\nobjectively reasonable.       California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35, 39\n\n(1988); cf. United States v. Scott, 975 F.2d 927, 928 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).   The burden of proving a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nlies with Vilches.      United States v. Sánchez, 943 F.2d 110, 113\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).        Vilches must demonstrate an expectation of\n\nprivacy in both the item seized and the place searched.               United\n\nStates v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 93 (1980).          Vilches cannot make\n\nthat showing here.\n\n            \"[T]he   circumstances   and   exigencies    of   the   maritime\n\nsetting afford people on a vessel a lesser expectation of privacy\n\nthan   in   their    homes,   obviating    the   usual   fourth     amendment\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\frequirements of a warrant.\"          United States v. Green, 671 F.2d 46,\n\n53 (1st Cir. 1982).          As the Government argues, Vilches had no\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the secret compartment in\n\nwhich the drugs were found. Cf. United States v. Cardona-Sandoval,\n\n6 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 1993) (distinguishing \"substantial vessels\n\nsuch as cargo ships and freighters\" from \"a small pleasure craft\n\nused for fishing\" where captain had reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy).\n\n            Even if Vilches had a subjective expectation of privacy,\n\nit was not an objectively reasonable expectation.              The district\n\ncourt rightly noted that \"society would not recognize a justifiable\n\nexpectation of privacy in a hidden compartment created for the\n\nexpress purpose of hiding illicit contraband.            To hold otherwise\n\nwould grant smugglers standing under the Fourth Amendment solely\n\nbecause they were careful in hiding their illicit merchandise.\"\n\nVilches-Navarrete, 413 F. Supp. 2d at 73-74; see also United States\n\nv. Sarda-Villa, 760 F.2d 1232, 1235 (11th Cir. 1985) (\"[W]e are not\n\nwilling to say that society is prepared to recognize a justifiable\n\nexpectation of privacy solely on the basis of appellants' efforts\n\nto secret the contraband.           Drug smugglers cannot assert standing\n\nsolely on the basis that they hid the drugs well and hoped no one\n\nwould find them.\").      As the Supreme Court said in Kyllo v. United\n\nStates, 533 U.S. 27 (2001), \"a Fourth Amendment search does not\n\noccur   .   .   .   unless   'the    individual   manifested   a   subjective\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fexpectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,' and\n\n'society    [is]     willing   to   recognize   that   expectation    as\n\nreasonable.'\"      Id. at 33 (quoting California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S.\n\n207, 211 (1986)).\n\n           The search was valid in any event because the USCG's\n\n\"authority under 14 U.S.C. § 89(a) to stop and board a vessel on\n\nthe high seas is quite broad.\"10       Cardona-Sandoval, 6 F.3d at 23\n\n(internal footnotes omitted).       In the instant case, the USCG had\n\nconsent from Honduras, the vessel's flag country, to board the\n\nBabouth and to take it to a U.S. port to complete the search.        The\n\nUSCG also possessed the requisite \"reasonable and articulable\n\ngrounds for suspecting that the vessel or those on board [we]re\n\nengaging in criminal activity.\"       Green, 671 F.2d at 53.\n\n\n\n10\n     14 U.S.C. § 89(a) provides, in relevant part:\n\n      The Coast Guard may make inquiries, examinations,\n      inspections, searches, seizures, and arrests upon the\n      high seas and waters over which the United States has\n      jurisdiction, for the prevention, detection, and\n      suppression of violations of laws of the United States.\n      For such purposes, commissioned, warrant, and petty\n      officers may at any time go on board of any vessel\n      subject to the jurisdiction, or the operation of any law,\n      of the United States, address inquiries to those on\n      board, examine the ships documents and papers, and\n      examine, inspect, and search the vessel and use all\n      necessary force to compel compliance. When from such\n      inquiries, examination, inspection, or search it appears\n      that a breach of the laws of the United States rendering\n      a person liable to arrest is being, or has been\n      committed, by any person, such person shall be\n      immediately pursued and arrested on shore, or other\n      lawful appropriate action shall be taken.\n\n                                    -23-\n\f              As the USCG's monitored the Babouth, it observed smaller\n\nvessels coming into contact with it the night before the USCG\n\nboarded the vessel.          The following day the USCG detected rub marks\n\nalong   the    port    side    of    the    Babouth    but     not    its    starboard,\n\nconfirming their belief in suspicious activity.                        On board, the\n\nUSCG's found even more evidence of suspicious activity.                              For\n\nexample, there was a discrepancy between the number of pallets that\n\nthe Babouth was carrying and those that were slated for delivery,\n\nand the GPS and navigational charts had been erased.\n\n              Each    step    of    the    USCG's     search    was    based    on   \"a\n\ncorresponding level of suspicion supported by specific facts.\"\n\nCardona-Sandoval, 6 F.3d at 23.             In United States v. Berryman, 717\n\nF.2d 651 (1st Cir. 1983), we said that \"although some encounters\n\n[with the Government] do not implicate fourth amendment concerns at\n\nall, more intrusive encounters short of arrests must be justified\n\nby   reasonable       suspicion      proportional       to   the     degree    of    the\n\nintrusion. That suspicion cannot be inchoate, but must be based on\n\n'specific and articulable facts . . . together with rational\n\ninferences from those facts' in order to establish a basis for\n\nreview of the police actions.\"                Id. at 653 (internal citations\n\nomitted).      The USCG had the requisite reasonable suspicion.\n\n              Furthermore, as the district court found, Vilches \"gave\n\nhis permission to the boarding team 'to access any space on the\n\nvessel.'\"      Vilches-Navarrete, 413 F. Supp. 2d at 72.                    Both at sea\n\n\n                                           -24-\n\fand at the port in San Juan, Vilches consented to the USCG's\n\nboarding of the Babouth and the search of the vessel.             At no point\n\ndid he object to the boarding of the vessel, the search of the\n\nvessel, or the taking of the vessel to San Juan.        \"It is . . . well\n\nsettled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the\n\n[Fourth Amendment] requirements of both a warrant and probable\n\ncause   is   a   search   that   is   conducted   pursuant   to    consent.\"\n\nSchneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973); see also\n\nUnited States v. Meléndez, 301 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, Honduras, under whose flag the\n\nBabouth sailed, consented to the search of the boat both at sea and\n\nin U.S. territory.\n\n             Accordingly, the denial of the motion to suppress is\n\naffirmed.\n\n                    2.    Motion to Suppress Hearing\n\n             \"The test for granting an evidentiary hearing in a\n\ncriminal case [is] substantive: did the defendant make a sufficient\n\nthreshold showing that material facts were in doubt or dispute?\"\n\nUnited States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1273 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nVilches made no such showing.           A hearing was not necessary to\n\naddress the suppression issues because in support of his motion,\n\nVilches merely presented the same statements by the USCG as the\n\nGovernment had.     Vilches did not dispute the Government's version\n\nof events and instead relied upon then.       This makes an evidentiary\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fhearing unnecessary since there were no material facts that were in\n\ndispute.   See id. at 1273-74; United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223,\n\n225 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"[E]videntiary hearings on motions are the\n\nexception, not the rule.\").\n\n                    3.    Vilches's Arrest\n\n            Vilches's challenge to his arrest is without merit.\n\nThere was no unreasonable delay between the arrest and Vilches's\n\ninitial appearance before a magistrate judge. Vilches was arrested\n\nthe same day that the USCG discovered the drugs on the Babouth,\n\nFebruary 7, 2005.         He was taken before a magistrate judge the\n\nfollowing day.      Furthermore, the short interval between when the\n\nUSCG first boarded and inspected the Babouth and the travel time\n\nbefore the Babouth arrived in San Juan did not result in a\n\ncustodial detention.       See United States v. Baker, 641 F.2d 1311,\n\n1319 (9th Cir. 1981) (\"routine Coast Guard boarding of vessels does\n\nnot create a custodial situation\"); cf. United States v. Elkins,\n\n774 F.2d 530, 535 n.3 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"It is well recognized that\n\na routine inspection and boarding of an American flagship vessel on\n\nthe high seas does not give rise to a custodial detention.\").            The\n\none day between the time Vilches was arrested and when he was\n\nbrought    before   the   magistrate   judge   was   reasonable,   and   the\n\ndistrict court properly denied his motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f           D.    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           We review a sufficiency of the evidence claim de novo.\n\nSee United States v. Carucci, 364 F.3d 339, 343 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nWe will affirm a conviction if, \"after assaying all the evidence in\n\nthe light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the\n\nessential elements of the crime.\"         United States v. O'Brien, 14\n\nF.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir. 1994).            \"All 'reasonable evidentiary\n\ninferences' are to be drawn 'in harmony with the verdict,' and 'all\n\nissues of credibility' are to be resolved 'in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government.'\"         United States v. Washington, 434\n\nF.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Casas, 356\n\nF.3d 104, 126 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n           Vilches argues that no rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound all of the essential elements of the crimes of possession\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute.      He claims that the Government offered \"thin\n\nisolated points of purported circumstantial evidence,\" which under\n\nscrutiny are easily explained away.            A review of the evidence\n\npresented at trial indicates otherwise.\n\n                     1.   Conspiracy\n\n           Vilches notes that a conviction for conspiracy requires\n\nproof   beyond   a   reasonable   doubt   of   three   elements:   (1)   the\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fexistence of an agreement to commit an unlawful act; (2) knowledge\n\nand intent to join the agreement; and (3) knowing participation in\n\nthe conspiracy.        United States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173\n\n(1st Cir. 1993). He argues that the Government's evidence at trial\n\nwas insufficient to establish any of the three elements.                          We\n\ndisagree.\n\n             At trial, the Government established beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt \"the existence of a conspiracy, [Vilches's] knowledge of the\n\nconspiracy,     and     [Vilches's]        voluntary      participation    in    the\n\nconspiracy.\"       United States v. Gómez-Pabón, 911 F.2d 847, 852 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).     As we made clear above, the Government proved beyond\n\na     reasonable     doubt   that    the     Babouth      was   \"subject   to    the\n\njurisdiction of the United States.\"                 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1).\n\nThere is no question or dispute that the USCG found cocaine,\n\nundoubtedly a controlled substance, on the Babouth. The Government\n\nalso proved at trial that Vilches \"knowingly or intentionally\n\npossessed the controlled substance with the intent to distribute\n\nit.\"    Guerrero, 114 F.3d at 339.\n\n             Chávez specifically testified to the details of the\n\nconspiracy.        See United States v. Cardales, 168 F.3d 548, 554-55\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).       Chávez testified to Vilches's involvement in the\n\nconspiracy. Specifically, once the Babouth departed Haiti, Vilches\n\nwas    in   constant   contact      with    the   owner    of   the   drugs,    Félix\n\nLamberti. While sailing, Vilches informed Chávez when they reached\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fthe predetermined meeting place for receiving the drugs.          Vilches\n\nis the one who received the call from the motorboat that was\n\ncarrying the drugs giving its location.         Vilches ordered that the\n\nBabouth reduce its speed so the drugs could be loaded onto the\n\nboat.   After the crew loaded the cocaine and hid it under a hatch,\n\nthey informed Vilches that the drugs were safely on board. Vilches\n\nthen ordered them to resume their normal speed. The Government met\n\nits burden.\n\n                     2.   Possession\n\n           With respect to the possession charge, Vilches again\n\nargues that there was insufficient evidence that he knowingly\n\npossessed the narcotics found on the Babouth.          He maintains that\n\nthe Government failed to meet its burden of proving that he had\n\nboth knowledge of and access to the narcotics.         See United States\n\nv. Patterson, 472 F.3d 767, 779 (10th Cir. 2006).            The facts --\n\nrecounted above -- belie his assertions of innocence.\n\n           Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the\n\nevidence is sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict because it is\n\nclear that a reasonable factfinder could find that the Government\n\nproved the essential elements of crimes with which Vilches was\n\naccused.\n\n                     3.   Circumstantial Evidence\n\n           Vilches    claims   that    the   Government's   circumstantial\n\nevidence does not withstand scrutiny and should be discounted.\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fContrary to Vilches's claims, the Government introduced sufficient\n\ncircumstantial evidence at trial to support his conviction.                           \"In\n\ncircumstantial cases . . ., the evidence is sufficient to convict\n\nif it adequately supports 'the requisite two-step inference': (1)\n\nthat the vessel was engaged in obviously illegal activity, and (2)\n\nthat   each    Appellant         was   ready     to    assist    in    the     criminal\n\nenterprise.\"       Bravo,    489   F.3d     at   9    (quoting   United      States   v.\n\nJiménez-Pérez, 869 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1989)); Guerrero, 114 F.3d\n\nat 342 (\"proof of sufficient participation in the crime, as well as\n\nknowledge of it, is required to convict:                     the defendant's 'mere\n\npresence' at the scene of the criminal activity is not enough\").\n\nVilches's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\n\nhis convictions attacks only the weight of the evidence; that is\n\ninsufficient here. He fails to demonstrate that the circumstantial\n\nevidence the Government offered is somehow inadequate to meet the\n\ntest   we   laid    out     in   Bravo.      There     was   substantial       evidence\n\nestablishing       each     element    of    the      possession      and    conspiracy\n\nconvictions.       His arguments are unavailing.\n\n            The reason the Babouth came to the attention of the USCG\n\nis that they detected vessels coming alongside it under the cover\n\nof darkness. The Government presented evidence that the USCG found\n\nthis suspicious because a vessel of the size of the Babouth                       would\n\nbe unlikely to stop in the dark, in the middle of the ocean, for\n\nany legitimate reason to take small boats alongside it.                               The\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fGovernment also presented evidence that the vessel had unusually\n\nexcessive electronic equipment, which was inconsistent with its\n\ncondition;    this   was   consistent    with   other   drug    trafficking\n\nventures.     Moreover, the USCG intercepted the Babouth in an area\n\nwell-known for drug trafficking.\n\n            There was also evidence that on board the Babouth the\n\nofficers found indicators of illicit activity and supplies that\n\nwere consistent with the possibility of empty space behind a false\n\nwall.     The USCG found fifty-gallon drums, typical of those which\n\ncould be used by vessels to refuel smaller vessels transporting\n\ncontraband. A large 500-gallon container, which Vilches claimed to\n\nbe a septic tank, was also found by the USCG.       Upon inspection, the\n\nUSCG found evidence indicating that it contained gasoline and was\n\nnot used as a septic tank.       Additionally, the Babouth's GPS and\n\nnavigational charts did not display the ship's prior course.\n\nDespite Vilches's explanation that he was a seasoned mariner and\n\ndid not need to use the GPS and charts, the officers witnessed\n\nVilches use them later.\n\n            The Babouth's registration, which Vilches claimed he\n\nlost, was later discovered in his briefcase by agents during the\n\nsearch.       Furthermore,    Vilches's     navigational       license   was\n\nfraudulent.    The Government also introduced evidence that Vilches\n\nwas hired by Sandoval, who was present at the meeting in which\n\nChávez was hired for the drug smuggling venture. Vilches testified\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fthat as the captain, he was the one to give the orders; nothing\n\ncould occur on the boat without his orders.                    Vilches attempted to\n\nexplain away the suspicions at trial; the jury chose not to believe\n\nhim.    The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly weighs against\n\nVilches.      The evidence presented at trial is more than sufficient\n\nto sustain the jury's verdict.\n\n              E. Sentence\n\n              We \"review challenges to sentencing process -– i.e.,\n\nerrors of law –- de novo.\"             United States v. Rivera, 448             F.3d 82,\n\n84 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing United States v.

[a]ssuming a plausible explanation and a defensible\n\noverall result.'\"          Id. (quoting United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,\n\n440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006)); see also Gall v. United States,\n\n128 S. Ct. 586, 602 (2007) (\"On abuse-of-discretion review, the\n\nCourt of Appeals should have given due deference to the District\n\nCourt's      reasoned      and    reasonable      decision     that   the   §     3553(a)\n\nfactors, on the whole, justified the sentence.\").\n\n              Vilches argues that the 365-month sentence imposed on him\n\nwas a \"de facto life sentence.\"                 He argues that the sentence was\n\nunreasonable under United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),\n\nbecause it was not predicated on the factors listed in § 3553(a).\n\nThe    question      for   this    court   is     whether     the   district      court's\n\n\n                                           -32-\n\fconclusion    is     supported        by   \"a    reasoned        explanation      [and]    a\n\nplausible outcome.\"             Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519; see also\n\nUnited States v. Zapete-García, 447 F.3d 57, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            The district court imposed a 365-month sentence after\n\nnoting that the Guidelines are advisory and after considering the\n\nsentencing factors listed in § 3553(a).                   The district court noted\n\nVilches's conduct, including his knowledge of the drug smuggling\n\noperation despite his assertion of ignorance.                      The district court\n\nalso discussed his prior criminal record, including his 1981\n\nconviction for possession with intent to distribute, and his 1983\n\nconviction,    where       he    received       120     months    for    possession       of\n\nmarijuana.     The district court did not count Vilches's previous\n\nconvictions towards his criminal history because of their dates but\n\nfound them to be indicative of his recidivism.                           See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a)(2)(B) (giving judges latitude to imposes sentences that\n\n\"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\").                          Finally, the\n\ndistrict    court     considered       the      fact    that     Vilches    had    used    a\n\ndifferent     name    in    the       past.       Given     the     district       court's\n\nconsideration        of    the    §    3553(a)         factors     and     its    reasoned\n\narticulation for the sentence, Vilches's 365-month sentence is\n\nreasonable.     The district court's reasoning was persuasive and\n\nexplicit, and the result was proper. The district court's sentence\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -33-\n\f          F.       Totality of the Errors\n\n          Vilches         argues    that    under      the   \"cumulative       error\n\ndoctrine,\" \"[i]ndividual errors, insufficient in themselves to\n\nnecessitate    a    new    trial,    may   in    the   aggregate    have   a   more\n\ndebilitating effect.\"          Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1195-96.              Vilches\n\nasserts that in this case, the numerous errors prejudiced his\n\nrights to a fair trial and violated due process under the Fifth and\n\nSixth Amendments.         We find these arguments unconvincing.            For the\n\nreasons elaborated above, we find that even if there were errors --\n\na question we need not answer --              they were harmless.      Vilches's\n\nclaim necessarily fails. See United States v. Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79,\n\n95 n.23 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[B]ecause we have found that none of [the\n\ndefendant's]       individual       complaints      resulted   in    substantial\n\nprejudice and that most are completely without merit, we reject the\n\nfinal contention that his conviction was tainted by cumulative\n\nerror.\" (quoting United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1322 (1st\n\nCir. 1994))) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons explained above, we affirm Vilches's\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n        \"Opinion in part and Concurrence in part follows\"\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\f           LYNCH and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, opinion of the court in\n\npart and concurring in part.

We\n\nwrite separately to address the constitutionality of 46 U.S.C.\n\n§ 70504(a), a question Judge Torruella's opinion bypasses.\n\n           We hold that there is no constitutional infirmity in\n\nCongress's explicit allocation in § 70504(a) of the question of\n\nwhether a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates\" to the court rather than the jury for decision.        That\n\nallocation was well within the power of Congress.\n\n           Vilches did not raise a challenge to the statute's\n\nconstitutionality in the district court and so our review is for\n\nplain error.    United States v. JG-24, Inc., 478 F.3d 28, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).     To establish plain error, Vilches must demonstrate\n\nthat \"(1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error\n\naffected [his] substantial rights; and (4) the error adversely\n\nimpacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"    United States v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).   We resolve this claim at the first step on the grounds that\n\nthere was no error at all.   See, e.g., United States v. Arango, 508\n\nF.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Vargas, 471 F.3d 255,\n\n264 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Morales-Rodríguez, 467 F.3d\n\n1, 16 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                -35-\n\f           Under 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1), an individual \"may not\n\nknowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess\n\nwith intent to distribute, a controlled substance on board . . . a\n\nvessel of the United States or a vessel subject to the jurisdiction\n\nof the United States.\"        In 1996, Congress moved to end the\n\ndisagreement among lower courts as to whether the determination\n\nthat a vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\n\nwas committed to a jury or a judge.    Congress did so by inserting\n\na provision explicitly providing that jurisdiction under this\n\nstatute is a preliminary question for the judge and is not an\n\nelement of the crime that must be submitted to the jury.         The\n\nstatute, 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a), provides that \"[j]urisdiction of the\n\nUnited States with respect to a vessel subject to this chapter is\n\nnot an element of an offense.   Jurisdictional issues arising under\n\nthis chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined\n\nsolely by the trial judge.\"\n\n           To date one circuit has upheld the constitutionality of\n\nthis provision. United States v. Tinoco, 304 F.3d 1088, 1111 (11th\n\nCir. 2002).   One circuit has held the provision unconstitutional.\n\nUnited States v. Perlaza, 439 F.3d 1149, 1167 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\n           In this case, the Coast Guard sought permission from\n\nHonduras to board the vessel Babouth, which was flying a Honduran\n\nflag.   The prosecution submitted a certificate from the Secretary\n\nof State as verification that the United States received such\n\n\n                                -36-\n\fpermission from Honduras.11      Vilches argues that the vessel was not\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States and the government\n\nfailed to make the required showing that it was.            The argument we\n\naddress is his contention that § 70504(a) is unconstitutional\n\nbecause, by assigning the issue to a judge, the statute violates\n\nhis Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to have every element of a\n\ncriminal offense decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.              We\n\ndisagree.       This issue is not an element of the crime in the\n\nrequisite sense and may be decided by a judge.\n\n            Congress    enjoys   latitude      in   determining   what   facts\n\nconstitute elements of a crime which must be tried before a jury\n\nand proved beyond a reasonable doubt and which do not.            See, e.g.,\n\nStaples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 604 (1994) (noting that the\n\n\"definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to\n\nthe legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which\n\nare solely creatures of statute\" (quoting Liparota v. United\n\nStates,   471    U.S.   419,   424   (1985))    (internal   quotation     mark\n\nomitted)); McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 86 (1986) (\"[W]e\n\nshould hesitate to conclude that due process bars the State from\n\npursuing its chosen course in the area of defining crimes and\n\nprescribing penalties.\").\n\n\n\n11\n    Under 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(2)(B), the consent of a foreign\nnation to the enforcement of United States law by the United States\nis \"proved conclusively by certification of the Secretary of State\nor the Secretary's designee.\"\n\n                                     -37-\n\f           This discretion about allocation of functions between\n\njudge and jury is subject to some limits.           See Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000).12          Congress acted well within\n\nconstitutional boundaries in determining that the question of\n\nwhether a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates\" is not an essential element of § 70503(a)(1) for several\n\nreasons.\n\n           First, § 70504(a) is constitutional under the Supreme\n\nCourt's teaching in McMillan.      The Pennsylvania statute at issue\n\nthere provided that anyone convicted of certain felonies was\n\nsubject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment\n\nif   the   sentencing   judge   (and   not    the   jury)   found,   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that the person visibly possessed a\n\nfirearm while committing the offense.         McMillan, 477 U.S. at 81.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld this allocation of functions on the basis\n\nof several factors, see id. at 86-90, noting that it was unable \"to\n\nlay down any 'bright line' test\" but concluding that Pennsylvania's\n\nMandatory Minimum Sentencing Act \"falls on the permissible side of\n\nthe constitutional line,\" id. at 91.     The Court did point out that\n\nthe statute did not create any presumption against the defendant's\n\ninnocence, that the finding of visible possession did not increase\n\nthe penalty to which the defendant was subject but rather cabined\n\n\n12\n   Apprendi does not govern § 70504(a) because this provision does\nnot increase the statutory penalty but rather serves as a\nprerequisite for guilt.\n\n                                  -38-\n\fthe   court's      discretion     within    the   statutory    range,    and   that\n\nPennsylvania did not appear to be restructuring an existing crime\n\nin order to evade the constitutional requirement of proof beyond\n\nreasonable doubt.13        Id. at 86-90.          All of these considerations\n\napply   equally      to   Congress's       decision   that    the   \"subject    to\n\njurisdiction\" issue is not an element of § 70503(a)(1) and may be\n\ndecided by a judge: the presumption of a defendant's innocence is\n\nnot affected; the underlying determination does not subject the\n\ndefendant to an increased penalty; and there is no evidence that\n\nCongress     was    attempting      to   evade    defendants'    constitutional\n\nrights.14\n\n             Second,      in     determining      whether    legislatures      have\n\ntransgressed constitutional boundaries in defining elements of a\n\ncrime, the Supreme Court has given great weight to the historic\n\ntreatment of particular categories of facts.                This is true whether\n\nthe allocation concerns sentencing, see, e.g., Harris v. United\n\nStates,     536    U.S.   545,    560-61    (2002)    (considering      historical\n\npractice in determining that facts increasing a minimum sentence\n\n\n\n13\n   The Court also noted that it was irrelevant that other state\nlegislatures had treated visible possession as an element of\nvarious crimes. McMillan, 477 U.S. at 90.\n14\n   McMillan remains good law after the Supreme Court's holding in\nApprendi.   Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 487 n.13; see also Harris v.\nUnited States, 536 U.S. 545, 563 (2002) (\"Apprendi's conclusions do\nnot undermine McMillan's.     There was no comparable historical\npractice of submitting facts increasing the mandatory minimum to\nthe jury, so the Apprendi rule did not extend to those facts.\").\n\n                                         -39-\n\fneed not be submitted to a jury), or the elements of a statutory\n\ncrime, see, e.g., United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 515 (1995)\n\n(\"We do not doubt that historical practice is relevant to what the\n\nConstitution means by such concepts as trial by jury . . . and it\n\nis   precisely    historical       practice    that     we   have    relied    on   in\n\nconcluding that the jury must find all the elements.\").\n\n              Under historical practice the determination of whether a\n\nvessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States would\n\nnot be an essential element of the offense.                   At common law, the\n\nelements of an offense included \"each part of the actus reus,\n\ncausation,     and    the   mens   rea\"   that    the    government     needed      to\n\nestablish in order to obtain a conviction.                   Tinoco, 304 F.3d at\n\n1108 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 520 (6th ed. 1990)).                      Section\n\n70503(a)(1) criminalizes the knowing or intentional manufacture,\n\ndistribution, or possession with intent to distribute a controlled\n\nsubstance on board a vessel.          Whether a vessel was subject to the\n\njurisdiction     of   the   United    States     has    no   bearing    on    whether\n\ndefendants manufactured, distributed, or possessed with intent to\n\ndistribute a controlled substance or whether they did so knowingly\n\nor intentionally.       The question of whether a vessel is subject to\n\nthe jurisdiction of the United States thus does not relate to\n\nwhether   a    defendant     committed    the     proscribed        actus    reus   or\n\npossessed the necessary mens rea.              As such it does not meet the\n\ncommon law definition of an element.\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\f            The Supreme Court's decision in Ford v. United States,\n\n273 U.S. 593 (1927), provides strong historical support that the\n\nquestion of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States is not an element of a crime involving a vessel.                            In\n\nFord, the defendants were charged with a Prohibition-era conspiracy\n\nto transport liquor into the United States in violation of a treaty\n\nbetween the United States and Great Britain.                           Id. at 600.       The\n\nSupreme Court held that whether the vessel was seized within the\n\nzone   covered     by     the    treaty     and    therefore           subject     to    the\n\njurisdiction of the United States was not an issue a jury needed to\n\ndecide:    \"The    issue       whether    the    ship       was   seized     within      the\n\nprescribed limit did not affect the question of the defendants'\n\nguilt or innocence.            It only affected the right of the court to\n\nhold their persons for trial.\"             Id. at 606.\n\n            Third, the argument that this \"subject to jurisdiction\"\n\nquestion    is    not    an     element    of    the    §    70305(a)(1)         crime    is\n\nstrengthened by the fact that Congress did not need to include a\n\nprovision    in    the    MDLEA     that    the    vessel         be    subject    to    the\n\njurisdiction      of     the    United     States.          Under      the   \"protective\n\nprinciple\"   of    international          law,    Congress         can    punish    crimes\n\ncommitted on the high seas regardless of whether a vessel is\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.                             Under the\n\nprotective principle, \"[a] state has jurisdiction to prescribe a\n\nrule of law attaching legal consequences to conduct outside its\n\n\n                                          -41-\n\fterritory that threatens its security as a state or the operation\n\nof its governmental functions, provided the conduct is generally\n\nrecognized as a crime under the law of states that have reasonably\n\ndeveloped legal systems.\" United States v. González, 776 F.2d 931,\n\n940 n.11 (11th Cir. 1985) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Foreign\n\nRelations Law of the United States § 33(1)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see also Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations\n\nLaw § 402 & cmt. f (restating protective principle).           In United\n\nStates v. Cardales, 168 F.3d 548 (1st Cir. 1999), this court noted\n\nthat \"application of the MDLEA to the defendants is consistent with\n\nthe protective principle of international law because Congress has\n\ndetermined that all drug trafficking aboard vessels threatens our\n\nnation's security.\"     Id. at 553; accord United States v. González,\n\n311 F.3d 440, 446 (1st Cir. 2002) (Torruella, J., concurring in the\n\njudgment) (because the protective principle applies, \"the MDLEA\n\ndoes not require a jurisdictional statement to place it within\n\nCongress's regulatory power.     The jurisdictional statement of the\n\nMDLEA is therefore not an essential element of the crime, as it may\n\nbe in other statutes that lack outside authority.\").              If the\n\nstatute need not have had a \"subject to jurisdiction\" component at\n\nall, that component is not an essential element of the crime unless\n\nCongress so intends.\n\n           In fact, there is a ready explanation for the presence of\n\nthe   \"subject   to   jurisdiction\"   provision   in   the   statute,   an\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\fexplanation which reinforces the conclusion that the finding as to\n\njurisdiction is not an element of the crime. Congress inserted the\n\nrequirement that a vessel be subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States into the statute as a matter of diplomatic comity.\n\nSee Tinoco, 304 F.3d at 1108 (\"[T]he jurisdictional requirement was\n\ninserted into the statute as a diplomatic courtesy to foreign\n\nnations and as a matter of international comity . . . .\").                To put\n\nthe concept in different terms, \"It is misleading . . . to consider\n\n[a foreign nation's] consent an element of the offense; rather, it\n\nis   a   diplomatic       requisite    illustrating      the    international\n\npartnership that ensures the rule of law on the high seas.\"\n\nGonzález, 776 F.2d at 940 (emphasis omitted).\n\n           We acknowledge that one circuit has decided the question\n\ndifferently.    The Ninth Circuit held in Perlaza that § 70504(a)'s\n\nallocation     of   the    jurisdictional      issue    to     the    judge   is\n\nunconstitutional based on two primary rationales. First, the court\n\nreasoned     that   because   many    courts   had     thought,      before   the\n\ncongressional clarification in 1996, that a jury was required to\n\ndetermine the jurisdiction question, Congress could not alter that\n\narrangement.    Perlaza, 439 F.3d at 1167.       Second, Perlaza reasoned\n\nthat because the jurisdictional inquiry involves factual questions,\n\nthat meant it had to be an element of the crime.             Id.     We disagree\n\non both points.     Congress ordinarily defines crimes and can alter\n\nstatutes to clarify or overrule judicial opinions.                   See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                      -43-\n\fCleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 19-20 (2000) (describing\n\nhow Congress amended the federal mail fraud statute to expand the\n\ncoverage given to it by the Court).     A congressional decision on\n\nhow to define elements of a crime is usually dispositive.         See\n\nStaples, 511 U.S. at 604-05.     Judicial interpretations given to\n\nallocations of functions between judge and jury under one version\n\nof a statute do not determine the constitutionality of a later,\n\nrevised version in which Congress has made a different allocation.\n\nMoreover, as to the second rationale, it is well established that\n\njuries need not decide all questions with factual components.     For\n\nexample, the admissibility of evidence and the legality of searches\n\nand seizures are committed to judges.    See, e.g., Gaudin, 515 U.S.\n\nat 525-26 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).\n\n            Judge Torruella is of the view the question should be\n\navoided, citing the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.         The\n\ndoctrine of constitutional avoidance is no bar to reaching the\n\nquestion of the constitutionality of § 70504(a) in this case.      The\n\nSupreme Court has not treated constitutional avoidance as a strict\n\nrule but rather as a prudential consideration that judges should\n\ntake into account on a case-by-case basis.       Rescue Army v. Mun.\n\nCourt of Los Angeles, 331 U.S. 549, 574 (1947); see also, e.g.,\n\nZobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1993)\n\n(majority    reaches   constitutional   issue   over   the   dissent's\n\nconstitutional avoidance argument).      In particular, the Supreme\n\n\n                                -44-\n\fCourt has departed from the doctrine in the contexts of harmless\n\nerror analysis, see, e.g., Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 501-04\n\n(1987), and the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 925 (1984).             And, in the\n\nqualified immunity context, the Court has told lower courts to\n\nreach    constitutional      issues   in   order   to   provide   guidance     on\n\nconstitutional issues.         See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201\n\n(2001); County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 841 n.5 (1998)\n\n(\"[I]f   the   policy   of    avoidance    were    always   followed   .   .   .,\n\nstandards of official conduct would tend to remain uncertain, to\n\nthe detriment of both officials and individuals.\"); see also Pierre\n\nN. Leval, Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta, 81\n\nN.Y.U. L. Rev. 1249, 1277 (2006) (noting tension between the\n\nSaucier rule and the doctrine of constitutional avoidance).\n\n            The constitutionality of 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a) is a\n\nrecurring issue which this court has avoided reaching before. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Gil-Carmona, 497 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); see also González, 311 F.3d at 443 (holding that defendant\n\nwaived this argument by pleading guilty).            The avoidance doctrine,\n\nof course, is not meant to thwart the even more fundamental\n\ndoctrine governing all judges that the view of the majority is the\n\nholding of the court.         We think it is important to resolve the\n\nquestion now in order to provide clear guidance to the district\n\njudges of this circuit and to litigants on how to handle this\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\fissue.   Cf. Leon, 468 U.S. at 925 (\"If the resolution of a\n\nparticular Fourth Amendment question is necessary to guide future\n\naction . . ., nothing will prevent reviewing courts from deciding\n\nthat question before turning to the good-faith issue.\").        The\n\nquestion is clearly raised in this case.   We do not think the issue\n\nis particularly difficult and so there is no reason to avoid the\n\nquestion because it is hard or close.       Indeed, the outcome is\n\nmandated by Supreme Court precedent.\n\n          We hold that § 70504(a) is constitutional and dispose of\n\nthe plain error inquiry at the first step.     We otherwise join in\n\nJudge Torruella's opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -46-\n\f",

Vilches was apprehended for trafficking drugs in international waters by the United States Coast Guard (\"USCG\"). On appeal, he makes numerous arguments. He argues that the MDLEA is unconstitutional and that the district court lacked jurisdiction. He also challenges the district court's refusal to suppress evidence, to grant a motion to dismiss, as well as the sufficiency of the evidence upon which he was convicted. He claims that his sentence was unreasonable and that the numerous errors in the case prejudiced his right to a fair trial. After careful consideration, we affirm his conviction and the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[3]</sup></h2>\n<p>On January 31, 2005, during a routine drug patrol in the eastern Caribbean Sea, USCG Lieutenant Adam Nolen Berkley, whose boarding team was deployed on the British Royal Fleet's Auxiliary Ship, the <i>Wave Ruler,</i> received information from a maritime patrol aircraft about a vessel of interest in international waters. A cargo vessel heading north had smaller vessels coming alongside it, which raised the suspicion of the USCG. The USCG continued to monitor the vessel.</p>\n<p>The next morning, using the British ship's helicopter, the USCG identified the vessel, the <i>Babouth,</i> which was flying the Honduran flag. As the USCG approached and performed a visual inspection, it made radio contact with the crew. Berkley was suspicious of the answers to some of his questions. He noted that the vessel had rub marks along the side; furthermore, it was rocking slowly back and forth. Berkley knew this to be a sign of a very heavy load. Additionally, the <i>Babouth</i> had an unusually large number of antennae, indicative of a great deal of electronic equipment on board for a vessel of this nature. Based on these factors, Berkley believed he had reasonable suspicion to approach the vessel. As he approached the <i>Babouth,</i> he raised the USCG flag, converting the <i>Wave Ruler</i> into a law enforcement vessel. Berkley also faxed a report to the officer on duty at the USCG, Southern District, and followed up with a phone call requesting that the USCG contact the Honduran government for permission to board and search the <i>Babouth.</i> Thereafter, the Honduran government granted permission, first verbally, and later followed by an official, written communication.</p>\n<p>The <i>Babouth</i> was fifty nautical miles west of Grenada, traveling in a north, northwesterly direction towards Puerto Rico and St. Croix when the USCG intercepted it. This area is a known drug trafficking area. Petty Officer Michael Christopher Acevedo, who was familiar with the area and its history of drug trafficking, boarded the <i>Babouth</i> with the permission of both the Government of Honduras and Vilches, its captain. Acevedo remained on the vessel for the duration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> of the search and was the officer in charge.</p>\n<p>Upon inspection, Berkley noticed that the <i>Babouth</i> had too much free board. He also noticed that the vessel was rusty and looked to be in poor repair. The <i>Babouth</i> also had drums commonly used by drug traffickers, including a 500-gallon fuel container that smelled strongly of, and contained what looked like, gasoline. Vilches told the officers that it was a septic tank for the toilets. The officers inspected the tank, and observed that it did not lead to a toilet but to the back of the boat and over the side.</p>\n<p>Acevedo asked Vilches for the registration documents and manifest of the <i>Babouth.</i> Vilches turned over a briefcase with documents for the ship, and provided Acevedo with an affidavit prepared in Trinidad stating that the registration had been lost. Acevedo, however, found the vessel's registration in Vilches's briefcase; it had expired on December 14, 2004.</p>\n<p>After a safety inspection and a search for weapons, the officers looked for indicators that the vessel was being utilized for smuggling contraband. They found freshly painted areas, spilled concrete, a bag of concrete mix, and fresh welds, all of which are indicators of hidden compartments. The sweep team also found other items which raised their suspicion about the contents of the vessel and the real purpose for which it was being used. Berkley and Acevedo found communication devices at the ship's bridge, similar to those Acevedo had seen in other drug seizure cases at sea.</p>\n<p>The <i>Babouth</i> contained navigational charts without plot marks and a global positioning system (\"GPS\") that was not being used. Vilches claimed that he did not use them because he was an experienced mariner. Despite this assertion, while on board the <i>Babouth,</i> Acevedo noted that Vilches did utilize the charts and the GPS.</p>\n<p>On the third day, another inspection team came to complete a space-accountability inspection. The concrete blocks on board, which Vilches had described as extremely sturdy, fell apart as the officers tried to move them. The inspection team found that the bill of lading for the ship's cargo conflicted with the ship's invoice. Vilches could not provide a satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy even though the ship's forms carried his seal and signature. In addition, Acevedo asked Vilches why they had been traveling so slowly since a cargo vessel would want to deliver its cargo quickly. Vilches blamed the slowness of the vessel on engine problems. He claimed that there was a hydraulic leak in the jacket of the water pump. Acevedo, a qualified mechanic, inspected the engine and found no hydraulic lines used for the jacket of the water pump.</p>\n<p>By February 5, 2005, the <i>Babouth</i> was in U.S. waters, and a task force boarded the vessel and continued the search. Vilches consented to the search. For safety reasons, the vessel was taken to the USCG's station in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On February 7, 2005, while still searching the <i>Babouth</i> at the port, one of the <i>Babouth's</i> crew members, Luis Fernando Piedrahita-Calle (\"Piedrahita\"), communicated by note that he wanted to speak to the DEA.</p>\n<p>Piedrahita met with the officers and told them where drugs were hidden and how the plan to smuggle the drugs was executed. Agents reboarded the <i>Babouth</i> and went to the area identified by Piedrahita. Vilches's attitude, which had been cooperative, changed once the agents returned after receiving the note from Piedrahita. As the agents searched the back part of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> the vessel, Vilches became assertive and questioned the agents about their search. Following Piedrahita's instructions, the agents found a well-hidden hatch under the linoleum floor. Under about six to ten inches of sand, sawdust, and ammonia, the officers found a bolted manhole cover. Inside the manhole, they found several white burlap sacks which tested positive for cocaine. The agents recovered thirty-five bales of cocaine, weighing approximately 950 kilograms.<sup>[4]</sup> Earlier, a canine had detected a narcotic odor in the area later identified by Piedrahita.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Indictment and Trial</h2>\n<p>After the USCG found the drugs on the boat, Vilches was arrested and charged with possession with the intent to distribute under the § 70503 of the MDLEA and with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute under § 70506(b). On July 26, 2005, Vilches joined a co-defendant's motions to suppress the evidence and dismiss the indictment. The district court denied the motions.</p>\n<p>Mardonio Chávez-Senti (\"Chávez\"), one of Vilches's co-defendants, pled guilty and testified at trial on behalf of the Government. He provided details of the conspiracy and of the day that the <i>Babouth</i> was intercepted by the USCG.</p>\n<p>According to his testimony, Chávez, a naval mechanical engineer, met with Pedro Valleadares, Antonio Ruiz, Aldo Lara, and José Sandoval, and agreed to participate in the drug trafficking venture for $30,000. He testified that Vilches joined them in Haiti to help prepare for the drug run; the <i>Babouth</i> left Haiti for Tortola to pick up drugs.</p>\n<p>Chávez recounted that at around midnight on January 31, 2005, Vilches called him and told him that they were at the prearranged point for the drug pick-up, but the boat bringing the drugs had not arrived. About an hour later, a motorboat, which Vilches was in contact with by radio, came up to the hull of the <i>Babouth</i> and people on the boat passed the bales of drugs up to the crew. The entire crew, with the exception of Vilches, who was piloting the vessel, participated in loading the drugs. A total of thirty-five bales were loaded. The motorboat then left. Chávez testified that the crew hid the bales in an empty water tank under the floor of the <i>Babouth.</i> The crew then informed Vilches that the job was complete. Vilches continued sailing, but was soon thereafter intercepted by the USCG.</p>\n<p>Vilches was the only defense witness. He admitted being the captain of the <i>Babouth,</i> but denied any knowledge of the drugs on board. Vilches denied making any satellite phone calls and denied any knowledge of a boat coming alongside the <i>Babouth.</i> He claimed that there was no discrepancy as to the number of pallets, despite the difference in quantity on the bill of lading and invoices. Though he admitted to knowing them, Vilches denied knowing how to contact either Sandoval or Lamberti. His address book, however, had contact information for both men; their names were highlighted in yellow. Vilches was also confronted with his falsified navigation license, for which he gave no satisfactory explanation.</p>\n<p>Vilches moved for a Rule 29 dismissal under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure at the conclusion of the Government's case and again at the conclusion of his own case. The district court denied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> both motions. The jury found Vilches guilty on both counts. He did not move to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Vilches's Pre-Sentencing Report (\"PSR\") grouped the two counts and calculated a base offense level of thirty-eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1). Taking into account Vilches's role as captain of the <i>Babouth,</i> the PSR added two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(2), for a total offense level of forty. Although Vilches had a prior record, the PSR calculated zero criminal history points, resulting in a criminal history category of I, because his convictions fell outside of the time limit for inclusion. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(e)(1). The PSR calculated an advisory guideline range of 292 to 365 months. The PSR included the statutory minimum term of ten years and a maximum of life. It noted that Vilches is a Chilean citizen with no legal status in the United States and that he would face removal proceedings upon completion of his sentence. No objections were filed to the PSR.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing held on May 19, 2006, Vilches's counsel requested that the court take into account the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) sentencing factors, and argued that a sentence of 292 months, the bottom of the Guidelines range, would be adequate considering Vilches's age. Counsel argued that a higher sentence for Vilches's crime, which did not involve violence, \"could be interpreted as punishment because he exercised his right to jury trial.\" When Vilches addressed the court, he insisted he was innocent. The Government called attention to Vilches's history and characteristics under § 3553(a) and requested a sentence at the top of the guideline range, 365 months.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the PSR, the district court calculated Vilches's sentence between 292 and 365 months. Taking into account the advisory guidelines and the § 3353(a) factors, the district court sentenced Vilches to 365 months for each count, to be served concurrently. The court noted that Vilches's prior drug-related convictions were indicative of his recidivism. The court found that \"a sentence at the top of the guideline range is the appropriate and the reasonable sentence.\" The court imposed an additional sentence of concurrent five-year terms of supervised release and a mandatory special monetary assessment, and upon motion declined to reconsider the sentence.</p>\n<p>Vilches appeals and challenges the constitutionality of the MDLEA, the district court's jurisdiction, the district court's refusal to suppress evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the reasonableness of his sentence, and argues for reversal based on a totality of errors. We address these challenges in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Constitutionality of the MDLEA</h2>\n<p>Once again, we are asked to decide the constitutionality of the jurisdictional element of the MDLEA. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gil-Carmona,</i> 497 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir. 2007). The MDLEA makes it a crime for any person on board \"a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1), to \"knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a). A \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" includes a \"vessel registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United States.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> <i>Id.</i> at § 70502(c)(1)(C).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the concurrence feels compelled to resolve this issue, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance requires us to refrain from ruling on the constitutionality of this statute because the posture of this case does not <i>require</i> us to pass upon this issue.<sup>[6]</sup> I believe we should not reach the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> merits of the constitutionality of this law because Vilches has not demonstrated that the district court committed plain error. I thus disagree with the reaching of this issue by the concurring opinion by Judges Lynch and Howard and express no opinion at this time on this matter.</p>\n<p>The standard of review for a defendant's claim that his constitutional rights were violated by congressional removal of an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> element of a charged offense from the jury's consideration is ordinarily harmless error. <i>See </i><i>Neder v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 1, 15, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999). Here, however, we apply plain error because Vilches did not object to the constitutionality of the statute in the district court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 510 F.3d 57, 72 (1st Cir.2007). Under the plain error standard, Vilches must prove \"(1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights,\" <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Downs-Moses,</i> 329 F.3d 253, 263 (1st Cir.2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted), and that the error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Matos,</i> 328 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Like in <i>Gil-Carmona,</i> the district court record clearly shows that the jury was presented with evidence that the <i>Babouth</i> was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. At trial, Berkley testified that while the <i>Babouth</i> was apprehended in international waters, he requested and was granted both verbal and written permission, through the USCG, Seventh District, by the Government of Honduras to board and search the <i>Babouth</i> pursuant to the Honduran-U.S. Counter Drugs Operations bilateral agreement. <i>See</i> Certification for the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act Case Involving the Vessel <i>Babouth</i> (Honduras). The MDLEA allows for U.S. officials to conduct searches on foreign flagged vessels with permission of the foreign state. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(2)(A), (B).<sup>[7]</sup> The Government presented the district court with documentation containing the Seal of the United States Department of State which stated that the Government of Honduras had granted the United States permission to enforce U.S. law against the <i>Babouth,</i> its cargo, and the people on board. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d 332, 340 n. 9 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We acknowledge that the 1996 amendments to § 1903 provide that the Secretary of State's certification `conclusively' proves a foreign nation's consent.\").</p>\n<p>Vilches did not object to the Government's arguments regarding jurisdiction at trial. His failure to object alone suggests that the asserted error was not plain. <i>Cf. </i><i>Gil-Carmona,</i> 497 F.3d at 55. In fact, at trial, Vilches had the opportunity to question the Government's presentation with regard to jurisdiction, but he chose merely to question how long it took between the time Berkley saw the Honduran flag and when he received permission to board the vessel. \"[T]he record establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that jurisdiction over the vessel existed under [§ 70504].\" <i>Id.</i> Even if the jury had been expressly presented with the question of jurisdiction, any reasonable jury would have found Vilches guilty. It cannot be said that any error in failing to submit the question of jurisdiction to the jury \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001); <i>cf. </i><i>Gil-Carmona,</i> 497 F.3d at 55; <i>Neder,</i> 527 U.S. at 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Jury Instruction on Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>Vilches argues that the district court's jury instruction was erroneous because it \"improperly invaded the province of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> jury determinations and violated the <i>Apprendi</i> principle.\"<sup>[8]</sup> Normally, this issue would be subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bravo,</i> 489 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2007). Vilches, however, made no objection below, and we review a claim of error not properly preserved below for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 627-29, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (holding that a defendant's failure to object to <i>Apprendi</i> error at trial requires plain error review); <i>United States v. Portes,</i> 505 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The MDLEA provides that \"[j]urisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a). The district court correctly instructed the jury that the \"[j]urisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense.\" <i>Id.</i> In its jury instruction, the district court plainly said: \"I'm instructing you that as a matter of law the motor vessel <i>Babouth</i> was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" This was a correct statement of the law. <i>See </i><i>Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d at 340 n. 9 (\"United States jurisdiction over vessels is no longer an element of an offense, but rather, a preliminary question of law for the trial judge\"); <i>United States v. Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d 1088, 1106 (11th Cir.2002) (\"The statutory language of the MDLEA now unambiguously mandates that the jurisdictional requirement be treated only as a question of subject matter jurisdiction for the court to decide.\"). At the conclusion of the jury instructions the district court asked whether there were any objections to the instruction. Vilches's counsel said no. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Motions to Suppress and Dismiss</h2>\n<p>\"We apply a mixed standard of review to the district court's denial of a suppression motion, reviewing the court's findings of fact for clear error and the application of the law to those facts <i>de novo.</i>\" <i>Bravo,</i> 489 F.3d at 8 (citing <i>Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1116).</p>\n<p>Vilches argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the USCG lacked reasonable suspicion to search the <i>Babouth.</i> Vilches further argues that Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were violated because it took five days for the USCG to get the <i>Babouth</i> to port in San Juan.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Vilches further contends that he was erroneously denied a suppression hearing and that this error unconstitutionally precluded him from properly developing and supporting his motion to suppress. Vilches also argues that the district court erred in holding that he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the stop and seizure. Vilches further argues that the warrantless detention of his person for several days constituted a de facto arrest and that the scope of the detention was unreasonable. We are unconvinced by any of Vilches's arguments and take them in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> 1. Alleged Fourth Amendment Violation</h2>\n<p>As we have said before, \"the Fourth Amendment does not apply to activities of the United States against aliens in international waters.\" <i>Bravo,</i> 489 F.3d at 8; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Verdugo-Urquídez,</i> 494 U.S. 259, 267, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990) (\"There is... no indication that the Fourth Amendment was understood by contemporaries of the Framers to apply to activities of the United States directed against aliens in foreign territory or in international waters.\"). Vilches is Chilean, and he was not residing in the United States. He was in international waters when he was approached by the USCG. The district court properly dismissed Vilches's Fourth Amendment claim pertaining to the USCG's actions in international waters.</p>\n<p>The district court also properly extended the same reasoning when it dismissed Vilches's Fourth Amendment claim based on the search of the <i>Babouth</i> at the port in San Juan. In <i>Verdugo-Urquídez,</i> the Supreme Court held that the defendant did not have constitutional rights based on his presence in the United States because constitutional protections only attach to aliens who \"come within the territory of the United States and developed substantial connections with this country.\" <i>Verdugo-Urquídez,</i> 494 U.S. at 271, 110 S.Ct. 1056. Vilches can claim no such \"substantial connections.\" Like <i>Verdugo-Urquídez,</i> who was imprisoned in California and had \"no previous significant voluntary connection to the United States,\" <i>id.,</i> Vilches was brought to the United States for the sole purposes of conducting a safe search of the vessel he captained. \"[T]his sort of presence  lawful but involuntary  is not of the sort to indicate any substantial connection with our country.\" <i>Id.</i> In this case, we are unable to say that Vilches's presence at the port in San Juan was completely involuntary because he consented to the search and the USCG's docking the <i>Babouth</i> in San Juan.</p>\n<p>But even if <i>Verdugo-Urquídez</i> does not apply, Vilches lacks standing to challenge the search. It is \"well settled that a defendant who fails to demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched or the item seized will not have `standing' to claim that an illegal search or seizure occurred.\" <i>United States v. Mancini,</i> 8 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir.1993) (citing <i>Rakas v. Illinois,</i> 439 U.S. 128, 138-48, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978)). In order to make such a showing, Vilches must show that he had both a subjective expectation of privacy and that society accepts that expectation as objectively reasonable. <i>California v. Greenwood,</i> 486 U.S. 35, 39, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Scott,</i> 975 F.2d 927, 928 (1st Cir.1992). The burden of proving a reasonable expectation of privacy lies with Vilches. <i>United States v. Sánchez,</i> 943 F.2d 110, 113 (1st Cir.1991). Vilches must demonstrate an expectation of privacy in both the item seized and the place searched. <i>United States v. Salvucci,</i> 448 U.S. 83, 93, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980). Vilches cannot make that showing here.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he circumstances and exigencies of the maritime setting afford people on a vessel a lesser expectation of privacy than in their homes, obviating the usual fourth amendment requirements of a warrant.\" <i>United States v. Green,</i> 671 F.2d 46, 53 (1st Cir.1982). As the Government argues, Vilches had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the secret compartment in which the drugs were found. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Cardona-Sandoval,</i> 6 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir.1993) (distinguishing \"substantial vessels such as cargo ships and freighters\" from \"a small pleasure craft used for fishing\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> where captain had reasonable expectation of privacy).</p>\n<p>Even if Vilches had a subjective expectation of privacy, it was not an objectively reasonable expectation. The district court rightly noted that \"society would not recognize a justifiable expectation of privacy in a hidden compartment created for the express purpose of hiding illicit contraband. To hold otherwise would grant smugglers standing under the Fourth Amendment solely because they were careful in hiding their illicit merchandise.\" <i>Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 413 F.Supp.2d at 73-74; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Sarda-Villa,</i> 760 F.2d 1232, 1235 (11th Cir.1985) (\"[W]e are not willing to say that society is prepared to recognize a justifiable expectation of privacy solely on the basis of appellants' efforts to secret the contraband. Drug smugglers cannot assert standing solely on the basis that they hid the drugs well and hoped no one would find them.\"). As the Supreme Court said in <i>Kyllo v. United States,</i> 533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001), \"a Fourth Amendment search does not occur ... unless `the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,' and `society [is] willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 33, 121 S.Ct. 2038 (quoting <i>California v. Ciraolo,</i> 476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986)).</p>\n<p>The search was valid in any event because the USCG's \"authority under 14 U.S.C. § 89(a) to stop and board a vessel on the high seas is quite broad.\"<sup>[10]</sup><i>Cardona-Sandoval,</i> 6 F.3d at 23 (internal footnotes omitted). In the instant case, the USCG had consent from Honduras, the vessel's flag country, to board the <i>Babouth</i> and to take it to a U.S. port to complete the search. The USCG also possessed the requisite \"reasonable and articulable grounds for suspecting that the vessel or those on board [we]re engaging in criminal activity.\" <i>Green,</i> 671 F.2d at 53.</p>\n<p>As the USCG's monitored the <i>Babouth,</i> it observed smaller vessels coming into contact with it the night before the USCG boarded the vessel. The following day the USCG detected rub marks along the port side of the <i>Babouth</i> but not its starboard, confirming their belief in suspicious activity. On board, the USCG's found even more evidence of suspicious activity. For example, there was a discrepancy between the number of pallets that the <i>Babouth</i> was carrying and those that were slated for delivery, and the GPS and navigational charts had been erased.</p>\n<p>Each step of the USCG's search was based on \"a corresponding level of suspicion supported by specific facts.\" <i>Cardona-Sandoval,</i> 6 F.3d at 23. In <i>United States v. Berryman,</i> 717 F.2d 651 (1st Cir.1983), we said that \"although some encounters [with the Government] do not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> implicate fourth amendment concerns at all, more intrusive encounters short of arrests must be justified by reasonable suspicion proportional to the degree of the intrusion. That suspicion cannot be inchoate, but must be based on `specific and articulable facts ... together with rational inferences from those facts' in order to establish a basis for review of the police actions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 653 (internal citations omitted). The USCG had the requisite reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as the district court found, Vilches \"gave his permission to the boarding team `to access any space on the vessel.'\" <i>Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 413 F.Supp.2d at 72. Both at sea and at the port in San Juan, Vilches consented to the USCG's boarding of the <i>Babouth</i> and the search of the vessel. At no point did he object to the boarding of the vessel, the search of the vessel, or the taking of the vessel to San Juan. \"It is ... well settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the [Fourth Amendment] requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search that is conducted pursuant to consent.\" <i>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</i> 412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Meléndez,</i> 301 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.2002). Additionally, as mentioned above, Honduras, under whose flag the <i>Babouth</i> sailed, consented to the search of the boat both at sea and in U.S. territory.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the denial of the motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Motion to Suppress Hearing</h2>\n<p>\"The test for granting an evidentiary hearing in a criminal case [is] substantive: did the defendant make a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt or dispute?\" <i>United States v. Panitz,</i> 907 F.2d 1267, 1273 (1st Cir.1990). Vilches made no such showing. A hearing was not necessary to address the suppression issues because in support of his motion, Vilches merely presented the same statements by the USCG as the Government had. Vilches did not dispute the Government's version of events and instead relied upon then. This makes an evidentiary hearing unnecessary since there were no material facts that were in dispute. <i>See id.</i> at 1273-74; <i>United States v. McGill,</i> 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[E]videntiary hearings on motions are the exception, not the rule.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Vilches's Arrest</h2>\n<p>Vilches's challenge to his arrest is without merit. There was no unreasonable delay between the arrest and Vilches's initial appearance before a magistrate judge. Vilches was arrested the same day that the USCG discovered the drugs on the <i>Babouth,</i> February 7, 2005. He was taken before a magistrate judge the following day. Furthermore, the short interval between when the USCG first boarded and inspected the <i>Babouth</i> and the travel time before the <i>Babouth</i> arrived in San Juan did not result in a custodial detention. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Baker,</i> 641 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir.1981) (\"routine Coast Guard boarding of vessels does not create a custodial situation\"); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Elkins,</i> 774 F.2d 530, 535 n. 3 (1st Cir.1985) (\"It is well recognized that a routine inspection and boarding of an American flagship vessel on the high seas does not give rise to a custodial detention.\"). The one day between the time Vilches was arrested and when he was brought before the magistrate judge was reasonable, and the district court properly denied his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>We review a sufficiency of the evidence claim <i>de novo. See </i><i>United States</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> <i>v. Carucci,</i> 364 F.3d 339, 343 (1st Cir. 2004). We will affirm a conviction if, \"after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\" <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994). \"All `reasonable evidentiary inferences' are to be drawn `in harmony with the verdict,' and `all issues of credibility' are to be resolved `in the light most favorable to the government.'\" <i>United States v. Washington,</i> 434 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 126 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p>Vilches argues that no rational trier of fact could have found all of the essential elements of the crimes of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute. He claims that the Government offered \"thin isolated points of purported circumstantial evidence,\" which under scrutiny are easily explained away. A review of the evidence presented at trial indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Conspiracy</h2>\n<p>Vilches notes that a conviction for conspiracy requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of three elements: (1) the existence of an agreement to commit an unlawful act; (2) knowledge and intent to join the agreement; and (3) knowing participation in the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir.1993). He argues that the Government's evidence at trial was insufficient to establish any of the three elements. We disagree.</p>\n<p>At trial, the Government established beyond a reasonable doubt \"the existence of a conspiracy, [Vilches's] knowledge of the conspiracy, and [Vilches's] voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Gómez-Pabón,</i> 911 F.2d 847, 852 (1st Cir.1990). As we made clear above, the Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the <i>Babouth</i> was \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1). There is no question or dispute that the USCG found cocaine, undoubtedly a controlled substance, on the <i>Babouth.</i> The Government also proved at trial that Vilches \"knowingly or intentionally possessed the controlled substance with the intent to distribute it.\" <i>Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p>Chávez specifically testified to the details of the conspiracy. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d 548, 554-55 (1st Cir. 1999). Chávez testified to Vilches's involvement in the conspiracy. Specifically, once the <i>Babouth</i> departed Haiti, Vilches was in constant contact with the owner of the drugs, Félix Lamberti. While sailing, Vilches informed Chávez when they reached the predetermined meeting place for receiving the drugs. Vilches is the one who received the call from the motorboat that was carrying the drugs giving its location. Vilches ordered that the <i>Babouth</i> reduce its speed so the drugs could be loaded onto the boat. After the crew loaded the cocaine and hid it under a hatch, they informed Vilches that the drugs were safely on board. Vilches then ordered them to resume their normal speed. The Government met its burden.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Possession</h2>\n<p>With respect to the possession charge, Vilches again argues that there was insufficient evidence that he knowingly possessed the narcotics found on the <i>Babouth.</i> He maintains that the Government failed to meet its burden of proving that he had both knowledge of and access to the narcotics. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Patterson,</i> 472 F.3d 767, 779 (10th Cir.2006). The facts  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> recounted above  belie his assertions of innocence.</p>\n<p>Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence is sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict because it is clear that a reasonable factfinder could find that the Government proved the essential elements of crimes with which Vilches was accused.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Circumstantial Evidence</h2>\n<p>Vilches claims that the Government's circumstantial evidence does not withstand scrutiny and should be discounted. Contrary to Vilches's claims, the Government introduced sufficient circumstantial evidence at trial to support his conviction. \"In circumstantial cases ..., the evidence is sufficient to convict if it adequately supports 'the requisite two-step inference': (1) that the vessel was engaged in obviously illegal activity, and (2) that each Appellant was ready to assist in the criminal enterprise.\" <i>Bravo,</i> 489 F.3d at 9 (quoting <i>United States v. Jiménez-Pérez,</i> 869 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1989)); <i>Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d at 342 (\"proof of sufficient participation in the crime, as well as knowledge of it, is required to convict: the defendant's `mere presence' at the scene of the criminal activity is not enough\"). Vilches's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions attacks only the weight of the evidence; that is insufficient here. He fails to demonstrate that the circumstantial evidence the Government offered is somehow inadequate to meet the test we laid out in <i>Bravo.</i> There was substantial evidence establishing each element of the possession and conspiracy convictions. His arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p>The reason the <i>Babouth</i> came to the attention of the USCG is that they detected vessels coming alongside it under the cover of darkness. The Government presented evidence that the USCG found this suspicious because a vessel of the size of the <i>Babouth</i> would be unlikely to stop in the dark, in the middle of the ocean, for any legitimate reason to take small boats alongside it. The Government also presented evidence that the vessel had unusually excessive electronic equipment, which was inconsistent with its condition; this was consistent with other drug trafficking ventures. Moreover, the USCG intercepted the <i>Babouth</i> in an area well-known for drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>There was also evidence that on board the <i>Babouth</i> the officers found indicators of illicit activity and supplies that were consistent with the possibility of empty space behind a false wall. The USCG found fifty-gallon drums, typical of those which could be used by vessels to refuel smaller vessels transporting contraband. A large 500-gallon container, which Vilches claimed to be a septic tank, was also found by the USCG. Upon inspection, the USCG found evidence indicating that it contained gasoline and was not used as a septic tank. Additionally, the <i>Babouth</i>'s GPS and navigational charts did not display the ship's prior course. Despite Vilches's explanation that he was a seasoned mariner and did not need to use the GPS and charts, the officers witnessed Vilches use them later.</p>\n<p>The <i>Babouth</i>'s registration, which Vilches claimed he lost, was later discovered in his briefcase by agents during the search. Furthermore, Vilches's navigational license was fraudulent. The Government also introduced evidence that Vilches was hired by Sandoval, who was present at the meeting in which Chávez was hired for the drug smuggling venture. Vilches testified that as the captain, he was the one to give the orders; nothing could occur on the boat without his orders. Vilches attempted to explain away the suspicions at trial; the jury chose not to believe him. The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> weighs against Vilches. The evidence presented at trial is more than sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Sentence</h2>\n<p>We \"review challenges to sentencing process  <i>i.e.,</i> errors of law  <i>de novo.</i>\" <i>United States v. Rivera,</i> 448 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2005)). \"Reasonableness challenges  <i>i.e.,</i> challenges to errors of judgment  are reviewed with `some deference ... [a]ssuming a plausible explanation and a defensible overall result.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006)); <i>see also </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 128 S.Ct. 586, 602, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\"On abuse-of-discretion review, the Court of Appeals should have given due deference to the District Court's reasoned and reasonable decision that the § 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence.\").</p>\n<p>Vilches argues that the 365-month sentence imposed on him was a \"de facto life sentence.\" He argues that the sentence was unreasonable under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was not predicated on the factors listed in § 3553(a). The question for this court is whether the district court's conclusion is supported by \"a reasoned explanation [and] a plausible outcome.\" <i>Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Zapete-García,</i> 447 F.3d 57, 60-61 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The district court imposed a 365-month sentence after noting that the Guidelines are advisory and after considering the sentencing factors listed in § 3553(a). The district court noted Vilches's conduct, including his knowledge of the drug smuggling operation despite his assertion of ignorance. The district court also discussed his prior criminal record, including his 1981 conviction for possession with intent to distribute, and his 1983 conviction, where he received 120 months for possession of marijuana. The district court did not count Vilches's previous convictions towards his criminal history because of their dates but found them to be indicative of his recidivism. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B) (giving judges latitude to imposes sentences that \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\"). Finally, the district court considered the fact that Vilches had used a different name in the past. Given the district court's consideration of the § 3553(a) factors and its reasoned articulation for the sentence, Vilches's 365-month sentence is reasonable. The district court's reasoning was persuasive and explicit, and the result was proper. The district court's sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. Totality of the Errors</h2>\n<p>Vilches argues that under the \"cumulative error doctrine,\" \"[i]ndividual errors, insufficient in themselves to necessitate a new trial, may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect.\" <i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1195-96. Vilches asserts that in this case, the numerous errors prejudiced his rights to a fair trial and violated due process under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We find these arguments unconvincing. For the reasons elaborated above, we find that even if there were errors  a question we need not answer  they were harmless. Vilches's claim necessarily fails. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d 79, 95 n. 23 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[B]ecause we have found that none of [the defendant's] individual complaints resulted in substantial prejudice and that most are completely without merit, we reject the final contention that his conviction was tainted by cumulative error.\" (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> <i>United States v. DeMasi,</i> 40 F.3d 1306, 1322 (1st Cir.1994))) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons explained above, we affirm Vilches's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>LYNCH and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, opinion of the court in part and concurring in part.</p>\n<p>We join Judge Torruella's opinion except as to Part II(A) (\"Constitutionality of the MDLEA\"). We write separately to address the constitutionality of 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a), a question Judge Torruella's opinion bypasses.</p>\n<p>We hold that there is no constitutional infirmity in Congress's explicit allocation in § 70504(a) of the question of whether a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" to the court rather than the jury for decision. That allocation was well within the power of Congress.</p>\n<p>Vilches did not raise a challenge to the statute's constitutionality in the district court and so our review is for plain error. <i>United States v. JG-24, Inc.,</i> 478 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir.2007). To establish plain error, Vilches must demonstrate that \"(1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error affected [his] substantial rights; and (4) the error adversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Riggs,</i> 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir.2002). We resolve this claim at the first step on the grounds that there was no error at all. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Arango,</i> 508 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Vargas,</i> 471 F.3d 255, 264 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Morales-Rodriguez,</i> 467 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Under 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1), an individual \"may not knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess with intent to distribute, a controlled substance on board ... a vessel of the United States or a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" In 1996, Congress moved to end the disagreement among lower courts as to whether the determination that a vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States was committed to a jury or a judge. Congress did so by inserting a provision explicitly providing that jurisdiction under this statute is a preliminary question for the judge and is not an element of the crime that must be submitted to the jury. The statute, 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a), provides that \"[j]urisdiction of the United States with respect to a vessel subject to this chapter is not an element of an offense. Jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\"</p>\n<p>To date one circuit has upheld the constitutionality of this provision. <i>United States v. Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d 1088, 1111 (11th Cir.2002). One circuit has held the provision unconstitutional. <i>United States v. Perlaza,</i> 439 F.3d 1149, 1167 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p>In this case, the Coast Guard sought permission from Honduras to board the vessel <i>Babouth,</i> which was flying a Honduran flag. The prosecution submitted a certificate from the Secretary of State as verification that the United States received such permission from Honduras.<sup>[11]</sup> Vilches argues that the vessel was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> the government failed to make the required showing that it was. The argument we address is his contention that § 70504(a) is unconstitutional because, by assigning the issue to a judge, the statute violates his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to have every element of a criminal offense decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree. This issue is not an element of the crime in the requisite sense and may be decided by a judge.</p>\n<p>Congress enjoys latitude in determining what facts constitute elements of a crime which must be tried before a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt and which do not. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Staples v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 600, 604, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994) (noting that the \"definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute\" (quoting <i>Liparota v. United States,</i> 471 U.S. 419, 424, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985)) (internal quotation mark omitted)); <i>McMillan v. Pennsylvania,</i> 477 U.S. 79, 86, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986) (\"[W]e should hesitate to conclude that due process bars the State from pursuing its chosen course in the area of defining crimes and prescribing penalties.\").</p>\n<p>This discretion about allocation of functions between judge and jury is subject to some limits. <i>See </i><i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).<sup>[12]</sup> Congress acted well within constitutional boundaries in determining that the question of whether a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" is not an essential element of § 70503(a)(1) for several reasons.</p>\n<p>First, § 70504(a) is constitutional under the Supreme Court's teaching in <i>McMillan.</i> The Pennsylvania statute at issue there provided that anyone convicted of certain felonies was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment if the sentencing judge (and not the jury) found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person visibly possessed a firearm while committing the offense. <i>McMillan,</i> 477 U.S. at 81, 106 S.Ct. 2411. The Supreme Court upheld this allocation of functions on the basis of several factors, <i>see id.</i> at 86-90, 106 S.Ct. 2411, noting that it was unable \"to lay down any `bright line' test\" but concluding that Pennsylvania's Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act \"falls on the permissible side of the constitutional line,\" <i>id.</i> at 91, 106 S.Ct. 2411. The Court did point out that the statute did not create any presumption against the defendant's innocence, that the finding of visible possession did not increase the penalty to which the defendant was subject but rather cabined the court's discretion within the statutory range, and that Pennsylvania did not appear to be restructuring an existing crime in order to evade the constitutional requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup>[13]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 86-90, 106 S.Ct. 2411. All of these considerations apply equally to Congress's decision that the \"subject to jurisdiction\" issue is not an element of § 70503(a)(1) and may be decided by a judge: the presumption of a defendant's innocence is not affected; the underlying determination does not subject the defendant to an increased penalty; and there is no evidence that Congress was attempting to evade defendants' constitutional rights.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> Second, in determining whether legislatures have transgressed constitutional boundaries in defining elements of a crime, the Supreme Court has given great weight to the historic treatment of particular categories of facts. This is true whether the allocation concerns sentencing, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 560-61, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (considering historical practice in determining that facts increasing a minimum sentence need not be submitted to a jury), or the elements of a statutory crime, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gaudin,</i> 515 U.S. 506, 515, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995) (\"We do not doubt that historical practice is relevant to what the Constitution means by such concepts as trial by jury ... and it is precisely historical practice that we have relied on in concluding that the jury must find all the elements.\").</p>\n<p>Under historical practice the determination of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States would not be an essential element of the offense. At common law, the elements of an offense included \"each part of the actus reus, causation, and the mens rea\" that the government needed to establish in order to obtain a conviction. <i>Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1108 (citing <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 520 (6th ed.1990)). Section 70503(a)(1) criminalizes the knowing or intentional manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance on board a vessel. Whether a vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States has no bearing on whether defendants manufactured, distributed, or possessed with intent to distribute a controlled substance or whether they did so knowingly or intentionally. The question of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States thus does not relate to whether a defendant committed the proscribed actus reus or possessed the necessary mens rea. As such it does not meet the common law definition of an element.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Ford v. United States,</i> 273 U.S. 593, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793 (1927), provides strong historical support that the question of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is not an element of a crime involving a vessel. In <i>Ford,</i> the defendants were charged with a Prohibition-era conspiracy to transport liquor into the United States in violation of a treaty between the United States and Great Britain. <i>Id.</i> at 600, 47 S.Ct. 531. The Supreme Court held that whether the vessel was seized within the zone covered by the treaty and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the United States was not an issue a jury needed to decide: \"The issue whether the ship was seized within the prescribed limit did not affect the question of the defendants' guilt or innocence. It only affected the right of the court to hold their persons for trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 606, 47 S.Ct. 531.</p>\n<p>Third, the argument that this \"subject to jurisdiction\" question is not an element of the § 70305(a)(1) crime is strengthened by the fact that Congress did not need to include a provision in the MDLEA that the vessel be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Under the \"protective principle\" of international law, Congress can punish crimes committed on the high seas regardless of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> United States. Under the protective principle, \"[a] state has jurisdiction to prescribe a rule of law attaching legal consequences to conduct outside its territory that threatens its security as a state or the operation of its governmental functions, provided the conduct is generally recognized as a crime under the law of states that have reasonably developed legal systems.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> 776 F.2d 931, 940 n. 11 (11th Cir.1985) (quoting <i>Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States</i> § 33(1)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law</i> § 402 &amp; cmt. f (restating protective principle). In <i>United States v. Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d 548 (1st Cir.1999), this court noted that \"application of the MDLEA to the defendants is consistent with the protective principle of international law because Congress has determined that all drug trafficking aboard vessels threatens our nation's security.\" <i>Id.</i> at 553; <i>accord </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> 311 F.3d 440, 446 (1st Cir.2002) (Torruella, J., concurring in the judgment) (because the protective principle applies, \"the MDLEA does not require a jurisdictional statement to place it within Congress's regulatory power. The jurisdictional statement of the MDLEA is therefore not an essential element of the crime, as it may be in other statutes that lack outside authority.\"). If the statute need not have had a \"subject to jurisdiction\" component at all, that component is not an essential element of the crime unless Congress so intends.</p>\n<p>In fact, there is a ready explanation for the presence of the \"subject to jurisdiction\" provision in the statute, an explanation which reinforces the conclusion that the finding as to jurisdiction is not an element of the crime. Congress inserted the requirement that a vessel be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into the statute as a matter of diplomatic comity. <i>See </i><i>Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1108 (\"[T]he jurisdictional requirement was inserted into the statute as a diplomatic courtesy to foreign nations and as a matter of international comity....\"). To put the concept in different terms, \"It is misleading ... to consider [a foreign nation's] consent an element of the offense; rather, it is a diplomatic requisite illustrating the international partnership that ensures the rule of law on the high seas.\" <i>Gonzalez,</i> 776 F.2d at 940 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that one circuit has decided the question differently. The Ninth Circuit held in <i>Perlaza</i> that § 70504(a)'s allocation of the jurisdictional issue to the judge is unconstitutional based on two primary rationales. First, the court reasoned that because many courts had thought, before the congressional clarification in 1996, that a jury was required to determine the jurisdiction question, Congress could not alter that arrangement. <i>Perlaza,</i> 439 F.3d at 1167. Second, <i>Perlaza</i> reasoned that because the jurisdictional inquiry involves factual questions, that meant it had to be an element of the crime. <i>Id.</i> We disagree on both points. Congress ordinarily defines crimes and can alter statutes to clarify or overrule judicial opinions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cleveland v. United States,</i> 531 U.S. 12, 19-20, 121 S.Ct. 365, 148 L.Ed.2d 221 (2000) (describing how Congress amended the federal mail fraud statute to expand the coverage given to it by the Court). A congressional decision on how to define elements of a crime is usually dispositive. <i>See </i><i>Staples,</i> 511 U.S. at 604-05, 114 S.Ct. 1793. Judicial interpretations given to allocations of functions between judge and jury under one version of a statute do not determine the constitutionality of a later, revised version in which Congress has made a different allocation. Moreover, as to the second rationale, it is well established that juries need not decide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> all questions with factual components. For example, the admissibility of evidence and the legality of searches and seizures are committed to judges. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gaudin,</i> 515 U.S. at 525-26, 115 S.Ct. 2310 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Judge Torruella is of the view the question should be avoided, citing the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is no bar to reaching the question of the constitutionality of § 70504(a) in this case. The Supreme Court has not treated constitutional avoidance as a strict rule but rather as a prudential consideration that judges should take into account on a case-by-case basis. <i>Rescue Army v. Mun. Court of Los Angeles,</i> 331 U.S. 549, 574, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 91 L.Ed. 1666 (1947); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist.,</i> 509 U.S. 1, 7-8, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993) (majority reaches constitutional issue over the dissent's constitutional avoidance argument). In particular, the Supreme Court has departed from the doctrine in the contexts of harmless error analysis, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Pope v. Illinois,</i> 481 U.S. 497, 501-04, 107 S.Ct. 1918, 95 L.Ed.2d 439 (1987), and the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 925, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). And, in the qualified immunity context, the Court has told lower courts to reach constitutional issues in order to provide guidance on constitutional issues. <i>See </i><i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); <i>County of Sacramento v. Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. 833, 841 n. 5, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (\"[I]f the policy of avoidance were always followed ..., standards of official conduct would tend to remain uncertain, to the detriment of both officials and individuals.\"); <i>see also</i> Pierre N. Leval, <i>Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta,</i> 81 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1249, 1277 (2006) (noting tension between the <i>Saucier</i> rule and the doctrine of constitutional avoidance).</p>\n<p>The constitutionality of 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a) is a recurring issue which this court has avoided reaching before. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gil-Carmona,</i> 497 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see also </i><i>Gonzalez,</i> 311 F.3d at 443 (holding that defendant waived this argument by pleading guilty). The avoidance doctrine, of course, is not meant to thwart the even more fundamental doctrine governing all judges that the view of the majority is the holding of the court. We think it is important to resolve the question now in order to provide clear guidance to the district judges of this circuit and to litigants on how to handle this issue. <i>Cf. </i><i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 925, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (\"If the resolution of a particular Fourth Amendment question is necessary to guide future action ..., nothing will prevent reviewing courts from deciding that question before turning to the good-faith issue.\"). The question is clearly raised in this case. We do not think the issue is particularly difficult and so there is no reason to avoid the question because it is hard or close. Indeed, the outcome is mandated by Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>We hold that § 70504(a) is constitutional and dispose of the plain error inquiry at the first step. We otherwise join in Judge Torruella's opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Judges Lynch and Howard write the opinion of the court as to the issue considered in Part II(A). <i>See infra</i> at 19.</p>\n<p>[2]  At the time of Vilches's conviction, the MDLEA was at 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a).

All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\").

After careful consideration, we affirm his conviction and the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[3]</sup></h2>\n<p>On January 31, 2005, during a routine drug patrol in the eastern Caribbean Sea, USCG Lieutenant Adam Nolen Berkley, whose boarding team was deployed on the British Royal Fleet's Auxiliary Ship, the <i>Wave Ruler,</i> received information from a maritime patrol aircraft about a vessel of interest in international waters. A cargo vessel heading north had smaller vessels coming alongside it, which raised the suspicion of the USCG. The USCG continued to monitor the vessel.</p>\n<p>The next morning, using the British ship's helicopter, the USCG identified the vessel, the <i>Babouth,</i> which was flying the Honduran flag. As the USCG approached and performed a visual inspection, it made radio contact with the crew. Berkley was suspicious of the answers to some of his questions. He noted that the vessel had rub marks along the side; furthermore, it was rocking slowly back and forth. Berkley knew this to be a sign of a very heavy load. Additionally, the <i>Babouth</i> had an unusually large number of antennae, indicative of a great deal of electronic equipment on board for a vessel of this nature. Based on these factors, Berkley believed he had reasonable suspicion to approach the vessel. As he approached the <i>Babouth,</i> he raised the USCG flag, converting the <i>Wave Ruler</i> into a law enforcement vessel. Berkley also faxed a report to the officer on duty at the USCG, Southern District, and followed up with a phone call requesting that the USCG contact the Honduran government for permission to board and search the <i>Babouth.</i> Thereafter, the Honduran government granted permission, first verbally, and later followed by an official, written communication.</p>\n<p>The <i>Babouth</i> was fifty nautical miles west of Grenada, traveling in a north, northwesterly direction towards Puerto Rico and St. Croix when the USCG intercepted it. This area is a known drug trafficking area. Petty Officer Michael Christopher Acevedo, who was familiar with the area and its history of drug trafficking, boarded the <i>Babouth</i> with the permission of both the Government of Honduras and Vilches, its captain. Acevedo remained on the vessel for the duration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> of the search and was the officer in charge.</p>\n<p>Upon inspection, Berkley noticed that the <i>Babouth</i> had too much free board. He also noticed that the vessel was rusty and looked to be in poor repair. The <i>Babouth</i> also had drums commonly used by drug traffickers, including a 500-gallon fuel container that smelled strongly of, and contained what looked like, gasoline. Vilches told the officers that it was a septic tank for the toilets. The officers inspected the tank, and observed that it did not lead to a toilet but to the back of the boat and over the side.</p>\n<p>Acevedo asked Vilches for the registration documents and manifest of the <i>Babouth.</i> Vilches turned over a briefcase with documents for the ship, and provided Acevedo with an affidavit prepared in Trinidad stating that the registration had been lost. Acevedo, however, found the vessel's registration in Vilches's briefcase; it had expired on December 14, 2004.</p>\n<p>After a safety inspection and a search for weapons, the officers looked for indicators that the vessel was being utilized for smuggling contraband. They found freshly painted areas, spilled concrete, a bag of concrete mix, and fresh welds, all of which are indicators of hidden compartments. The sweep team also found other items which raised their suspicion about the contents of the vessel and the real purpose for which it was being used. Berkley and Acevedo found communication devices at the ship's bridge, similar to those Acevedo had seen in other drug seizure cases at sea.</p>\n<p>The <i>Babouth</i> contained navigational charts without plot marks and a global positioning system (\"GPS\") that was not being used. Vilches claimed that he did not use them because he was an experienced mariner. Despite this assertion, while on board the <i>Babouth,</i> Acevedo noted that Vilches did utilize the charts and the GPS.</p>\n<p>On the third day, another inspection team came to complete a space-accountability inspection. The concrete blocks on board, which Vilches had described as extremely sturdy, fell apart as the officers tried to move them. The inspection team found that the bill of lading for the ship's cargo conflicted with the ship's invoice. Vilches could not provide a satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy even though the ship's forms carried his seal and signature. In addition, Acevedo asked Vilches why they had been traveling so slowly since a cargo vessel would want to deliver its cargo quickly. Vilches blamed the slowness of the vessel on engine problems. He claimed that there was a hydraulic leak in the jacket of the water pump. Acevedo, a qualified mechanic, inspected the engine and found no hydraulic lines used for the jacket of the water pump.</p>\n<p>By February 5, 2005, the <i>Babouth</i> was in U.S. waters, and a task force boarded the vessel and continued the search. Vilches consented to the search. For safety reasons, the vessel was taken to the USCG's station in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On February 7, 2005, while still searching the <i>Babouth</i> at the port, one of the <i>Babouth's</i> crew members, Luis Fernando Piedrahita-Calle (\"Piedrahita\"), communicated by note that he wanted to speak to the DEA.</p>\n<p>Piedrahita met with the officers and told them where drugs were hidden and how the plan to smuggle the drugs was executed. Agents reboarded the <i>Babouth</i> and went to the area identified by Piedrahita. Vilches's attitude, which had been cooperative, changed once the agents returned after receiving the note from Piedrahita. As the agents searched the back part of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> the vessel, Vilches became assertive and questioned the agents about their search. Following Piedrahita's instructions, the agents found a well-hidden hatch under the linoleum floor. Under about six to ten inches of sand, sawdust, and ammonia, the officers found a bolted manhole cover. Inside the manhole, they found several white burlap sacks which tested positive for cocaine. The agents recovered thirty-five bales of cocaine, weighing approximately 950 kilograms.<sup>[4]</sup> Earlier, a canine had detected a narcotic odor in the area later identified by Piedrahita.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Indictment and Trial</h2>\n<p>After the USCG found the drugs on the boat, Vilches was arrested and charged with possession with the intent to distribute under the § 70503 of the MDLEA and with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute under § 70506(b). On July 26, 2005, Vilches joined a co-defendant's motions to suppress the evidence and dismiss the indictment. The district court denied the motions.</p>\n<p>Mardonio Chávez-Senti (\"Chávez\"), one of Vilches's co-defendants, pled guilty and testified at trial on behalf of the Government. He provided details of the conspiracy and of the day that the <i>Babouth</i> was intercepted by the USCG.</p>\n<p>According to his testimony, Chávez, a naval mechanical engineer, met with Pedro Valleadares, Antonio Ruiz, Aldo Lara, and José Sandoval, and agreed to participate in the drug trafficking venture for $30,000. He testified that Vilches joined them in Haiti to help prepare for the drug run; the <i>Babouth</i> left Haiti for Tortola to pick up drugs.</p>\n<p>Chávez recounted that at around midnight on January 31, 2005, Vilches called him and told him that they were at the prearranged point for the drug pick-up, but the boat bringing the drugs had not arrived. About an hour later, a motorboat, which Vilches was in contact with by radio, came up to the hull of the <i>Babouth</i> and people on the boat passed the bales of drugs up to the crew. The entire crew, with the exception of Vilches, who was piloting the vessel, participated in loading the drugs. A total of thirty-five bales were loaded. The motorboat then left. Chávez testified that the crew hid the bales in an empty water tank under the floor of the <i>Babouth.</i> The crew then informed Vilches that the job was complete. Vilches continued sailing, but was soon thereafter intercepted by the USCG.</p>\n<p>Vilches was the only defense witness. He admitted being the captain of the <i>Babouth,</i> but denied any knowledge of the drugs on board. Vilches denied making any satellite phone calls and denied any knowledge of a boat coming alongside the <i>Babouth.</i> He claimed that there was no discrepancy as to the number of pallets, despite the difference in quantity on the bill of lading and invoices. Though he admitted to knowing them, Vilches denied knowing how to contact either Sandoval or Lamberti. His address book, however, had contact information for both men; their names were highlighted in yellow. Vilches was also confronted with his falsified navigation license, for which he gave no satisfactory explanation.</p>\n<p>Vilches moved for a Rule 29 dismissal under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure at the conclusion of the Government's case and again at the conclusion of his own case. The district court denied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> both motions. The jury found Vilches guilty on both counts. He did not move to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Vilches's Pre-Sentencing Report (\"PSR\") grouped the two counts and calculated a base offense level of thirty-eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1). Taking into account Vilches's role as captain of the <i>Babouth,</i> the PSR added two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(2), for a total offense level of forty. Although Vilches had a prior record, the PSR calculated zero criminal history points, resulting in a criminal history category of I, because his convictions fell outside of the time limit for inclusion. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(e)(1). The PSR calculated an advisory guideline range of 292 to 365 months. The PSR included the statutory minimum term of ten years and a maximum of life. It noted that Vilches is a Chilean citizen with no legal status in the United States and that he would face removal proceedings upon completion of his sentence. No objections were filed to the PSR.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing held on May 19, 2006, Vilches's counsel requested that the court take into account the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) sentencing factors, and argued that a sentence of 292 months, the bottom of the Guidelines range, would be adequate considering Vilches's age. Counsel argued that a higher sentence for Vilches's crime, which did not involve violence, \"could be interpreted as punishment because he exercised his right to jury trial.\" When Vilches addressed the court, he insisted he was innocent. The Government called attention to Vilches's history and characteristics under § 3553(a) and requested a sentence at the top of the guideline range, 365 months.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the PSR, the district court calculated Vilches's sentence between 292 and 365 months. Taking into account the advisory guidelines and the § 3353(a) factors, the district court sentenced Vilches to 365 months for each count, to be served concurrently. The court noted that Vilches's prior drug-related convictions were indicative of his recidivism. The court found that \"a sentence at the top of the guideline range is the appropriate and the reasonable sentence.\" The court imposed an additional sentence of concurrent five-year terms of supervised release and a mandatory special monetary assessment, and upon motion declined to reconsider the sentence.</p>\n<p>Vilches appeals and challenges the constitutionality of the MDLEA, the district court's jurisdiction, the district court's refusal to suppress evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the reasonableness of his sentence, and argues for reversal based on a totality of errors. We address these challenges in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Constitutionality of the MDLEA</h2>\n<p>Once again, we are asked to decide the constitutionality of the jurisdictional element of the MDLEA. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gil-Carmona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202859\"><a href=\"/opinion/202859/united-states-v-gil-carmona/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir. 2007). The MDLEA makes it a crime for any person on board \"a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1), to \"knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance,\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a). A \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" includes a \"vessel registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United States.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> <i>Id.</i> at § 70502(c)(1)(C).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the concurrence feels compelled to resolve this issue, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance requires us to refrain from ruling on the constitutionality of this statute because the posture of this case does not <i>require</i> us to pass upon this issue.<sup>[6]</sup> I believe we should not reach the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> merits of the constitutionality of this law because Vilches has not demonstrated that the district court committed plain error. I thus disagree with the reaching of this issue by the concurring opinion by Judges Lynch and Howard and express no opinion at this time on this matter.</p>\n<p>The standard of review for a defendant's claim that his constitutional rights were violated by congressional removal of an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> element of a charged offense from the jury's consideration is ordinarily harmless error. <i>See </i><i>Neder v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span> (1999). Here, however, we apply plain error because Vilches did not object to the constitutionality of the statute in the district court. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Under the plain error standard, Vilches must prove \"(1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights,\" <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200598\"><a href=\"/opinion/200598/united-states-v-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v.

At trial, Berkley testified that while the <i>Babouth</i> was apprehended in international waters, he requested and was granted both verbal and written permission, through the USCG, Seventh District, by the Government of Honduras to board and search the <i>Babouth</i> pursuant to the Honduran-U.S. Counter Drugs Operations bilateral agreement. <i>See</i> Certification for the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act Case Involving the Vessel <i>Babouth</i> (Honduras). The MDLEA allows for U.S. officials to conduct searches on foreign flagged vessels with permission of the foreign state. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70502(c)(2)(A), (B).<sup>[7]</sup> The Government presented the district court with documentation containing the Seal of the United States Department of State which stated that the Government of Honduras had granted the United States permission to enforce U.S. law against the <i>Babouth,</i> its cargo, and the people on board. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Guerrero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197385\"><a href=\"/opinion/197385/united-states-v-amado-guerrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 340 n. 9 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We acknowledge that the 1996 amendments to § 1903 provide that the Secretary of State's certification `conclusively' proves a foreign nation's consent.\").</p>\n<p>Vilches did not object to the Government's arguments regarding jurisdiction at trial. His failure to object alone suggests that the asserted error was not plain. <i>Cf. </i><i>Gil-Carmona,</i> 497 F.3d at 55. In fact, at trial, Vilches had the opportunity to question the Government's presentation with regard to jurisdiction, but he chose merely to question how long it took between the time Berkley saw the Honduran flag and when he received permission to board the vessel. \"[T]he record establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that jurisdiction over the vessel existed under [§ 70504].\" <i>Id.</i> Even if the jury had been expressly presented with the question of jurisdiction, any reasonable jury would have found Vilches guilty. It cannot be said that any error in failing to submit the question of jurisdiction to the jury \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001); <i>cf. </i><i>Gil-Carmona,</i> 497 F.3d at 55; <i>Neder,</i> 527 U.S. at 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1827</span></a></span>. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Jury Instruction on Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>Vilches argues that the district court's jury instruction was erroneous because it \"improperly invaded the province of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> jury determinations and violated the <i>Apprendi</i> principle.\"<sup>[8]</sup> Normally, this issue would be subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bravo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797988\"><a href=\"/opinion/797988/united-states-v-alfre-luis-bravo-and-jesus-antonio-martinez-rosado-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2007). Vilches, however, made no objection below, and we review a claim of error not properly preserved below for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cotton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 627-29, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court correctly instructed the jury that the \"[j]urisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense.\" <i>Id.</i> In its jury instruction, the district court plainly said: \"I'm instructing you that as a matter of law the motor vessel <i>Babouth</i> was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" This was a correct statement of the law. <i>See </i><i>Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d at 340 n. 9 (\"United States jurisdiction over vessels is no longer an element of an offense, but rather, a preliminary question of law for the trial judge\"); <i>United States v. Tinoco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75998\"><a href=\"/opinion/75998/united-states-v-pedro-luis-christopher-tinoco/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span>, 1106 (11th Cir.2002) (\"The statutory language of the MDLEA now unambiguously mandates that the jurisdictional requirement be treated only as a question of subject matter jurisdiction for the court to decide.\"). At the conclusion of the jury instructions the district court asked whether there were any objections to the instruction. Vilches's counsel said no. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Motions to Suppress and Dismiss</h2>\n<p>\"We apply a mixed standard of review to the district court's denial of a suppression motion, reviewing the court's findings of fact for clear error and the application of the law to those facts <i>de novo.</i>\" <i>Bravo,</i> 489 F.3d at 8 (citing <i>Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1116).</p>\n<p>Vilches argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the USCG lacked reasonable suspicion to search the <i>Babouth.</i> Vilches further argues that Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were violated because it took five days for the USCG to get the <i>Babouth</i> to port in San Juan.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Vilches further contends that he was erroneously denied a suppression hearing and that this error unconstitutionally precluded him from properly developing and supporting his motion to suppress. Vilches also argues that the district court erred in holding that he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the stop and seizure. Vilches further argues that the warrantless detention of his person for several days constituted a de facto arrest and that the scope of the detention was unreasonable. We are unconvinced by any of Vilches's arguments and take them in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> 1. Alleged Fourth Amendment Violation</h2>\n<p>As we have said before, \"the Fourth Amendment does not apply to activities of the United States against aliens in international waters.\" <i>Bravo,</i> 489 F.3d at 8; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Verdugo-Urquídez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112382\"><a href=\"/opinion/112382/united-states-v-verdugo-urquidez/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 267, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112382\"><a href=\"/opinion/112382/united-states-v-verdugo-urquidez/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Vilches is Chilean, and he was not residing in the United States. He was in international waters when he was approached by the USCG. The district court properly dismissed Vilches's Fourth Amendment claim pertaining to the USCG's actions in international waters.</p>\n<p>The district court also properly extended the same reasoning when it dismissed Vilches's Fourth Amendment claim based on the search of the <i>Babouth</i> at the port in San Juan. In <i>Verdugo-Urquídez,</i> the Supreme Court held that the defendant did not have constitutional rights based on his presence in the United States because constitutional protections only attach to aliens who \"come within the territory of the United States and developed substantial connections with this country.\" <i>Verdugo-Urquídez,</i> 494 U.S. at 271, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112382\"><a href=\"/opinion/112382/united-states-v-verdugo-urquidez/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></a></span>. Vilches can claim no such \"substantial connections.\" Like <i>Verdugo-Urquídez,</i> who was imprisoned in California and had \"no previous significant voluntary connection to the United States,\" <i>id.,</i> Vilches was brought to the United States for the sole purposes of conducting a safe search of the vessel he captained. \"[T]his sort of presence  lawful but involuntary  is not of the sort to indicate any substantial connection with our country.\" <i>Id.</i> In this case, we are unable to say that Vilches's presence at the port in San Juan was completely involuntary because he consented to the search and the USCG's docking the <i>Babouth</i> in San Juan.</p>\n<p>But even if <i>Verdugo-Urquídez</i> does not apply, Vilches lacks standing to challenge the search. It is \"well settled that a defendant who fails to demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched or the item seized will not have `standing' to claim that an illegal search or seizure occurred.\" <i>United States v. Mancini,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195007\"><a href=\"/opinion/195007/united-states-v-mancini/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir.1993) (citing <i>Rakas v.

Vilches cannot make that showing here.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he circumstances and exigencies of the maritime setting afford people on a vessel a lesser expectation of privacy than in their homes, obviating the usual fourth amendment requirements of a warrant.\" <i>United States v.

The district court rightly noted that \"society would not recognize a justifiable expectation of privacy in a hidden compartment created for the express purpose of hiding illicit contraband. To hold otherwise would grant smugglers standing under the Fourth Amendment solely because they were careful in hiding their illicit merchandise.\" <i>Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 413 F.Supp.2d at 73-74; <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

In the instant case, the USCG had consent from Honduras, the vessel's flag country, to board the <i>Babouth</i> and to take it to a U.S. port to complete the search. The USCG also possessed the requisite \"reasonable and articulable grounds for suspecting that the vessel or those on board [we]re engaging in criminal activity.\" <i>Green,</i> 671 F.2d at 53.</p>\n<p>As the USCG's monitored the <i>Babouth,</i> it observed smaller vessels coming into contact with it the night before the USCG boarded the vessel.

On board, the USCG's found even more evidence of suspicious activity. For example, there was a discrepancy between the number of pallets that the <i>Babouth</i> was carrying and those that were slated for delivery, and the GPS and navigational charts had been erased.</p>\n<p>Each step of the USCG's search was based on \"a corresponding level of suspicion supported by specific facts.\" <i>Cardona-Sandoval,</i> 6 F.3d at 23.

Berryman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424871\"><a href=\"/opinion/424871/united-states-v-fred-s-berryman/\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1983), we said that \"although some encounters [with the Government] do not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> implicate fourth amendment concerns at all, more intrusive encounters short of arrests must be justified by reasonable suspicion proportional to the degree of the intrusion. That suspicion cannot be inchoate, but must be based on `specific and articulable facts ... together with rational inferences from those facts' in order to establish a basis for review of the police actions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 653 (internal citations omitted). The USCG had the requisite reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as the district court found, Vilches \"gave his permission to the boarding team `to access any space on the vessel.'\" <i>Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 413 F.Supp.2d at 72. Both at sea and at the port in San Juan, Vilches consented to the USCG's boarding of the <i>Babouth</i> and the search of the vessel. At no point did he object to the boarding of the vessel, the search of the vessel, or the taking of the vessel to San Juan. \"It is ... well settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the [Fourth Amendment] requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search that is conducted pursuant to consent.\" <i>Schneckloth v.

Additionally, as mentioned above, Honduras, under whose flag the <i>Babouth</i> sailed, consented to the search of the boat both at sea and in U.S. territory.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the denial of the motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Motion to Suppress Hearing</h2>\n<p>\"The test for granting an evidentiary hearing in a criminal case [is] substantive: did the defendant make a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt or dispute?\" <i>United States v.

Vilches made no such showing. A hearing was not necessary to address the suppression issues because in support of his motion, Vilches merely presented the same statements by the USCG as the Government had. Vilches did not dispute the Government's version of events and instead relied upon then. This makes an evidentiary hearing unnecessary since there were no material facts that were in dispute. <i>See id.</i> at 1273-74; <i>United States v. McGill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[E]videntiary hearings on motions are the exception, not the rule.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Vilches's Arrest</h2>\n<p>Vilches's challenge to his arrest is without merit. There was no unreasonable delay between the arrest and Vilches's initial appearance before a magistrate judge. Vilches was arrested the same day that the USCG discovered the drugs on the <i>Babouth,</i> February 7, 2005. He was taken before a magistrate judge the following day. Furthermore, the short interval between when the USCG first boarded and inspected the <i>Babouth</i> and the travel time before the <i>Babouth</i> arrived in San Juan did not result in a custodial detention. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Baker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387398\"><a href=\"/opinion/387398/united-states-v-martin-james-baker-ray-murrell-honea-stuart-p-mclean/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>, 1319 (9th Cir.1981) (\"routine Coast Guard boarding of vessels does not create a custodial situation\"); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v.

The one day between the time Vilches was arrested and when he was brought before the magistrate judge was reasonable, and the district court properly denied his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>We review a sufficiency of the evidence claim <i>de novo. See </i><i>United States</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> <i>v. Carucci,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785772\"><a href=\"/opinion/785772/united-states-v-michael-l-carucci-united-states-v-michael-l-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, 343 (1st Cir. 2004). We will affirm a conviction if, \"after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\" <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661452\"><a href=\"/opinion/661452/43-socsecrepser-489-medicaremedicaid-guide-p-42092-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 706 (1st Cir.1994). \"All `reasonable evidentiary inferences' are to be drawn `in harmony with the verdict,' and `all issues of credibility' are to be resolved `in the light most favorable to the government.'\" <i>United States v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202001\"><a href=\"/opinion/202001/united-states-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200815\"><a href=\"/opinion/200815/united-states-v-casas/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 126 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p>Vilches argues that no rational trier of fact could have found all of the essential elements of the crimes of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute. He claims that the Government offered \"thin isolated points of purported circumstantial evidence,\" which under scrutiny are easily explained away. A review of the evidence presented at trial indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Conspiracy</h2>\n<p>Vilches notes that a conviction for conspiracy requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of three elements: (1) the existence of an agreement to commit an unlawful act; (2) knowledge and intent to join the agreement; and (3) knowing participation in the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Sepúlveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1173 (1st Cir.1993). He argues that the Government's evidence at trial was insufficient to establish any of the three elements. We disagree.</p>\n<p>At trial, the Government established beyond a reasonable doubt \"the existence of a conspiracy, [Vilches's] knowledge of the conspiracy, and [Vilches's] voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Gómez-Pabón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546890\"><a href=\"/opinion/546890/united-states-v-luis-e-gomez-pabon-united-states-v-wilfredo/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 852 (1st Cir.1990). As we made clear above, the Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the <i>Babouth</i> was \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. § 70503(a)(1). There is no question or dispute that the USCG found cocaine, undoubtedly a controlled substance, on the <i>Babouth.</i> The Government also proved at trial that Vilches \"knowingly or intentionally possessed the controlled substance with the intent to distribute it.\" <i>Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p>Chávez specifically testified to the details of the conspiracy. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cardales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198339\"><a href=\"/opinion/198339/united-states-v-julio-cardales/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 554-55 (1st Cir. 1999). Chávez testified to Vilches's involvement in the conspiracy. Specifically, once the <i>Babouth</i> departed Haiti, Vilches was in constant contact with the owner of the drugs, Félix Lamberti. While sailing, Vilches informed Chávez when they reached the predetermined meeting place for receiving the drugs. Vilches is the one who received the call from the motorboat that was carrying the drugs giving its location. Vilches ordered that the <i>Babouth</i> reduce its speed so the drugs could be loaded onto the boat. After the crew loaded the cocaine and hid it under a hatch, they informed Vilches that the drugs were safely on board. Vilches then ordered them to resume their normal speed. The Government met its burden.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Possession</h2>\n<p>With respect to the possession charge, Vilches again argues that there was insufficient evidence that he knowingly possessed the narcotics found on the <i>Babouth.</i> He maintains that the Government failed to meet its burden of proving that he had both knowledge of and access to the narcotics. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Patterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796377\"><a href=\"/opinion/796377/united-states-v-cleo-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></a></span>, 779 (10th Cir.2006). The facts  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> recounted above  belie his assertions of innocence.</p>\n<p>Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence is sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict because it is clear that a reasonable factfinder could find that the Government proved the essential elements of crimes with which Vilches was accused.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Circumstantial Evidence</h2>\n<p>Vilches claims that the Government's circumstantial evidence does not withstand scrutiny and should be discounted. Contrary to Vilches's claims, the Government introduced sufficient circumstantial evidence at trial to support his conviction. \"In circumstantial cases ..., the evidence is sufficient to convict if it adequately supports 'the requisite two-step inference': (1) that the vessel was engaged in obviously illegal activity, and (2) that each Appellant was ready to assist in the criminal enterprise.\" <i>Bravo,</i> 489 F.3d at 9 (quoting <i>United States v. Jiménez-Pérez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519199\"><a href=\"/opinion/519199/united-states-v-joaquin-jimenez-perez-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1989)); <i>Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d at 342 (\"proof of sufficient participation in the crime, as well as knowledge of it, is required to convict: the defendant's `mere presence' at the scene of the criminal activity is not enough\"). Vilches's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions attacks only the weight of the evidence; that is insufficient here. He fails to demonstrate that the circumstantial evidence the Government offered is somehow inadequate to meet the test we laid out in <i>Bravo.</i> There was substantial evidence establishing each element of the possession and conspiracy convictions. His arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p>The reason the <i>Babouth</i> came to the attention of the USCG is that they detected vessels coming alongside it under the cover of darkness. The Government presented evidence that the USCG found this suspicious because a vessel of the size of the <i>Babouth</i> would be unlikely to stop in the dark, in the middle of the ocean, for any legitimate reason to take small boats alongside it. The Government also presented evidence that the vessel had unusually excessive electronic equipment, which was inconsistent with its condition; this was consistent with other drug trafficking ventures. Moreover, the USCG intercepted the <i>Babouth</i> in an area well-known for drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>There was also evidence that on board the <i>Babouth</i> the officers found indicators of illicit activity and supplies that were consistent with the possibility of empty space behind a false wall. The USCG found fifty-gallon drums, typical of those which could be used by vessels to refuel smaller vessels transporting contraband. A large 500-gallon container, which Vilches claimed to be a septic tank, was also found by the USCG. Upon inspection, the USCG found evidence indicating that it contained gasoline and was not used as a septic tank. Additionally, the <i>Babouth</i>'s GPS and navigational charts did not display the ship's prior course. Despite Vilches's explanation that he was a seasoned mariner and did not need to use the GPS and charts, the officers witnessed Vilches use them later.</p>\n<p>The <i>Babouth</i>'s registration, which Vilches claimed he lost, was later discovered in his briefcase by agents during the search. Furthermore, Vilches's navigational license was fraudulent. The Government also introduced evidence that Vilches was hired by Sandoval, who was present at the meeting in which Chávez was hired for the drug smuggling venture. Vilches testified that as the captain, he was the one to give the orders; nothing could occur on the boat without his orders. Vilches attempted to explain away the suspicions at trial; the jury chose not to believe him. The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> weighs against Vilches. The evidence presented at trial is more than sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), because it was not predicated on the factors listed in § 3553(a). The question for this court is whether the district court's conclusion is supported by \"a reasoned explanation [and] a plausible outcome.\" <i>Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519; <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

The district court noted Vilches's conduct, including his knowledge of the drug smuggling operation despite his assertion of ignorance. The district court also discussed his prior criminal record, including his 1981 conviction for possession with intent to distribute, and his 1983 conviction, where he received 120 months for possession of marijuana. The district court did not count Vilches's previous convictions towards his criminal history because of their dates but found them to be indicative of his recidivism. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B) (giving judges latitude to imposes sentences that \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\"). Finally, the district court considered the fact that Vilches had used a different name in the past. Given the district court's consideration of the § 3553(a) factors and its reasoned articulation for the sentence, Vilches's 365-month sentence is reasonable. The district court's reasoning was persuasive and explicit, and the result was proper. The district court's sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. Totality of the Errors</h2>\n<p>Vilches argues that under the \"cumulative error doctrine,\" \"[i]ndividual errors, insufficient in themselves to necessitate a new trial, may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect.\" <i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1195-96. Vilches asserts that in this case, the numerous errors prejudiced his rights to a fair trial and violated due process under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We find these arguments unconvincing. For the reasons elaborated above, we find that even if there were errors  a question we need not answer  they were harmless. Vilches's claim necessarily fails. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201500\"><a href=\"/opinion/201500/united-states-v-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 95 n. 23 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[B]ecause we have found that none of [the defendant's] individual complaints resulted in substantial prejudice and that most are completely without merit, we reject the final contention that his conviction was tainted by cumulative error.\" (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> <i>United States v.

We write separately to address the constitutionality of 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a), a question Judge Torruella's opinion bypasses.</p>\n<p>We hold that there is no constitutional infirmity in Congress's explicit allocation in § 70504(a) of the question of whether a vessel is \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" to the court rather than the jury for decision. That allocation was well within the power of Congress.</p>\n<p>Vilches did not raise a challenge to the statute's constitutionality in the district court and so our review is for plain error. <i>United States v. JG-24, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796945\"><a href=\"/opinion/796945/no-04-2577/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2007). To establish plain error, Vilches must demonstrate that \"(1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error affected [his] substantial rights; and (4) the error adversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v.

We resolve this claim at the first step on the grounds that there was no error at all. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Arango,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203021\"><a href=\"/opinion/203021/united-states-v-arango/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v.

Congress did so by inserting a provision explicitly providing that jurisdiction under this statute is a preliminary question for the judge and is not an element of the crime that must be submitted to the jury. The statute, 46 U.S.C. § 70504(a), provides that \"[j]urisdiction of the United States with respect to a vessel subject to this chapter is not an element of an offense. Jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\"</p>\n<p>To date one circuit has upheld the constitutionality of this provision. <i>United States v. Tinoco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75998\"><a href=\"/opinion/75998/united-states-v-pedro-luis-christopher-tinoco/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span>, 1111 (11th Cir.2002).

The prosecution submitted a certificate from the Secretary of State as verification that the United States received such permission from Honduras.<sup>[11]</sup> Vilches argues that the vessel was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> the government failed to make the required showing that it was. The argument we address is his contention that § 70504(a) is unconstitutional because, by assigning the issue to a judge, the statute violates his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to have every element of a criminal offense decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2411</span></a></span>. The Supreme Court upheld this allocation of functions on the basis of several factors, <i>see id.</i> at 86-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2411</span></a></span>, noting that it was unable \"to lay down any `bright line' test\" but concluding that Pennsylvania's Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act \"falls on the permissible side of the constitutional line,\" <i>id.</i> at 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2411</span></a></span>. The Court did point out that the statute did not create any presumption against the defendant's innocence, that the finding of visible possession did not increase the penalty to which the defendant was subject but rather cabined the court's discretion within the statutory range, and that Pennsylvania did not appear to be restructuring an existing crime in order to evade the constitutional requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup>[13]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 86-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2411</span></a></span>. All of these considerations apply equally to Congress's decision that the \"subject to jurisdiction\" issue is not an element of § 70503(a)(1) and may be decided by a judge: the presumption of a defendant's innocence is not affected; the underlying determination does not subject the defendant to an increased penalty; and there is no evidence that Congress was attempting to evade defendants' constitutional rights.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> Second, in determining whether legislatures have transgressed constitutional boundaries in defining elements of a crime, the Supreme Court has given great weight to the historic treatment of particular categories of facts. This is true whether the allocation concerns sentencing, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 560-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span> (2002) (considering historical practice in determining that facts increasing a minimum sentence need not be submitted to a jury), or the elements of a statutory crime, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gaudin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 515, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span> (1995) (\"We do not doubt that historical practice is relevant to what the Constitution means by such concepts as trial by jury ... and it is precisely historical practice that we have relied on in concluding that the jury must find all the elements.\").</p>\n<p>Under historical practice the determination of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States would not be an essential element of the offense. At common law, the elements of an offense included \"each part of the actus reus, causation, and the mens rea\" that the government needed to establish in order to obtain a conviction. <i>Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1108 (citing <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 520 (6th ed.1990)). Section 70503(a)(1) criminalizes the knowing or intentional manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance on board a vessel. Whether a vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States has no bearing on whether defendants manufactured, distributed, or possessed with intent to distribute a controlled substance or whether they did so knowingly or intentionally. The question of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States thus does not relate to whether a defendant committed the proscribed actus reus or possessed the necessary mens rea. As such it does not meet the common law definition of an element.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Ford v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620766\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620766/ford-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></span> (1927), provides strong historical support that the question of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is not an element of a crime involving a vessel. In <i>Ford,</i> the defendants were charged with a Prohibition-era conspiracy to transport liquor into the United States in violation of a treaty between the United States and Great Britain. <i>Id.</i> at 600, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span>. The Supreme Court held that whether the vessel was seized within the zone covered by the treaty and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the United States was not an issue a jury needed to decide: \"The issue whether the ship was seized within the prescribed limit did not affect the question of the defendants' guilt or innocence. It only affected the right of the court to hold their persons for trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 606, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span>.</p>\n<p>Third, the argument that this \"subject to jurisdiction\" question is not an element of the § 70305(a)(1) crime is strengthened by the fact that Congress did not need to include a provision in the MDLEA that the vessel be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Under the \"protective principle\" of international law, Congress can punish crimes committed on the high seas regardless of whether a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> United States. Under the protective principle, \"[a] state has jurisdiction to prescribe a rule of law attaching legal consequences to conduct outside its territory that threatens its security as a state or the operation of its governmental functions, provided the conduct is generally recognized as a crime under the law of states that have reasonably developed legal systems.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460404\"><a href=\"/opinion/460404/united-states-v-angel-rey-gonzalez-antonio-barrios-laureno-antonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 940 n. 11 (11th Cir.1985) (quoting <i>Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States</i> § 33(1)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law</i> § 402 &amp; cmt. f (restating protective principle). In <i>United States v. Cardales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198339\"><a href=\"/opinion/198339/united-states-v-julio-cardales/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1999), this court noted that \"application of the MDLEA to the defendants is consistent with the protective principle of international law because Congress has determined that all drug trafficking aboard vessels threatens our nation's security.\" <i>Id.</i> at 553; <i>accord </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200216\"><a href=\"/opinion/200216/united-states-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 446 (1st Cir.2002) (Torruella, J., concurring in the judgment) (because the protective principle applies, \"the MDLEA does not require a jurisdictional statement to place it within Congress's regulatory power. The jurisdictional statement of the MDLEA is therefore not an essential element of the crime, as it may be in other statutes that lack outside authority.\"). If the statute need not have had a \"subject to jurisdiction\" component at all, that component is not an essential element of the crime unless Congress so intends.</p>\n<p>In fact, there is a ready explanation for the presence of the \"subject to jurisdiction\" provision in the statute, an explanation which reinforces the conclusion that the finding as to jurisdiction is not an element of the crime. Congress inserted the requirement that a vessel be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into the statute as a matter of diplomatic comity. <i>See </i><i>Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1108 (\"[T]he jurisdictional requirement was inserted into the statute as a diplomatic courtesy to foreign nations and as a matter of international comity....\"). To put the concept in different terms, \"It is misleading ... to consider [a foreign nation's] consent an element of the offense; rather, it is a diplomatic requisite illustrating the international partnership that ensures the rule of law on the high seas.\" <i>Gonzalez,</i> 776 F.2d at 940 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that one circuit has decided the question differently. The Ninth Circuit held in <i>Perlaza</i> that § 70504(a)'s allocation of the jurisdictional issue to the judge is unconstitutional based on two primary rationales. First, the court reasoned that because many courts had thought, before the congressional clarification in 1996, that a jury was required to determine the jurisdiction question, Congress could not alter that arrangement. <i>Perlaza,</i> 439 F.3d at 1167. Second, <i>Perlaza</i> reasoned that because the jurisdictional inquiry involves factual questions, that meant it had to be an element of the crime. <i>Id.</i> We disagree on both points. Congress ordinarily defines crimes and can alter statutes to clarify or overrule judicial opinions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cleveland v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118390\"><a href=\"/opinion/118390/cleveland-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 19-20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118390\"><a href=\"/opinion/118390/cleveland-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span> (2000) (describing how Congress amended the federal mail fraud statute to expand the coverage given to it by the Court). A congressional decision on how to define elements of a crime is usually dispositive. <i>See </i><i>Staples,</i> 511 U.S. at 604-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087954\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087954/staples-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1793</span></a></span>. Judicial interpretations given to allocations of functions between judge and jury under one version of a statute do not determine the constitutionality of a later, revised version in which Congress has made a different allocation. Moreover, as to the second rationale, it is well established that juries need not decide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> all questions with factual components. For example, the admissibility of evidence and the legality of searches and seizures are committed to judges. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gaudin,</i> 515 U.S. at 525-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2310</span></a></span> (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Judge Torruella is of the view the question should be avoided, citing the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is no bar to reaching the question of the constitutionality of § 70504(a) in this case. The Supreme Court has not treated constitutional avoidance as a strict rule but rather as a prudential consideration that judges should take into account on a case-by-case basis. <i>Rescue Army v.

No. 104-324, § 1138(a)(5), 110 Stat. 3901, and deemed jurisdiction over vessels a preliminary question of law. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. § 70504 (\"Jurisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\"). Since the amendment, judges have taken on the task of determining of whether a \"vessel [is] subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> at § 70503(a)(1); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

As early as 1885, the Supreme Court said that the Court, \"[i]n the exercise of [deciding the constitutionality of laws], ... is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered: one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other, never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\" <i>Liverpool, N.Y. &amp; Phila.
