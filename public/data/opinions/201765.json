Defendants Edgardo Arlequín-Vélez and Karen\n\nMattei-Bechonaga,        respectively       the    Mayor     and   Human    Resources\n\nManager of the Municipality of Guayanilla, bring this appeal to\n\nchallenge the denial of their motion for summary judgment on\n\ngrounds of qualified immunity.              Defendants, who stand accused of\n\nparticipating in the unlawful termination of a number of former\n\nmunicipal employees following the 2000 elections in Puerto Rico,\n\nargue that the district court erroneously looked only to the\n\ncomplaint, and not the summary judgment record, when it denied\n\ntheir motion.      Defendants further assert that a proper review of\n\nthe summary judgment record would reveal that, as a matter of law,\n\nthey   were    entitled       to    qualified     immunity    because      there   were\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the employment actions\n\nthat they ordered, and because a reasonable official would have\n\nunderstood himself or herself to be entitled to take the actions\n\nundertaken.\n\n              It is true that, in its opinion denying defendants'\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court referenced only to\n\nthe allegations in the pleadings, and not the proof in the summary\n\njudgment      record,    as    is    required     when   a   defendant     asserts   a\n\nqualified immunity defense on the basis of the summary judgment\n\nrecord   and    argues    that      the   record    fails    to    substantiate    the\n\nexistence of a viable constitutional claim.                   See e.g., Riverdale\n\nMills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2004).                    But it\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fis simply not the case that the court failed to conduct the\n\nthreshold constitutional analysis against the backdrop of summary\n\njudgment principles.      For the court, in a separate opinion issued\n\nthe same day as the qualified immunity opinion, performed the\n\ncalculus that defendants say should have been conducted within the\n\nqualified immunity opinion.        In this \"merits\" opinion, the court\n\nruled that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether\n\nplaintiffs have made out a viable constitutional claim.            While the\n\ncourt,   in   its   qualified    immunity    opinion,   might   have   cross-\n\nreferenced its record-based merits analysis (or, better yet, issued\n\na   single    opinion   addressing   first    whether   plaintiffs'    First\n\nAmendment claim was sufficiently supported to warrant a trial and\n\nthen whether defendants nonetheless were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity from that claim, see Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200-02\n\n(2001)), there can be no doubt that the court reviewed the summary\n\njudgment record and concluded that there is a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact whether defendants' actions violated plaintiffs'\n\nFirst Amendment rights.         To pretend otherwise, as the individual\n\ndefendants ask us to do, would be empty formalism.              We therefore\n\nreject the primary appellate argument -- that the district court\n\nfailed to decide whether plaintiffs' constitutional claim was\n\nadequately supported by the summary judgment record -- as built\n\nupon a faulty premise.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f              Defendants devote the remainder of their brief to an\n\nimplicit challenge to the district court's merits ruling, arguing\n\nthat budgetary and public policy considerations entitled them to\n\nact as they did.       Plaintiffs respond that the court's ruling was\n\ncorrect, that there was sufficient evidence that defendants were\n\nmotivated     by   political    animus,   and    that   defendants'    argument\n\nassumes as a given a crucial fact in dispute:                   namely, that\n\ndefendants were in fact motivated by the budgetary and public\n\npolicy considerations that they say motivated them.               Defendants\n\ncounter mostly by challenging the adequacy of plaintiffs' evidence.\n\nBut they also suggest that, under relevant law, any political\n\nanimus they harbored is immaterial.\n\n              The dispute over the correctness of the district court's\n\nconclusions that plaintiffs had established a trialworthy issue as\n\nto defendants' motivations is one that we are powerless to resolve\n\nat this time.        Our jurisdiction extends only to interlocutory\n\nchallenges to denials of qualified immunity that are premised on\n\nalleged misapplications of governing law, and not to claims that\n\nthe   court    misapplied      the   summary    judgment   framework    to   the\n\nevidence.       See, e.g., Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 309-20\n\n(1995); Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 204 F.3d 1, 10-14 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). To the extent that defendants have suggested that they were\n\nentitled to act as they did notwithstanding any political animus\n\nthey harbored, they do not develop the following argument, which\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fwould be cognizable on interlocutory appeal:                   that they lawfully\n\ncould    take   action       against   plaintiffs     even     if,   as    the    court\n\nconcluded, there are trialworthy issues whether they were motivated\n\nby political animus and/or non-discriminatory considerations. See,\n\ne.g., Hadfield v. McDonough, 407 F.3d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(employee may be terminated for political affiliation if position\n\nis policymaking or confidential).               Rather, their argument is that,\n\nbecause there existed legitimate and reasonable bases for the\n\nchallenged      conduct      --   i.e.,   the    budgetary     and   public      policy\n\nconsiderations that defendants say animated them -- plaintiffs\n\ncannot    establish      a    constitutional       violation    even      with   their\n\nevidence of animus.          See Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 593\n\n(1998) (discussing the affirmative defense in Mt. Healthy City Bd.\n\nof Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)).              But the court did not\n\nagree with defendants' premise:            that the summary judgment record\n\ncompels a finding that defendants were in fact constrained by the\n\nbudgetary and public policy considerations they cite.                     And we lack\n\njurisdiction to review this fact-based rejection of the lynchpin of\n\ndefendants' position.\n\n            Affirmed in part; dismissed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f",

Our jurisdiction extends only to interlocutory\n\nchallenges to denials of qualified immunity that are premised on\n\nalleged misapplications of governing law, and not to claims that\n\nthe   court    misapplied      the   summary    judgment   framework    to   the\n\nevidence.       See, e.g., Johnson v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309-20\n\n(1995); Acevedo-Garcia v.

To the extent that defendants have suggested that they were\n\nentitled to act as they did notwithstanding any political animus\n\nthey harbored, they do not develop the following argument, which\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fwould be cognizable on interlocutory appeal:                   that they lawfully\n\ncould    take   action       against   plaintiffs     even     if,   as    the    court\n\nconcluded, there are trialworthy issues whether they were motivated\n\nby political animus and/or non-discriminatory considerations. See,\n\ne.g., Hadfield v. McDonough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201577\"><a href=\"/opinion/201577/hadfield-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(employee may be terminated for political affiliation if position\n\nis policymaking or confidential).               Rather, their argument is that,\n\nbecause there existed legitimate and reasonable bases for the\n\nchallenged      conduct      --   i.e.,   the    budgetary     and   public      policy\n\nconsiderations that defendants say animated them -- plaintiffs\n\ncannot    establish      a    constitutional       violation    even      with   their\n\nevidence of animus.          See Crawford-El v. Britton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118203\"><a href=\"/opinion/118203/crawford-el-v-britton/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593\n\n(1998) (discussing the affirmative defense in Mt.

But the court did not\n\nagree with defendants' premise:            that the summary judgment record\n\ncompels a finding that defendants were in fact constrained by the\n\nbudgetary and public policy considerations they cite.
