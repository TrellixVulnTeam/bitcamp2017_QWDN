Brian Bailey was one of seven\n\njailers charged with federal offenses arising from five incidents\n\nat the Nashua Street Jail in Boston, Massachusetts, where guards\n\nemployed excessive force against pretrial detainees and then acted\n\nto   conceal    their      misconduct.          The   grand     jury's    superseding\n\nindictment charged all seven defendants with conspiracy to deprive\n\npretrial detainees of their civil rights in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 241 (the “global conspiracy” charge).                  Bailey was also charged\n\nwith assaulting and aiding and abetting the assault of a pretrial\n\ndetainee,    see      18   U.S.C.   §    242;     conspiring      to    obstruct    and\n\nobstructing a federal criminal investigation, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1512(b)(3) (the witness tampering statute); and perjury (for lying\n\nto a federal grand jury), see 18 U.S.C. § 1623.\n\n            Three of the defendants pleaded guilty to the global\n\nconspiracy charge and to their individual substantive charges, and\n\nthe trial of the fourth defendant was severed.                         Bailey and the\n\nother two remaining defendants were tried together.                      Bailey's two\n\nco-defendants were acquitted on all counts.                   Bailey was acquitted\n\nof the global conspiracy charge, but was convicted of the other\n\ncharges and sentenced to 41 months in prison.                   He now appeals his\n\nconvictions and sentence.\n\n                                          I.\n\n             The     following    facts    are    either      uncontested,    or,    if\n\ncontested,     are    presented     in    the    light   most    favorable    to    the\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fverdicts.    See United States v. McCann, 366 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n            Boston's Nashua Street Jail, operated by the Suffolk\n\nCounty   Sheriff's    Department,    houses      pretrial    detainees.     On\n\nSeptember 24, 1999, Officer Bailey and Officer Michael Ross were\n\nassigned to work in the jail's psychiatric unit.             On that day, the\n\npsychiatric unit housed a pretrial detainee who was on suicide\n\nwatch.   In accordance with jail policy, the detainee was stripped\n\nof his clothes and denied sheets and blankets to prevent their use\n\nin a suicide attempt.       His only covering was a paper “johnny.”\n\n            During   the    course   of    the   afternoon,    the   detainee\n\ncomplained repeatedly that his cell was cold and that he needed a\n\nblanket.     When    Ross   denied   his   request,    the    detainee    began\n\nscreaming, swearing, and punching and kicking his cell door.                He\n\npersisted in this behavior for approximately three hours. At about\n\n4 p.m., Bailey told Ross that “he had [had] enough” of the detainee\n\nand that he was going to “bang him out.”            Ross replied that they\n\nshould wait until later that evening.\n\n            Bailey left the unit for dinner at about 5:30 p.m. While\n\nat dinner, he saw Officer Paul Davis, a member of the Sheriff's\n\nEmergency Response Team.      The Team is summoned to jail emergencies\n\nby way of an electronic alarm that all officers carry.                   Bailey\n\ninformed Davis that he was having a problem with an inmate and that\n\nDavis might hear his alarm go off later that night.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f            When Bailey returned from dinner, he and Ross discussed\n\nentering the detainee's cell to “slap him around.”          Since Ross and\n\nBailey were not ordinarily authorized to enter a detainee's cell\n\nwithout permission from a superior, they fabricated a story to\n\njustify their actions.      They initially agreed to report that the\n\ndetainee had made a mess in his cell, that they had entered the\n\ncell to clean it, and that they were attacked upon entry.\n\n            At   6:30   p.m.,   Officer   Brian   Murphy   arrived   at   the\n\npsychiatric unit to relieve Ross so that the latter could go to\n\ndinner.    Ross notified Murphy of the plan to enter the detainee's\n\ncell.     Murphy replied that he wanted no part of it and that they\n\nhad “better write a good report.”         Undeterred, Ross and Bailey put\n\non gloves and entered the detainee's cell.           Ross approached the\n\ndetainee and yelled at him to be quiet.        When the detainee refused,\n\nRoss slapped his face several times and then delivered multiple\n\n“knee strikes,” driving his knee into the victim's thigh.            Bailey\n\njoined the attack by punching the detainee several times in the\n\nribs and shoulder.      As he was being struck, the detainee cried and\n\ncomplained of back pain.        The detainee was then pushed down onto\n\nhis bed, and Bailey and Ross attempted to handcuff him.               At no\n\npoint during the altercation did the detainee assault the officers\n\nor make any threatening gestures.         He did not fight back other than\n\nto resist the handcuffing.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            Bailey's alarm was activated at some point during the\n\nmelee.     The Emergency Response Team, including Davis and Deputy\n\nAnthony Nuzzo, arrived shortly thereafter.            They placed handcuffs\n\non the detainee and strapped him in a restraint chair.                  While\n\nsecured in the chair, the detainee cried and complained of back\n\npain.     Bailey informed Ross later that night that he had slapped\n\nthe detainee while he was restrained in the chair.                Bailey also\n\nbragged to Davis that he and Ross had “beat the fuck out of” the\n\ndetainee.\n\n            Shortly after the incident, Bailey consulted with Nuzzo,\n\nwho told him that the story about entering the detainee's cell to\n\nclean up a mess was not adequate cover for the beating.                 Nuzzo\n\nadvised    Bailey   to   report   that    he   and   Ross   had   entered   the\n\ndetainee's cell because of an apparent medical emergency, only to\n\nbe attacked upon their entrance.         After further discussion, Bailey\n\nand Ross decided to go with this revised “medical emergency”\n\nfabrication in their incident reports.           They stood by this story\n\nwhen subsequently questioned by Sheriff's Department investigators\n\nwho were conducting an internal inquiry.             Relying in part on what\n\nthey were told by Bailey and Ross, the investigators filed a report\n\nconcluding that the officers had acted appropriately. This report,\n\ncontaining the false statements, was subsequently obtained by the\n\nFBI in connection with an investigation of a separate incident of\n\nexcessive force at the Nashua Street Jail.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            In October 2000, Bailey was summoned to testify before a\n\nfederal grand jury about the September 24, 1999 incident.                             He\n\ntestified that he had entered the detainee's cell because he\n\nthought the detainee was having a seizure, that the detainee jumped\n\nup and attacked him, and that no one struck the detainee during the\n\nincident.        At    trial,     however,      Bailey      admitted      that   he   had\n\nintentionally lied to the grand jury in an effort to protect\n\nhimself and Ross.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            A.          Obstruction of Justice\n\n            As set forth above, Bailey was convicted of violating and\n\nconspiring to violate the federal witness tampering statute by\n\nknowingly engaging in misleading conduct with the intent to prevent\n\nthe communication of information concerning the commission of a\n\nfederal crime to a federal law enforcement officer.                       See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1512(b)(3).         Bailey argues that the prosecution failed to prove\n\nthe intent element of this crime, and that the jury was improperly\n\ninstructed on this point.               Underlying Bailey's argument is the\n\npremise, rejected by the district court, that the intent required\n\nby   the   statute      cannot     be   found    when    there      was    no    federal\n\ninvestigation     extant     or    imminent      at   the    time   of     the   alleged\n\nmisleading conduct.1\n\n\n      1\n      In making this argument, Bailey also suggests that his\nconduct did not fall within the statute's sweep because his\nmisstatements were made to Sheriff's Department investigators who,\n\n                                          -6-\n\f          Bailey's interpretation of § 1512(b)(3) is not consistent\n\nwith its plain language, which reads:\n\n          Whoever    knowingly    uses     intimidation,\n          threatens, or corruptly persuades another\n          person, or attempts to do so, or engages in\n          misleading conduct toward another person, with\n          intent to . . . hinder, delay, or prevent the\n          communication to a law enforcement officer or\n          judge of the United States of information\n          relating to the commission or possible\n          commission of a Federal offense . . . shall be\n          fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n          than ten years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3).   Nothing in this provision implies that a\n\nfederal investigation must be imminent or underway at the time of\n\nthe actus reus.   To the contrary, and as several circuits have\n\nrecognized, the statutory language suggests that Congress intended\n\n§ 1512(b)(3) not merely to safeguard the integrity of ongoing or\n\nimminent federal investigations, but more broadly to facilitate\n\nfederal law enforcement's ability to gather information about\n\n\n\nhe argues, were not federal “law enforcement officer[s]” for the\npurposes of the statute.       This argument misunderstands the\ngovernment's case theory. The government did not allege that the\nSheriff's   Department  investigators   were   the  federal   \"law\nenforcement officers” to whom the statute refers; the government\nalleged that the investigators were the witnesses who ultimately\nrelayed Bailey's misinformation to federal law enforcement\nofficers. See United States v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 680 (1st\nCir. 2000) (holding that the requirements of the statute are\nsatisfied so long as the possibility exists that the defendant's\nmisinformation will eventually be communicated to federal\nofficials).    That these witnesses were themselves county law\nenforcement personnel does not change the analysis. See United\nStates v. Veal, 153 F.3d 1233, 1245 (11th Cir. 1998) (holding that\nstate police investigators “become witnesses as a matter of course\nin each investigation in which they are involved”).\n\n                               -7-\n\fpossible federal crimes -- including federal crimes that are not\n\nyet under investigation at the time of the offense.             See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Guadalupe, 402 F.3d 409, 411 (3d Cir. 2005)\n\n(“[P]roving a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3) does not depend\n\non the existence or imminency of a federal investigation but rather\n\non the possible existence of a federal crime and a defendant's\n\nintention to thwart an inquiry into that crime by officials who\n\nhappen to be federal.”); United States v. Perry, 335 F.3d 316, 321\n\n(4th Cir. 2003) (finding a violation of § 1512(b)(3) where the\n\ndefendant provided false information to local police intending to\n\nprevent the initiation of a federal investigation into his status\n\nas a felon in possession of a firearm), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct.\n\n1408 (2004); United States v. Veal, 153 F.3d 1233, 1250 (11th Cir.\n\n1998) (“By its wording, § 1512(b)(3) does not depend on the\n\nexistence or imminency of a federal case or investigation but\n\nrather   on   the   possible   existence   of   a   federal   crime   and   a\n\ndefendant's intention to thwart an inquiry into that crime.”).2\n\n\n     2\n      Bailey argues that three extra-circuit cases interpreting §\n1512(a)(1)(C) -- United States v. Emery, 186 F.3d 921 (8th Cir.\n1999); United States v. Causey, 185 F.3d 407 (5th Cir. 1999); and\nUnited States v. Bell, 113 F.3d 1345 (3d Cir. 1997) -- have\nimplicitly recognized that a federal investigation must be at least\nimminent, if not underway, to support a conviction under the\nwitness tampering statute. But none of these cases implies such a\nrule.    They merely require the government to prove that the\ndefendant was at least partially motivated by a desire to prevent\ncommunication between a witness and a law enforcement officer\nconcerning the commission or possible commission of a federal\noffense, and that the officer was in fact a federal officer. See\nEmery, 186 F.3d at 925; Causey, 185 F.3d at 421-23; Bell, 113 F.3d\n\n                                   -8-\n\fAccordingly, we reject Bailey's argument that § 1512(b)(3) requires\n\nan existing or imminent federal investigation at the time of the\n\ndefendant's misleading conduct.\n\n            In reaching this conclusion, we acknowledge Bailey's\n\nargument that 18 U.S.C. § 1512(f)(1) supports reading a pending-or-\n\nimminent-federal-investigation       requirement    into   §   1512(b)(3).\n\nSection     1512(f)(1)   provides   that,   for    purposes    of   certain\n\nprovisions of the obstruction of justice statute, “an official\n\nproceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the\n\ntime of the offense.”        Bailey would have us draw a negative\n\ninference from Congress's explicit statement that an \"official\n\nproceeding” need not be underway or imminent -- i.e., that Congress\n\ncontemplated that a federal investigation, contrary to an official\n\nproceeding, must be pending or about to be instituted at the time\n\nof the offense.\n\n            Such a negative inference is not warranted.             For one\n\nthing, § 1512(f)(1) does not apply to § 1512(b)(3) because §\n\n1512(b)(3) does not require that the proscribed conduct occur in\n\nthe context of an \"official proceeding.”           See Veal, 153 F.3d at\n\n1250.     And even if § 1512(f)(1) did apply, its application would\n\n\n\nat 1348-49; see also United States v. Stansfield, 171 F.3d 806,\n816-18 (3d Cir. 1999). Nothing logically precludes these statutory\nelements from being satisfied where, as here, the misleading\nconduct reasonably could be found to have been intended to prevent\nthe commencement of what would prove to be a federal investigation\ninto a federal offense.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fsupport our ruling because the federal grand jury investigation to\n\nwhich       Bailey's       misstatements       eventually       led    (which,    per    §\n\n1512(f)(1), need not have been underway or imminent at the time of\n\nthe   offense)           constitutes    an   “official     proceeding”        within    the\n\nmeaning of § 1512(f)(1).               See 18 U.S.C. § 1515(a)(1)(A) (defining\n\nan official proceeding for purposes of § 1512(f)(1) as, among other\n\nthings, a proceeding before a federal grand jury); United States v.\n\nFrankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 651 (1st Cir. 1996) (“Both a federal\n\ntrial       and    a     federal   grand     jury   investigation       are    'official\n\nproceedings' within the meaning of the statute.”).\n\n                  Before concluding, we also acknowledge Bailey's argument\n\nthat a failure to read a pending-or-imminent-federal-investigation\n\nrequirement into § 1512(b)(3) raises due process and ex post facto\n\nconcerns because it leaves open the possibility of a prosecution\n\nfor conduct that no defendant could have understood to constitute\n\na federal offense at the time of its commission.                      We do not see how\n\nthis is so.              Section 1512(b)(3) requires that the misleading\n\nconduct affect the communication of information \"relating to the\n\ncommission          or     possible    commission     of    a     federal      offense.”\n\nTherefore, the statute applies only to obstructive behavior that\n\nthe defendant knows could impede an investigation into conduct that\n\ncould constitute a federal crime at the time of its commission.3\n\n\n        3\n      Of course the statute does not require that the defendant\nspecifically know that the underlying conduct could constitute a\nfederal offense. See Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 681.\n\n                                             -10-\n\fHere there can be no claim that it would be unconstitutional to\n\napply the statute to Bailey, whom the jury reasonably found was\n\naware of the conduct giving rise to the eventual federal civil\n\nrights charges at the time he misled the Sheriff's Department\n\ninvestigators.\n\n             B.       Aiding and Abetting\n\n             The prosecution presented two theories for conviction on\n\nthe substantive civil rights charge:              that Bailey was a principal,\n\nor, alternatively, that he aided and abetted Ross in the assault.\n\nBailey argues that the jury instruction on aiding and abetting was\n\nerroneous.        Because the verdict form does not specify the theory\n\nunder which the jury found Bailey guilty, and because Bailey's\n\nclaim   is   one    of   legal     error   rather    than   sufficiency   of   the\n\nevidence, the availability of an alternate theory of conviction\n\nwould not save the jury's verdict.              See Griffin v. United States,\n\n502 U.S. 46, 59 (1991) (“Jurors are not generally equipped to\n\ndetermine whether a particular theory of conviction submitted to\n\nthem is contrary to law.”); United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580,\n\n589 (1st Cir. 1996) (general verdict that may have been grounded on\n\nlegally erroneous theory requires setting aside verdict on all\n\ngrounds).     We thus assume arguendo that the guilty verdict was\n\ngrounded on the challenged aiding-and-abetting theory.\n\n             Bailey      raises    two   issues     regarding   the   aiding-and-\n\nabetting instructions.            Primarily, he contends that the jury was\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fwrongly instructed to find him guilty if it found that he failed to\n\nact when he had a legal obligation to do so, because, he says, an\n\naffirmative act must be proved.   Alternatively, he argues that it\n\nwas not appropriate to give a failure-to-act instruction in this\n\ncase because the prosecution presented no evidence or argument that\n\nBailey had a legal obligation to act.     Because Bailey failed to\n\nobject to the instructions with the requisite specificity, see Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 30(d), our review is only for plain error, see Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 52(b); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-36\n\n(1993).   A defendant alleging plain error must show that an error\n\noccurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the\n\ndefendant's substantial rights, but also seriously impacted the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 732-36.\n\n          Bailey has fallen well short of meeting the demanding\n\nplain-error test.    The district court provided the jury with a\n\nseven-paragraph   aiding-and-abetting   instruction.   Within   this\n\ncomprehensive instruction, the court stated:\n\n          In order to aid and abet another to commit a\n          crime,   a  defendant   must    willfully  and\n          knowingly have associated himself in some way\n          with the crime, and willfully and knowingly\n          have sought by some act to help make the crime\n          succeed. Participation in a crime is willful\n          if   action    is   taken    voluntarily   and\n          intentionally, or, in the case of a failure to\n          act, with the specific intent to fail to do\n          something the law requires to be done.\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f(emphasis added). Bailey argues that the instruction misstates the\n\nlaw to the extent that it countenances criminal liability for a\n\nfailure to act.     He cites a number of cases for the proposition\n\nthat an aider and abettor must have “affirmatively participated” in\n\nthe crime.    See, e.g., United States v. Martin, 228 F.3d 1, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); United States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 385 (1st\n\nCir. 1979).\n\n             But the government did not allege that Bailey merely\n\nstood by while his partner attacked the detainee.        Rather, the\n\ngovernment's theory, elucidated in closing argument, was that\n\nBailey struck the detainee himself, or, at a minimum, that he\n\nactively participated in his partner's assault by “[g]oing into a\n\nlocked cell for no legitimate reason, knowing that force was going\n\nto be used and then assisting [Ross], whether [by] holding [the\n\ndetainee] down or really just emboldening [Ross] by preventing the\n\ninmate from defending himself.”\n\n             Because the government did not proceed on a failure-to-\n\nact theory, the court's instruction on that point was extraneous.\n\nBut it is highly unlikely that this extraneous reference, when read\n\nin the context of an otherwise correct seven-paragraph instruction,\n\nmisled the jury to believe that it could convict Bailey simply for\n\nfailing to intervene in the attack.     See Jones v. United States,\n\n527 U.S. 373, 391 (1999) (“[Jury] instructions must be evaluated\n\nnot in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.”).    This\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fis especially so given the clarifying instruction that immediately\n\nfollowed the passage to which Bailey objects:\n\n          The mere presence of a defendant where a crime\n          is   being  committed,   even   coupled   with\n          knowledge by the defendant that a crime is\n          being committed, or the mere acquiescence by a\n          defendant in the criminal conduct of others,\n          is not sufficient to establish aiding and\n          abetting. An aider and abettor must have some\n          interest in the criminal venture.\n\nThis instruction properly safeguarded against any misapplication of\n\nthe   failure-to-act   instruction.     See   id.   (holding   that\n\ninstructions that may appear problematic when read in isolation\n\n“can be cured when read in conjunction with other instructions”).4\n\n          C.     Bodily Injury\n\n          Bailey next contends that the prosecution failed to\n\nintroduce evidence sufficient to permit a rational jury finding of\n\nbodily injury for the purposes of his felony conviction under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 242.   In determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a\n\nguilty verdict, we review the totality of the evidence in the light\n\n\n      4\n      We note, too, that the extraneous instruction was not\nsubstantively wrong. Indeed, the language to which Bailey objects\nis a standard definition of willfulness that federal courts\nregularly employ in aiding-and-abetting instructions. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Gordon, 290 F.3d 539, 543 (3d Cir.), cert. denied,\n537 U.S. 1063 (2002); United States v. Brown, 151 F.3d 476, 486\n(6th Cir. 1998); United States v. Monteiro, 871 F.2d 204, 208 (1st\nCir. 1989). It is a hornbook definition. See, e.g., 1 L. Sand, et\nal., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 11-2 (2004)\n(“Participation in a crime is willful if done voluntarily and\nintentionally, and with the specific intent to do something which\nthe law forbids or with the specific intent to fail to do something\nthe law requires to be done; that is to say, with a bad purpose\neither to disobey or to disregard the law.”) (emphasis added).\n\n                                 -14-\n\fmost favorable      to   the    government,    and   then   ask   whether   “any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.”          United States v. Henderson,\n\n320   F.3d   92,   102   (1st   Cir.   2003)   (quoting     United   States   v.\n\nWoodward, 149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n             A felony conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 242 requires proof\n\nthat the defendant “willfully subject[ed] [a] person . . . to the\n\ndeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or\n\nprotected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, . . .\n\nif bodily injury results [from such deprivation].”                Although the\n\nstatute does not define “bodily injury,” the term is defined\n\nidentically in four other provisions of Title 18.            See 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n831(f)(5); 1365(h)(4); 1515(a)(5); 1864(d)(2) (all defining “bodily\n\ninjury” as “(A) a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, or disfigurement;\n\n(B) physical pain; (C) illness; (D) impairment of [a/the] function\n\nof a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or (E) any other\n\ninjury to the body, no matter how temporary”).                    The Eleventh\n\nCircuit has applied this definition in § 242 cases.                  See United\n\nStates v. Myers, 972 F.2d 1566, 1572 (11th Cir. 1992) (noting that\n\n“[w]hen Congress uses, but does not define a particular word, it is\n\npresumed to have adopted that word's established meaning”) (citing\n\nDavis v. Michigan Dep't of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 813 (1989)).               We\n\nfollow suit and adopt the established definition of “bodily injury”\n\nfor the purposes of § 242.         The district court's jury instruction\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fregarding bodily injury, although not identical, was consistent\n\nwith this definition.5\n\n           Bailey argues that the only proof of bodily injury was\n\nthe evidence that the detainee cried after the assault.                   He argues\n\nthat people cry for a variety of reasons, and, therefore, crying\n\nalone could not establish physical pain.             But the record reflects\n\nthat the evidence of physical pain goes beyond the detainee's post-\n\nattack   crying.       The    prosecution      elicited    testimony       that   the\n\ndetainee suffered multiple blows to the head, shoulder, ribs, and\n\nthighs, and that he cried both during and after the attack.\n\nMoreover, Ross testified that the detainee specifically complained\n\nof back pain during and after the incident.               Bailey himself stated\n\nafter the incident that he and Ross had “beat the fuck out of [the\n\ndetainee].”        Taken     together,   the    evidence     above       provides   a\n\nsufficient basis for a rational trier of fact to find bodily injury\n\nfor the purposes of a § 242 felony conviction.\n\n           D.         Prejudicial Spillover\n\n           Bailey     asserts    that    the    majority    of     his    trial   was\n\ncentered   on   the    government's      theory   that     there    was    a   global\n\nconspiracy among the guards at the Nashua Street Jail that involved\n\nbeating detainees and then covering up their crimes by filing false\n\n\n\n     5\n      With no objection from Bailey, the district court instructed\nthe jury that a bodily injury could include “any injury to the\nbody, no matter how minor, slight or temporary, and includes burns,\ncuts, abrasions, bruises or physical pain.”\n\n                                      -16-\n\freports and lying to investigators.         According to Bailey, when the\n\njury acquitted all three defendants of this global conspiracy, the\n\ndistrict court should have “taken a step back” to reassess the\n\nprejudicial impact of the conspiracy evidence on the separate\n\nsubstantive charges.       In essence, he argues that the conspiracy\n\nevidence   tainted   the    jury's   consideration    of   the   substantive\n\ncharges and therefore entitles him to a new trial on those charges.\n\n           Bailey's argument is specious.         As an initial matter,\n\nBailey had ample opportunity to seek severance prior to trial\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 14.       To the extent that the prejudice\n\nBailey alleges could not be detected prior to trial, he could also\n\nhave moved for a mistrial, though “mistrials grounded on spillover\n\nprejudice are rare.” United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1284\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).     Bailey raised his claim of spillover prejudice\n\nfor the first time in his motion for a new trial, and even then, in\n\nthe vaguest of terms.       In this case, the record demonstrates that\n\nthe district court took appropriate measures to safeguard against\n\npotential spillover prejudice by instructing the jury to consider\n\nthe evidence separately as to each count.            Cf. United States v.\n\nHoule, 237 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir. 2001) (instructions to the jury to\n\nconsider the evidence separately as to each defendant were an\n\nadequate   safeguard       against   the    possibility    of    prejudicial\n\nspillover).   We presume that jurors follow such instructions.           See\n\nUnited States v. Freeman, 208 F.3d 332, 345 (1st Cir. 2000).           And,\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\findeed, the verdict in this case suggests that the jury was able to\n\n“distinguish among the various counts.”              Id.     Bailey's two co-\n\ndefendants     at    trial,   who   were   also   charged    with    the   global\n\nconspiracy, were acquitted on all counts.            Such a       discriminating\n\nverdict   is        strong    evidence     that   the      jury     successfully\n\ncompartmentalized the evidence and applied the appropriate evidence\n\nto the appropriate counts and defendants.            Houle, 237 F.3d at 76;\n\nFreeman, 208 F.3d at 345-46.\n\n          E.          Sentencing\n\n          At Bailey's sentencing, the district court, applying the\n\nthen mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines, raised the\n\nbasic offense level of twelve by six because Bailey had acted under\n\ncolor of law, see U.S.S.G. § 2H1.1(b)(1), by two because Bailey had\n\nobstructed justice, see id. § 3C1.1, and by two because the court\n\nfound by a preponderance of the evidence that the victim was\n\nvulnerable, see id. § 3A1.1(b)(1). Bailey's enhanced offense level\n\nof 22 yielded a sentencing range of 41 to 51 months.                  The court\n\nsentenced Bailey to 41 months in prison, followed by two years of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n             In Bailey's opening appellate brief, he asserts that the\n\ndistrict court's vulnerable-victim finding was erroneous because\n\nthe court failed to make a particularized inquiry into the victim's\n\nsituation, instead focusing solely on the victim's generic status\n\nas a prisoner in the psychiatric unit.               In subsequent briefs,\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fBailey argues that a remand is necessary in light of the Supreme\n\nCourt's recent decisions in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. ___,\n\n124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004) (calling into question the constitutionality\n\nof the Guidelines), and United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. ___, 125\n\nS. Ct. 738 (2005) (severing the provisions making the Guidelines\n\nmandatory in order to preserve the Guidelines as an advisory\n\nsystem).    We consider these arguments in turn.\n\n                     1.    Vulnerable-Victim Finding\n\n            Under U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b)(1), the base offense level\n\nshould be raised two levels if “the defendant knew or should have\n\nknown that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.”               The\n\nGuidelines define a “vulnerable victim” as “a person (A) who is a\n\nvictim of the offense of conviction . . . ; and (B) who is\n\nunusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or\n\nwho is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.”\n\nU.S.S.G.    §   3A1.1,    cmt.   n.2.     “We   have   interpreted   the   term\n\n'susceptible to the criminal conduct' as being 'primarily concerned\n\nwith the impaired capacity of the victim to detect or prevent the\n\ncrime, rather than the quantity of the harm suffered by the\n\nvictim.'”       United States v. Donnelly, 370 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting United States v. Fosher, 124 F.3d 52, 55-56 (1st\n\nCir. 1997)).\n\n            A sentencing judge must make two separate determinations\n\nbefore imposing a § 3A1.1(b)(1) enhancement: First, the judge must\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fconclude “that the victim of the crime was vulnerable, that is,\n\nthat the victim had an 'impaired capacity . . . to detect or\n\nprevent the crime.'” Donnelly, 370 F.3d at 92 (quoting Fosher, 124\n\nF.3d at 55-56).        Second, the judge must find “that the defendant\n\nknew or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability.”\n\nId.        We    review     the   district     court's   “interpretation    and\n\napplication” of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for\n\nclear error.       United States v. Savarese, 385 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n                Bailey's argument is concerned solely with the first\n\nprong of the test -- whether the victim was vulnerable.                 There is\n\noverwhelming evidence in the record supporting the district court's\n\nconclusion that he was.           As the court explicitly found, the victim\n\nwas on suicide watch, was deemed a threat to himself or others, was\n\nstripped of his clothes, was cold, and was not allowed out of his\n\ncell even to get food.            In light of these findings, we are at a\n\nloss to comprehend Bailey's suggestion that the court failed to\n\nmake   a   sufficiently       particularized     inquiry   into   the   victim's\n\nsituation.\n\n                       2.     Blakely/Booker Challenge\n\n                Bailey next contends that the vulnerable-victim finding\n\nviolated his Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find all the\n\nfacts impacting upon his sentence beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBailey did not object on these grounds below or so argue in his\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fopening brief, but raised the argument for the first time in his\n\nreply brief (which was filed after the Supreme Court's Blakely\n\ndecision).     While this appeal was under advisement, the Supreme\n\nCourt issued its decision in Booker.          Thereafter, Bailey and the\n\ngovernment filed supplemental briefs addressing whether, in light\n\nof Booker and our subsequent circuit precedent, Bailey's case\n\nshould be remanded to the district court to determine whether re-\n\nsentencing is necessary.\n\n          Because Bailey made no arguments in the district court\n\nconcerning     the   constitutionality   of    the   Guidelines   or   the\n\napplication of the Guidelines to his sentence under Blakely or\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), we review only for\n\nplain error.    See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).6\n\n          Under the four-part plain error test outlined in Olano,\n\nwe grant relief only if we find (1) an error, (2) that is plain,\n\nand that not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights,\n\nbut also (4) “seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.”          Id. at 77 (quoting\n\n\n\n     6\n      In so framing the issue, we reject Bailey's suggestion that\nhis initial challenge to the vulnerable-victim enhancement was\nsufficient to preserve his Booker argument for plenary review.\nAlthough we treat “almost any colorable claim” as preserving Booker\nerror, see United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.\n2005), here it is clear that Bailey's objection was directed solely\nto the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court's\nfinding.\n\n                                  -21-\n\fOlano, 507 U.S. at 736).          The defendant bears the burden of\n\npersuasion with respect to all four elements of the test.               See\n\nUnited States v. González-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 302 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (citing Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77).\n\n          The first two prongs are satisfied where, as here, the\n\ndistrict court treated the Guidelines as mandatory at sentencing.\n\nSee Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77.       To meet the third prong of the\n\ntest Bailey must show a “reasonable probability” that the district\n\ncourt would impose a more favorable sentence to Bailey under the\n\nnow “advisory” Guidelines.    Id. at 75.      “[W]e are inclined not to\n\nbe overly demanding as to proof of probability where, either in the\n\nexisting record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable\n\nindication that the district judge might well have reached a\n\ndifferent result under advisory guidelines.”           United States v.\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Bailey   has   failed   to   present   us   with   any   argument\n\nregarding the probability of a sentence reduction in his case.\n\nRather, he invites us to disregard Antonakopoulos and hold instead\n\nthat the burden should rest with the government to defend the pre-\n\nBooker sentence, at least where “there was no [guilty] plea and a\n\nvariety of sentencing issues were considered by the district\n\ncourt.” Under such circumstances, Bailey argues, we should presume\n\nthat the district court would have analyzed the case differently\n\nwere it not for the mandatory nature of the Guidelines.\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f          We decline Bailey's invitation to ignore Antonakopoulos.\n\nAbsent unusual circumstances not present here, panels of this court\n\nare bound by prior circuit decisions.       See United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir. 2002).7   Because Bailey\n\nhas entirely failed to “advance any viable theory as to how the\n\nBooker error” prejudiced his substantial rights, and because we\n\nfind nothing in the record to “suggest a basis for such an\n\ninference,” we deny Bailey's request to remand for re-sentencing.\n\nGonzález-Mercado, 402 F.3d at 303.8\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm Bailey's\n\nconvictions and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      To the extent Bailey seeks to distinguish his case from\nAntonakopoulos, his effort is unpersuasive. In Antonakopoulos, as\nhere, the district court imposed a sentence following a jury trial\nand conviction; there was no guilty plea. See 399 F.3d at 71; see\nalso United States v. Carpenter, ___ F.3d ___, 2005 WL 708335 at *1\n(1st Cir. Mar. 29, 2005).       Moreover, the district court in\nAntonakopoulos arguably faced a more complex set of sentencing\nissues than were presented here. See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n82 (noting that the district court had made no less than three\nfactual findings resulting in sentence enhancements beyond that\nauthorized by the jury verdict and also denied a request for a\ndownward departure).\n     8\n      For the same reasons we reject Bailey's request for re-\nargument concerning his Booker claim.\n\n                               -23-\n\f",

He now appeals his convictions and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are either uncontested, or, if contested, are presented in the light most favorable to the verdicts. <i>See United States v. McCann,</i> 366 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston's Nashua Street Jail, operated by the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department, houses pretrial detainees. On September 24, 1999, Officer Bailey and Officer Michael Ross were assigned to work in the jail's psychiatric unit. On that day, the psychiatric unit housed a pretrial detainee who was on suicide watch. In accordance with jail policy, the detainee was stripped of his clothes and denied sheets and blankets to prevent their use in a suicide attempt. His only covering was a paper \"johnny.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the afternoon, the detainee complained repeatedly that his cell was cold and that he needed a blanket. When Ross denied his request, the detainee began screaming, swearing, and punching and kicking his cell door. He persisted in this behavior for approximately three hours. At about 4 p.m., Bailey told Ross that \"he had [had] enough\" of the detainee and that he was going to \"bang him out.\" Ross replied that they should wait until later that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey left the unit for dinner at about 5:30 p.m. While at dinner, he saw Officer Paul Davis, a member of the Sheriff's Emergency Response Team. The Team is summoned to jail emergencies by way of an electronic alarm that all officers carry. Bailey informed Davis that he was having a problem with an inmate and that Davis might hear his alarm go off later that night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Bailey returned from dinner, he and Ross discussed entering the detainee's cell to \"slap him around.\" Since Ross and Bailey were not ordinarily authorized to enter a detainee's cell without permission from a superior, they fabricated a story to justify their actions. They initially agreed to report that the detainee had made a mess in his cell, that they had entered the cell to clean it, and that they were attacked upon entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 6:30 p.m., Officer Brian Murphy arrived at the psychiatric unit to relieve Ross so that the latter could go to dinner. Ross notified Murphy of the plan to enter the detainee's cell. Murphy replied that he wanted no part of it and that they had \"better write a good report.\" Undeterred, Ross and Bailey put on gloves and entered the detainee's cell. Ross approached the detainee and yelled at him to be quiet. When the detainee refused, Ross slapped his face several times and then delivered multiple \"knee strikes,\" driving his knee into the victim's thigh. Bailey joined the attack by punching the detainee several times in the ribs and shoulder. As he was being struck, the detainee cried and complained of back pain. The detainee was then pushed down onto his bed, and Bailey and Ross attempted to handcuff him. At no point during the altercation did the detainee assault the officers or make any threatening gestures. He did not fight back other than to resist the handcuffing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey's alarm was activated at some point during the melee. The Emergency Response Team, including Davis and Deputy Anthony Nuzzo, arrived shortly thereafter. They placed handcuffs on the detainee and strapped him in a restraint chair. While secured in the chair, the detainee cried and complained of back pain. Bailey informed Ross later that night that he had slapped the detainee while he was restrained in the chair. Bailey also bragged to Davis that he and Ross had \"beat the fuck out of\" the detainee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the incident, Bailey consulted with Nuzzo, who told him that the story about entering the detainee's cell to clean up a mess was not adequate cover for the beating. Nuzzo advised Bailey to report that he and Ross had entered the detainee's cell because of an apparent medical emergency, only to be attacked upon their entrance. After further discussion, Bailey and Ross decided to go with this revised \"medical emergency\" fabrication in their incident reports. They stood by this story when subsequently questioned by Sheriff's Department investigators who were conducting an internal inquiry. Relying in part on what they were told by Bailey and Ross, the investigators filed a report concluding that the officers had acted appropriately. This report, containing the false statements, was subsequently obtained by the FBI in connection with an investigation of a separate incident of excessive force at the Nashua Street Jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2000, Bailey was summoned to testify before a federal grand jury about the September 24, 1999 incident. He testified that he had entered the detainee's cell because he thought the detainee was having a seizure, that the detainee jumped up and attacked him, and that no one struck the detainee during the incident. At trial, however, Bailey admitted that he had intentionally lied to the grand jury in an effort to protect himself and Ross.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As set forth above, Bailey was convicted of violating and conspiring to violate the federal witness tampering statute by knowingly engaging in misleading conduct with the intent to prevent the communication of information concerning the commission of a federal crime to a federal law enforcement officer. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(3). Bailey argues that the prosecution failed to prove the intent element of this crime, and that the jury was improperly instructed on this point. Underlying Bailey's argument is the premise, rejected by the district court, that the intent required by the statute cannot be found when there was no federal investigation extant or imminent at the time of the alleged misleading conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey's interpretation of &#167; 1512(b)(3) is not consistent with its plain language, which reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever knowingly uses intimidation, threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to... hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(3). Nothing in this provision implies that a federal investigation must be imminent or underway at the time of the actus reus. To the contrary, and as several circuits have recognized, the statutory language suggests that Congress intended &#167; 1512(b)(3) not merely to safeguard the integrity of ongoing or imminent federal investigations, but more broadly to facilitate federal law enforcement's ability to gather information about possible federal crimes &#8212; including federal crimes that are not yet under investigation at the time of the offense. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Guadalupe,</i> 402 F.3d 409, 411 (3d Cir.2005) (\"[P]roving a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(3) does not depend on the existence or imminency of a federal investigation but rather on the possible existence of a federal crime and a defendant's intention to thwart an inquiry into that crime by officials who happen to be federal.\"); <i>United States v. Perry,</i> 335 F.3d 316, 321 (4th Cir.2003) (finding a violation of &#167; 1512(b)(3) where the defendant provided false information to local police intending to <i>prevent</i> the initiation of a federal investigation into his status as a felon in possession of a firearm), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1185, 124 S.Ct. 1408, 158 L.Ed.2d 91 (2004); <i>United States v. Veal,</i> 153 F.3d 1233, 1250 (11th Cir.1998) (\"By its wording, &#167; 1512(b)(3) does not depend on the existence or imminency of a federal case or investigation but rather on the possible existence of a federal crime and a defendant's intention to thwart an inquiry into that crime.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Accordingly, we reject Bailey's argument that &#167; 1512(b)(3) requires an existing or imminent federal investigation at the time of the defendant's misleading conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we acknowledge Bailey's argument that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(f)(1) supports reading a pending-or-imminent-federal-investigation requirement into &#167; 1512(b)(3). Section 1512(f)(1) provides that, for purposes of certain provisions of the obstruction of justice statute, \"an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.\" Bailey would have us draw a negative inference from Congress's explicit statement that an \"official proceeding\" need not be underway or imminent &#8212; i.e., that Congress contemplated that a federal <i>investigation,</i> contrary to an official proceeding, must be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a negative inference is not warranted. For one thing, &#167; 1512(f)(1) does not apply to &#167; 1512(b)(3) because &#167; 1512(b)(3) does not require that the proscribed conduct occur in the context of an \"official proceeding.\" <i>See Veal,</i> 153 F.3d at 1250. And even if &#167; 1512(f)(1) did apply, its application would support our ruling because the federal grand jury investigation to which Bailey's misstatements eventually led (which, per &#167; 1512(f)(1), need not have been underway or imminent at the time of the offense) constitutes an \"official proceeding\" within the meaning of &#167; 1512(f)(1). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1515(a)(1)(A) (defining an official proceeding for purposes of &#167; 1512(f)(1) as, among other things, a proceeding before a federal grand jury); <i>United States v. Frankhauser,</i> 80 F.3d 641, 651 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Both a federal trial and a federal grand jury investigation are `official proceedings' within the meaning of the statute.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before concluding, we also acknowledge Bailey's argument that a failure to read a pending-or-imminent-federal-investigation requirement into &#167; 1512(b)(3) raises due process and ex post facto concerns because it leaves open the possibility of a prosecution for conduct that no defendant could have understood to constitute a federal offense at the time of its commission. We do not see how this is so. Section 1512(b)(3) requires that the misleading conduct affect the communication of information \"relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense.\" Therefore, the statute applies only to obstructive behavior that the defendant knows could impede an investigation into conduct that could constitute a federal crime at the time of its commission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Here there can be no claim that it would be unconstitutional to apply the statute to Bailey, whom the jury reasonably found was aware of the conduct giving rise to the eventual federal civil rights charges at the time he misled the Sheriff's Department investigators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Aiding and Abetting</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution presented two theories for conviction on the substantive civil rights charge: that Bailey was a principal, or, alternatively, that he aided and abetted Ross in the assault. Bailey argues that the jury instruction on aiding and abetting was erroneous. Because the verdict form does not specify the theory under which the jury found Bailey guilty, and because Bailey's claim is one of legal error rather than sufficiency of the evidence, the availability of an alternate theory of conviction would not save the jury's verdict. <i>See Griffin v. United States,</i> 502 U.S. 46, 59, 112 S.Ct. 466, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991) (\"Jurors are not generally equipped to determine whether a particular theory of conviction submitted to them is contrary to law.\"); <i>United States v. Boots,</i> 80 F.3d 580, 589 (1st Cir.1996) (general verdict that may have been grounded on legally erroneous theory requires setting aside verdict on all grounds). We thus assume <i>arguendo</i> that the guilty verdict was grounded on the challenged aiding-and-abetting theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey raises two issues regarding the aiding-and-abetting instructions. Primarily, he contends that the jury was wrongly instructed to find him guilty if it found that he failed to act when he had a legal obligation to do so, because, he says, an affirmative act must be proved. Alternatively, he argues that it was not appropriate to give a failure-to-act instruction in this case because the prosecution presented no evidence or argument that Bailey had a legal obligation to act. Because Bailey failed to object to the instructions with the requisite specificity, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), our review is only for plain error, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). A defendant alleging plain error must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also seriously impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey has fallen well short of meeting the demanding plain-error test. The district court provided the jury with a seven-paragraph aiding-and-abetting instruction. Within this comprehensive instruction, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to aid and abet another to commit a crime, a defendant must willfully and knowingly have associated himself in some way with the crime, and willfully and knowingly have sought by some act to help make the crime succeed. Participation in a crime is willful if action is taken voluntarily and intentionally, <i>or, in the case of a failure to act,</i> with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Bailey argues that the instruction misstates the law to the extent that it countenances criminal liability for a failure to act. He cites a number of cases for the proposition that an aider and abettor must have \"affirmatively participated\" in the crime. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Martin,</i> 228 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Indelicato,</i> 611 F.2d 376, 385 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the government did not allege that Bailey merely stood by while his partner attacked the detainee. Rather, the government's theory, elucidated in closing argument, was that Bailey struck the detainee himself, or, at a minimum, that he actively participated in his partner's assault by \"[g]oing into a locked cell for no legitimate reason, knowing that force was going to be used and then assisting [Ross], whether [by] holding [the detainee] down or really just emboldening [Ross] by preventing the inmate from defending himself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the government did not proceed on a failure-to-act theory, the court's instruction on that point was extraneous. But it is highly unlikely that this extraneous reference, when read in the context of an otherwise correct seven-paragraph instruction, misled the jury to believe that it could convict Bailey simply for failing to intervene in the attack. <i>See Jones v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 373, 391, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999) (\"[Jury] instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.\"). This is especially so given the clarifying instruction that immediately followed the passage to which Bailey objects:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere presence of a defendant where a crime is being committed, even coupled with knowledge by the defendant that a crime is being committed, or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the criminal conduct of others, is not sufficient to establish aiding and abetting. An aider and abettor must have some interest in the criminal venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction properly safeguarded against any misapplication of the failure-to-act instruction. <i>See id.</i> (holding that instructions that may appear problematic when read in isolation \"can be cured when read in conjunction with other instructions\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Bodily Injury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey next contends that the prosecution failed to introduce evidence sufficient to permit a rational jury finding of bodily injury for the purposes of his felony conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242. In determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a guilty verdict, we review the totality of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and then ask whether \"any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A felony conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242 requires proof that the defendant \"willfully subject[ed][a] person ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,... if bodily injury results [from such deprivation].\" Although the statute does not define \"bodily injury,\" the term is defined identically in four other provisions of Title 18. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 831(f)(5); 1365(h)(4); 1515(a)(5); 1864(d)(2) (all defining \"bodily injury\" as \"(A) a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, or disfigurement; (B) physical pain; (C) illness; (D) impairment of [a/the] function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or (E) any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary\"). The Eleventh Circuit has applied this definition in &#167; 242 cases. <i>See United States v. Myers,</i> 972 F.2d 1566, 1572 (11th Cir.1992) (noting that \"[w]hen Congress uses, but does not define a particular word, it is presumed to have adopted that word's established meaning\") (citing <i>Davis v. Michigan Dep't of Treasury,</i> 489 U.S. 803, 813, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989)). We follow suit and adopt the established definition of \"bodily injury\" for the purposes of &#167; 242. The district court's jury instruction regarding bodily injury, although not identical, was consistent with this definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey argues that the only proof of bodily injury was the evidence that the detainee cried after the assault. He argues that people cry for a variety of reasons, and, therefore, crying alone could not establish physical pain. But the record reflects that the evidence of physical pain goes beyond the detainee's post-attack crying. The prosecution elicited testimony that the detainee suffered multiple blows to the head, shoulder, ribs, and thighs, and that he cried both during and after the attack. Moreover, Ross testified that the detainee specifically complained of back pain during and after the incident. Bailey himself stated after the incident that he and Ross had \"beat the fuck out of [the detainee].\" Taken together, the evidence above provides a sufficient basis for a rational trier of fact to find bodily injury for the purposes of a &#167; 242 felony conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Prejudicial Spillover</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey asserts that the majority of his trial was centered on the government's theory that there was a global conspiracy among the guards at the Nashua Street Jail that involved beating detainees and then covering up their crimes by filing false reports and lying to investigators. According to Bailey, when the jury acquitted all three defendants of this global conspiracy, the district court should have \"taken a step back\" to reassess the prejudicial impact of the conspiracy evidence on the separate substantive charges. In essence, he argues that the conspiracy evidence tainted the jury's consideration of the substantive charges and therefore entitles him to a new trial on those charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey's argument is specious. As an initial matter, Bailey had ample opportunity to seek severance prior to trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 14. To the extent that the prejudice Bailey alleges could not be detected prior to trial, he could also have moved for a mistrial, though \"mistrials grounded on spillover prejudice are rare.\" <i>United States v. Houlihan,</i> 92 F.3d 1271, 1284 (1st Cir.1996). Bailey raised his claim of spillover prejudice for the first time in his motion for a new trial, and even then, in the vaguest of terms. In this case, the record demonstrates that the district court took appropriate measures to safeguard against potential spillover prejudice by instructing the jury to consider the evidence separately as to each count. <i>Cf. United States v. Houle,</i> 237 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir.2001) (instructions to the jury to consider the evidence separately as to each defendant were an adequate safeguard against the possibility of prejudicial spillover). We presume that jurors follow such instructions. <i>See United States v. Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d 332, 345 (1st Cir.2000). And, indeed, the verdict in this case suggests that the jury was able to \"distinguish among the various counts.\" <i>Id.</i> Bailey's two co-defendants at trial, who were also charged with the global conspiracy, were acquitted on all counts. Such a discriminating verdict is strong evidence that the jury successfully compartmentalized the evidence and applied the appropriate evidence to the appropriate counts and defendants. <i>Houle,</i> 237 F.3d at 76; <i>Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d at 345-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Bailey's sentencing, the district court, applying the then mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines, raised the basic offense level of twelve by six because Bailey had acted under color of law, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(b)(1), by two because Bailey had obstructed justice, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3C1.1, and by two because the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the victim was vulnerable, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3A1.1(b)(1). Bailey's enhanced offense level of 22 yielded a sentencing range of 41 to 51 months. The court sentenced Bailey to 41 months in prison, followed by two years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bailey's opening appellate brief, he asserts that the district court's vulnerable-victim finding was erroneous because the court failed to make a particularized inquiry into the victim's situation, instead focusing solely on the victim's generic status as a prisoner in the psychiatric unit. In subsequent briefs, Bailey argues that a remand is necessary in light of the Supreme Court's recent decisions in <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (calling into question the constitutionality of the Guidelines), and <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (severing the provisions making the Guidelines mandatory in order to preserve the Guidelines as an advisory system). We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Vulnerable-Victim Finding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1(b)(1), the base offense level should be raised two levels if \"the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\" The Guidelines define a \"vulnerable victim\" as \"a person (A) who is a victim of the offense of conviction ...; and (B) who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1, cmt. n. 2. \"We have interpreted the term `susceptible to the criminal conduct' as being `primarily concerned with the impaired capacity of the victim to detect or prevent the crime, rather than the quantity of the harm suffered by the victim.'\" <i>United States v. Donnelly,</i> 370 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>United States v. Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d 52, 55-56 (1st Cir.1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing judge must make two separate determinations before imposing a &#167; 3A1.1(b)(1) enhancement: First, the judge must conclude \"that the victim of the crime was vulnerable, that is, that the victim had an `impaired capacity ... to detect or prevent the crime.'\" <i>Donnelly,</i> 370 F.3d at 92 (quoting <i>Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d at 55-56). Second, the judge must find \"that the defendant knew or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability.\" <i>Id.</i> We review the district court's \"interpretation and application\" of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Savarese,</i> 385 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey's argument is concerned solely with the first prong of the test &#8212; whether the victim was vulnerable. There is overwhelming evidence in the record supporting the district court's conclusion that he was. As the court explicitly found, the victim was on suicide watch, was deemed a threat to himself or others, was stripped of his clothes, was cold, and was not allowed out of his cell even to get food. In light of these findings, we are at a loss to comprehend Bailey's suggestion that the court failed to make a sufficiently particularized inquiry into the victim's situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Blakely/Booker</i> Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey next contends that the vulnerable-victim finding violated his Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find all the facts impacting upon his sentence beyond a reasonable doubt. Bailey did not object on these grounds below or so argue in his opening brief, but raised the argument for the first time in his reply brief (which was filed after the Supreme Court's <i>Blakely</i> decision). While this appeal was under advisement, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <i>Booker.</i> Thereafter, Bailey and the government filed supplemental briefs addressing whether, in light of <i>Booker</i> and our subsequent circuit precedent, Bailey's case should be remanded to the district court to determine whether re-sentencing is necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Bailey made no arguments in the district court concerning the constitutionality of the Guidelines or the application of the Guidelines to his sentence under <i>Blakely</i> or <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we review only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the four-part plain error test outlined in <i>Olano,</i> we grant relief only if we find (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and that not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 77 (quoting <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770). The defendant bears the burden of persuasion with respect to all four elements of the test. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d 294, 302 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two prongs are satisfied where, as here, the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory at sentencing. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77. To meet the third prong of the test Bailey must show a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence to Bailey under the now \"advisory\" Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 75. \"[W]e are inclined not to be overly demanding as to proof of probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey has failed to present us with <i>any</i> argument regarding the probability of a sentence reduction in his case. Rather, he invites us to disregard <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and hold instead that the burden should rest with the government to defend the pre-<i>Booker</i> sentence, at least where \"there was no [guilty] plea and a variety of sentencing issues were considered by the district court.\" Under such circumstances, Bailey argues, we should presume that the district court would have analyzed the case differently were it not for the mandatory nature of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline Bailey's invitation to ignore <i>Antonakopoulos.</i> Absent unusual circumstances not present here, panels of this court are bound by prior circuit decisions. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Because Bailey has entirely failed to \"advance any viable theory as to how the <i>Booker</i> error\" prejudiced his substantial rights, and because we find nothing in the record to \"suggest a basis for such an inference,\" we deny Bailey's request to remand for re-sentencing. <i>Gonzalez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d at 303.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth herein, we <i>affirm</i> Bailey's convictions and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In making this argument, Bailey also suggests that his conduct did not fall within the statute's sweep because his misstatements were made to Sheriff's Department investigators who, he argues, were not federal \"law enforcement officer[s]\" for the purposes of the statute. This argument misunderstands the government's case theory. The government did not allege that the Sheriff's Department investigators were the federal \"law enforcement officers\" to whom the statute refers; the government alleged that the investigators were the<i>witnesses</i> who ultimately relayed Bailey's misinformation to federal law enforcement officers. <i>See United States v. Baldyga,</i> 233 F.3d 674, 680 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that the requirements of the statute are satisfied so long as the possibility exists that the defendant's misinformation will eventually be communicated to federal officials). That these witnesses were themselves county law enforcement personnel does not change the analysis. <i>See United States v. Veal,</i> 153 F.3d 1233, 1245 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that state police investigators \"become witnesses as a matter of course in each investigation in which they are involved\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Bailey argues that three extra-circuit cases interpreting &#167; 1512(a)(1)(C) &#8212;<i>United States v. Emery,</i> 186 F.3d 921 (8th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Causey,</i> 185 F.3d 407 (5th Cir.1999); and <i>United States v. Bell,</i> 113 F.3d 1345 (3d Cir.1997) &#8212; have implicitly recognized that a federal investigation must be at least imminent, if not underway, to support a conviction under the witness tampering statute. But none of these cases implies such a rule. They merely require the government to prove that the defendant was at least partially motivated by a desire to prevent communication between a witness and a law enforcement officer concerning the commission or possible commission of a federal offense, and that the officer was in fact a federal officer. <i>See Emery,</i> 186 F.3d at 925; <i>Causey,</i> 185 F.3d at 421-23; <i>Bell,</i> 113 F.3d at 1348-49; <i>see also United States v. Stansfield,</i> 171 F.3d 806, 816-18 (3d Cir.1999). Nothing logically precludes these statutory elements from being satisfied where, as here, the misleading conduct reasonably could be found to have been intended to prevent the commencement of what would prove to be a federal investigation into a federal offense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Of course the statute does not require that the defendant specifically know that the underlying conduct could constitute a federal offense<i>See Baldyga,</i> 233 F.3d at 681.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note, too, that the extraneous instruction was not substantively wrong. Indeed, the language to which Bailey objects is a standard definition of willfulness that federal courts regularly employ in aiding-and-abetting instructions<i>See, e.g., United States v. Gordon,</i> 290 F.3d 539, 543 (3d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 1063, 123 S.Ct. 647, 154 L.Ed.2d 549 (2002); <i>United States v.

Sand, <i>et al.,</i> Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 11-2 (2004) (\"Participation in a crime is willful if done voluntarily and intentionally, and with the specific intent to do something which the law forbids <i>or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done;</i> that is to say, with a bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> With no objection from Bailey, the district court instructed the jury that a bodily injury could include \"any injury to the body, no matter how minor, slight or temporary, and includes burns, cuts, abrasions, bruises or physical pain.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In so framing the issue, we reject Bailey's suggestion that his initial challenge to the vulnerable-victim enhancement was sufficient to preserve his<i>Booker</i> argument for plenary review. Although we treat \"almost any colorable claim\" as preserving <i>Booker</i> error, <i>see United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005), here it is clear that Bailey's objection was directed solely to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court's finding.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> To the extent Bailey seeks to distinguish his case from<i>Antonakopoulos,</i> his effort is unpersuasive. In <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> as here, the district court imposed a sentence following a jury trial and conviction; there was no guilty plea. <i>See</i> 399 F.3d at 71; <i>see also United States v. Carpenter,</i> 403 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir.2005). Moreover, the district court in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> arguably faced a more complex set of sentencing issues than were presented here. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 82 (noting that the district court had made no less than three factual findings resulting in sentence enhancements beyond that authorized by the jury verdict and also denied a request for a downward departure).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> For the same reasons we reject Bailey's request for re-argument concerning his<i>Booker</i> claim.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The grand jury's superseding indictment charged all seven defendants with conspiracy to deprive pretrial detainees of their civil rights in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241 (the \"global conspiracy\" charge). Bailey was also charged with assaulting and aiding and abetting the assault of a pretrial detainee, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242; conspiring to obstruct and obstructing a federal criminal investigation, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(3) (the witness tampering statute); and perjury (for lying to a federal grand jury), <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three of the defendants pleaded guilty to the global conspiracy charge and to their individual substantive charges, and the trial of the fourth defendant was severed.

On September 24, 1999, Officer Bailey and Officer Michael Ross were assigned to work in the jail's psychiatric unit. On that day, the psychiatric unit housed a pretrial detainee who was on suicide watch. In accordance with jail policy, the detainee was stripped of his clothes and denied sheets and blankets to prevent their use in a suicide attempt. His only covering was a paper \"johnny.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the afternoon, the detainee complained repeatedly that his cell was cold and that he needed a blanket. When Ross denied his request, the detainee began screaming, swearing, and punching and kicking his cell door. He persisted in this behavior for approximately three hours. At about 4 p.m., Bailey told Ross that \"he had [had] enough\" of the detainee and that he was going to \"bang him out.\" Ross replied that they should wait until later that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey left the unit for dinner at about 5:30 p.m. While at dinner, he saw Officer Paul Davis, a member of the Sheriff's Emergency Response Team. The Team is summoned to jail emergencies by way of an electronic alarm that all officers carry. Bailey informed Davis that he was having a problem with an inmate and that Davis might hear his alarm go off later that night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Bailey returned from dinner, he and Ross discussed entering the detainee's cell to \"slap him around.\" Since Ross and Bailey were not ordinarily authorized to enter a detainee's cell without permission from a superior, they fabricated a story to justify their actions. They initially agreed to report that the detainee had made a mess in his cell, that they had entered the cell to clean it, and that they were attacked upon entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 6:30 p.m., Officer Brian Murphy arrived at the psychiatric unit to relieve Ross so that the latter could go to dinner. Ross notified Murphy of the plan to enter the detainee's cell. Murphy replied that he wanted no part of it and that they had \"better write a good report.\" Undeterred, Ross and Bailey put on gloves and entered the detainee's cell. Ross approached the detainee and yelled at him to be quiet. When the detainee refused, Ross slapped his face several times and then delivered multiple \"knee strikes,\" driving his knee into the victim's thigh. Bailey joined the attack by punching the detainee several times in the ribs and shoulder. As he was being struck, the detainee cried and complained of back pain. The detainee was then pushed down onto his bed, and Bailey and Ross attempted to handcuff him. At no point during the altercation did the detainee assault the officers or make any threatening gestures. He did not fight back other than to resist the handcuffing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey's alarm was activated at some point during the melee. The Emergency Response Team, including Davis and Deputy Anthony Nuzzo, arrived shortly thereafter. They placed handcuffs on the detainee and strapped him in a restraint chair. While secured in the chair, the detainee cried and complained of back pain. Bailey informed Ross later that night that he had slapped the detainee while he was restrained in the chair. Bailey also bragged to Davis that he and Ross had \"beat the fuck out of\" the detainee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the incident, Bailey consulted with Nuzzo, who told him that the story about entering the detainee's cell to clean up a mess was not adequate cover for the beating. Nuzzo advised Bailey to report that he and Ross had entered the detainee's cell because of an apparent medical emergency, only to be attacked upon their entrance. After further discussion, Bailey and Ross decided to go with this revised \"medical emergency\" fabrication in their incident reports. They stood by this story when subsequently questioned by Sheriff's Department investigators who were conducting an internal inquiry. Relying in part on what they were told by Bailey and Ross, the investigators filed a report concluding that the officers had acted appropriately. This report, containing the false statements, was subsequently obtained by the FBI in connection with an investigation of a separate incident of excessive force at the Nashua Street Jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2000, Bailey was summoned to testify before a federal grand jury about the September 24, 1999 incident. He testified that he had entered the detainee's cell because he thought the detainee was having a seizure, that the detainee jumped up and attacked him, and that no one struck the detainee during the incident. At trial, however, Bailey admitted that he had intentionally lied to the grand jury in an effort to protect himself and Ross.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As set forth above, Bailey was convicted of violating and conspiring to violate the federal witness tampering statute by knowingly engaging in misleading conduct with the intent to prevent the communication of information concerning the commission of a federal crime to a federal law enforcement officer. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(3). Bailey argues that the prosecution failed to prove the intent element of this crime, and that the jury was improperly instructed on this point. Underlying Bailey's argument is the premise, rejected by the district court, that the intent required by the statute cannot be found when there was no federal investigation extant or imminent at the time of the alleged misleading conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey's interpretation of &#167; 1512(b)(3) is not consistent with its plain language, which reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever knowingly uses intimidation, threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to... hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b)(3). Nothing in this provision implies that a federal investigation must be imminent or underway at the time of the actus reus. To the contrary, and as several circuits have recognized, the statutory language suggests that Congress intended &#167; 1512(b)(3) not merely to safeguard the integrity of ongoing or imminent federal investigations, but more broadly to facilitate federal law enforcement's ability to gather information about possible federal crimes &#8212; including federal crimes that are not yet under investigation at the time of the offense. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Section 1512(f)(1) provides that, for purposes of certain provisions of the obstruction of justice statute, \"an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.\" Bailey would have us draw a negative inference from Congress's explicit statement that an \"official proceeding\" need not be underway or imminent &#8212; i.e., that Congress contemplated that a federal <i>investigation,</i> contrary to an official proceeding, must be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a negative inference is not warranted. For one thing, &#167; 1512(f)(1) does not apply to &#167; 1512(b)(3) because &#167; 1512(b)(3) does not require that the proscribed conduct occur in the context of an \"official proceeding.\" <i>See Veal,</i> 153 F.3d at 1250. And even if &#167; 1512(f)(1) did apply, its application would support our ruling because the federal grand jury investigation to which Bailey's misstatements eventually led (which, per &#167; 1512(f)(1), need not have been underway or imminent at the time of the offense) constitutes an \"official proceeding\" within the meaning of &#167; 1512(f)(1). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1515(a)(1)(A) (defining an official proceeding for purposes of &#167; 1512(f)(1) as, among other things, a proceeding before a federal grand jury); <i>United States v.

We do not see how this is so. Section 1512(b)(3) requires that the misleading conduct affect the communication of information \"relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense.\" Therefore, the statute applies only to obstructive behavior that the defendant knows could impede an investigation into conduct that could constitute a federal crime at the time of its commission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Here there can be no claim that it would be unconstitutional to apply the statute to Bailey, whom the jury reasonably found was aware of the conduct giving rise to the eventual federal civil rights charges at the time he misled the Sheriff's Department investigators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Aiding and Abetting</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution presented two theories for conviction on the substantive civil rights charge: that Bailey was a principal, or, alternatively, that he aided and abetted Ross in the assault. Bailey argues that the jury instruction on aiding and abetting was erroneous. Because the verdict form does not specify the theory under which the jury found Bailey guilty, and because Bailey's claim is one of legal error rather than sufficiency of the evidence, the availability of an alternate theory of conviction would not save the jury's verdict. <i>See Griffin v.

Primarily, he contends that the jury was wrongly instructed to find him guilty if it found that he failed to act when he had a legal obligation to do so, because, he says, an affirmative act must be proved. Alternatively, he argues that it was not appropriate to give a failure-to-act instruction in this case because the prosecution presented no evidence or argument that Bailey had a legal obligation to act. Because Bailey failed to object to the instructions with the requisite specificity, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), our review is only for plain error, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <i>United States v.

The district court provided the jury with a seven-paragraph aiding-and-abetting instruction. Within this comprehensive instruction, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to aid and abet another to commit a crime, a defendant must willfully and knowingly have associated himself in some way with the crime, and willfully and knowingly have sought by some act to help make the crime succeed. Participation in a crime is willful if action is taken voluntarily and intentionally, <i>or, in the case of a failure to act,</i> with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Bailey argues that the instruction misstates the law to the extent that it countenances criminal liability for a failure to act. He cites a number of cases for the proposition that an aider and abettor must have \"affirmatively participated\" in the crime. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199098\"><a href=\"/opinion/199098/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v.

Rather, the government's theory, elucidated in closing argument, was that Bailey struck the detainee himself, or, at a minimum, that he actively participated in his partner's assault by \"[g]oing into a locked cell for no legitimate reason, knowing that force was going to be used and then assisting [Ross], whether [by] holding [the detainee] down or really just emboldening [Ross] by preventing the inmate from defending himself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the government did not proceed on a failure-to-act theory, the court's instruction on that point was extraneous. But it is highly unlikely that this extraneous reference, when read in the context of an otherwise correct seven-paragraph instruction, misled the jury to believe that it could convict Bailey simply for failing to intervene in the attack. <i>See Jones v.

The district court's jury instruction regarding bodily injury, although not identical, was consistent with this definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey argues that the only proof of bodily injury was the evidence that the detainee cried after the assault. He argues that people cry for a variety of reasons, and, therefore, crying alone could not establish physical pain. But the record reflects that the evidence of physical pain goes beyond the detainee's post-attack crying. The prosecution elicited testimony that the detainee suffered multiple blows to the head, shoulder, ribs, and thighs, and that he cried both during and after the attack. Moreover, Ross testified that the detainee specifically complained of back pain during and after the incident. Bailey himself stated after the incident that he and Ross had \"beat the fuck out of [the detainee].\" Taken together, the evidence above provides a sufficient basis for a rational trier of fact to find bodily injury for the purposes of a &#167; 242 felony conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Prejudicial Spillover</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey asserts that the majority of his trial was centered on the government's theory that there was a global conspiracy among the guards at the Nashua Street Jail that involved beating detainees and then covering up their crimes by filing false reports and lying to investigators. According to Bailey, when the jury acquitted all three defendants of this global conspiracy, the district court should have \"taken a step back\" to reassess the prejudicial impact of the conspiracy evidence on the separate substantive charges. In essence, he argues that the conspiracy evidence tainted the jury's consideration of the substantive charges and therefore entitles him to a new trial on those charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey's argument is specious. As an initial matter, Bailey had ample opportunity to seek severance prior to trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 14. To the extent that the prejudice Bailey alleges could not be detected prior to trial, he could also have moved for a mistrial, though \"mistrials grounded on spillover prejudice are rare.\" <i>United States v. Houlihan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1284 (1st Cir.1996). Bailey raised his claim of spillover prejudice for the first time in his motion for a new trial, and even then, in the vaguest of terms. In this case, the record demonstrates that the district court took appropriate measures to safeguard against potential spillover prejudice by instructing the jury to consider the evidence separately as to each count. <i>Cf. United States v. Houle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199243\"><a href=\"/opinion/199243/united-states-v-houle/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2001) (instructions to the jury to consider the evidence separately as to each defendant were an adequate safeguard against the possibility of prejudicial spillover). We presume that jurors follow such instructions. <i>See United States v.

And, indeed, the verdict in this case suggests that the jury was able to \"distinguish among the various counts.\" <i>Id.</i> Bailey's two co-defendants at trial, who were also charged with the global conspiracy, were acquitted on all counts. Such a discriminating verdict is strong evidence that the jury successfully compartmentalized the evidence and applied the appropriate evidence to the appropriate counts and defendants. <i>Houle,</i> 237 F.3d at 76; <i>Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d at 345-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Bailey's sentencing, the district court, applying the then mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines, raised the basic offense level of twelve by six because Bailey had acted under color of law, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(b)(1), by two because Bailey had obstructed justice, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3C1.1, and by two because the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the victim was vulnerable, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3A1.1(b)(1). Bailey's enhanced offense level of 22 yielded a sentencing range of 41 to 51 months.

In light of these findings, we are at a loss to comprehend Bailey's suggestion that the court failed to make a sufficiently particularized inquiry into the victim's situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Blakely/Booker</i> Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bailey next contends that the vulnerable-victim finding violated his Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find all the facts impacting upon his sentence beyond a reasonable doubt. Bailey did not object on these grounds below or so argue in his opening brief, but raised the argument for the first time in his reply brief (which was filed after the Supreme Court's <i>Blakely</i> decision). While this appeal was under advisement, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <i>Booker.</i> Thereafter, Bailey and the government filed supplemental briefs addressing whether, in light of <i>Booker</i> and our subsequent circuit precedent, Bailey's case should be remanded to the district court to determine whether re-sentencing is necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Bailey made no arguments in the district court concerning the constitutionality of the Guidelines or the application of the Guidelines to his sentence under <i>Blakely</i> or <i>Apprendi v.

To meet the third prong of the test Bailey must show a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence to Bailey under the now \"advisory\" Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 75. \"[W]e are inclined not to be overly demanding as to proof of probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v.

Rather, he invites us to disregard <i>Antonakopoulos</i> and hold instead that the burden should rest with the government to defend the pre-<i>Booker</i> sentence, at least where \"there was no [guilty] plea and a variety of sentencing issues were considered by the district court.\" Under such circumstances, Bailey argues, we should presume that the district court would have analyzed the case differently were it not for the mandatory nature of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline Bailey's invitation to ignore <i>Antonakopoulos.</i> Absent unusual circumstances not present here, panels of this court are bound by prior circuit decisions. <i>See United States v.

This argument misunderstands the government's case theory. The government did not allege that the Sheriff's Department investigators were the federal \"law enforcement officers\" to whom the statute refers; the government alleged that the investigators were the<i>witnesses</i> who ultimately relayed Bailey's misinformation to federal law enforcement officers. <i>See United States v.

That these witnesses were themselves county law enforcement personnel does not change the analysis. <i>See United States v.

But none of these cases implies such a rule. They merely require the government to prove that the defendant was at least partially motivated by a desire to prevent communication between a witness and a law enforcement officer concerning the commission or possible commission of a federal offense, and that the officer was in fact a federal officer. <i>See Emery,</i> 186 F.3d at 925; <i>Causey,</i> 185 F.3d at 421-23; <i>Bell,</i> 113 F.3d at 1348-49; <i>see also United States v.

Nothing logically precludes these statutory elements from being satisfied where, as here, the misleading conduct reasonably could be found to have been intended to prevent the commencement of what would prove to be a federal investigation into a federal offense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Of course the statute does not require that the defendant specifically know that the underlying conduct could constitute a federal offense<i>See Baldyga,</i> 233 F.3d at 681.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note, too, that the extraneous instruction was not substantively wrong.
