Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n               Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n               and DiClerico, Jr.,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Diana Lynn Pagán-Rosado, with whom Brown & Ubarri was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Irene S. Soroeta-Kodesh, Assistant Solicitor General, with\nwhom Salvador J. Antonetti-Stutts, Solicitor General, and Mariana\nD. Negrón-Vargas, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 24, 2007\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.           This appeal arises from the\n\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment against plaintiff-\n\nappellant   Mary      Flor   Morón-Barradas     (\"Morón\").        Morón   charged\n\ndefendant-appellant Department of Education for the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico (\"DOE\") with discrimination and retaliation under Title\n\nVII based on its failure to hire her for a teaching position and\n\nits failure to issue her a teaching certification for which she\n\nclaims she was qualified.        After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\nA. Marketing Teacher Position\n\n            In   or    around    February     1999,   the   DOE   announced   an\n\nimmediate opening for a marketing teacher at the Juan Suárez\n\nPelegrina Secondary School in Aguadilla.               Although none of the\n\napplicants held a teacher's license, the DOE awarded Morón, the\n\nmost qualified applicant, the three-month contract.\n\n            In August 1999, the DOE announced the opening of the same\n\nposition for the upcoming 1999-2000 school year.                  Morón applied\n\nagain, but the DOE hired another applicant, Milagros Blázquez.\n\nMorón   filed    a    petition    for    reconsideration      with    the   DOE,\n\nchallenging Blázquez's qualifications and arguing that she, Morón,\n\nwas the more qualified candidate.             The DOE denied her petition in\n\nMarch of 2000.\n\n            On May 25, 2000, Morón filed an appeal of the DOE's\n\ndecision with the Public Education System Appeals Board (\"JASEP,\"\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\ffor its Spanish acronym).              JASEP denied the appeal on April 3,\n\n2003, concluding that Morón was not qualified for the position and\n\nthat Blázquez was the more qualified applicant.                  Móron then sought\n\njudicial review before the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals, which\n\naffirmed JASEP's decision.1           Flor v. Departamento de Educación, No.\n\nKLRA 03-00361, 2004 WL 1801975 (P.R. Cir. May 28, 2004).                  Móron did\n\nnot appeal this decision.\n\nB. Certification\n\n              Meanwhile,      on     February      25,   2000,   Morón    filed   an\n\napplication      with   the    DOE    for    a    Marketing   Education    Teaching\n\nCertificate, believing that she had met all the requirements.                     On\n\nApril 5, 2000, she received a letter from the DOE stating that she\n\nhad     not   fulfilled       all     the     requirements       to   qualify     for\n\ncertification.      Morón then asked the DOE's Certification Division\n\nto review her qualifications. On August 7, 2001, the Certification\n\nDivision informed Móron that she lacked five credit hours of\n\nmarketing courses to qualify for the certificate.                     On August 20,\n\n2001,    Morón    again    requested         the    Certification      Division    to\n\nreevaluate her qualifications.              The Director of the Certification\n\n\n\n\n1\n  JASEP had concluded that Blázquez was qualified for the position\nbecause she had a \"regular teaching certificate.\" By the time of\nMorón's appeal to the Court of Appeals, the DOE admitted that it\nhad erred in determining that Blázquez had the required\ncertificate, but the court agreed with the DOE that Blázquez was\nnonetheless more qualified than Morón.\n\n                                            -3-\n\fDivision responded that the Division would not intervene because\n\nMorón's case was pending before JASEP.\n\n           On May 19, 2003, the Certification Division issued a new\n\nevaluation of Morón's certification application,2 determining that\n\nshe had met all but the occupational experience requirement for\n\ncertification, although one of her required tests had expired since\n\nher initial application. The Division's determination was based on\n\nthe fact that it could not verify her occupational experience\n\nbecause the business in question \"did not exist or had shut down.\"\n\nIn   addition,   the   Division   noted   \"discrepancies   in   years   and\n\nschedules of service\" in Morón's submitted documents.\n\nC. EEOC Charge\n\n           On April 12, 2000, after the DOE denied her application\n\nfor reconsideration of the hiring decision and failed to issue her\n\ncertification, Morón filed a charge of discrimination with the\n\nEqual Opportunity Employment Commission (\"EEOC\") against the DOE,\n\nalleging national origin, age, and disability discrimination.           She\n\nclaimed that she is Venezuelan and that the 1999-2000 marketing\n\nteacher position had been given to a younger, less qualified Puerto\n\nRican. She also claimed that her rejection occurred only after the\n\n\n\n2\n   JASEP's April 3 order in Morón's appeal of the DOE's hiring\ndecision directed the DOE's Certifications Division to evaluate\nMorón's file and \"if it finds that she does meet the requirements\nfor a regular teaching certificate, that the same be conferred on\nher retroactively to the date when she first qualified for the\ncertificate.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\fDOE hired her for the previous three-month contract and thereby\n\nlearned of her partial disability.         Morón later amended her charge\n\nto include retaliation.\n\n           Because the DOE never responded to Morón's charge, the\n\nEEOC issued a reasonable cause determination on August 7, 2001, see\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1601.21, offering to initiate a conciliation process\n\nbetween the parties, see id. § 1601.24.         When conciliation failed,\n\nthe EEOC issued Morón a \"right to sue\" letter dated September 4,\n\n2001.   See id. § 1601.28.\n\nD. District Court Proceedings\n\n           On May 17, 2004, Morón filed an amended complaint in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,\n\nclaiming national origin discrimination with respect to the DOE's\n\nfailure to hire her for the 1999-2000 marketing teacher position\n\nand its subsequent failure to certify her.3          She also included a\n\nretaliation claim, in relation to her EEOC charge.\n\n           The    DOE    filed   a   motion   for   summary   judgment     on\n\nNovember   5,    2004,   and   simultaneously   filed   a   motion   for   an\n\nextension of time to file English translations of its exhibits,\n\nincluding the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals decision against Morón\n\n(the \"Court of Appeals decision\").         The DOE filed all the English\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The history of this case prior to May 17, 2004 is not relevant\nto the disposition of this appeal.\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftranslations by the court-imposed deadline, except for the Court of\n\nAppeals decision.\n\n           On   November   19,   2004,      Morón   filed   a   motion   for    an\n\nextension of time until December 14 to file her opposition to the\n\nDOE's motion for summary judgment.           The district court granted her\n\nuntil December 8.    As of December 30, Morón had not yet filed her\n\nopposition, prompting the DOE to file a motion to adjudicate its\n\nunopposed motion for summary judgment.\n\n           On January 10, 2005, Morón requested another extension of\n\ntime,   until   January    14,   to   file    her   opposition,    citing      her\n\nattorney's heavy case load.           Morón then filed her opposition on\n\nJanuary 14, thirty-seven days late.\n\n           On April 7, 2005, the DOE filed an \"emergency\" motion to\n\nadjudicate its unopposed motion for summary judgment and a motion\n\nrequesting that the district court consider its attached exhibit,\n\nthe Puerto Rico Court of Appeals decision, in Spanish.                         The\n\ndistrict court declined to consider the exhibit in Spanish, and on\n\nApril 11 ordered the DOE to provide an English translation by\n\nApril 25, which the DOE did.           On April 13, Morón filed a motion\n\nrequesting that the district court reconsider its April 11 order\n\nand strike the DOE's emergency motion and accompanying motion to\n\nconsider the exhibit in Spanish. The district court denied Morón's\n\nmotion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            On May 3, 2005, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the DOE.   Morón Barrada v. Dep't of Educ., 368\n\nF. Supp. 2d 137, 140 (D.P.R. 2005).        The court refused to consider\n\nMorón's untimely opposition, and accordingly \"accept[ed] as true\n\nall material facts set forth by defendant with appropriate record\n\nsupport.\"   Id. at 142.   The court concluded that (1) Morón's claim\n\nthat the DOE failed to hire her for the 1999-2000 marketing teacher\n\nposition on account of her national origin was barred by res\n\njudicata and collateral estoppel; (2) Morón failed to establish a\n\nprima facie case of national origin discrimination in relation to\n\nthe DOE's failure to certify her because she was not qualified for\n\nthe certificate; and (3) Morón failed to establish a prima facie\n\ncase of retaliation because there was no evidence that the DOE's\n\nrefusal to grant her certification was causally connected to her\n\nfiling of the EEOC charge.\n\n            Morón filed a motion to amend the judgment, and also\n\nrequesting relief from judgment, on May 17, 2005. She included two\n\n\"new\" pieces of evidence: (1) a letter dated April 22, 2005, from\n\nthe DOE to Morón's attorney, indicating that the DOE had decided to\n\naccredit    Morón's   occupational    experience,   and   that   she   had\n\ntherefore fulfilled all the requirements for certification, other\n\nthan one expired test,4 and (2) handwritten notes from a DOE\n\n\n\n4\n  Morón admits that she received the letter on April 27, 2005, six\ndays prior to the entry of summary judgment.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fpersonnel record obtained on May 10, 2005 by Morón's attorney\n\nthrough discovery in another case, stating that the DOE needed only\n\nto verify Morón's occupational experience to complete approval of\n\nher certification.         Morón argued that the district court should\n\nvacate its determination that she was not qualified to receive the\n\nteaching certificate because the new evidence demonstrated that she\n\nwas qualified from the time of her original application, since the\n\nDOE relied on the same evidence that Morón originally submitted.\n\n           On July 15, 2005, Morón filed a supplemental motion for\n\nreconsideration, including additional \"new\" evidence in support of\n\nher claims: a May 2, 2005 JASEP order directing the DOE to submit\n\nthe   results   of   its    evaluation   of   Morón's   qualifications   for\n\ncertification, and the DOE's responding motion in compliance with\n\nthe order, reiterating the content of its April 22, 2005 letter to\n\nMorón.\n\n           The DOE filed a motion for an extension of time to file\n\nan opposition to Morón's supplemental motion for reconsideration on\n\nJuly 29, 2005, citing its attorney's \"overwhelming workload.\"\n\nWithout an answer from the district court, the DOE filed the\n\nopposition on August 23, at least twenty-one days late.5             Morón\n\nfiled a motion to strike the opposition, which the district court\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n5\n   Morón states that the opposition was due on August 2, whereas\nthe DOE implies that it was due on July 29.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            Finally, on January 19, 2006, the district court denied\n\nMorón's motion to alter the judgment and supplemental motion for\n\nreconsideration.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n            Morón challenges the district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment in favor of the DOE on all her claims and the court's\n\ndenial of her motions for reconsideration and relief from judgment.\n\nMorón also disputes the district court's refusal to consider her\n\nuntimely opposition to the DOE's motion for summary judgment, while\n\nat the same time accepting three of the DOE's late filings: (1) its\n\nemergency motion to adjudicate its summary judgment motion; (2) the\n\ncertified English translation of the Court of Appeals opinion in\n\nFlor, 2004 WL 1801975, affirming JASEP's conclusion that Morón was\n\nnot qualified and that Blázquez was better qualified for the\n\nmarketing   teacher      position;   and     (3)    its   second   response     in\n\nopposition to Morón's motions for reconsideration.\n\nA. Untimely Filings\n\n            Morón does not dispute that the district court has the\n\ndiscretionary authority to consider a motion for summary judgment\n\nunopposed   when   the    non-moving    party      does   not   timely   file   an\n\nopposition. See Pérez-Cordero v. Wal-Mart P.R., 440 F.3d 531, 533-\n\n34 (1st Cir. 2006).       Rather, she argues, inter alia, that it was\n\nunfair for the district court to refuse to consider her untimely\n\nopposition while at the same time accepting the DOE's late filings.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fId. at 534 (\"Normally, we will not disturb a district court's\n\ndecision to consider a summary judgment motion unopposed because a\n\nparty has missed the deadline for filing an opposition[,] . . .\n\n[but w]e have granted relief when the appealing litigant was\n\nreasonably surprised by the deadline or the action of the court, or\n\nthe events leading to the contested decision were unfair.\").\n\nHowever, even considering Morón's opposition, and consequently not\n\ntaking as true the DOE's statement of facts, there is no evidence\n\nto support Morón's claims of discrimination or retaliation, as\n\ndiscussed in detail below.        Thus, we need not reach Morón's\n\nargument that the district court abused its discretion in refusing\n\nto consider her untimely opposition.\n\n          With the unfairness issue set aside because Morón's\n\nopposition does not help her case, Morón offers no other argument\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion in accepting the\n\nDOE's allegedly late filings.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b); McIntosh\n\nv. Antonino, 71 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"The administration of\n\nfiling deadlines is a matter of case management that comes within\n\nthe district court's discretion.\").\n\nB. Summary Judgment\n\n          Morón   argues   that   contrary   to   the   district   court's\n\nconclusions, (1) her claim of discrimination in the DOE's hiring\n\ndecision is not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel, (2)\n\nshe was qualified for both the marketing teacher position and the\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fteaching certificate, and (3) the temporal proximity of her EEOC\n\ncharge and the DOE's failure to issue her certification indicates\n\nthat the two events are causally connected for purposes of her\n\nretaliation claim.\n\n           We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing\n\nthe record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n\nDePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 F.3d 112, 117 (1st Cir. 2005).           We will\n\naffirm summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material\n\nfact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n           For purposes of our review, we will look to the full\n\nsummary judgment record, as if the district court had considered\n\nMorón's   untimely   opposition,   because     it   does   not   change   our\n\nconclusion that the DOE is entitled to summary judgment on all\n\nclaims.\n\n           1. Discrimination in Hiring Decision\n\n           To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\n\nseq., Morón must show that (1) she is a member of a protected\n\nclass, (2) she applied and was qualified for the marketing teacher\n\nposition, and the DOE (3) rejected her and (4) hired someone with\n\nsimilar or lesser qualifications.         See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\n\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973); Sinai v. New Eng. Tel. & Tel. Co.,\n\n3 F.3d 471, 474 (1st Cir. 1993).          The DOE argues that Morón is\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fcollaterally estopped from relitigating whether she was qualified\n\nfor the position or whether the DOE hired a similarly or less\n\nqualified applicant, because the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the administrative agency's findings against her on these\n\nissues.    See Flor, 2004 WL 1801975.       We agree.\n\n               Under 28 U.S.C. § 1738, federal courts must give the same\n\neffect to a state or territory judgment as the issuing jurisdiction\n\nwould.    See Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).        The\n\nrules     of    preclusion   apply   equally   to    judicially   reviewed\n\nadministrative agency decisions, such as Flor.            Kremer v. Chem.\n\nConstr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 466 (1982).            Under Puerto Rico law,\n\nres judicata applies when there is \"the most perfect identity\n\nbetween the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their\n\ncapacity as such.\"       P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3343.       Puerto Rico\n\ncourts have interpreted the statute to permit issue preclusion, or\n\ncollateral estoppel, as well, even when identity of causes is\n\nlacking.       Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Medina, 834 F.2d 242, 245-46 (1st\n\nCir. 1987) (citing A & P Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. Asociación Caná,\n\nInc., 10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 984, 996 (1981)).\n\n               In order for collateral estoppel to apply here, Morón and\n\nthe DOE must have actually litigated the facts in question, and\n\nthose facts must have been essential to a valid and final judgment\n\nin a prior action.       See Felix Davis v. Vieques Air Link, 892 F.2d\n\n1122, 1124-25 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing, inter alia, Pereira v.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fHernández, 83 P.R. 156, 161 n.7 (1961), and A & P Gen. Contractors,\n\n10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 984).     In Flor, 2004 WL 1801975, the Puerto\n\nRico Court of Appeals agreed with JASEP's conclusion that Morón was\n\nnot qualified for the teaching position, and that the teacher\n\nchosen to fill the position was more qualified than Morón.              Both\n\nparties fully and fairly litigated the issues in that case,6 the\n\nfacts of Morón's and Blázquez's qualifications were essential to\n\nthe judgment that the DOE properly hired Blázquez rather than\n\nMorón, and Flor is final and unappealable. Therefore, we are bound\n\nby the Puerto Rico court's factual determinations.\n\n           Morón responds that her case is analogous to Thomas v.\n\nContoocook Valley Sch. Dist., 150 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 1998), and that\n\ntherefore, as in that case, we should not apply the standard\n\npresumption of preclusion.     In Thomas, a school board had made two\n\nfindings   regarding   the   school's      nonrenewal   of   the   plaintiff\n\nteacher: (1) that the teacher was terminated due to her poor\n\nperformance and (2) that her disability had no bearing on the\n\nschool's decision.     Id. at 35.    The reviewing state agency upheld\n\nthe finding of poor performance as not arbitrary or capricious, but\n\nalso found that there was insufficient evidence on which to decide\n\nwhether there was any disability discrimination.             Id. at 36-37.\n\n\n\n6\n   Morón does not argue that she did not have a full and fair\nopportunity to litigate the factual issues of her and Blázquez's\nqualifications, and we see no evidence in the record to the\ncontrary.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fThe agency then referred the discrimination issue to a state human\n\nrights commission.        Id.    The agency's bifurcated decision was\n\nsummarily affirmed, without explanation, by the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court.     Id. at 37.\n\n            Based on Thomas's particularly \"unusual\" circumstances,\n\nwe    denied    preclusive   effect    to    the   administrative    agency's\n\nconclusion, affirmed by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, that the\n\nteacher's termination was due to her poor performance.              Id. at 39-\n\n40.    First, we determined that under New Hampshire law, the non-\n\nrenewal proceedings before the school board did not preclude\n\nseparate review of a discrimination claim before the human rights\n\ncommission.     Id. at 41-42.    Such law does not exist in Puerto Rico.\n\n            Second, we concluded in Thomas that the precise issue\n\nbefore    the    state   administrative      agency   --   \"that   there   was\n\n'sufficient evidence' in support of the School Board's proffered\n\nreason for the nonrenewal decision\" -- was not identical to the\n\nissue before the court, that is, \"whether the defendant's decision\n\nwas in fact motivated by discrimination on the basis of [the\n\nteacher's] disability.\"         Id. at 42.    Here, unlike the teacher in\n\nThomas, Morón has not pointed to any evidence of discrimination\n\nthat might sustain her case under a mixed-motive analysis.                 See\n\nHillstrom v. Best Western TLC Hotel, 354 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (\"[I]n mixed-motive cases, plaintiffs must present enough\n\nevidence to permit a finding that there was differential treatment\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fin an employment action and that the adverse employment decision\n\nwas caused at least in part by a forbidden type of bias.\").\n\nRather, Morón must proceed under the burden-shifting framework,7\n\nwhich requires her to establish that she was qualified for the\n\nmarketing teacher position and that Blázquez was not more qualified\n\nthan she was.       These precise questions, however, have already been\n\nexpressly    determined    by    both    an    administrative       agency   and   a\n\nreviewing court, and neither these determinations nor those of the\n\nEEOC raised any questions of discriminatory intent.8                  See Thomas,\n\n150 F.3d at 42 (\"The finding of 'sufficient cause' must be viewed\n\nin conjunction with the fact that the State Board explicitly chose\n\nnot   to   decide    whether    the   School    Board   .   .   .   impermissibly\n\ndiscriminated against Thomas based upon her voice disability.\").\n\n            In sum, there is simply no reason to depart from the\n\nstandard rules of issue preclusion in this case.                    Because Morón\n\ncannot come before us now and argue that she was qualified, or that\n\nBlázquez was less qualified, for the DOE position, Morón cannot\n\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination.                 Thus, the DOE is\n\n\n\n\n7\n   In any event, Morón has not requested that her case be reviewed\nunder a mixed-motive theory. See Hillstrom, 354 F.3d at 31 (\"It is\ndoubtful that Hillstrom has preserved [the mixed-motive] issue, as\nhe never suggested to the district court that he was presenting\n[such a] case.\").\n8\n  The EEOC's determinations were based solely on the DOE's failure\nto respond.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fentitled to judgment as a matter of law on Morón's discrimination\n\nclaim.9\n\n          2. Discrimination in Certification Decision\n\n          When, as here, direct evidence is lacking to support a\n\ndiscrimination claim, the plaintiff must rely on establishing a\n\nprima facie case through the familiar steps of the burden-shifting\n\nframework.   See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-05.   On appeal,\n\nhowever, we have often put aside the prima facie case to focus\n\ninstead on \"whether there is evidence that, notwithstanding the\n\n. . . stated reasons for the [decision], the real reason, at least\n\nin part, was . . . discrimination.\"      Fontánez-Núñez v. Janssen\n\nOrtho LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).   \"[T]he task of proving discrimination remains the\n\nplaintiff's at all times.\" Dichner v. Liberty Travel, 141 F.3d 24,\n\n30 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          The DOE maintains that Morón was denied certification\n\nbecause she was not qualified.    Whether or not Morón was actually\n\nqualified for certification at the time in question, the record,\n\naugmented with Morón's submissions in support of her opposition to\n\nsummary judgment, in no way suggests that the DOE's decision was\n\n\n\n\n9\n    The DOE also argued, and the district court alternatively\nconcluded, that Morón's claim was foreclosed on res judicata\nprinciples.   Because we hold that her claim is collaterally\nestopped, we need not reach the claim preclusion issue.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fdiscriminatory.10     Even     if   the   DOE   mistakenly   denied   Morón's\n\napplication for certification, there is no evidence that the\n\ndecision was made because she is Venezuelan.              Therefore, in the\n\nabsence   of   evidence   of   discrimination,        summary   judgment   was\n\nproperly granted on Morón's claim of discrimination in the denial\n\nof her application for certification.\n\n           3. Retaliation\n\n           To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under\n\nTitle VII, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), Morón was required to show\n\nthat \"(1) [she] engaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2)\n\n[she] suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse\n\naction    is   causally   connected       to    the   protected    activity.\"\n\nHernández-Torres v. Intercont'l Trading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).    In her opposition to summary judgment, Morón did not\n\nspecify the causal nexus of her retaliation claim.              Nevertheless,\n\nthe district court concluded that sufficient time passed between\n\nMorón's filing of the EEOC charge on April 12, 2000, and the DOE's\n\nrejection of her application for certification on August 7, 2001,\n\nto defeat an inference of causal connection based on temporal\n\n\n\n10\n   To raise an inference of intentional discrimination based on a\ndefendant's proffered reason for a challenged action, a plaintiff\nmust provide \"a substantial showing that respondent's explanation\nwas false.\"    Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir.\n2000) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S.\n133, 144 (2000)).    Morón has not met that standard here.     See\nReeves, 530 U.S. at 144-45 (describing evidentiary basis for\ninference).\n\n                                     -17-\n\fproximity. See Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6,\n\n25 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Three and four month periods have been held\n\ninsufficient to establish a causal connection based on temporal\n\nproximity.\").\n\n           On   appeal,   Morón   argues   that   the    district   court\n\nmiscalculated the temporal proximity of the two events. First, she\n\npoints to the fact that the DOE first rejected her application for\n\ncertification on April 5, 2000, a week before she filed the EEOC\n\ncharge.   It is impossible for the DOE to have retaliated against\n\nMorón before she engaged in protected activity.         Next, Morón lists\n\na number of instances between April 12, 2000, and November 27, 2000\n\nwhen she continued to allege discrimination before the EEOC.        None\n\nof these events suggest that the DOE took any action against her\n\nduring this time, which might serve as a basis for a retaliation\n\nclaim.    Even so, more than eight months elapsed between the last\n\ndate in this series of events and the DOE's next action on\n\nAugust 7, 2001, which is still insufficient to establish temporal\n\nproximity.   See id.\n\n           Based on the record before us, we can find no evidence of\n\na causal connection between Morón's filing of the EEOC charge and\n\nthe DOE's failure to certify her as a marketing teacher.              We\n\ntherefore affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the DOE on Morón's retaliation claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fC.   Motions for Reconsideration and Relief from Judgment\n\n           Finally, Morón challenges the district court's denial of\n\nher motion to alter or amend the judgment and for relief from\n\njudgment, and her supplemental motion for reconsideration, in light\n\nof new evidence that she has been qualified for the teaching\n\ncertificate since the time of her application.11    See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 60(b)(2).   \"[Because] we defer broadly to the district court's\n\ninformed discretion in granting or denying relief from judgment,\n\n. . . we review its ruling solely for abuse of that discretion.\"\n\nKarak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           With her Rule 60(b) motions, Morón offered three new\n\npieces of evidence in support of her claim that she was qualified\n\nfor the teaching certificate from the time that she first filed her\n\napplication with the DOE.   The district court refused to entertain\n\nthe first piece of evidence -- a letter dated April 22, 2005, in\n\nwhich the DOE allegedly informed Morón that she had been qualified\n\nfor the certificate all along -- because, inter alia, Morón had\n\nreceived the letter prior to summary judgment.     The district court\n\ndid not specifically address Morón's other \"new\" evidence: (a)\n\nhandwritten notes from a DOE file, allegedly stating that the DOE\n\nneeded only to verify her occupational experience to complete\n\napproval of her certification, obtained on May 10, 2005, and (b) a\n\n\n11\n   Morón also appeals the ruling on the ground that the district\ncourt should have accepted her opposition to summary judgment. As\nwe concluded above, we need not reach this question.\n\n                                -19-\n\fJuly   15,   2005   JASEP   order   directing   the   DOE   to   submit   its\n\nevaluation of Morón's qualifications for certifiction, and the\n\nDOE's motion in compliance with the order reiterating the content\n\nof the April 22, 2005 letter.\n\n             We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\ndenial of Morón's Rule 60(b)(2) motions.           The court should only\n\ngrant such relief from summary judgment when \"(1) [new] evidence\n\nhas been discovered since the trial; (2) the evidence could not by\n\ndue diligence have been discovered earlier by the movant; (3) the\n\nevidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) the\n\nevidence is of such a nature that it would probably change the\n\nresult were a new trial to be granted.\"         U.S. Steel v. M. DeMatteo\n\nConstr. Co., 315 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2002) (footnote omitted)\n\n(citing Mitchell v. United States, 141 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\nMorón received the April 22, 2005 letter prior to summary judgment,\n\nand offered no reason why she did not bring the evidence to the\n\nattention of the court earlier.       Thus, the district court properly\n\nrefused to consider that evidence. See González-Piña v. Rodríguez,\n\n407 F.3d 425, 433 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"'[A] party who seeks relief\n\nfrom a judgment based on newly discovered evidence must, at the\n\nvery least, offer a convincing explanation as to why he could not\n\nhave proffered the crucial evidence at an earlier stage of the\n\nproceedings.'\" (quoting Karak, 288 F.3d at 19-20)).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f          The same logic applies to the rest of Morón's \"new\"\n\nevidence, which at best is merely cumulative of the April 22, 2005\n\nletter.   Morón suggests that the handwritten notes show that she\n\nwas qualified for the certificate from the time of her application,\n\nwhich is also what the letter said.12 Similarly, the DOE's response\n\nto the JASEP order reiterates the contents of the letter.   Because\n\nMorón was in possession of this information prior to summary\n\njudgment but was not diligent in bringing it to the court's\n\nattention, the court did not abuse its discretion by failing to\n\nconsider the evidence in deciding Morón's Rule 60(b) motions.   See\n\nid.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the entry of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the DOE.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n12\n   We should clarify that the import of the notes is unclear. The\nnotes appear to state that Morón's occupational experience \"must be\napproved in order to obt[ain]\" the Certificate. We interpret this\nstatement to simply reiterate the content of the DOE's May 19, 2003\nevaluation of Morón's file -- that she still lacked the\noccupational experience requirement. In that case, the evidence\nshould not be considered because it is merely cumulative. However,\nfor purposes of our analysis above, we will accept Morón's\ninterpretation of the notes.\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

Mor&#243;n applied again, but the DOE hired another applicant, Milagros Bl&#225;zquez. Mor&#243;n filed a petition for reconsideration with the DOE, challenging Bl&#225;zquez's qualifications and arguing that she, Mor&#243;n, was the more qualified candidate.

Wal-Mart P.R.,</i> 440 F.3d 531, 533-34 (1st Cir.2006).

However, even considering Mor&#243;n's opposition, and consequently not taking as true the DOE's statement of facts, there is no evidence to support Mor&#243;n's claims of discrimination or retaliation, as discussed in detail below.

Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <i>Sinai v. New Eng. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,</i> 3 F.3d 471, 474 (1st Cir.1993). The DOE argues that Mor&#243;n is collaterally estopped from relitigating whether she was qualified for the position or whether the DOE hired a similarly or less qualified applicant, because the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals affirmed the administrative agency's findings against her on these issues. <i>See Flor,</i> 2004 WL 1801975. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738, federal courts must give the same effect to a state or territory judgment as the issuing jurisdiction would. <i>See Cruz v. Melecio,</i> 204 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.2000). The rules of preclusion apply equally to judicially reviewed administrative agency decisions, such as <i>Flor. Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp.,</i> 456 U.S. 461, 466, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982). Under Puerto Rico law, res judicata applies when there is \"the most perfect identity between the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3343. Puerto Rico courts have interpreted the statute to permit issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, as well, even when identity of causes is lacking. <i>Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Medina,</i> 834 F.2d 242, 245-46 (1st Cir.1987) (citing <i>A &amp; P Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. Asociaci&#243;n Can&#225;, Inc.,</i> 10 P.R. Offic.

Vieques Air Link,</i> 892 F.2d 1122, 1124-25 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing, <i>inter alia, Pereira v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 83 P.R.R. 156, 161 n. 7 (1961), and <i>A &amp; P Gen. Contractors,</i> 10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 984, 110 D.P.R. 753). In <i>Flor,</i> 2004 WL 1801975, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals agreed with JASEP's conclusion that Mor&#243;n was not qualified for the teaching position, and that the teacher chosen to fill the position was more qualified than Mor&#243;n. Both parties fully and fairly litigated the issues in that case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the facts of Mor&#243;n's and Bl&#225;zquez's qualifications were essential to the judgment that the DOE properly hired Bl&#225;zquez rather than Mor&#243;n, and <i>Flor</i> is final and unappealable. Therefore, we are bound by the Puerto Rico court's factual determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mor&#243;n responds that her case is analogous to <i>Thomas v. Contoocook Valley Sch. Dist.,</i> 150 F.3d 31 (1st Cir.1998), and that therefore, as in that case, we should not apply the standard presumption of preclusion. In <i>Thomas,</i> a school board had made two findings regarding the school's nonrenewal of the plaintiff teacher: (1) that the teacher was terminated due to her poor performance and (2) that her disability had no bearing on the school's decision. <i>Id.</i> at 35. The reviewing state agency upheld the finding of poor performance as not arbitrary or capricious, but also found that there was insufficient evidence on which to decide whether there was any disability discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 36-37. The agency then referred the discrimination issue to a state human rights commission. <i>Id.</i> The agency's bifurcated decision was summarily affirmed, without explanation, by the New Hampshire Supreme Court. <i>Id.</i> at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on <i>Thomas</i>'s particularly \"unusual\" circumstances, we denied preclusive effect to the administrative agency's conclusion, affirmed by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, that the teacher's termination was due to her poor performance. <i>Id.</i> at 39-40. First, we determined that under New Hampshire law, the non-renewal proceedings before the school board did not preclude separate review of a discrimination claim before the human rights commission. <i>Id.</i> at 41-42. Such law does not exist in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we concluded in <i>Thomas</i> that the precise issue before the state administrative agency &#8212; \"that there was `sufficient evidence' in support of the School Board's <i>proffered</i> reason for the nonrenewal decision\" &#8212; was not identical to the issue before the court, that is, \"whether the defendant's decision was in fact motivated by discrimination on the basis of [the teacher's] disability.\" <i>Id.</i> at 42. Here, unlike the teacher in <i>Thomas,</i> Mor&#243;n has not pointed to any evidence of discrimination that might sustain her case under a mixed-motive analysis. <i>See Hillstrom v. Best Western TLC Hotel,</i> 354 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[I]n mixed-motive cases, plaintiffs must present enough evidence to permit a finding that there was differential treatment in an employment action and that the adverse employment decision was caused at least in part by a forbidden type of bias.\"). Rather, Mor&#243;n must proceed under the burden-shifting framework,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> which requires her to establish that she was qualified for the marketing teacher position and that Bl&#225;zquez was not more qualified than she was. These precise questions, however, have already been expressly determined by both an administrative agency and a reviewing court, and neither these determinations nor those of the EEOC raised any questions of discriminatory intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See Thomas,</i> 150 F.3d at 42 (\"The finding of `sufficient cause' must be viewed in conjunction with the fact that the State Board explicitly chose not to decide whether the School Board . . . impermissibly discriminated against Thomas based upon her voice disability.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, there is simply no reason to depart from the standard rules of issue preclusion in this case. Because Mor&#243;n cannot come before us now and argue that she was qualified, or that Bl&#225;zquez was less qualified, for the DOE position, Mor&#243;n cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Thus, the DOE is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Mor&#243;n's discrimination claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Discrimination in Certification Decision</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as here, direct evidence is lacking to support a discrimination claim, the plaintiff must rely on establishing a prima facie case through the familiar steps of the burden-shifting framework. <i>See McDonnell Douglas,</i> 411 U.S. at 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817. On appeal, however, we have often put aside the prima facie case to focus instead on \"whether there is evidence that, notwithstanding the . . . stated reasons for the [decision], the real reason, at least in part, was . . . discrimination.\" <i>Font&#225;nez-N&#250;&#241;ez v. Janssen Ortho LLC,</i> 447 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he task of proving discrimination remains the plaintiff's at all times.\" <i>Dichner v.

Whether or not Mor&#243;n was actually qualified for certification at the time in question, the record, augmented with Mor&#243;n's submissions in support of her opposition to summary judgment, in no way suggests that the DOE's decision was discriminatory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Even if the DOE mistakenly denied Mor&#243;n's application for certification, there is no evidence that the decision was made because she is Venezuelan. Therefore, in the absence of evidence of discrimination, summary judgment was properly granted on Mor&#243;n's claim of discrimination in the denial of her application for certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>3. Retaliation</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a), Mor&#243;n was required to show that \"(1) [she] engaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2)[she] suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action is causally connected to the protected activity.\" <i>Hern&#225;ndez-Torres v. Intercont'l Trading, Inc.,</i> 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.1998). In her opposition to summary judgment, Mor&#243;n did not specify the causal nexus of her retaliation claim. Nevertheless, the district court concluded that sufficient time passed between Mor&#243;n's filing of the EEOC charge on April 12, 2000, and the DOE's rejection of her application for certification on August 7, 2001, to defeat an inference of causal connection based on temporal proximity. <i>See Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 355 F.3d 6, 25 (1st Cir.2004) (\"Three and four month periods have been held insufficient to establish a causal connection based on temporal proximity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mor&#243;n argues that the district court miscalculated the temporal proximity of the two events. First, she points to the fact that the DOE first rejected her application for certification on April 5, 2000, a week before she filed the EEOC charge. It is impossible for the DOE to have retaliated against Mor&#243;n before she engaged in protected activity. Next, Mor&#243;n lists a number of instances between April 12, 2000, and November 27, 2000 when she continued to allege discrimination before the EEOC. None of these events suggest that the DOE took any action against her during this time, which might serve as a basis for a retaliation claim. Even so, more than eight months elapsed between the last date in this series of events and the DOE's next action on August 7, 2001, which is still insufficient to establish temporal proximity. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the record before us, we can find no evidence of a causal connection between Mor&#243;n's filing of the EEOC charge and the DOE's failure to certify her as a marketing teacher. We therefore affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the DOE on Mor&#243;n's retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

The district court refused to entertain the first piece of evidence &#8212; a letter dated April 22, 2005, in which the DOE allegedly informed Mor&#243;n that she had been qualified for the certificate all along &#8212; because, <i>inter alia,</i> Mor&#243;n had received the letter prior to summary judgment. The district court did not specifically address Mor&#243;n's other \"new\" evidence: (a) handwritten notes from a DOE file, allegedly stating that the DOE needed only to verify her occupational experience to complete approval of her certification, obtained on May 10, 2005, and (b) a July 15, 2005 JASEP order directing the DOE to submit its evaluation of Mor&#243;n's qualifications for certification, and the DOE's motion in compliance with the order reiterating the content of the April 22, 2005 letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of Mor&#243;n's Rule 60(b)(2) motions. The court should only grant such relief from summary judgment when \"(1) [new] evidence has been discovered since the trial; (2) the evidence could not by due diligence have been discovered earlier by the movant; (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) the evidence is of such a nature that it would probably change the result were a new trial to be granted.\" <i>U.S. Steel v.

Mor&#243;n received the April 22, 2005 letter prior to summary judgment, and offered no reason why she did not bring the evidence to the attention of the court earlier. Thus, the district court properly refused to consider that evidence. <i>See Gonz&#225;lez-Pi&#241;a v.

Marketing Teacher Position</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or around February 1999, the DOE announced an immediate opening for a marketing teacher at the Juan Su&#225;rez Pelegrina Secondary School in Aguadilla. Although none of the applicants held a teacher's license, the DOE awarded Mor&#243;n, the most qualified applicant, the three-month contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1999, the DOE announced the opening of the same position for the upcoming 1999-2000 school year. Mor&#243;n applied again, but the DOE hired another applicant, Milagros Bl&#225;zquez. Mor&#243;n filed a petition for reconsideration with the DOE, challenging Bl&#225;zquez's qualifications and arguing that she, Mor&#243;n, was the more qualified candidate. The DOE denied her petition in March of 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 25, 2000, Mor&#243;n filed an appeal of the DOE's decision with the Public Education System Appeals Board (\"JASEP,\" for its Spanish acronym). JASEP denied the appeal on April 3, 2003, concluding that Mor&#243;n was not qualified for the position and that Bl&#225;zquez was the more qualified applicant. Mor&#243;n then sought judicial review before the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals, which affirmed JASEP's decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Flor v.

On April 5, 2000, she received a letter from the DOE stating that she had not fulfilled all the requirements to qualify for certification. Mor&#243;n then asked the DOE's Certification Division to review her qualifications. On August 7, 2001, the Certification Division informed M&#243;ron that she lacked five credit hours of marketing courses to qualify for the certificate. On August 20, 2001, Mor&#243;n again requested the Certification Division to reevaluate her qualifications.

The Division's determination was based on the fact that it could not verify her occupational experience because the business in question \"did not exist or had shut down.\" In addition, the Division noted \"discrepancies in years and schedules of service\" in Mor&#243;n's submitted documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

She claimed that she is Venezuelan and that the 1999-2000 marketing teacher position had been given to a younger, less qualified Puerto Rican. She also claimed that her rejection occurred only after the DOE hired her for the previous three-month contract and thereby learned of her partial disability.

In <i>Thomas,</i> a school board had made two findings regarding the school's nonrenewal of the plaintiff teacher: (1) that the teacher was terminated due to her poor performance and (2) that her disability had no bearing on the school's decision. <i>Id.</i> at 35. The reviewing state agency upheld the finding of poor performance as not arbitrary or capricious, but also found that there was insufficient evidence on which to decide whether there was any disability discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 36-37. The agency then referred the discrimination issue to a state human rights commission. <i>Id.</i> The agency's bifurcated decision was summarily affirmed, without explanation, by the New Hampshire Supreme Court. <i>Id.</i> at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on <i>Thomas</i>'s particularly \"unusual\" circumstances, we denied preclusive effect to the administrative agency's conclusion, affirmed by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, that the teacher's termination was due to her poor performance. <i>Id.</i> at 39-40.

Here, unlike the teacher in <i>Thomas,</i> Mor&#243;n has not pointed to any evidence of discrimination that might sustain her case under a mixed-motive analysis. <i>See Hillstrom v.

Rather, Mor&#243;n must proceed under the burden-shifting framework,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> which requires her to establish that she was qualified for the marketing teacher position and that Bl&#225;zquez was not more qualified than she was. These precise questions, however, have already been expressly determined by both an administrative agency and a reviewing court, and neither these determinations nor those of the EEOC raised any questions of discriminatory intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See Thomas,</i> 150 F.3d at 42 (\"The finding of `sufficient cause' must be viewed in conjunction with the fact that the State Board explicitly chose not to decide whether the School Board . . . impermissibly discriminated against Thomas based upon her voice disability.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, there is simply no reason to depart from the standard rules of issue preclusion in this case.

In her opposition to summary judgment, Mor&#243;n did not specify the causal nexus of her retaliation claim. Nevertheless, the district court concluded that sufficient time passed between Mor&#243;n's filing of the EEOC charge on April 12, 2000, and the DOE's rejection of her application for certification on August 7, 2001, to defeat an inference of causal connection based on temporal proximity. <i>See Calero-Cerezo v.

First, she points to the fact that the DOE first rejected her application for certification on April 5, 2000, a week before she filed the EEOC charge. It is impossible for the DOE to have retaliated against Mor&#243;n before she engaged in protected activity. Next, Mor&#243;n lists a number of instances between April 12, 2000, and November 27, 2000 when she continued to allege discrimination before the EEOC. None of these events suggest that the DOE took any action against her during this time, which might serve as a basis for a retaliation claim. Even so, more than eight months elapsed between the last date in this series of events and the DOE's next action on August 7, 2001, which is still insufficient to establish temporal proximity. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the record before us, we can find no evidence of a causal connection between Mor&#243;n's filing of the EEOC charge and the DOE's failure to certify her as a marketing teacher.
