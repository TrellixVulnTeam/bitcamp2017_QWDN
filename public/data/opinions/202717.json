Olmo-Rodríguez for appellant.\n     Susana I. Peñagarícano-Brown, Assistant Solicitor General,\nDepartment of Justice, with whom Salvador J. Antonetti-Stutts,\nSolicitor General, and Maite D. Oronoz-Rodríguez, Deputy Solicitor\nGeneral, were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                          April 24, 2007\n\n\n\n____________________\n* Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f           DICLERICO, District Judge.         Angelina Ruiz-Rosa brought\n\nsuit against officials of the Puerto Rico prison system and prison\n\nmedical   personnel   after   her   eighteen-year-old    son,   Jose   Luis\n\nMachuca-Ruiz, died of septicemia while being detained at the\n\nBayamón   1072   Correctional    Complex   (“BCC”).     In   her   amended\n\ncomplaint, Ruiz alleged violations of the Fifth, Eighth, and\n\nFourteenth Amendments, actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and\n\nmedical malpractice under Puerto Rico law.            The district court\n\ndismissed her suit as a sanction for failing to comply with its\n\norder to allege her claims as directed, and alternatively, granted\n\nsummary judgment in the defendants’ favor on the federal claim, and\n\ndeclined supplemental jurisdiction as to the malpractice claim,\n\nwhich was dismissed without prejudice.\n\n\n\n                                Background1\n\n           Jose Luis Machuca-Ruiz was incarcerated at BCC beginning\n\non September 19, 2001.     On November 21, 2001, he reported to sick\n\ncall, requesting medical care for a skin infection on his upper\n\nright thigh.     He was evaluated and given topical medication.        The\n\ninfection worsened, and Machuca was seen in the prison’s emergency\n\nroom on December 5 when the attending doctor found a mass in his\n\nupper right thigh area, ordered a complete blood count (“CBC”), and\n\n\n\n     1\n      The facts are taken from the record and are undisputed unless\notherwise stated.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fprescribed    Tylenol.      Another    doctor    examined   Machuca   in   the\n\nemergency room later in the day and noted swollen lymph nodes\n\n(adenopathy), with high fever and pain.             Machuca was discharged\n\nfrom the emergency room early in the morning of December 6 before\n\nthe results of the CBC were available.\n\n           The prison received the results of Machuca’s CBC test\n\nlater in the day on December 6.        The results showed that he had an\n\nelevated   white    blood   count,     including    elevated   readings    for\n\nneutrophils. He was given an antibiotic, which his mother contends\n\nwas not effective to fight the type of infection that he had.              On\n\nDecember 8, Machuca returned to the prison emergency room because\n\nof pain.   The infection site showed signs of worsening, as his leg\n\nwas tender, swollen, and red.         The next day, Machuca was diagnosed\n\nwith cellulitis in his right thigh. On December 10, another doctor\n\nin the prison emergency room diagnosed Machuca with a right thigh\n\nabscess and referred him to the prison infirmary.\n\n           Dr.     Pichardo,    the   prison’s     part-time   surgeon,    was\n\nconsulted about Machuca’s case.         Dr. Pichardo drained the abscess,\n\nordered a culture of the abscess discharge, and ordered a second\n\nantibiotic.      After the surgery, Dr. Pichardo, who worked at the\n\nprison only two days each week, did not do a follow up evaluation.\n\nOn December 12, Machuca began to experience headaches and the wound\n\nsite was secreting pus.        During the night of December 12, Machuca\n\nbegan to experience respiratory problems.           Early in the morning of\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fDecember 13, Machuca was transferred to Bayamón Regional Hospital,\n\nwhere he died the next day.\n\n           Angelina Ruiz-Rosa brought suit on her own behalf and on\n\nbehalf of her deceased son on April 12, 2004.           She alleged federal\n\ncivil rights claims based on violations of the Fifth, Eighth, and\n\nFourteenth   Amendments       and   claims   under   Puerto    Rico   law   of\n\nnegligence and medical malpractice.             Ruiz brought her claims\n\nagainst the Puerto Rico Administrator of Corrections, Victor Rivera\n\nGonzález; the Secretary of the Department of Health, Johnny Rullán;\n\nthe Chief Health Care Coordinator for Puerto Rico, Aida Guzmán-\n\nFont; the Medical Director at BCC, Hector Mena; medical doctors at\n\nBCC, including Rafael Pichardo; unnamed nurses at BCC; the unnamed\n\nSuperintendent of BCC; and unidentified insurance companies.\n\n           The defendants filed a motion to dismiss in July of 2004\n\nand also filed an answer to Ruiz’s complaint.           During the fall of\n\n2004 and the winter of 2005, Ruiz moved to substitute some named\n\nparties for the John Doe defendants and to extend the deadlines for\n\ndiscovery and for identifying other defendants.           With their motion\n\nto dismiss still pending, the defendants moved for summary judgment\n\non March 15, 2005.       On March 21, 2005, the district court denied\n\nthe defendants’ motion to dismiss but found that “the complaint\n\njumbles the allegations pertaining to the constitutional tort with\n\nthose   partaking   of    a    medical   malpractice,    and    imputes     all\n\ndefendants with liability under either legal theory.”             The court\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fordered Ruiz to file an amended complaint, on or before April 18,\n\nto “separate the factual allegations corresponding to each legal\n\ntheory of liability, and . . . also define which defendants are\n\nliable under each of the theories, and for what actions.”       The\n\ncourt also warned Ruiz that failure to file an amended complaint as\n\nordered would result in dismissal of her case.     The court denied\n\nRuiz’s motions to substitute parties and to extend discovery\n\ndeadlines.\n\n          Ruiz filed an amended complaint within the time allowed.\n\nThe amended complaint named several new defendants in place of John\n\nDoe defendants.   Ruiz also moved to dismiss all claims against\n\nVictor Rivera González.   The court dismissed the claims against\n\nRivera and against Hector Mena.    The defendants supplemented their\n\nmotion for summary judgment after the amended complaint was filed,\n\nand Ruiz filed a response.        On February 15, 2006, the court\n\ndismissed the defendants who had been named as John Does but were\n\nthen identified by name in Ruiz’s amended complaint.    On February\n\n28, 2006, the court found that Ruiz’s amended complaint did not\n\ncomply with the order to separate her allegations as to each of her\n\ntheories of liability and as to each defendant and dismissed all of\n\nRuiz’s claims as a sanction for noncompliance.    At the same time,\n\nthe court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on\n\nRuiz’s federal claim and declined supplemental jurisdiction as to\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fher malpractice claim under Puerto Rico law, which was dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n\n\n                                Discussion\n\n           Ruiz appeals the district court’s order that dismissed\n\nher claims as a sanction and alternatively granted summary judgment\n\nin the defendants’ favor on her federal claims.2       She contends that\n\ndismissing her claims as a sanction was inappropriate and that the\n\ndistrict   court   erred   in   granting     summary   judgment   in   the\n\ndefendants’ favor on her federal claim.       The remaining defendants,\n\nJohnny Rullán, Aida Guzmán-Font, and Rafael Pichardo, defend the\n\ndistrict court’s decision to dismiss Ruiz’s claims as a sanction\n\nand argue that summary judgment was properly granted.3\n\n\n\n     2\n      Ruiz does not appeal the district court’s decisions denying\nRuiz’s motions to substitute named defendants for the John Doe\ndefendants and dismissing additional defendants named in the\namended complaint.    Ruiz also does not challenge the district\ncourt’s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction over her\nmalpractice claim.\n     3\n      The defendants also argue that sovereign immunity provided by\nthe Eleventh Amendment bars Ruiz’s claims against them, which is a\ntheory that the district court rejected. The defendants did not\nfile a cross appeal to address this issue.       To the extent the\nEleventh Amendment implicates the court’s jurisdiction, see Hudson\nSavings Bank v. Austin, --- F.3d ---, 2007 WL 642007, at *5 (1st\nCir. Mar. 5, 2007) (noting issue of whether Eleventh Amendment is\njurisdictional doctrine is unresolved), which the court is required\nto consider sua sponte, see Doyle v. Huntress, Inc., 419 F.3d 3, 6\n(1st Cir. 2005), we are satisfied that the Eleventh Amendment does\nnot provide immunity to the defendants here, who were sued in their\nindividual capacities, see Dasey v. Anderson, 304 F.3d 148, 153\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                   -6-\n\fA.   Dismissal as Sanction\n\n             In response to a defendant’s motion, a court may dismiss\n\nan action “[f]or failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply\n\nwith . . . any order of court.”              Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).       A\n\ndismissal entered to sanction a party for failure to comply with a\n\ncourt’s order or for failure to prosecute the case is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion.     Malot v. Dorado Beach Cottages Assocs., ---\n\nF.3d ---, 2007 WL 549110, at *3 (1st Cir. Feb. 23, 2007).                 In\n\ndetermining whether an abuse of discretion has occurred, “we must\n\nfairly balance the court’s venerable authority over case management\n\nwith   the    larger   concerns   of    justice,   including   the    strong\n\npresumption in favor of deciding cases on the merits.”          Id.\n\n             Dismissal with prejudice, along with contempt, are the\n\nmost severe penalties that may be ordered against a recalcitrant\n\nparty.   Benitez-Garcia v. Gonzalez-Vega, 468 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2006). We therefore reserve dismissal with prejudice for egregious\n\nmisconduct that is measured by considering all aspects of the case,\n\nincluding “‘the severity of the violation, the legitimacy of the\n\nparty’s excuse, repetition of violations, the deliberateness vel\n\nnon of the misconduct, mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other\n\nside and to the operations of the court, and the adequacy of lesser\n\nsanctions.’”    Id. at 5 (quoting Robson v. Hallenbeck, 81 F.3d 1, 2-\n\n3 (1st Cir. 1996)). In addition, procedural fairness mandates that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthe   plaintiff    be   afforded     an    opportunity    to   explain     her\n\nnoncompliance or to advocate for a lesser sanction.            Id. at 7.\n\n          In this case, the district court found Ruiz’s original\n\ncomplaint wanting, but instead of dismissing her claims, the court\n\ngranted her an opportunity to file a more clearly stated complaint.\n\nRuiz filed an amended complaint within the time the court allowed.\n\nAs directed, Ruiz separated her claims into separate causes of\n\naction, alleging deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\n\nunder federal law as her first claim and medical malpractice under\n\nPuerto Rico law as her second claim.            Ruiz alleged particular\n\nactions and conduct by each defendant, including the newly named\n\ndefendants, in support of her federal claim.           For her malpractice\n\nclaim, however, Ruiz adopted by reference all of the allegations\n\nmade in support of the federal claim and stated that those “acts\n\nand omissions, also amount to gross negligence and/or fault under\n\nPuerto Rico” law.\n\n          The     district   court    found   Ruiz’s     amended   complaint\n\ndeficient, concluding that she “utterly failed to comply with our\n\nOrder of March 21, 2005.”      In particular, the court faulted Ruiz\n\nfor “once again jumbl[ing] the allegations pertaining to the\n\nconstitutional violation based on denial of medical care with those\n\nwhich would sustain a tort for medical malpractice, and unabashedly\n\nreassert[ing] that all defendants are liable under both legal\n\ntheories.”   The court also found it unacceptable that Ruiz adopted\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fby reference all of the facts alleged in support of her federal\n\nclaim to support her malpractice claim.4       The court concluded that\n\nRuiz’s medical malpractice claim against the defendants who were\n\nalleged to have “purely administrative deficiencies” was “patently\n\nfrivolous.”\n\n            To satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), a\n\nplaintiff must allege claims in a way that gives the defendants\n\nfair notice of what the claims are and the grounds for those\n\nclaims.   Calvi v. Knox County, 470 F.3d 422, 430 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nThe complaint “must ‘at least set forth minimal facts as to who did\n\nwhat to whom, when, where, and why.’” Id. (quoting Educadores\n\nPuertorriquenos en Accion v. Hernandez, 367 F.3d 61, 66 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)). Civil rights cases do not impose a heightened pleading\n\nstandard.     Asociación   De   Suscripción   Conjunta   Del   Deguro   De\n\nResponsabilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza, --- F.3d ---, 2007\n\nWL 613719, at *17 (1st Cir. Mar. 1, 2007).\n\n            The defendants’ counsel conceded at oral argument that\n\nRuiz’s amended complaint put the defendants on notice of what her\n\nclaims were and the grounds for those claims and agreed that the\n\n\n     4\n      The reason for the district court’s aversion to Ruiz’s\nadoption of allegations by reference is not clear. Because that is\na commonly-used pleading shortcut, that procedure, standing alone,\ncannot be a basis for the court’s sanction.       See, e.g., Mass.\nNurses Ass’n v. N. Adams Reg’l, 467 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2006);\nGulf Coast Bank & Trust Co. v. Reder, 355 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir.\n2004); In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 14 (1st\nCir. 2003); Conway Chevrolet Buick, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,\n136 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                    -9-\n\famended complaint satisfied the requirements of notice pleading.\n\nThe defendants’ counsel argued, however, that the district court’s\n\nsanction was within its discretion because Ruiz’s amended complaint\n\ndid not meet the more exacting requirements set forth in the\n\ndistrict court’s order.    We disagree.\n\n           In its March 21 order, the district court required more\n\nthan is necessary to satisfy the notice pleading standard of the\n\nfederal rules.   The district court then dismissed Ruiz’s claims as\n\na sanction for failing to comply with the court-imposed standard.\n\nIt is far from clear that Ruiz failed to comply with the court’s\n\norder, much less that any deficiency in the amended complaint was\n\na sufficient basis to support the harsh sanction of dismissal.5\n\nThe court’s decision to dismiss the complaint as a sanction was an\n\nabuse of discretion.      We turn to the alternative basis for the\n\ndistrict court’s decision, summary judgment.\n\n\n\nB.   Summary Judgment\n\n           On appeal, we review summary judgment de novo, employing\n\nthe same standard that governed consideration of the motion below.\n\nSee Salem Hosp. v. Mass. Nurses Ass’n, 449 F.3d 234, 237 (1st Cir.\n\n\n      5\n      To the extent the district court dismissed Ruiz’s claims as\nfrivolous or for failing to state a cause of action, as opposed to\nimposing dismissal as a sanction, that result is also disfavored\nand would not have been appropriate here. See, e.g., Cepero-Rivera\nv. Fagundo, 414 F.3d 124, 130 (1st Cir. 2005); Chute v. Walker, 281\nF.3d 314, 319 (1st Cir. 2002); Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States,\n257 F.3d 31, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                 -10-\n\f2006).     We therefore examine all of the material facts of record\n\nand resolve all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving\n\nparty.    N.H. Ins. Co. v. Dagnone, 475 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate when the properly supported facts\n\nof record “show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.”        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n              The district court granted the defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment on Ruiz’s federal claims and declined supplemental\n\njurisdiction     over    her   malpractice   claim,   which   was   dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice.        In doing so, the court noted that Machuca’s\n\nillness was a serious medical need but agreed with the defendants\n\nthat evidence was lacking to support the deliberate indifference\n\nprong    of   Ruiz’s    federal   claim.   Ruiz   argues   that   she   alleged\n\nsufficient facts to allow a jury to conclude that the defendants\n\nwere deliberately indifferent to her son’s serious medical needs\n\nand, to a lesser extent, contends that record facts support her\n\nclaim.\n\n              Because Ruiz’s son, Machuca, was a pretrial detainee\n\nrather than a convicted inmate, the Fourteenth Amendment governs\n\nhis claim.      Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides at least as much protection for\n\npretrial detainees as the Eighth Amendment provides for convicted\n\ninmates.      Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983).\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fGenerally, the standard applied under the Fourteenth Amendment is\n\nthe same as the Eighth Amendment standard.6              Burrell v. Hampshire\n\nCounty, 307 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            For     medical     treatment     in   prison     to        offend   the\n\nConstitution,       the     care   “must     involve     ‘acts     or     omissions\n\nsufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious\n\nmedical needs.’”      Feeney v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 464 F.3d 158,\n\n161 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 105-06\n\n(1976)).    Deliberate indifference in this context may be shown by\n\nthe denial of needed care as punishment and by decisions about\n\nmedical care made recklessly with “actual knowledge of impending\n\nharm, easily preventable.”          Id. at 162 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).       Deliberate indifference means that “a prison official\n\nsubjectively ‘must both be aware of facts from which the inference\n\ncould be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and\n\nhe must also draw the inference.’”           Burrell, 307 F.3d at 8 (quoting\n\nFarmer     v.    Brennan,    511   U.S.    825,    837   (1994)).        Therefore,\n\nsubstandard care, malpractice, negligence, inadvertent failure to\n\nprovide care, and disagreement as to the appropriate course of\n\ntreatment are all insufficient to prove a constitutional violation.\n\nFeeney, 464 F.3d at 161-62.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      The parties and the district court considered the claim under\nthe Eighth Amendment.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            Ruiz primarily relies on the allegations in her complaint\n\nto oppose summary judgment, and such reliance does not satisfy the\n\nRule 56 standard.      In contrast, the defendants cite to the medical\n\nrecord, deposition testimony, and their declarations submitted in\n\nsupport of the motion for summary judgment.               See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).    A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary\n\njudgment must present competent evidence of record that shows a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.        See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\n\nU.S. 242, 256 (1986). Allegations made in a plaintiff’s complaint,\n\nstanding alone, are not enough to oppose a properly supported\n\nmotion for summary judgment.          Velazquez-Garcia v. Horizon Lines of\n\nP.R., Inc., 473 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            As     presented,   the    record       provides    no   evidence    of\n\ndeliberate indifference on the part of any of the defendants.\n\nRuiz’s    expert    witness,    Dr.    Carlos   Eduardo        Ramirez   Gonzalez,\n\ncriticized the care Machuca received, stating that he was given\n\nineffective antibiotics, that doses of the antibiotics which were\n\nprescribed were missed, that the staff failed to keep adequate\n\nmedical   records,     and   that     the   staff    failed     to   respond    when\n\nMachuca’s condition worsened. Dr. Ramirez stated that in his\n\nopinion the prison medical staff was indifferent to Machuca’s need\n\nfor care because they saw that his condition was deteriorating but\n\nfailed to take any action.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f             The record establishes that Dr. Pichardo treated Machuca\n\nby draining the abscess, ordering a culture, and prescribing a\n\nsecond antibiotic.      Although Ruiz disagrees with the treatment Dr.\n\nPichardo provided, Dr. Ramirez’s opinion does not provide evidence\n\nthat Dr. Pichardo was aware that the antibiotic he prescribed was\n\nineffective and would pose a substantial risk of harm to Machuca.\n\nRuiz also faults Dr. Pichardo for failing to monitor Machuca’s\n\ncondition after he treated him.           The record shows, however, that\n\nDr. Pichardo only worked at the prison two days each week.                Ruiz\n\nprovides no evidence that Dr. Pichardo was aware that his failure\n\nto monitor Machuca after treating him would subject Machuca to a\n\nsubstantial risk of harm.\n\n             Ruiz has shown only that her expert witness disagrees\n\nwith   Dr.   Pichardo’s   choice     of    antibiotic   and    the   course   of\n\ntreatment    Dr.   Pichardo    provided,     which   might    be   evidence   of\n\nmalpractice (a matter on which we express no opinion), but is\n\ninsufficient to show deliberate indifference. See Feeney, 464 F.3d\n\nat 162-63.      In addition, Ruiz, the party with the burden of proof,\n\ncannot rely on speculation or conjecture and must present “more\n\nthan a mere scintilla of evidence in [her] favor.”             Invest Almaz v.\n\nTemple-Inland Forest Prods. Corp., 243 F.3d 57, 76 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n             Ruiz argues that Dr. Rullán, who was Secretary of the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Health, and Dr. Guzmán, who was Chief\n\nHealth   Care    Coordinator   for   the    Correctional      Health   Services\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fProgram, knew of the substandard medical treatment provided at BCC\n\nand failed to remedy the problem. Specifically, Ruiz contends that\n\nDr. Rullán and Dr. Guzmán knew that failing to treat sepsis\n\nproperly with antibiotics puts patients’ lives at risk and that the\n\npractice of having a surgeon available only two days each week puts\n\npatients’ lives at risk.            She further contends that the risk of\n\nharm   from    inadequate      medical    treatment    at   BCC   was    obvious.\n\nAlthough Ruiz alleges that Dr. Rullán and Dr. Guzmán knew of these\n\npractices and their consequences, she provided no evidence of such\n\nknowledge.\n\n              While    proof   of     deliberate    indifference    by     prison\n\nofficials does not require evidence that the officials were aware\n\nof the risk of a specific harm, the plaintiff must show that the\n\nofficials had “knowledge of facts from which the official[s] can\n\ndraw the inference that a substantial risk of serious harm exists.”\n\nCalderon-Ortiz v. Laboy-Alvarado, 300 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nIn some circumstances, “a fact-finder may conclude that a prison\n\nofficial knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the\n\nrisk was obvious.”        Burrell, 307 F.3d at 8.           The risk, however,\n\nmust   have    been    obvious   to    the     particular   officials    who   are\n\ndefendants.      Id.\n\n              The record establishes that Dr. Guzmán was appointed by\n\nthe federal court in Puerto Rico to coordinate compliance with the\n\nMedical Health Care Plan and the Mental Health Plan in the Puerto\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fRico prison system.         She had no involvement with medical care for\n\nindividual inmates at BCC and knew nothing about Machuca’s case\n\nuntil Ruiz filed suit.        As Secretary of Health in Puerto Rico, Dr.\n\nRullán had no involvement in the medical treatment provided to\n\nMachuca “or any other patient.”          He did not supervise the medical\n\nstaff at BCC.          Like Dr. Guzmán,       Dr. Rullán became aware of\n\nMachuca’s case only after Ruiz filed suit.              Nothing in the record\n\nshows or even suggests that either Dr. Guzmán or Dr. Rullán knew of\n\ninadequate medical care at BCC, or that an inadequacy, which would\n\npermit the inference that inmates were at substantial risk of\n\nserious harm, was obvious.7        Therefore, no factual issue exists to\n\navoid summary judgment on whether Dr. Guzmán and Dr. Rullán were\n\ndeliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm to Machuca.\n\n\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n           The district court abused its discretion in dismissing\n\nRuiz’s   claims   as    a   sanction   for    failing   to   comply   with   the\n\nheightened pleading standard imposed by the court’s order.              In the\n\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact on the question of the\n\ndefendants’ deliberate indifference to Machuca’s serious medical\n\nneeds, however, summary judgment was appropriately granted in the\n\ndefendants’ favor on Ruiz’s federal claim.              Ruiz does not appeal\n\n\n     7\n      Indeed, Ruiz concedes as much, stating in her brief that\n“there is not much in the record regarding defendants’ knowledge of\nthe risks of harm that existed at [BCC].”\n\n                                       -16-\n\fthe   district    court’s   decision     not   to    exercise   supplemental\n\njurisdiction over her malpractice claim.            Therefore, that part of\n\nthe district court’s decision that dismissed Ruiz’s claim as a\n\nsanction   is    harmless   error.8      The   district   court’s   decision\n\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the federal\n\nclaim and declining supplemental jurisdiction over the malpractice\n\nclaim, which was dismissed without prejudice, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n      In addition, although the district court ordered that\njudgment enter dismissing the complaint as a sanction for failing\nto comply with the court’s previous order, the judgment entered the\nsame day dismissed the federal claims, with prejudice, and\ndismissed the tort claims under Puerto Rico law without prejudice.\n\n                                      -17-\n\f",

In her amended complaint, Ruiz alleged violations of the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, actionable under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and medical malpractice under Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed her suit as a sanction for failing to comply with its order to allege her claims as directed, and alternatively, granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor on the federal claim, and declined supplemental jurisdiction as to the malpractice claim, which was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n      <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jose Luis Machuca-Ruiz was incarcerated at BCC beginning on September 19, 2001. On November 21, 2001, he reported to sick call, requesting medical care for a skin infection on his upper right thigh. He was evaluated and given topical medication. The infection worsened, and Machuca was seen in the prison's emergency room on December 5 when the attending doctor found a mass in his upper right thigh area, ordered a complete blood count (\"CBC\"), and prescribed Tylenol. Another doctor examined Machuca in the emergency room later in the day and noted swollen lymph nodes (adenopathy), with high fever and pain. Machuca was discharged from the emergency room early in the morning of December 6 before the results of the CBC were available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prison received the results of Machuca's CBC test later in the day on December 6. The results showed that he had an elevated white blood count, including elevated readings for neutrophils. He was given an antibiotic, which his mother contends was not effective to fight the type of infection that he had. On December 8, Machuca returned to the prison emergency room because of pain. The infection site showed signs of worsening, as his leg was tender, swollen, and red. The next day, Machuca was diagnosed with cellulitis in his right thigh. On December 10, another doctor in the prison emergency room diagnosed Machuca with a right thigh abscess and referred him to the prison infirmary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Pichardo, the prison's part-time surgeon, was consulted about Machuca's case. Dr. Pichardo drained the abscess, ordered a culture of the abscess discharge, and ordered a second antibiotic. After the surgery, Dr. Pichardo, who worked at the prison only two days each week, did not do a follow up evaluation. On December 12, Machuca began to experience headaches and the wound site was secreting pus. During the night of December 12, Machuca began to experience respiratory problems. Early in the morning of December 13, Machuca was transferred to Bayam&#243;n Regional Hospital, where he died the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Angelina Ruiz-Rosa brought suit on her own behalf and on behalf of her deceased son on April 12, 2004. She alleged federal civil rights claims based on violations of the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and claims under Puerto Rico law of negligence and medical malpractice. Ruiz brought her claims against the Puerto Rico Administrator of Corrections, Victor Rivera Gonz&#225;lez; the Secretary of the Department of Health, Johnny Rull&#225;n; the Chief Health Care Coordinator for Puerto Rico, Aida Guzm&#225;n-Font; the Medical Director at BCC, Hector Mena; medical doctors at BCC, including Rafael Pichardo; unnamed nurses at BCC; the unnamed Superintendent of BCC; and unidentified insurance companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss in July of 2004 and also filed an answer to Ruiz's complaint. During the fall of 2004 and the winter of 2005, Ruiz moved to substitute some named parties for the John Doe defendants and to extend the deadlines for discovery and for identifying other defendants. With their motion to dismiss still pending, the defendants moved for summary judgment on March 15, 2005. On March 21, 2005, the district court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss but found that \"the complaint jumbles the allegations pertaining to the constitutional tort with those partaking of a medical malpractice, and imputes all defendants with liability under either legal theory.\" The court ordered Ruiz to file an amended complaint, on or before April 18, to \"separate the factual allegations corresponding to each legal theory of liability, and ... also define which defendants are liable under each of the theories, and for what actions.\" The court also warned Ruiz that failure to file an amended complaint as ordered would result in dismissal of her case.

The amended complaint named several new defendants in place of John Doe defendants. Ruiz also moved to dismiss all claims against Victor Rivera Gonz&#225;lez. The court dismissed the claims against Rivera and against Hector Mena. The defendants supplemented their motion for summary judgment after the amended complaint was filed, and Ruiz filed a response. On February 15, 2006, the court dismissed the defendants who had been named as John Does but were then identified by name in Ruiz's amended complaint. On February 28, 2006, the court found that Ruiz's amended complaint did not comply with the order to separate her allegations as to each of her theories of liability and as to each defendant and dismissed all of Ruiz's claims as a sanction for noncompliance. At the same time, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on Ruiz's federal claim and declined supplemental jurisdiction as to her malpractice claim under Puerto Rico law, which was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Discussion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruiz appeals the district court's order that dismissed her claims as a sanction and alternatively granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor on her federal claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She contends that dismissing her claims as a sanction was inappropriate and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in the defendants' favor on her federal claim. The remaining defendants, Johnny Rull&#225;n, Aida Guzm&#225;n-Font, and Rafael Pichardo, defend the district court's decision to dismiss Ruiz's claims as a sanction and argue that summary judgment was properly granted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Dismissal as Sanction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to a defendant's motion, a court may dismiss an action \"[f]or failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with ... any order of court.\" Fed.

Dorado Beach Cottages Assocs.,</i> 478 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.2007). In determining whether an abuse of discretion has occurred, \"we must fairly balance the court's venerable authority over case management with the larger concerns of justice, including the strong presumption in favor of deciding cases on the merits.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismissal with prejudice, along with contempt, are the most severe penalties that may be ordered against a recalcitrant party. <i>Benitez-Garcia v.

We therefore reserve dismissal with prejudice for egregious misconduct that is measured by considering all aspects of the case, including \"`the severity of the violation, the legitimacy of the party's excuse, repetition of violations, the deliberateness vel non of the misconduct, mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other side and to the operations of the court, and the adequacy of lesser sanctions.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 5 (quoting <i>Robson v.

Ruiz filed an amended complaint within the time the court allowed. As directed, Ruiz separated her claims into separate causes of action, alleging deliberate indifference to serious medical needs under federal law as her first claim and medical malpractice under Puerto Rico law as her second claim. Ruiz alleged particular actions and conduct by each defendant, including the newly named defendants, in support of her federal claim. For her malpractice claim, however, Ruiz adopted by reference all of the allegations made in support of the federal claim and stated that those \"acts and omissions, also amount to gross negligence and/or fault under Puerto Rico\" law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found Ruiz's amended complaint deficient, concluding that she \"utterly failed to comply with our Order of March 21, 2005.\" In particular, the court faulted Ruiz for \"once again jumbl[ing] the allegations pertaining to the constitutional violation based on denial of medical care with those which would sustain a tort for medical malpractice, and unabashedly reassert[ing] that all defendants are liable under both legal theories.\" The court also found it unacceptable that Ruiz adopted by reference all of the facts alleged in support of her federal claim to support her malpractice claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court concluded that Ruiz's medical malpractice claim against the defendants who were alleged to have \"purely administrative deficiencies\" was \"patently frivolous.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), a plaintiff must allege claims in a way that gives the defendants fair notice of what the claims are and the grounds for those claims. <i>Calvi v.

The complaint \"must `at least set forth minimal facts as to who did what to whom, when, where, and why.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Educadores Puertorriquenos en Accion v.

The defendants' counsel argued, however, that the district court's sanction was within its discretion because Ruiz's amended complaint did not meet the more exacting requirements set forth in the district court's order.

The district court then dismissed Ruiz's claims as a sanction for failing to comply with the court-imposed standard. It is far from clear that Ruiz failed to comply with the court's order, much less that any deficiency in the amended complaint was a sufficient basis to support the harsh sanction of dismissal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The court's decision to dismiss the complaint as a sanction was an abuse of discretion.

In doing so, the court noted that Machuca's illness was a serious medical need but agreed with the defendants that evidence was lacking to support the deliberate indifference prong of Ruiz's federal claim. Ruiz argues that she alleged sufficient facts to allow a jury to conclude that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to her son's serious medical needs and, to a lesser extent, contends that record facts support her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Ruiz's son, Machuca, was a pretrial detainee rather than a convicted inmate, the Fourteenth Amendment governs his claim. <i>Surprenant v.

Deliberate indifference in this context may be shown by the denial of needed care as punishment and by decisions about medical care made recklessly with \"actual knowledge of impending harm, easily preventable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 162 (internal quotation marks omitted). Deliberate indifference means that \"a prison official subjectively `must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.'\" <i>Burrell,</i> 307 F.3d at 8 (quoting <i>Farmer v.

Therefore, substandard care, malpractice, negligence, inadvertent failure to provide care, and disagreement as to the appropriate course of treatment are all insufficient to prove a constitutional violation. <i>Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 161-62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruiz primarily relies on the allegations in her complaint to oppose summary judgment, and such reliance does not satisfy the Rule 56 standard. In contrast, the defendants cite to the medical record, deposition testimony, and their declarations submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment must present competent evidence of record that shows a genuine issue for trial. <i>See Anderson v.

Ruiz's expert witness, Dr. Carlos Eduardo Ramirez Gonzalez, criticized the care Machuca received, stating that he was given ineffective antibiotics, that doses of the antibiotics which were prescribed were missed, that the staff failed to keep adequate medical records, and that the staff failed to respond when Machuca's condition worsened. Dr. Ramirez stated that in his opinion the prison medical staff was indifferent to Machuca's need for care because they saw that his condition was deteriorating but failed to take any action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record establishes that Dr. Pichardo treated Machuca by draining the abscess, ordering a culture, and prescribing a second antibiotic. Although Ruiz disagrees with the treatment Dr. Pichardo provided, Dr. Ramirez's opinion does not provide evidence that Dr. Pichardo was aware that the antibiotic he prescribed was ineffective and would pose a substantial risk of harm to Machuca. Ruiz also faults Dr. Pichardo for failing to monitor Machuca's condition after he treated him. The record shows, however, that Dr. Pichardo only worked at the prison two days each week. Ruiz provides no evidence that Dr. Pichardo was aware that his failure to monitor Machuca after treating him would subject Machuca to a substantial risk of harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruiz has shown only that her expert witness disagrees with Dr. Pichardo's choice of antibiotic and the course of treatment Dr. Pichardo provided, which might be evidence of malpractice (a matter on which we express no opinion), but is insufficient to show deliberate indifference. <i>See Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 162-63. In addition, Ruiz, the party with the burden of proof, cannot rely on speculation or conjecture and must present \"more than a mere scintilla of evidence in [her] favor.\" <i>Invest Almaz v. Temple-Inland Forest Prods.

Specifically, Ruiz contends that Dr. Rull&#225;n and Dr. Guzm&#225;n knew that failing to treat sepsis properly with antibiotics puts patients' lives at risk and that the practice of having a surgeon available only two days each week puts patients' lives at risk. She further contends that the risk of harm from inadequate medical treatment at BCC was obvious. Although Ruiz alleges that Dr. Rull&#225;n and Dr. Guzm&#225;n knew of these practices and their consequences, she provided no evidence of such knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While proof of deliberate indifference by prison officials does not require evidence that the officials were aware of the risk of a specific harm, the plaintiff must show that the officials had \"knowledge of facts from which the official[s] can draw the inference that a substantial risk of serious harm exists.\" <i>Calderon-Ortiz v. Laboy-Alvarado,</i> 300 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 2002). In some circumstances, \"a fact-finder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.\" <i>Burrell,</i> 307 F.3d at 8. The risk, however, must have been obvious to the particular officials who are defendants. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record establishes that Dr. Guzm&#225;n was appointed by the federal court in Puerto Rico to coordinate compliance with the Medical Health Care Plan and the Mental Health Plan in the Puerto Rico prison system. She had no involvement with medical care for individual inmates at BCC and knew nothing about Machuca's case until Ruiz filed suit. As Secretary of Health in Puerto Rico, Dr. Rull&#225;n had no involvement in the medical treatment provided to Machuca \"or any other patient.\" He did not supervise the medical staff at BCC. Like Dr. Guzm&#225;n, Dr. Rull&#225;n became aware of Machuca's case only after Ruiz filed suit. Nothing in the record shows or even suggests that either Dr. Guzm&#225;n or Dr. Rull&#225;n knew of inadequate medical care at BCC, or that an inadequacy, which would permit the inference that inmates were at substantial risk of serious harm, was obvious.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Therefore, no factual issue exists to avoid summary judgment on whether Dr. Guzm&#225;n and Dr. Rull&#225;n were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm to Machuca.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court abused its discretion in dismissing Ruiz's claims as a sanction for failing to comply with the heightened pleading standard imposed by the court's order. In the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the question of the defendants' deliberate indifference to Machuca's serious medical needs, however, summary judgment was appropriately granted in the defendants' favor on Ruiz's federal claim. Ruiz does not appeal the district court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her malpractice claim. Therefore, that part of the district court's decision that dismissed Ruiz's claim as a sanction is harmless error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The district court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the federal claim and declining supplemental jurisdiction over the malpractice claim, which was dismissed without prejudice, is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The facts are taken from the record and are undisputed unless otherwise stated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Ruiz does not appeal the district court's decisions denying Ruiz's motions to substitute named defendants for the John Doe defendants and dismissing additional defendants named in the amended complaint.

In her amended complaint, Ruiz alleged violations of the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, actionable under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and medical malpractice under Puerto Rico law. The district court dismissed her suit as a sanction for failing to comply with its order to allege her claims as directed, and alternatively, granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor on the federal claim, and declined supplemental jurisdiction as to the malpractice claim, which was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n      <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jose Luis Machuca-Ruiz was incarcerated at BCC beginning on September 19, 2001. On November 21, 2001, he reported to sick call, requesting medical care for a skin infection on his upper right thigh. He was evaluated and given topical medication. The infection worsened, and Machuca was seen in the prison's emergency room on December 5 when the attending doctor found a mass in his upper right thigh area, ordered a complete blood count (\"CBC\"), and prescribed Tylenol. Another doctor examined Machuca in the emergency room later in the day and noted swollen lymph nodes (adenopathy), with high fever and pain. Machuca was discharged from the emergency room early in the morning of December 6 before the results of the CBC were available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prison received the results of Machuca's CBC test later in the day on December 6. The results showed that he had an elevated white blood count, including elevated readings for neutrophils. He was given an antibiotic, which his mother contends was not effective to fight the type of infection that he had. On December 8, Machuca returned to the prison emergency room because of pain. The infection site showed signs of worsening, as his leg was tender, swollen, and red. The next day, Machuca was diagnosed with cellulitis in his right thigh. On December 10, another doctor in the prison emergency room diagnosed Machuca with a right thigh abscess and referred him to the prison infirmary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Pichardo, the prison's part-time surgeon, was consulted about Machuca's case. Dr. Pichardo drained the abscess, ordered a culture of the abscess discharge, and ordered a second antibiotic. After the surgery, Dr. Pichardo, who worked at the prison only two days each week, did not do a follow up evaluation. On December 12, Machuca began to experience headaches and the wound site was secreting pus. During the night of December 12, Machuca began to experience respiratory problems.

With their motion to dismiss still pending, the defendants moved for summary judgment on March 15, 2005. On March 21, 2005, the district court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss but found that \"the complaint jumbles the allegations pertaining to the constitutional tort with those partaking of a medical malpractice, and imputes all defendants with liability under either legal theory.\" The court ordered Ruiz to file an amended complaint, on or before April 18, to \"separate the factual allegations corresponding to each legal theory of liability, and ... also define which defendants are liable under each of the theories, and for what actions.\" The court also warned Ruiz that failure to file an amended complaint as ordered would result in dismissal of her case.

The court dismissed the claims against Rivera and against Hector Mena. The defendants supplemented their motion for summary judgment after the amended complaint was filed, and Ruiz filed a response. On February 15, 2006, the court dismissed the defendants who had been named as John Does but were then identified by name in Ruiz's amended complaint. On February 28, 2006, the court found that Ruiz's amended complaint did not comply with the order to separate her allegations as to each of her theories of liability and as to each defendant and dismissed all of Ruiz's claims as a sanction for noncompliance.

In doing so, the court noted that Machuca's illness was a serious medical need but agreed with the defendants that evidence was lacking to support the deliberate indifference prong of Ruiz's federal claim. Ruiz argues that she alleged sufficient facts to allow a jury to conclude that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to her son's serious medical needs and, to a lesser extent, contends that record facts support her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Ruiz's son, Machuca, was a pretrial detainee rather than a convicted inmate, the Fourteenth Amendment governs his claim. <i>Surprenant v.

Ruiz's expert witness, Dr. Carlos Eduardo Ramirez Gonzalez, criticized the care Machuca received, stating that he was given ineffective antibiotics, that doses of the antibiotics which were prescribed were missed, that the staff failed to keep adequate medical records, and that the staff failed to respond when Machuca's condition worsened. Dr. Ramirez stated that in his opinion the prison medical staff was indifferent to Machuca's need for care because they saw that his condition was deteriorating but failed to take any action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record establishes that Dr. Pichardo treated Machuca by draining the abscess, ordering a culture, and prescribing a second antibiotic. Although Ruiz disagrees with the treatment Dr. Pichardo provided, Dr. Ramirez's opinion does not provide evidence that Dr. Pichardo was aware that the antibiotic he prescribed was ineffective and would pose a substantial risk of harm to Machuca. Ruiz also faults Dr. Pichardo for failing to monitor Machuca's condition after he treated him. The record shows, however, that Dr. Pichardo only worked at the prison two days each week. Ruiz provides no evidence that Dr. Pichardo was aware that his failure to monitor Machuca after treating him would subject Machuca to a substantial risk of harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruiz has shown only that her expert witness disagrees with Dr. Pichardo's choice of antibiotic and the course of treatment Dr. Pichardo provided, which might be evidence of malpractice (a matter on which we express no opinion), but is insufficient to show deliberate indifference. <i>See Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 162-63. In addition, Ruiz, the party with the burden of proof, cannot rely on speculation or conjecture and must present \"more than a mere scintilla of evidence in [her] favor.\" <i>Invest Almaz v.

Specifically, Ruiz contends that Dr. Rull&#225;n and Dr. Guzm&#225;n knew that failing to treat sepsis properly with antibiotics puts patients' lives at risk and that the practice of having a surgeon available only two days each week puts patients' lives at risk. She further contends that the risk of harm from inadequate medical treatment at BCC was obvious. Although Ruiz alleges that Dr. Rull&#225;n and Dr. Guzm&#225;n knew of these practices and their consequences, she provided no evidence of such knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While proof of deliberate indifference by prison officials does not require evidence that the officials were aware of the risk of a specific harm, the plaintiff must show that the officials had \"knowledge of facts from which the official[s] can draw the inference that a substantial risk of serious harm exists.\" <i>Calderon-Ortiz v.

In some circumstances, \"a fact-finder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.\" <i>Burrell,</i> 307 F.3d at 8. The risk, however, must have been obvious to the particular officials who are defendants. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record establishes that Dr. Guzm&#225;n was appointed by the federal court in Puerto Rico to coordinate compliance with the Medical Health Care Plan and the Mental Health Plan in the Puerto Rico prison system. She had no involvement with medical care for individual inmates at BCC and knew nothing about Machuca's case until Ruiz filed suit. As Secretary of Health in Puerto Rico, Dr. Rull&#225;n had no involvement in the medical treatment provided to Machuca \"or any other patient.\" He did not supervise the medical staff at BCC. Like Dr. Guzm&#225;n, Dr. Rull&#225;n became aware of Machuca's case only after Ruiz filed suit. Nothing in the record shows or even suggests that either Dr. Guzm&#225;n or Dr. Rull&#225;n knew of inadequate medical care at BCC, or that an inadequacy, which would permit the inference that inmates were at substantial risk of serious harm, was obvious.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Therefore, no factual issue exists to avoid summary judgment on whether Dr. Guzm&#225;n and Dr. Rull&#225;n were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm to Machuca.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court abused its discretion in dismissing Ruiz's claims as a sanction for failing to comply with the heightened pleading standard imposed by the court's order. In the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the question of the defendants' deliberate indifference to Machuca's serious medical needs, however, summary judgment was appropriately granted in the defendants' favor on Ruiz's federal claim. Ruiz does not appeal the district court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her malpractice claim. Therefore, that part of the district court's decision that dismissed Ruiz's claim as a sanction is harmless error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The district court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the federal claim and declining supplemental jurisdiction over the malpractice claim, which was dismissed without prejudice, is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The facts are taken from the record and are undisputed unless otherwise stated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Ruiz does not appeal the district court's decisions denying Ruiz's motions to substitute named defendants for the John Doe defendants and dismissing additional defendants named in the amended complaint.
