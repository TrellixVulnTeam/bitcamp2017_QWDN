Raymond L. Acosta, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     James M. Fox for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH. S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 10, 2002\n\f          STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge. A jury convicted petitioner\n\nJulio Ramirez-Burgos of aiding and abetting two carjackings in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2 and § 2119, and of using a weapon during\n\nthe commission of a violent crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c).   Although Count One of the superseding indictment charged\n\nRamirez with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2119(2), the trial court did not\n\ninstruct the jury to determine whether the victim of the carjacking\n\nsuffered serious bodily injury as a result of the carjacking.\n\nRamirez appeals the district court's denial of his § 2255 petition,\n\nin which he claimed that his sentence must be vacated because the\n\nSupreme Court's ruling in Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227\n\n(1999), requires that the jury determine the element of serious\n\nbodily injury.   We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          We review this case for the fourth time.1      In 1995 a\n\nfederal grand jury indicted Ramirez and Daniel Montañez-Rosa2 on\n\ntwo counts of aiding and abetting each other in two carjackings, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2 and 2119, and on one count of using a firearm during\n\nthe commission of a violent crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).         The\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The factual details of the two carjackings and rape are set\nforth in United States v. Ramirez-Burgos, No. 96-1298, 1997 WL\n268695 (1st Cir. May 21, 1997).\n     2\n      Montañez pled guilty before trial and cooperated with the\nprosecution.\n\n                                -2-\n\fdefendants were charged under the 1992 version of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n21193, which provided, in relevant part:\n\n          Whoever, possessing a firearm as defined in\n          section 921 of this title, takes a motor\n          vehicle . . . [from] another by force and\n          violence or by intimidation, or attempts to do\n          so, shall--\n          (1) be fined . . . or imprisoned not more than\n          15 years or both\n          (2) if serious bodily injury (as defined in\n          section 1365 of this title) results, be fined\n          under this title or imprisoned not more than\n          25 years, or both. . . .\n\n                             * * * *\n\nAs is apparent from the text of the statute, the default maximum\n\nsentence for a carjacking is fifteen years, id. § 2119(1), but if\n\nthe carjacking results in \"serious bodily injury,\" the maximum\n\nstatutory penalty is increased to twenty-five years, id. § 2119(2).\n\n          Count One charged Ramirez and Montañez with aiding and\n\nabetting each other in taking, while armed, a motor vehicle from\n\nNancy Rosado-Santiago\n\n          by force, violence or intimidation, to wit: by\n          forcing her to remain in the car, at gunpoint,\n          and   forcibly   assaulting    her   sexually,\n          resulting in serious bodily injury, as defined\n          in [18 U.S.C.] section 1365, namely bodily\n          injury which involves a substantial risk of\n\n\n     3\n      In 1994, Congress amended the statute, substituting \"with the\nintent to cause death or serious bodily harm\" for \"possessing a\nfirearm as defined in [18 U.S.C.] section 921.\" In Holloway v.\nUnited States, 526 U.S. 1 (1999), where the Supreme Court\nconsidered intent to commit bodily injury, it interpreted the later\nversion of the statute.     As Ramirez's habeas petition does not\npresent any independent claim that the jury had to find intent,\nHolloway is not relevant to our analysis here.\n\n                               -3-\n\f            death and extreme physical pain.     All in\n            violation of 18 United States Code, Sections\n            2119(2) and 2.\n\nThe trial court read the entire indictment to the jury, including\n\nthe above-quoted language. Despite that reading, the court did not\n\ninstruct the       jury   under    §   2119(2).     Rather,   its   instruction\n\nreferred solely to the elements set forth in the first paragraph of\n\n§   2119.    The    court,   however,      did    provide   the   jury   for   its\n\ndeliberation a copy of the superseding indictment, which included\n\nCount One, quoted above.          Trial counsel did not object to the jury\n\ninstructions as given.4\n\n            The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three\n\ncounts.     The trial evidence showed that, before relinquishing\n\ncontrol over Rosado and her vehicle, one of the carjackers forced\n\nher to undress and then raped her.                In both written exceptions\n\nfiled in response to the Pre-Sentence Investigative Report and at\n\n\n\n      4\n      Indeed, in support of a motion in limine seeking to exclude\nall references to the sexual assault of Rosado, Ramirez argued that\nserious bodily injury was a sentencing factor and not an element of\nthe offense.   In a written order entered on June 15, 1995, the\ndistrict court denied Ramirez's motion on the ground that sexual\nassault \"constituted part of the element of the offense for which\ndefendant was charged in Count I of the Indictment.\"\n     At the time of Ramirez's convictions, this Court had not yet\ndecided whether serious bodily injury was an element or a\nsentencing factor of § 2119(2).       Ramirez's jury verdict was\nrendered on June 21, 1995.     Shortly thereafter but before his\nsentencing, this Court held that serious bodily injury was a\nsentencing factor, not an element of the offense, on October 12,\n1995. See United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 1000 (1st\nCir. 1995), overruled by Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227\n(1999).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe sentencing hearing, Ramirez objected to a recommended four-\n\npoint enhancement for serious bodily injury, under U.S.S.G. §\n\n2B3.1(B)(3), being applied to his conviction for the carjacking of\n\nRosado. He claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support\n\na finding of serious bodily injury to support the enhancement.\n\nHowever, he did not argue that the maximum available sentence for\n\nthe carjacking of Rosado was fifteen years because of the failure\n\nto instruct the jury to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\n\nRosado suffered serious bodily injury.\n\n          The district court flatly rejected Ramirez's objection,\n\nnoting that the jury had found Ramirez guilty under § 2119(2).   He\n\nthen determined that there was sufficient evidence of serious\n\nbodily injury to enhance Ramirez's sentence by four points under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(B)(3). In the end, the court sentenced Ramirez to\n\na term of 360 months as to Counts One and Two, to be served\n\nconcurrently, and 60 months as to Count Three, to be served\n\nconsecutively to Counts One and Two.\n\n          Ramirez, pro se, appealed his convictions and sentence.\n\nBut he assigned no error to the court's jury instructions, nor did\n\nhe claim that he was deprived of due process or of his right to\n\njury trial because no \"serious bodily injury\" instruction was\n\nprovided to the jury.   In fact, relying on our decision in United\n\nStates v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 1000 (1st Cir. 1995), Ramirez\n\nchallenged the denial of his motion in limine on the ground, inter\n\n\n                                -5-\n\falia, that serious bodily injury was a sentencing factor.       We\n\naffirmed his convictions, but vacated his sentence and remanded for\n\nresentencing because the sentence imposed by the district court\n\nexceeded the maximum sentence available under the statute.   United\n\nStates v. Ramirez-Burgos, No. 96-1298, 1997 WL 268695 (1st Cir. May\n\n21, 1997); see also 18 U.S.C. § 2119(2) (providing for a term of\n\n300 months for carjacking that results in serious bodily injury).\n\nOn remand, the district court resentenced Ramirez to 300 months as\n\nto Count One, but erroneously entered an identical concurrent 300-\n\nmonth term for Count Two, which lacked serious bodily injury and\n\nthus had a statutory maximum of fifteen years under § 2119(1).\n\nRamirez again appealed, this time with appointed counsel, who\n\nraised a number of objections to the convictions and sentence.5\n\nMoreover, appointed counsel did not raise the claim now raised in\n\nthe § 2255 petition.\n\n          On March 24, 1999, one day after the filing of Ramirez's\n\nreply brief, the Supreme Court decided Jones v. United States, 526\n\nU.S. 227 (1999). In Jones, the Supreme Court held that subsections\n\n(1)-(3) of § 2119 are \"three separate offenses . . . [with]\n\n\n     5\n      We declined to review the newly brought challenges to his\nconvictions as they were outside the scope of the issues made\nrelevant by the intervening appellate decision and remand. United\nStates v. Ramirez-Burgos, No. 98-1995, 1999 WL 525916, at *3-4 (1st\nCir. May 18, 1999) (citing United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d\n24, 30-33 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that under law-of-the-case\ndoctrine, when resentencing after a remand, district court should\nconsider only new arguments or new facts made newly-relevant by the\nintervening decision of the court of appeals)).\n\n                               -6-\n\fdistinct elements, each of which must be charged by indictment,\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt, and submitted to a jury for its\n\nverdict.\"   Id. at 251-52.    Ramirez did not raise the Jones issue at\n\ntrial,   nor   during   the   pendency   of   the   second   appeal,   in   a\n\nsupplemental brief or a 28j letter.\n\n            Two months after the Jones decision and without reference\n\nto it, we vacated Ramirez's sentence as to Count Two, on the ground\n\nthat it exceeded the statutory maximum of fifteen years under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119(1).       United States v. Ramirez-Burgos, No. 98-1995,\n\n1999 WL 525916 (1st Cir. May 18, 1999).\n\n                                   II.\n\n            On May 24, 2000, seeking to take advantage of the Jones\n\ndecision, Ramirez brought a motion to vacate, set aside or correct\n\nhis sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.           He argued that the\n\ndistrict court should vacate his sentence because the jury did not\n\ndetermine beyond a reasonable doubt whether Rosado suffered serious\n\nbodily injury.    In the alternative, he alleged that his appellate\n\ncounsel's failure to advise this Court of the Jones decision on his\n\nsecond appeal amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.            The\n\ndistrict court denied his petition.\n\n            We granted a certificate of appealability, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2253(c), as to (1) whether appellate counsel's failure to advise\n\nthis Court of the Jones decision constituted ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel, (2) whether Ramirez's prior default of the Jones issue\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fbarred him from raising it for the first time on collateral review,\n\nand (3) whether Jones entitles him to relief.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           For Ramirez to prevail on his ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim, he must establish (1) that, by failing to advise\n\nthis   Court   of   the   Jones    decision,    his   appellate   counsel's\n\nperformance \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\"\n\nand (2) that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel's unprofessional errors,\" he would have prevailed on his\n\nJones claim on his second appeal.           Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 688, 686-88 (1984); see also Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478,\n\n485 (1986) (holding that the Strickland standard applies to trial\n\nand appellate counsel).           We find it unnecessary to determine\n\nwhether Ramirez's appellate counsel was unreasonable in failing to\n\nraise a Jones claim, for even if we assume that he was, his claim\n\nwould have failed under Strickland's second prong.\n\n           Because Ramirez failed to object to the jury instructions\n\nor otherwise raise a Jones-type claim at trial, we would not have\n\ngranted relief on his second appeal unless Ramirez established that\n\nthe Jones error was plain under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).           See United\n\nStates v. Perez-Montañez, 202 F.3d 434, 441-43 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(holding that, on direct appeal, plain error review applies where\n\nthe Jones argument was not preserved at trial); cf. United States\n\nv. Cotton, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S. Ct. 1781, 1785 (2002) (holding that\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fa   defendant's   failure   to   object     to   Apprendi6   error   at   trial\n\nengenders plain error review on direct appeal); Neder v. United\n\nStates, 527 U.S. 1, 15 (1999) (holding that \"the omission of an\n\nelement [in a jury instruction] is an error that is subject to\n\nharmless-error analysis.\").      \"Under that test, before an appellate\n\ncourt can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1)\n\n'error,' (2) that is 'plain,' and (3) that 'affect[s] substantial\n\nrights.'\"    Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997)\n\n(quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993)).                 If\n\nthese conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to\n\ncorrect the error, \"but only if (4) the error seriously affect[s]\n\nthe   fairness,   integrity,     or    public     reputation    of   judicial\n\nproceedings.\"     Id. at 467 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 732).\n\n            We quickly dispose of the first two prongs of the test.\n\nJones applies to Ramirez's case retroactively as his case was still\n\non direct review at the time it was decided.            Perez-Montañez, 202\n\nF.3d at 442 (citing Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 328\n\n(1987)).    Accordingly, the trial court's failure to instruct the\n\njury to determine the element of whether the carjacking resulted in\n\nserious bodily injury was \"error.\" See Jones, 526 U.S. at 251-252;\n\n\n      6\n      In Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000), the\nSupreme Court held that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior\nconviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n                                      -9-\n\fPerez-Montañez, 202 F.3d at 441-42.      And because Jones was decided\n\nat the time of appellate consideration, the error was \"plain.\" See\n\nJohnson, 520 U.S. at 468 (\"[W]here the law at the time of trial was\n\nsettled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal--it\n\nis enough that an error be 'plain' at the time of appellate\n\nconsideration.\").\n\n          Our   third   inquiry   is   whether   the   error   \"affect[ed]\n\n[Ramirez's] substantial rights.\"         An error affects substantial\n\nrights if it was \"prejudicial,\" meaning that the error \"must have\n\naffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\"            Olano,\n\n507 U.S. at 734; see also Perez-Montañez, 202 F.3d at 442.             In\n\nmaking this inquiry, we do not \"'become in effect a second jury to\n\ndetermine whether the defendant is guilty.'\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 19\n\n(quoting R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970)).\n\nRather, \"we must determine 'whether the record contains evidence\n\nthat could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to\n\nthe omitted element.'\"    United States v. Benjamin, 252 F.3d 1, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Neder, 527 U.S. at 19); United States v.\n\nBaldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 682 (1st Cir. 2000) (same).        This inquiry is\n\nsubstantially similar to the standard applied in harmless error\n\nanalysis, except that the petitioner, not the government, \"bears\n\nthe burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\"           Olano, 507\n\nU.S. at 734; see also Perez-Montañez, 202 F.3d at 442.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            In providing for an enhanced penalty in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2119(2), Congress intended that defendants involved in carjackings\n\nthat include serious bodily injury should receive more severe\n\npunishment than those defendants involved in carjackings that do\n\nnot include serious bodily injury.                 The issue for the jury,\n\ntherefore, is whether the carjacking resulted in serious bodily\n\ninjury.     It   is   undisputed       that    Rosado   was    raped   during   the\n\ncommission of the carjacking; indeed, Ramirez conceded this fact at\n\noral argument.7       And not surprisingly, Ramirez agreed at oral\n\nargument that Rosado suffered serious bodily injury as a result of\n\nbeing    raped   by   one   of   the    carjackers.       Thus,     the   question\n\nimmediately before us is whether Rosado's serious bodily injury--\n\nthe rape--resulted from the carjacking.\n\n            We are not in uncharted territory.                In United States v.\n\nVazquez-Rivera, 135 F.3d 172, 178 (1st Cir. 1998), we analyzed what\n\ntype of injuries \"result\" from a carjacking for purposes of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119(2).      We explained that\n\n            the choice of the word \"results\" in the\n            statutory phrase \"if serious bodily injury . .\n            . results\" suggests that Congress intended to\n            cover a fairly broad range of consequences\n            flowing from a carjacking. Moreover, the\n            legislative    history    characterized    the\n\n\n     7\n      Ramirez must concede this point. The jury heard undisputed\ntestimony that, before abandoning Rosado and her vehicle, one of\nthe carjackers forced her to undress and then raped her. Moreover,\nthe jury heard uncontroverted testimony that semen was found on her\nbody and skirt. Ramirez had an opportunity to cross-examine Rosado\non this point, but chose not to do so.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f           provision as imposing the enhancement when the\n           carjacking \"involves bodily injury,\" which\n           supports the view that the injuries covered\n           are not limited to those resulting from the\n           \"taking\" of a vehicle, but also include those\n           caused by the carjacker at any point during\n           his or her retention of the vehicle.\n\nId. (citation omitted).       Accordingly, we held that serious bodily\n\ninjury arising from the rape in that case resulted from the\n\ncarjacking.8    Id.    We have since reaffirmed our reading of the term\n\n\"results\" as including injuries that were caused by the actions of\n\nthe carjacker at any time during the commission of the carjacking.\n\nSee United States v. Lowe, 145 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir. 1998).9\n\n           The jury heard overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence\n\nthat Rosado was raped during the commission of the carjacking. See\n\nRamirez-Burgos I, 1997 WL 268695, at *1, 4-5. Indeed, in Ramirez's\n\ndirect   appeal,      we   found    that   \"the   rape,      like   the    earlier\n\nbrandishing of the gun, provided the intimidation by which the\n\ncarjackers     extended     their    control      of   the    victim      and   her\n\n\n     8\n      In 1996, Congress amended § 2119(2) to make clear that the\ndefinition of \"serious bodily injury\" includes sexual abuse, as\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2242, that occurs during the\ncourse of the carjacking. See Carjacking Correction Act of 1996,\nPub. L. 104-217, 110 Stat. 3020; H.R. Rep. No. 104-787 (1996),\nreprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3409 (\"[The amendment to § 2119(2)]\nis intended to make clear that offenders who commit rape during a\ncarjacking should get the penalty enhancement provided for in the\nstatute.\").\n     9\n      We do not here set forth the temporal limits of a carjacking\nunder § 2119.     But we reaffirm, without hesitation, that the\ncommission of a carjacking continues at least while the carjacker\nmaintains control over the victim and her car. See Vazquez-Rivera,\n135 F.3d at 178.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fautomobile.\"     Id. at *5.       At no time has Ramirez disputed that\n\nRosado's serious bodily injury occurred during the commission of\n\nthe carjacking.      Nor does he do so now.    In sum, Ramirez has failed\n\nto point to any facts--and our independent review of the entire\n\nrecord has found none--that suggest that the jury rationally could\n\nhave reached a different conclusion.\n\n           Faced with the unavoidable conclusion that the rape\n\nresulted from the carjacking, at oral argument, Ramirez maintained\n\nthat he suffered prejudice because the jury did not determine the\n\nidentity of the rapist.      According to his theory--one that was not\n\nraised at trial, sentencing, direct appeal, in his § 2255 petition,\n\nor in his briefs for this appeal--only the rapist, not the other\n\ncarjacker, can be held criminally responsible for the serious\n\nbodily injury because the rape was not included in the purpose of\n\nthe joint venture--the carjacking of Rosado--and, in any case, the\n\nrape occurred after the joint venture ended.\n\n           Ramirez's arguments raise the interesting question of the\n\nscope of aider and abettor liability under the carjacking statute.\n\nAfter   all,   not   only   was   Ramirez   charged   and   convicted   as   a\n\nprincipal, but he was also charged and convicted as an aider and\n\nabettor under 18 U.S.C. § 2(a) (\"Whoever commits an offense against\n\nthe United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or\n\nprocures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\"). The case\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\flaw is remarkably silent on the question of the scope of aider and\n\nabettor liability in this situation.\n\n           Although intriguing, the issue need not detain us for two\n\nreasons.   First, the question of the scope of aider and abettor\n\nliability is beyond the scope of this appeal.           The only issue\n\nbefore us is whether the failure to instruct the jury to determine\n\nthe element of serious bodily injury affected the trial court\n\nproceedings.     Had the error not occurred, the trial court would\n\nhave instructed the jury to determine, in addition to the other\n\nelements of the offense, only whether Rosado suffered serious\n\nbodily injury as a result of the carjacking.       There is nothing in\n\nJones or § 2119(2) that requires the trial court to instruct the\n\njury to determine the identity of the person who actually caused\n\nthe serious bodily injury.      The identity of the rapist is simply\n\nimmaterial to answering this question.\n\n           Second, even if the identity of the rapist is material,\n\nwe reach the same result because the jury verdict necessarily\n\nincluded a finding that Ramirez was the rapist. The trial evidence\n\nshowed   that   there   were   only   two   carjackers--the   number   of\n\ncarjackers has never been in dispute.       Given that there were only\n\ntwo carjackers, Ramirez and Montañez, if one is excluded as the\n\nrapist, the other necessarily is the rapist.         After taking over\n\nRosado's car, the two carjackers drove around searching for a\n\nsecond victim.    One carjacker drove Rosado's car while the other\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fsat in the backseat.      Spotting Kassandra Rivera-Boujoven, the\n\ndriver rammed Rosado's car into Rivera's car.     The driver then\n\nexited Rosado's car, got into Rivera's car, and drove away, leaving\n\nthe only other carjacker with Rosado.     The other carjacker, who\n\nremained in the backseat of Rosado's car, moved to the driver's\n\nseat, and drove Rosado to a secluded location.     Once there, he\n\nordered her to undress, and then raped her.   After raping Rosado,\n\nthe second carjacker left Rosado and climbed into the backseat of\n\nRivera's car.     The two men, with Rivera in the passenger seat,\n\ndrove off, stopped to consume drugs, and ultimately crashed into a\n\nmango tree.     Ramirez was found in the backseat of Rivera's car,\n\ntrying to escape.10\n\n          The trial evidence was overwhelming and uncontroverted\n\nthat Montañez was the first carjacker, the carjacker who exited\n\nRosado's car, and the only driver of Rivera's vehicle, leaving the\n\nsecond carjacker as the one who ultimately raped Rosado.11    That\n\n\n     10\n      At trial, Ramirez maintained that he did not participate in\neither of the two carjackings. According to his defense theory,\nthe second carjacker, the one who raped Rosado and jumped in the\nbackseat of Rivera's car, exited Rivera's car at a housing project.\nShortly thereafter, Ramirez got into the backseat of Rivera's car\nto shoot up drugs with Montañez. At closing argument, his trial\ncounsel explained that \"by chance, luck, or coincidence,\" Ramirez\nhad unwittingly switched places with the second carjacker--the\nrapist.   The jury cearly rejected Ramirez's mere coincidence\nargument, and found him guilty of both carjackings.\n     11\n      In closing argument, Ramirez's trial counsel acknowledged\nthat Montañez was the driver of Rosado's car who exited and took\nover Rivera's. Moreover, Rivera specifically identified Montañez\nas the only driver of her car, and Ramirez himself testified that\n\n                                -15-\n\fonly leaves Ramirez, the second carjacker, as the rapist.        By\n\nconvicting Ramirez for both carjackings, the jury necessarily found\n\nthat Ramirez was the second carjacker, who remained in Rosado's car\n\nafter Montañez exited, and who ultimately raped Rosado.    No other\n\nreading of the facts and verdict is possible.    In any event, the\n\nrecord does not contain evidence that would allow a rational jury\n\nto reach a contrary finding. The jury's determination that Ramirez\n\nwas the rapist is not surprising given the overwhelming evidence\n\npresented at trial, including the positive identification by Rosado\n\nthat Ramirez was the rapist and corroborating testimony provided by\n\nRivera.   See Ramirez-Burgos I, 1997 WL 268695, at *3-5.   In short,\n\nwe conclude that the jury verdict necessarily would have been the\n\nsame had the trial court asked the jury to determine whether the\n\ncarjacking resulted in serious bodily injury.\n\n           Finally, even were we to pass over the question of\n\nwhether the error affected Ramirez's substantial rights, we would\n\nstill affirm because Ramirez's claim fails under the fourth prong\n\nof plain error review.   In Johnson, the Supreme Court held that,\n\nwhere the trial court fails to submit an element of an offense to\n\nthe jury, if the evidence of the omitted element is \"overwhelming\"\n\nand \"essentially uncontroverted,\" there is \"no basis for concluding\n\n\n\nMontañez was the driver of Rivera's car. Finally, Rosado testified\nthat after Ramirez raped her, she watched him get into the backseat\nof Rivera's car. There is no dispute that Montañez was not the\nrapist.\n\n                               -16-\n\fthat the error 'seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.'\"           520 U.S. at 470.\n\n          Here,   Ramirez    concedes      that   Rosado   suffered   serious\n\nbodily injury as a result of the rape.            And as we explained, the\n\noverwhelming and uncontroverted evidence at trial showed that the\n\nrape resulted from the carjacking for purposes of § 2119(2).\n\nFurthermore, the jury's finding of guilt for the carjacking of both\n\nRosado and Rivera necessarily included a finding that Ramirez was\n\nthe rapist.   There is no other rational way of reading the trial\n\nevidence and verdict.    Thus, the failure of the district court to\n\nsubmit the element of serious bodily injury to the jury was simply\n\ninconsequential   to    Ramirez's    conviction       or   the   sentence   he\n\nultimately received.        In sum, we find that the trial error,\n\nalthough plain, did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity,\n\nor public reputation of judicial proceedings.12\n\n\n\n     12\n       By deciding that Ramirez would have been unable to establish\nplain error on direct review and thus cannot establish that his\nappellate counsel was ineffective under the second prong of\nStrickland, we need not discuss whether Ramirez has shown actual\nprejudice sufficient to excuse his procedural default of the Jones\nclaim.   See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 622 (1997)\n(holding that in order to excuse a procedural default, a petitioner\nmust demonstrate either cause for failing to raise the claim and\nactual prejudice, or actual innocence).      Given that the actual\nprejudice standard is more demanding than that for plain error and\nthat Ramirez is unable to satisfy the plain error standard, he\nfails, a fortiori, to satisfy the actual prejudice standard to\nexcuse his default. See United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 166\n(1982) (holding that the actual prejudice standard on collateral\nreview presents a \"significantly higher hurdle\" than plain error\nreview). Ramirez has made no claim of actual innocence.\n\n                                    -17-\n\f           Having found that there is no reasonable probability that\n\nthe second appeal panel would have found plain error had appellate\n\ncounsel raised Jones and complained about the jury instructions, we\n\nhold   that   Ramirez   has   failed    to   establish   prejudice   under\n\nStrickland's second prong.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          It is beyond question that Ramirez was properly convicted\n\nof and sentenced for a carjacking that resulted in serious bodily\n\ninjury.   The decision of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f",

Although Count One of the superseding indictment charged Ramirez with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2), the trial court did not instruct the jury to determine whether the victim of the carjacking suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the carjacking. Ramirez appeals the district court's denial of his &#167; 2255 petition, in which he claimed that his sentence must be vacated because the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Jones v.

Despite that reading, the court did not instruct the jury under &#167; 2119(2). Rather, its instruction referred solely to the elements set forth in the first paragraph of &#167; 2119. The court, however, did provide the jury for its deliberation a copy of the superseding indictment, which included Count One, quoted above.

The trial evidence showed that, before relinquishing control over Rosado and her vehicle, one of the carjackers forced her to undress and then raped her. In both written exceptions filed in response to the Pre-Sentence Investigative Report and at the sentencing hearing, Ramirez objected to a recommended four-point enhancement for serious bodily injury, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(B)(3), being applied to his conviction for the carjacking of Rosado. He claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of serious bodily injury to support the enhancement. However, he did not argue that the maximum available sentence for the carjacking of Rosado was fifteen years because of the failure to instruct the jury to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Rosado suffered serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court flatly rejected Ramirez's objection, noting that the jury had found Ramirez guilty under &#167; 2119(2). He then determined that there was sufficient evidence of serious bodily injury to enhance Ramirez's sentence by four points under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(B)(3). In the end, the court sentenced Ramirez to a term of 360 months as to Counts One and Two, to be served concurrently, and 60 months as to Count Three, to be served consecutively to Counts One and Two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez, <i>pro se,</i> appealed his convictions and sentence. But he assigned no error to the court's jury instructions, nor did he claim that he was deprived of due process or of his right to jury trial because no \"serious bodily injury\" instruction was provided to the jury. In fact, relying on our decision in <i>United States v. Rivera-Gomez,</i> 67 F.3d 993, 1000 (1st Cir.1995), Ramirez challenged the denial of his motion <i>in limine</i> on the ground, <i>inter alia,</i> that serious bodily injury was a sentencing factor. We affirmed his convictions, but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing because the sentence imposed by the district court exceeded the maximum sentence available under the statute. <i>United States v. Ramirez-Burgos,</i> No. 96-1298, 1997 WL 268695 (1st Cir. May 21, 1997); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2) (providing for a term of 300 months for carjacking that results in serious bodily injury). On remand, the district court resentenced Ramirez to 300 months as to Count One, but erroneously entered an identical concurrent 300-month term for Count Two, which lacked serious bodily injury and thus had a statutory maximum of fifteen years under &#167; 2119(1). Ramirez again appealed, this time with appointed counsel, who raised a number of objections to the convictions and sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, appointed counsel did not raise the claim now raised in the &#167; 2255 petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 24, 1999, one day after the filing of Ramirez's reply brief, the Supreme Court decided <i>Jones v.

The issue for the jury, therefore, is whether the carjacking <i>resulted</i> in serious bodily injury. It is undisputed that Rosado was raped during the commission of the carjacking; indeed, Ramirez conceded this fact at oral argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> And not surprisingly, Ramirez agreed at oral argument that Rosado suffered serious bodily injury as a result of being raped by one of the carjackers. Thus, the question immediately before us is whether Rosado's serious bodily injury &#8212; the rape &#8212; resulted from the carjacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not in uncharted territory. In <i>United States v. Vazquez-Rivera,</i> 135 F.3d 172, 178 (1st Cir.1998), we analyzed what type of injuries \"result\" from a carjacking for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2). We explained that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the choice of the word \"results\" in the statutory phrase \"if serious bodily injury... results\" suggests that Congress intended to cover a fairly broad range of consequences flowing from a carjacking. Moreover, the legislative history characterized the provision as imposing the enhancement when the carjacking \"<i>involves</i> bodily injury,\" which supports the view that the injuries covered are not limited to those resulting from the \"taking\" of a vehicle, but also include those caused by the carjacker at any point during his or her retention of the vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). Accordingly, we held that serious bodily injury arising from the rape in that case resulted from the carjacking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> We have since reaffirmed our reading of the term \"results\" as including injuries that were caused by the actions of the carjacker at any time during the commission of the carjacking. <i>See United States v. Lowe,</i> 145 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury heard overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence that Rosado was raped during the commission of the carjacking. <i>See Ramirez-Burgos I,</i> 1997 WL 268695, at *1, *4-*5. Indeed, in Ramirez's direct appeal, we found that \"the rape, like the earlier brandishing of the gun, provided the intimidation by which the carjackers extended their control of the victim and her automobile.\" <i>Id.</i> at *5. At no time has Ramirez disputed that Rosado's serious bodily injury occurred during the commission of the carjacking. Nor does he do so now. In sum, Ramirez has failed to point to any facts &#8212; and our independent review of the entire record has found none &#8212; that suggest that the jury rationally could have reached a different conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the unavoidable conclusion that the rape resulted from the carjacking, at oral argument, Ramirez maintained that he suffered prejudice because the jury did not determine the identity of the rapist. According to his theory &#8212; one that was not raised at trial, sentencing, direct appeal, in his &#167; 2255 petition, or in his briefs for this appeal &#8212; <i>only</i> the rapist, not the other carjacker, can be held criminally responsible for the serious bodily injury because the rape was not included in the purpose of the joint venture &#8212; the carjacking of Rosado &#8212; and, in any case, the rape occurred after the joint venture ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez's arguments raise the interesting question of the scope of aider and abettor liability under the carjacking statute. After all, not only was Ramirez charged and convicted as a principal, but he was also charged and convicted as an aider and abettor under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(a) (\"Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\"). The case law is remarkably silent on the question of the scope of aider and abettor liability in this situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although intriguing, the issue need not detain us for two reasons. First, the question of the scope of aider and abettor liability is beyond the scope of this appeal. The only issue before us is whether the failure to instruct the jury to determine the element of serious bodily injury affected the trial court proceedings. Had the error not occurred, the trial court would have instructed the jury to determine, in addition to the other elements of the offense, <i>only</i> whether Rosado suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the carjacking. There is nothing in <i>Jones</i> or &#167; 2119(2) that requires the trial court to instruct the jury to determine the identity of the person who actually caused the serious bodily injury. The identity of the rapist is simply immaterial to answering this question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the identity of the rapist is material, we reach the same result because the jury verdict <i>necessarily</i> included a finding that Ramirez was the rapist. The trial evidence showed that there were only <i>two</i> carjackers &#8212; the number of carjackers has never been in dispute. Given that there were only two carjackers, Ramirez and Monta&#241;ez, if one is excluded as the rapist, the other necessarily is the rapist. After taking over Rosado's car, the two carjackers drove around searching for a second victim. One carjacker drove Rosado's car while the other sat in the backseat. Spotting Kassandra Rivera-Boujoven, the driver rammed Rosado's car into Rivera's car. The driver then exited Rosado's car, got into Rivera's car, and drove away, leaving the only other carjacker with Rosado. The other carjacker, who remained in the backseat of Rosado's car, moved to the driver's seat, and drove Rosado to a secluded location. Once there, he ordered her to undress, and then raped her. After raping Rosado, the second carjacker left Rosado and climbed into the backseat of Rivera's car. The two men, with Rivera in the passenger seat, drove off, stopped to consume drugs, and ultimately crashed into a mango tree. Ramirez was found in the backseat of Rivera's car, trying to escape.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial evidence was overwhelming and uncontroverted that Monta&#241;ez was the first carjacker, the carjacker who exited Rosado's car, and the <i>only</i> driver of Rivera's vehicle, leaving the second carjacker as the one who ultimately raped Rosado.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> That only leaves Ramirez, the second carjacker, as the rapist. By convicting Ramirez for both carjackings, the jury necessarily found that Ramirez was the second carjacker, who remained in Rosado's car after Monta&#241;ez exited, and who ultimately raped Rosado. No other reading of the facts and verdict is possible. In any event, the record does not contain evidence that would allow a rational jury to reach a contrary finding. The jury's determination that Ramirez was the rapist is not surprising given the overwhelming evidence presented at trial, including the positive identification by Rosado that Ramirez was the rapist and corroborating testimony provided by Rivera. <i>See Ramirez-Burgos I,</i> 1997 WL 268695, at *3-*5. In short, we conclude that the jury verdict necessarily would have been the same had the trial court asked the jury to determine whether the carjacking resulted in serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even were we to pass over the question of whether the error affected Ramirez's substantial rights, we would still affirm because Ramirez's claim fails under the fourth prong of plain error review. In <i>Johnson,</i> the Supreme Court held that, where the trial court fails to submit an element of an offense to the jury, if the evidence of the omitted element is \"overwhelming\" and \"essentially uncontroverted,\" there is \"no basis for concluding that the error `seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" 520 U.S. at 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Ramirez concedes that Rosado suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the rape. And as we explained, the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence at trial showed that the rape resulted from the carjacking for purposes of &#167; 2119(2). Furthermore, the jury's finding of guilt for the carjacking of both Rosado and Rivera necessarily included a finding that Ramirez was the rapist. There is no other rational way of reading the trial evidence and verdict. Thus, the failure of the district court to submit the element of serious bodily injury to the jury was simply inconsequential to Ramirez's conviction or the sentence he ultimately received. In sum, we find that the trial error, although plain, did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that there is no reasonable probability that the second appeal panel would have found plain error had appellate counsel raised <i>Jones</i> and complained about the jury instructions, we hold that Ramirez has failed to establish prejudice under <i>Strickland</i>'s second prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond question that Ramirez was properly convicted of and sentenced for a carjacking that resulted in serious bodily injury.

Despite that reading, the court did not instruct the jury under &#167; 2119(2). Rather, its instruction referred solely to the elements set forth in the first paragraph of &#167; 2119. The court, however, did provide the jury for its deliberation a copy of the superseding indictment, which included Count One, quoted above.

In both written exceptions filed in response to the Pre-Sentence Investigative Report and at the sentencing hearing, Ramirez objected to a recommended four-point enhancement for serious bodily injury, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(B)(3), being applied to his conviction for the carjacking of Rosado. He claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of serious bodily injury to support the enhancement. However, he did not argue that the maximum available sentence for the carjacking of Rosado was fifteen years because of the failure to instruct the jury to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Rosado suffered serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court flatly rejected Ramirez's objection, noting that the jury had found Ramirez guilty under &#167; 2119(2). He then determined that there was sufficient evidence of serious bodily injury to enhance Ramirez's sentence by four points under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(B)(3). In the end, the court sentenced Ramirez to a term of 360 months as to Counts One and Two, to be served concurrently, and 60 months as to Count Three, to be served consecutively to Counts One and Two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez, <i>pro se,</i> appealed his convictions and sentence.

Accordingly, we held that serious bodily injury arising from the rape in that case resulted from the carjacking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> We have since reaffirmed our reading of the term \"results\" as including injuries that were caused by the actions of the carjacker at any time during the commission of the carjacking. <i>See United States v.

Indeed, in Ramirez's direct appeal, we found that \"the rape, like the earlier brandishing of the gun, provided the intimidation by which the carjackers extended their control of the victim and her automobile.\" <i>Id.</i> at *5. At no time has Ramirez disputed that Rosado's serious bodily injury occurred during the commission of the carjacking. Nor does he do so now. In sum, Ramirez has failed to point to any facts &#8212; and our independent review of the entire record has found none &#8212; that suggest that the jury rationally could have reached a different conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the unavoidable conclusion that the rape resulted from the carjacking, at oral argument, Ramirez maintained that he suffered prejudice because the jury did not determine the identity of the rapist. According to his theory &#8212; one that was not raised at trial, sentencing, direct appeal, in his &#167; 2255 petition, or in his briefs for this appeal &#8212; <i>only</i> the rapist, not the other carjacker, can be held criminally responsible for the serious bodily injury because the rape was not included in the purpose of the joint venture &#8212; the carjacking of Rosado &#8212; and, in any case, the rape occurred after the joint venture ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez's arguments raise the interesting question of the scope of aider and abettor liability under the carjacking statute. After all, not only was Ramirez charged and convicted as a principal, but he was also charged and convicted as an aider and abettor under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(a) (\"Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\"). The case law is remarkably silent on the question of the scope of aider and abettor liability in this situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although intriguing, the issue need not detain us for two reasons. First, the question of the scope of aider and abettor liability is beyond the scope of this appeal. The only issue before us is whether the failure to instruct the jury to determine the element of serious bodily injury affected the trial court proceedings. Had the error not occurred, the trial court would have instructed the jury to determine, in addition to the other elements of the offense, <i>only</i> whether Rosado suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the carjacking. There is nothing in <i>Jones</i> or &#167; 2119(2) that requires the trial court to instruct the jury to determine the identity of the person who actually caused the serious bodily injury. The identity of the rapist is simply immaterial to answering this question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the identity of the rapist is material, we reach the same result because the jury verdict <i>necessarily</i> included a finding that Ramirez was the rapist. The trial evidence showed that there were only <i>two</i> carjackers &#8212; the number of carjackers has never been in dispute. Given that there were only two carjackers, Ramirez and Monta&#241;ez, if one is excluded as the rapist, the other necessarily is the rapist. After taking over Rosado's car, the two carjackers drove around searching for a second victim. One carjacker drove Rosado's car while the other sat in the backseat. Spotting Kassandra Rivera-Boujoven, the driver rammed Rosado's car into Rivera's car. The driver then exited Rosado's car, got into Rivera's car, and drove away, leaving the only other carjacker with Rosado. The other carjacker, who remained in the backseat of Rosado's car, moved to the driver's seat, and drove Rosado to a secluded location. Once there, he ordered her to undress, and then raped her. After raping Rosado, the second carjacker left Rosado and climbed into the backseat of Rivera's car. The two men, with Rivera in the passenger seat, drove off, stopped to consume drugs, and ultimately crashed into a mango tree. Ramirez was found in the backseat of Rivera's car, trying to escape.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial evidence was overwhelming and uncontroverted that Monta&#241;ez was the first carjacker, the carjacker who exited Rosado's car, and the <i>only</i> driver of Rivera's vehicle, leaving the second carjacker as the one who ultimately raped Rosado.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> That only leaves Ramirez, the second carjacker, as the rapist. By convicting Ramirez for both carjackings, the jury necessarily found that Ramirez was the second carjacker, who remained in Rosado's car after Monta&#241;ez exited, and who ultimately raped Rosado. No other reading of the facts and verdict is possible. In any event, the record does not contain evidence that would allow a rational jury to reach a contrary finding. The jury's determination that Ramirez was the rapist is not surprising given the overwhelming evidence presented at trial, including the positive identification by Rosado that Ramirez was the rapist and corroborating testimony provided by Rivera. <i>See Ramirez-Burgos I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">268695</span></span>, at *3-*5. In short, we conclude that the jury verdict necessarily would have been the same had the trial court asked the jury to determine whether the carjacking resulted in serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even were we to pass over the question of whether the error affected Ramirez's substantial rights, we would still affirm because Ramirez's claim fails under the fourth prong of plain error review. In <i>Johnson,</i> the Supreme Court held that, where the trial court fails to submit an element of an offense to the jury, if the evidence of the omitted element is \"overwhelming\" and \"essentially uncontroverted,\" there is \"no basis for concluding that the error `seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" 520 U.S. at 470, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1544</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Ramirez concedes that Rosado suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the rape. And as we explained, the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence at trial showed that the rape resulted from the carjacking for purposes of &#167; 2119(2). Furthermore, the jury's finding of guilt for the carjacking of both Rosado and Rivera necessarily included a finding that Ramirez was the rapist. There is no other rational way of reading the trial evidence and verdict. Thus, the failure of the district court to submit the element of serious bodily injury to the jury was simply inconsequential to Ramirez's conviction or the sentence he ultimately received. In sum, we find that the trial error, although plain, did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that there is no reasonable probability that the second appeal panel would have found plain error had appellate counsel raised <i>Jones</i> and complained about the jury instructions, we hold that Ramirez has failed to establish prejudice under <i>Strickland</i>'s second prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond question that Ramirez was properly convicted of and sentenced for a carjacking that resulted in serious bodily injury.
