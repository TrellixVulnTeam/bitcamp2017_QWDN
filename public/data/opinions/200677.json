Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n    Farouk Martins on brief pro se.\n    John M.

Farouk Martins has appealed a district court\n\norder dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim.    See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   We affirm.\n\n          We review, de novo, the district court's grant of a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.   Martin v.\n\nApplied Cellular Technology, Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThe district court here granted the Rule 12(b)(6) motion on res\n\njudicata (claim preclusion) grounds.     We look to state law in\n\ndeciding the res judicata effect of a state court judgment in\n\nfederal court.   Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U.S.\n\n461, 481-82 (1982); Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   In Massachusetts, \"[t]hree elements are essential for\n\ninvocation of claim preclusion: (1) the identity or privity of the\n\nparties to the present and prior actions, (2) identity of the cause\n\nof action, and (3) prior final judgment on the merits.\"    DaLuz v.\n\nDept. of Correction, 434 Mass. 40, 45, 746 N.E.2d 501, 505 (2001).\n\nThe second element -- that of \"the identity of the cause of action\"\n\n-- is the only one potentially at issue here.   As to that element,\n\nMassachusetts law provides that \"[c]laim preclusion makes a valid,\n\nfinal judgment conclusive on the parties and their privies, and\n\nprevents relitigation of all matters that were or could have been\n\nadjudicated in the action.\"    Blanchette v. School Committee of\n\nWestwood, 427 Mass. 176, 179 n.3, 692 N.E.2d 21, 24 n.3 (1998)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f           In   responding   to    the   appellee's   motion   to   dismiss,\n\nMartins informed the district court that he had filed a complaint\n\nwith the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) in\n\nSeptember 1997 against his former employer, the Boston Public\n\nHealth Commission (BPHC), alleging retaliation after reporting\n\nsexual harassment to BPHC.           Martins argued that, because his\n\nretaliation claim remained pending before the MCAD at the time of\n\nhis state court common law action for defamation and because the\n\nstate court would not adjudicate any such retaliation claim until\n\nthe administrative process was completed, he did not have a full\n\nand fair opportunity to litigate that retaliation claim in his\n\nstate court case.\n\n           Martins did not attach any documents from his MCAD\n\nfiling.   Nor did he inform the district court of the outcome of any\n\nMCAD proceeding.    He did provide a copy of a right-to-sue letter\n\nissued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), dated\n\nSeptember 19, 2002, and a copy of an October 1998 ruling by the\n\nstate court in his defamation suit that denied a motion apparently\n\nfiled by BPHC seeking to dismiss.          The responsibility and, thus,\n\nconsequences for having presented an incomplete and fragmented\n\nrecord rest with Martins.         In any event, we are able to conclude\n\nthat res judicata appropriately lies here to bar the most recent\n\ncomplaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          Contrary to Martins's contention, he was not deprived of\n\na full and fair opportunity to litigate his retaliation claim in\n\nthe state court.      See O'Neill v. City Manager of Cambridge, 428\n\nMass. 257, 259, 700 N.E.2d 530, 533 (1998) (reciting that claim\n\npreclusion does not apply in a case where a party did not have an\n\nopportunity    to   raise   the     claim   at    the   earlier     proceeding).\n\nAlthough Martins was required by state law to first present a\n\ntimely complaint of discrimination to the MCAD -- here, Martins's\n\nclaim was for termination (allegedly) in retaliation for his\n\nallegations of sexual harassment against a fellow employee whom\n\nMartins supervised -- he had the right to withdraw that claim from\n\nthe MCAD and bring suit in court at any time with permission of the\n\nMCAD or   as   of   right   after    ninety      days   if   the   MCAD   had   not\n\nadjudicated the case by that time.          Green v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 422\n\nMass. 551, 557 n.8, 664 N.E.2d 808, 812 n.8 (1996); Charland v.\n\nMuzi Motors, Inc., 417 Mass. 580, 583-84, 631 N.E.2d 555, 557\n\n(1994); see also Lavelle v. MCAD, 426 Mass. 332, 335, 688 N.E.2d\n\n1331, 1334 (1997) (reciting that \"a complainant has the right under\n\nG.L. c. 151B, ยง 9, to terminate agency proceedings and obtain a\n\njudicial determination of her claim\") (emphasis added).\n\n          If Martins had withdrawn his MCAD complaint, he could\n\nhave pursued the retaliation claim in conjunction with his common\n\nlaw defamation claim.       This is so whether the statutory basis for\n\nMartins's retaliation claim is Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, ยง 9 or\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fTitle VII. A state court has concurrent jurisdiction to adjudicate\n\na Title VII claim.       Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Donnelly, 494\n\nU.S. 820, 821 (1990).         Although Martins did not have an EEOC right-\n\nto-sue letter at the time of his state court defamation action, he\n\ncould have sought such a letter from the EEOC 180 days after filing\n\nan EEOC complaint.      See Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. EEOC, 432 U.S.\n\n355, 361 (1977); see also Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp.,\n\n456 U.S. 461, 465 n.3 (1982) (reciting that \"[w]here the Commission\n\nhas not filed a civil action against the employer, it must, if\n\nrequested, issue a right-to-sue letter 180 days after the charge\n\nwas filed\").    Martins does not inform us of the date that he filed\n\nhis EEOC complaint but, pursuant to the worksharing agreement by\n\nwhich a claim filed with the MCAD is effectively filed with the\n\nEEOC, see Davis v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 251 F.3d 227, 230 n.1\n\n(1st   Cir.   2001),    we     can   assume,    as    operative   for   the   EEOC\n\ncomplaint, the purported filing date of September 1997 for his MCAD\n\ncomplaint.      Thus, Martins could have requested a right-to-sue\n\nletter   from   the    EEOC    in    March    1998.     Martins's   state     court\n\ndefamation action was still pending at this time and was not\n\nresolved by the state superior court until June 1999.                   There is\n\nnothing to suggest that Martins could not have notified the state\n\ncourt of his Title VII claim and sought a stay of that action until\n\nhe asked for and obtained the letter from the EEOC.                 Cf. Heyliger\n\nv. State U. & Comm. Coll. System of Tenn., 126 F.3d 849, 855-56\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f(6th Cir. 1997) (holding that claim preclusion, under Tennessee\n\nlaw, applied to bar Title VII claim because plaintiff could have\n\ntimely sought EEOC right-to-sue letter and folded the Title VII\n\nclaim into his state court civil rights action); Woods v. Dunlop\n\nTire Corp., 972 F.2d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 1992) (holding that claim\n\npreclusion applied to bar Title VII claim because plaintiff could\n\nhave filed her claim under the Labor Management Relations Act and\n\nthen either sought a stay of that action pending the outcome of the\n\nTitle VII proceeding or sought a right-to-sue letter from the\n\nEEOC).\n\n          From aught that appears, however, Martins chose not to\n\nwithdraw his MCAD complaint. He was certainly within his rights to\n\nopt for an administrative, rather than judicial, decision of his\n\nretaliation claim. See Charland v. Muzi Motors, Inc., 417 Mass. at\n\n583-85, 631 N.E.2d at 557-58.   That Martins chose not withdraw his\n\nMCAD complaint and to pursue this retaliation claim in his state\n\ncourt defamation suit, however, does not mean that he did not have\n\na full and fair opportunity to present this retaliation claim in\n\nstate court.   It only means that he failed to take advantage of the\n\nopportunity that was available to him.    That failure on Martins's\n\npart does not prevent the application of claim preclusion here.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",

System of Tenn., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746903\"><a href=\"/opinion/746903/wilton-e-heyliger-v-state-university-and-community-college-system-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855-56\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f(6th Cir. 1997) (holding that claim preclusion, under Tennessee\n\nlaw, applied to bar Title VII claim because plaintiff could have\n\ntimely sought EEOC right-to-sue letter and folded the Title VII\n\nclaim into his state court civil rights action); Woods v.

He was certainly within his rights to\n\nopt for an administrative, rather than judicial, decision of his\n\nretaliation claim. See Charland v. Muzi Motors, Inc., 417 Mass. at\n\n583-85, 631 N.E.2d at 557-58.   That Martins chose not withdraw his\n\nMCAD complaint and to pursue this retaliation claim in his state\n\ncourt defamation suit, however, does not mean that he did not have\n\na full and fair opportunity to present this retaliation claim in\n\nstate court.   It only means that he failed to take advantage of the\n\nopportunity that was available to him.    That failure on Martins's\n\npart does not prevent the application of claim preclusion here.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f</pre>",
