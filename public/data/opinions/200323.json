Michael A.

This case involves a motor\n\nvehicle accident, in which defendant-appellee Lynn Dobert struck a\n\ngasoline tanker driven by plaintiff-appellant Aaron Staelens, who\n\nthree to five hours after the collision injured his knee when he\n\ntripped   over   a   piece    of   equipment   left   by   a   state   employee\n\ninvestigating the accident.         Staelens and his wife sued Dobert and\n\nher husband, alleging that Dobert's negligence proximately caused\n\nStaelens's injuries.     The district court granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of the Doberts; we affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            As this case comes to us on a grant of summary judgment,\n\nwe relate the facts in the light most favorable to the Staelens,\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in their favor.                 Crawford v.\n\nLamantia, 34 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1994).             At approximately 6:00\n\np.m., on December 17, 1997, Dobert negligently drove her automobile\n\ninto a gasoline tanker driven by Staelens. State Police, including\n\nan accident reconstruction team, firefighters, and an ambulance\n\narrived on scene.        Although Staelens escaped injury from the\n\nimpact, Dobert did not, and was transported from the scene by an\n\nambulance.       After       the   reconstruction     team     completed    its\n\ninvestigation, a Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") inspector\n\narrived to inspect the tanker.              Finished with inspecting the\n\ntanker's lights, the DOT inspector told Staelens that he could turn\n\nthem off.    As Staelens approached the door to the cab, he stepped\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fon a creeper,1 which had been left out by the DOT inspector, fell\n\nonto his back, and injured his knee.                       Staelens's fall occurred\n\nthree to five hours after the initial impact.\n\n                  After limited discovery, the Doberts filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, contending that the DOT inspector's negligence\n\nwas an intervening and superseding cause that relieved the Doberts\n\nof liability.            The district court agreed and granted the motion\n\nsolely on that ground.2\n\n                                              II.\n\n                  Under Massachusetts law, \"[i]n addition to being the\n\ncause in fact of the injury [the but for cause], the plaintiff must\n\nshow that the negligent conduct was a proximate or legal cause of\n\nthe injury as well.\"            Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 320, 771\n\nN.E.2d 770 (2002).             To establish proximate cause, a plaintiff must\n\nshow       that    his    or    her     injuries    were    within   the    reasonably\n\nforeseeable risks of harm created by the defendant's negligent\n\nconduct.

Generally,     intervening\n\nnegligent conduct of a third person will not relieve the original\n\ntortfeasor         from     liability     where     such   conduct   was   reasonably\n\n\n\n       1\n      A creeper is a flat board with underlying wheels used to\ninspect the underside of a vehicle.\n       2\n      The negligence of the relevant actors--Dobert, the DOT\ninspector, and Staelens--was not an issue before the district\ncourt.\n\n                                              -3-\n\fforeseeable. Poskus, 423 Mass. at 639-40, 670 N.E.2d 383; Jesionek\n\nv. Mass. Port Authority, 376 Mass. 101, 105-06, 378 N.E.2d 995\n\n(1978).\n\n          Although the question of proximate cause--i.e., whether\n\na risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable--is ordinarily for the\n\njury, summary judgment may be appropriate when the evidence and the\n\nreasonable inferences drawn therefrom lead to but one conclusion.\n\nKent, 437 Mass. at 320-22, 771 N.E.2d 770; Poskus, 423 Mass. at\n\n636-41, 670 N.E.2d 383; Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 400 Mass.\n\n837, 842, 512 N.E.2d 272 (1987).     This is such a case: no jury\n\ncould conclude that it was reasonably foreseeable that, three to\n\nfive hours after the collision, Staelens would trip over a piece of\n\nequipment brought to the scene sometime after the accident by a\n\nstate employee inspecting the tanker.    Staelens suffered no injury\n\nfrom the collision itself nor from any risk of harm resulting\n\ntherefrom; e.g., he did not slip on fluids or trip over debris from\n\nthe vehicles involved in the accident.   Instead, Staelens's injury\n\nresulted from an independent agency, the DOT inspector's conduct,\n\nafter the risks of harm resulting from Dobert's negligent conduct\n\nhad come to rest.   Indeed, as we have said, three to five hours\n\npassed without incident.\n\n          To find in favor of Staelens would be to substantially\n\nextend the scope of reasonable foreseeability as set forth in\n\nMassachusetts case law and stretch the concept beyond reason, a\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fcourse we decline to follow.              Dobert did not become an insurer of\n\nStaelens's safety against all conceivable harms merely because she\n\nstruck   the   tanker         he    was   driving.          As    instructed      by    the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, \"[t]here must be limits to\n\nthe scope or definition of reasonable foreseeability based on\n\nconsiderations of policy and pragmatic judgment.\"                             Poskus, 423\n\nMass. at 640, 670 N.E.2d 383; see also Kent, 437 Mass. at 320-21,\n\n771 N.E.2d 770; Dan B.

This is such a case: no jury could conclude that it was reasonably foreseeable that, three to five hours after the collision, Staelens would trip over a piece of equipment brought to the scene sometime after the accident by a state employee inspecting the tanker. Staelens suffered no injury from the collision itself nor from any risk of harm resulting therefrom; <i>e.g.,</i> he did not slip on fluids or trip over debris from the vehicles involved in the accident. Instead, Staelens's injury resulted from an independent agency, the DOT inspector's conduct, after the risks of harm resulting from Dobert's negligent conduct had come to rest. Indeed, as we have said, three to five hours passed without incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To find in favor of Staelens would be to substantially extend the scope of reasonable foreseeability as set forth in Massachusetts case law and stretch the concept beyond reason, a course we decline to follow. Dobert did not become an insurer of Staelens's safety against all conceivable harms merely because she struck the tanker he was driving. As instructed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, \"[t]here must be limits to the scope or definition of reasonable foreseeability based on considerations of policy and pragmatic judgment.\" <i>Poskus,</i> 423 Mass. at 640, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span>; <i>see also Kent,</i> 437 Mass. at 320-21, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></span>; Dan B.

Otherwise, liability would extend endlessly, one harm leading inevitably to others. In sum, the undisputed facts would not permit a fairminded jury to conclude that Staelens's injuries were within the reasonably foreseeable risks of harm resulting from Dobert's negligent conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed, costs to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A creeper is a flat board with underlying wheels used to inspect the underside of a vehicle</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The negligence of the relevant actors &#8212; Dobert, the DOT inspector, and Staelens &#8212; was not an issue before the district court</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
