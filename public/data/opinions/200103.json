Gilberto Gierbolini-Ortiz, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Radamés A. Torruella, with whom Maggie Correa-Avilés and\nMcConnell Valdes were on brief, for appellant.\n\n    José F. Quetglas for appellee.\n\n\n                        August 28, 2002\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Gina Marrero filed this employment\n\ndiscrimination action against her former employer, Goya of Puerto\n\nRico, Inc. (Goya), under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.       Marrero alleged that sexual harassment\n\nby her former supervisor, Ramón Cárdenas, created a hostile work\n\nenvironment; that Goya retaliated against her when she complained\n\nabout Cárdenas's behavior; and that, as a result of the retaliation\n\nand continuing harassment, she was forced to resign.            She sought\n\ncompensatory damages, back pay, and punitive damages.\n\n            The case proceeded to trial, and at the close of the\nevidence Goya moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50\n\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.       Goya argued, first, that\nmuch of the alleged harassment fell outside Title VII's statute of\nlimitations, leaving events within the limitations period that did\n\nnot rise to the level of a hostile work environment.        Second, Goya\nmaintained that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to\nsupport Marrero's claims of retaliation and constructive discharge,\n\nand her request for punitive damages.        Finally, it urged the court\nto enter judgment in its favor on the basis of the affirmative\ndefense recognized in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775\n\n(1998), and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742\n(1998), for cases involving sexual harassment by a supervisor.\n            The district court deferred judgment on the motion and\n\nsubmitted    the   case   to   the   jury.    After   several    hours   of\ndeliberations, the jury returned a verdict in Marrero's favor,\n\nawarding her $175,000 in compensatory damages, $11,250 in back pay,\n\n                                     -2-\n\fand $75,000 in punitive damages.                 Goya duly renewed its Rule 50\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a\n\nnew trial.       This time, the district court rejected the motion,\nconcluding that Goya had forfeited the statute of limitations\n\ndefense; that there was ample evidence to support the jury's\n\nfindings of a hostile work environment and retaliation, its award\nof back pay for constructive discharge, and the punitive damages;\n\nand    that    the     jury   reasonably        concluded    that    Goya   had    not\n\nestablished      the    elements     of    the    Faragher/Ellerth      affirmative\n\ndefense.\n\n              We review de novo the court's denial of Goya's motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law.              White v. N.H. Dep't of Corrections,\n\n221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2000).                 Like the district court, we\nexamine the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable\n\nto    Marrero.       Id.      We   \"may    not   consider    the     credibility   of\n\nwitnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight\nof the evidence.\"          Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).                   We must affirm unless\n\n\"reasonable persons could not have reached the conclusion that the\n\njury embraced.\" Negron-Rivera v. Rivera-Claudio, 204 F.3d 287, 290\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).        We review the district court's denial of Goya's\n\nrequest for a new trial for an abuse of discretion, recognizing\n\nthat \"[a] new trial should be ordered only if the court believes\n\nthat the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such\n\nthat    upholding      the    verdict     will   result     in   a   miscarriage   of\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fjustice.\"   Ramos v. Davis & Geck, Inc., 167 F.3d 727, 731 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n            We conclude that Marrero's hostile work environment claim\nwas supported by sufficient evidence and was not barred by the\n\nstatute of limitations.             We also conclude that Goya was not\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Faragher/Ellerth\n\naffirmative   defense,    or    the    issue   of   constructive   discharge.\n\nHowever, we hold that the district court erred in accepting the\n\nverdict for Marrero on her claim of retaliation.              Because it is\n\nimpossible to determine what portion (if any) of the compensatory\n\nand punitive damages awards was based on the jury's erroneous\n\nfinding of retaliation, we remand for a new trial on damages.\n\n                               I.    BACKGROUND\n\n            The jury could have found the following facts.1           Marrero\n\nbegan work at Goya in April of 1995, where she served as a\nsecretary in the Sales Department, under the supervision of Ramón\nCárdenas, the Vice President for sales. Marrero also had duties in\n\nthe Exports Department, where her supervisor was Wilberto Rivera\nand -- later -- José Luis Diaz.\n            Marrero was subjected to sexual harassment by Cárdenas\n\nthroughout her tenure at Goya.         The harassment consisted primarily\nof sexual comments, often accompanied by lascivious looks and\noffensive gestures.      Cárdenas also would contrive to \"bump into\"\n\nMarrero in the narrow hallway between their work spaces, and on\n\n\n     1\n      We provide a sense of the case here.            We provide more detail\nin the relevant sections of the opinion.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fseveral occasions rubbed his body against hers as she used the\n\nphotocopier machine.\n\n           In the summer of 1995, Marrero confronted Cárdenas about\nhis behavior.    After a brief respite, the harassment began again,\n\nnow accompanied by more \"vulgar\" comments made \"with a gross tone.\"\n\nIn addition, Cárdenas began to criticize Marrero for work-related\nmatters.   He would scold her for no reason, sometimes yelling at\n\nher in front of other employees. On other occasions Cárdenas would\n\nstartle Marrero by slapping her desk with his fist; he then would\n\nask, \"Aren't you tough?       Are you scared?\"\n\n           Cárdenas also used his authority to \"punish\" Marrero in\n\nseveral ways.    He often gave her extra work just as she was leaving\n\nfor the day, making her stay extra hours without pay for overtime.\nAlthough he was aware that she was hypoglycemic, Cárdenas changed\n\nMarrero's lunch hour so that she was forced to work for more than\n\nfive hours without a break.          He also used his power in more petty\nways, such as refusing Marrero's requests to leave her desk to use\n\nthe bathroom.\n\n           Cárdenas's       conduct     made     Marrero   feel    \"offended,\n\nhumiliated, embarrassed, depressed.\"           By the fall of 1995, she had\n\nbecome   \"very   anxious,     very    nervous\"    at   work.      Marrero   had\n\ndifficulty concentrating; she \"had to make a super-human effort\" in\n\norder to perform her duties.\n\n           In    December    of   1995,     Marrero    suffered    a   nervous\n\nbreakdown. She \"couldn't function the way [she] was feeling.\" Her\n\nfamily physician prescribed antidepressants and tranquilizers, and\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\freferred her to a psychiatrist, Dr. Fernando Cabrera.   Marrero met\n\nwith Dr. Cabrera several times during December, 1995, and January,\n\n1996.   During her first visit, she mentioned that Cárdenas was\nbothering and pressuring her at work, but she did not provide any\n\ndetails. Dr. Cabrera described Marrero as \"disorganized, confused,\n\nand unable to talk in a coherent and logical way\" about what was\nbothering her.     He diagnosed a major depression with psychotic\n\nfeatures and a panic disorder, and recommended that Marrero take a\n\nfive-week medical leave from work.    During that time, he treated\n\nher aggressively with antidepressants, tranquilizers, and anti-\n\npsychotic drugs.\n\n           Marrero returned to work on February 5, 1996.   She did\n\nnot feel that she had recovered fully, but \"needed the money\" from\nwork.   She was greeted by more of the same harassment by Cárdenas.\n\nHe continued to make sexual comments, and \"was always getting on\n\n[Marrero's] case.\"\n           Eventually, the situation \"became intolerable,\" and on\n\nAugust 15, 1996, Marrero suffered another emotional breakdown. She\n\nwas taken by a Goya nurse to the emergency ward of a psychiatric\n\nhospital, and from there to Dr. Cabrera's office. Marrero told Dr.\n\nCabrera \"I cannot work anymore\" and that Cárdenas was \"making her\n\nfeel bad.\"   Dr. Cabrera interviewed the Goya nurse, who confirmed\n\nthat it \"was true, that [Marrero] was being harassed by . . . Mr.\n\nCárdenas.\"    Dr. Cabrera issued a medical certificate to Goya\n\nexcusing Marrero from work for two weeks.   The certificate stated\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fthat Marrero was suffering from \"depression and anxiety caused by\n\nwork.\"\n\n            Marrero returned to work after two weeks of sick leave.\nAgain, she was subjected to continuing harassment by Cárdenas,\n\nculminating in the events of October 31, 1996.                   Cárdenas told\n\nMarrero that he was going out to buy Halloween presents.                  He gave\nher \"a direct penetrating look with lust,\" and said:                  \"I have a\n\nlittle present for you that you're never going to forget and if you\n\ndon't do the things I tell you and order you to do I am going to\n\nfire     you.\"       Marrero     interpreted   that    comment   as   a    sexual\n\ninvitation, and a threat that if she did not submit, she would be\n\nfired.\n\n             Marrero immediately reported the incident to Diaz (her\nsupervisor in the Exports Department).                 Marrero had discussed\n\nCárdenas's behavior with Diaz previously, as she had with his\n\npredecessor, Rivera.           She also had complained to Remigio Nieves,\nthe Vice President of the Human Resources Department.                 Following\n\nthe \"Halloween presents\" incident, Marrero sent a memo to Nieves,\n\nrequesting       a   copy   of    Goya's   policy     on   discrimination     and\n\nharassment.      When Nieves did not respond, Marrero decided to seek\n\nadvice from the Department of Labor for the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico. She met with Nieves several days later and informed him that\n\nshe planned to file a formal grievance.\n\n             Marrero went on sick leave from November 13 to 20, 1996.\n\nDuring that time, she filed a charge of sexual harassment with the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Cárdenas and\n\nGoya.    She also retained legal counsel.\n\n            Marrero returned to work on Wednesday, November 20. That\nmorning, she met with Nieves and Goya's in-house counsel, Horacio\n\nCabrera. The three discussed Marrero's problems with Cárdenas, and\n\nMarrero confirmed that she had filed a charge with the EEOC.\nNieves   then    handed     her    a    letter    stating       that   she     had   been\n\ntransferred to the Human Resources Department, where she would\n\nserve as his secretary.            In that job, Marrero would no longer be\n\nunder Cárdenas's direct supervision; however, her new desk would be\n\napproximately the same distance from Cárdenas's office as her\n\noriginal   location.         She       asked    Nieves    why    she   could     not   be\n\ntransferred      to   an   available         secretarial    position      in    another\nbuilding, away from Cárdenas.             Nieves responded that the decision\n\nhad been made; he urged her to view the transfer as a promotion.\n\n            In her new position as Nieves's secretary, Marrero would\nperform largely the same duties as she had as secretary for the\n\nSales and Exports Departments.               Nevertheless, Nieves told her that\n\nshe would have to undergo a probationary period \"to see whether\n\n[she]    could    perform    the       new     duties.\"         Marrero   viewed       the\n\nprobationary period as a threat to her job security.\n\n            Marrero remained at the new position for the final two\n\ndays of the work week.       She was trained by Maritza Ramos, secretary\n\nto the President of Goya. Marrero felt threatened by Ramos, who --\n\ntogether with Nieves -- subjected her to \"extreme supervision.\"\n\nMoreover, Cárdenas continued to bother Marrero in her new position.\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fHe stared at her, made faces, and laughed at her.                 At one point he\n\nsaid, \"[you] thought [I] was going to be screwed,\" but \"it was\n\n[you] who ended up screwed.\"\n           As   a    result    of   the    continuing      harassment     and   the\n\nhostility she felt in her new job, and acting on advice from Dr.\n\nCabrera, Marrero did not return to work after Friday, November 22.\nShe hoped that she would be able to go back to Goya once her\n\nemotional condition improved.           However, by March of 1997 -- after\n\ncontinuous psychiatric treatment, and on the recommendation of Dr.\n\nCabrera -- Marrero decided she had no choice but to resign.                     She\n\ngave   notice   of   her     retirement       on   March   24,   1997.     Shortly\n\nthereafter, she filed a second charge with the EEOC alleging\n\nretaliation and constructive discharge.\n\n                      II.     HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT\n\n           Marrero's        complaint     alleged,     inter     alia,   that   the\nconstant sexual harassment by Cárdenas created a hostile work\nenvironment actionable under Title VII.                In order to prevail on\n\nthat claim, she had to establish that the harassment was so \"severe\nor pervasive\" as to alter the terms of her employment, creating a\nwork environment that was both objectively hostile and perceived as\n\nhostile by Marrero herself.          Faragher, 524 U.S. at 786 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).           As explained below, we conclude that\nthere was sufficient evidence to support the verdict.                    Before we\n\nreach that issue, however, we first must address Goya's argument\nthat Marrero's hostile work environment claim is barred by the\n\nstatute of limitations.\n\n                                        -9-\n\f            A.       Statute of Limitations\n\n            Under Title VII, a plaintiff must file a charge with the\n\nEEOC \"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurred.\"                 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e).            In a\n\n\"deferral   jurisdiction\"         such    as    Puerto    Rico,   that    period    is\n\nextended to 300 days.        See id. § 2000e-5(e)(1); Mohasco Corp. v.\n\nSilver, 447 U.S. 807, 814 n.16 (1980).2                  Here, Marrero filed her\n\nhostile work environment charge on November 13, 1996.                       Counting\n\nback 300 days, Goya maintains that she can recover only for events\n\noccurring on or after January 18, 1996.\n            The first time Goya presented that argument in any detail\n\nwas in its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, filed at\nthe close of Marrero's case.              Marrero responded on two fronts.\nFirst,   she     argued    that    Goya     had      forfeited    the    statute    of\n\nlimitations      defense   by     failing       to   raise   it   earlier    in    the\n\n\n     2\n       As we have explained elsewhere:\n     The full story is more complicated, in part because\n     § 2000e-5(e) interacts with § 2000e-5(c), which imposes\n     a sixty-day waiting period between the filing of a charge\n     with state or local authorities and the filing of a\n     charge with the EEOC[.]     A complainant in a deferral\n     State . . . need only file his charge within 240 days of\n     the alleged discriminatory employment practice in order\n     to insure that his federal rights will be preserved. If\n     a complainant files later than that (but not more than\n     300 days after the practice complained of), his right to\n     seek relief under Title VII will nonetheless be preserved\n     if the State happens to complete its consideration of the\n     charge prior to the 300-day period.\nThomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 47 n.5 (1st Cir. 1999)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n     Those subtleties are of no import here. Marrero filed her\ncharge less than one month after one of the instances of harassment\nthat makes up her hostile work environment claim. As we explain\nbelow, that is enough to satisfy the statute of limitations here.\n\n                                         -10-\n\flitigation.          Second,   she    maintained       that   her   hostile    work\n\nenvironment      claim   was     governed    by   the    so-called      \"continuing\n\nviolation doctrine,\" and therefore was immune from Title VII's time\nbar.     Under the continuing violation doctrine, Marrero argued, a\n\nplaintiff may recover for events outside the 300-day limitations\n\nperiod    \"if    they    are   deemed     part    of    an    ongoing    series   of\ndiscriminatory acts and there is some violation within the statute\n\nof limitations period that anchors the earlier claims.\"                    O'Rourke\n\nv. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 730 (1st Cir. 2001)                  (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).            Marrero contended that the \"chain\" of\n\nharassment      by   Cárdenas,    which     continued    into    the    limitations\n\nperiod, satisfied that standard.\n\n             Goya did not dispute that Marrero's allegations of sexual\nharassment, if true, would satisfy the relatedness requirement of\n\nthe continuing violation doctrine. It emphasized, however, that we\n\nhad refused to apply the continuing violation doctrine in cases\nwhere the plaintiff was \"aware that [she] was being unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated against while the earlier acts, now untimely, were\n\ntaking place.\"       Provencher v. CVS Pharm., 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    Goya insisted that Marrero was aware of the discrimination\n\nat least as early as December of 1995, when -- according to her own\n\ntestimony -- she suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of\n\nCárdenas's behavior.       Thus, Goya argued that Marrero was obligated\n\nto file a charge within the next 300 days and, having failed to do\n\nso, could not recover for the earlier (now untimely) events.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f          The    district      court    did    not   address   the   merits   of\n\nMarrero's continuing violation claim, or Goya's response. Instead,\n\nit held that Goya had forfeited its statute of limitations defense\nby failing to raise it earlier in the proceedings.               We express no\n\nview on the forfeiture issue because the Supreme Court's recent\n\ndecision in National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 122 S. Ct.\n\n2061 (2002), makes clear that Goya's statute of limitations defense\n\nfails on its merits.\n\n             In Morgan, the Court distinguished between hostile work\n\nenvironment     claims   and     claims       involving   discrete    acts    of\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation, such as a discharge, failure to\n\npromote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire.               Id. at 2070-72.\n\nAs noted, a Title VII plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC\nwithin 300 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice\n\noccurred.\"    42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e).          The Court reasoned that \"[a]\n\ndiscrete retaliatory or discriminatory act 'occurred'\" for purposes\nof the statute of limitations \"on the day that it 'happened.'\"\n\nMorgan, 122 S. Ct. at 2070.        Therefore, the plaintiff must file a\n\ncharge within 300 days \"of the date of the act or lose the ability\n\nto recover for it.\"      Id. at 2071.\n\n          Hostile work environment claims are different. A hostile\n\nwork environment, the Court explained, is created by \"repeated\n\nconduct\" -- \"a series of separate acts that collectively constitute\n\none 'unlawful employment practice.'\"             Id. at 2073-74 (quoting 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)).       As such, hostile work environment claims\n\ndo not \"turn on single acts but on an aggregation of hostile acts\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fextending over a period of time.\"           Havercombe v. Dep't of Educ.,\n\n250 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).              It follows that the \"unlawful\n\nemployment practice\" that triggers the statute of limitations\noccurs, not \"on any particular day,\" but \"over a series of days or\n\nperhaps years.\"      Morgan, 122 S. Ct. at 2073.          Thus, the Court\n\nconcluded, the statute of limitations is satisfied as long as the\nplaintiff files a charge within 300 days of one of the many acts\n\nthat, taken together, created the hostile work environment.\n\n          In so holding, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the\n\nview -- advanced by Goya here -- that \"the plaintiff may not base\n\na suit on individual acts that occurred outside the statute of\n\nlimitations unless it would have been unreasonable to expect the\n\nplaintiff to sue before the statute ran on such conduct.\"             Id. at\n\n2075.    Title    VII,    the    Court   explained,   \"does   not   separate\n\nindividual acts that are part of the hostile work environment claim\n\nfrom the whole for purposes of timely filing and liability.\"             Id.\n\nRather, the \"incidents comprising a hostile work environment are\n\npart of one unlawful employment practice\" and, in order to comply\n\nwith the statute of limitations, \"the employee need only file a\n\ncharge within [300] days of any act that is part of the hostile\n\nwork environment.\"       Id.    That standard clearly is satisfied here:\n\nMarrero filed her charge on November 13, 1996, less than one month\n\nafter the \"Halloween presents\" incident.\n\n          B.       Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          Goya argues that, even if the jury was entitled to\n\nconsider Cárdenas's conduct throughout the course of Marrero's\n\n                                     -13-\n\femployment, the evidence was insufficient to establish harassment\n\nof the requisite severity or pervasiveness.              Although it does not\n\ndispute that Marrero subjectively perceived her work environment as\nhostile and abusive, Goya insists that any harassment by Cárdenas,\n\nwhile perhaps \"inappropriate,\" was too \"mild[]\" to create an\n\nobjectively hostile work environment.             We disagree.\n             There is no \"mathematically precise test\" for determining\n\nwhen conduct in the workplace moves beyond the \"merely offensive\"\n\nand enters     the   realm      of   unlawful    discrimination.        Harris v.\n\nForklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).             Rather, the question\n\nwhether the environment is objectively \"hostile or abusive\" must be\n\nanswered by reference to \"all the circumstances,\" including the\n\n\"frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it\nis physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;     and   whether         it   unreasonably   interferes      with   an\n\nemployee's work performance.\"               Id. at 23.      \"Subject to some\npolicing at the outer bounds,\" it is for the jury to weigh those\n\nfactors and decide whether the harassment was of a kind or to a\ndegree that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected\n\nthe   conditions     of   her    employment.       Gorski   v.   N.H.   Dep't   of\n\nCorrections, 290 F.3d 466, 474 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Here, the jury reasonably could have found that Marrero\n\nwas subjected to harassment on a daily basis, including humiliating\n\nsexual remarks and innuendos.              For example, Cárdenas constantly\n\nreferred to Marrero as \"the redhead\" and frequently made comments\n\nsuch as \"the redhead is really hot,\" \"the redhead is on fire,\" or\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f\"if this is what hell is like then the devil can take me with him.\"\n\nCárdenas also made repeated comments about Marrero's lips, legs,\n\nand clothing. He even used Marrero's hypoglycemia as an avenue for\ninnuendo:     making a reference to his diabetes, Cárdenas told her\n\n\"what goes down in you goes up in me,\" and asked her \"are you sweet\n\nto men?\"    At other times, Cárdenas was more explicit: he once asked\nMarrero \"what are you going to do with the thing you have between\n\nyour legs?\"     Finally, the jury could have found that Cárdenas's\n\n\"Halloween presents\" comment was a sexual invitation, coupled with\n\na threat that Marrero would be fired if she did not accept.\n\n             Taken together, such comments support the jury's finding\n\nof a hostile work environment.            See O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 729\n\n(\"Evidence     of    sexual    remarks,     innuendoes,    ridicule,     and\nintimidation may be sufficient to support a jury verdict for a\n\nhostile work environment.\"); White, 221 F.3d at 260-61 (finding a\n\nhostile work environment where, inter alia, \"disgusting comments\"\nand conversations occurred \"everyday\"). It bears emphasis that the\n\nharassment here was more or less constant from Marrero's first day\nof work in April of 1995 until she left in November of 1996.           Thus,\n\nthis case is easily distinguished from those in which courts have\n\nrefused to find a hostile work environment based solely on sexual\n\ncomments that are few and far between.            See, e.g., Chamberlin v.\n\n101 Realty, Inc., 915 F.2d 777, 783 (1st Cir. 1990) (expressing\n\ndoubt as to whether five sexual comments made over the course of a\n\nfour   to   five    week   period   constituted    harassment   severe   and\n\npervasive enough to create a hostile work environment). As we have\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fobserved elsewhere, \"[t]he workplace is not a cocoon, and those who\n\nlabor in it are expected to have reasonably thick skins.\"             Suarez\n\nv. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2000).            However,\nit is one thing to say that employees must learn to tolerate\n\n\"simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless\n\nextremely serious).\" Faragher, 524 U.S. at 778 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).           It is quite another to require\n\nemployees    to   suffer   the   constant   attentions   of   a   lascivious\n\nsupervisor.\n\n            Nor did Cárdenas limit himself to a purely private\n\ndialogue.     He also discussed Marrero's appearance with other\n\nemployees.    For example, he told Marrero's co-workers that she\n\n\"would be the model that would be used for any future female\nemployees that Goya would hire.\"       Another time, Cárdenas invited a\n\nmale employee to assess what sort of underwear Marrero was wearing\n\nunder her skirt.     It was hardly unreasonable for Marrero to find\nsuch behavior humiliating.\n\n            Marrero also testified that Cárdenas subjected her to\n\nunwelcome physical touching.         On approximately five occasions,\n\nCárdenas made full \"body to body\" contact with her in the hallway.\n\nAt other times, he would just \"brush[] by\" her, or would stand in\n\nher way and -- when she tried to pass him -- pretend that they were\n\ndancing. When Marrero had to use the photocopier machine, Cárdenas\n\noften hovered over her with his hands on her shoulders, or stood\n\nclose by, rubbing the side of his body against her.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f              On other occasions, Cárdenas harassed Marrero in ways\n\nthat   were    not    explicitly      sexual.      Using   his   power    as   her\n\nsupervisor,     he    altered   her    work   hours    knowing   that    it   would\nexacerbate her hypoglycemia. He often stood at her desk and stared\n\nangrily at her, and when she did not pay attention to him he would\n\npound her desk with his fist to startle her.                 He criticized her\nwork unfairly, sometimes embarrassing her by yelling at her in\n\nfront of her co-workers.           Our cases make clear that, \"where a\n\nplaintiff endures harassing conduct, although not explicitly sexual\n\nin nature, which undermines her ability to succeed at her job,\n\nthose acts should be considered along with overtly sexually abusive\n\nconduct in assessing a hostile work environment claim.\"                 O'Rourke,\n\n235 F.3d at 729.\n              Finally, there was evidence from which the jury could\n\nhave found that Marrero's work was adversely affected by the\n\nharassment.        She became anxious and depressed, and often found it\ndifficult     to    concentrate.       Marrero's      supervisors   noticed     the\n\nchange, and -- after the first few months of her employment -- her\n\nperformance evaluations dropped from \"excellent\" to \"regular.\"\n\n              In sum, there was ample evidence to support the verdict\n\non Marrero's hostile work environment claim.                As we noted at the\n\noutset, \"[o]verriding a jury verdict is warranted only if the\n\nevidence is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to\n\njudgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\"\n\nColasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 100 F.3d 203, 208 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is not the state of\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fthe evidence in this case.         Accordingly, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's denial of Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law on\n\nthe hostile work environment claim.\n\n                    III.   GOYA'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n            Goya argues, next, that it cannot be held liable for\n\nCárdenas's behavior even if a hostile work environment existed. As\n\na general rule, an employer is vicariously liable for an actionable\n\nhostile work environment created by a supervisor.              See Faragher,\n\n524 U.S. at 807; Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 765.              However, the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized an affirmative defense to employer liability\nthat \"look[s] to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as\n\nwell as that of [the] plaintiff victim.\"               Faragher, 524 U.S. at\n781; see also Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 765 (describing the affirmative\n\ndefense).    Goya maintains that it established that affirmative\n\ndefense here, and that the district court erred in denying its\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law on that ground.\n            The    Faragher/Ellerth    affirmative        defense   has   two\n\nnecessary elements, and the employer bears the burden of proof as\nto both.    Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807-08; Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 765.\n\nFirst, the employer must show that it \"exercised reasonable care to\n\nprevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\"\nEllerth, 524 U.S. at 765.       That requirement typically is addressed\nby proof that the employer \"had promulgated an antiharassment\n\npolicy with [a] complaint procedure.\"            Id.    Second, the employer\nmust establish \"that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to\n\ntake   advantage    of   any   preventive   or   corrective    opportunities\n\n                                    -18-\n\fprovided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"               Id.   That\n\nprong is usually addressed by proof that the plaintiff unreasonably\n\nignored an established complaint procedure.3\n           Thus, the availability of the affirmative defense often\n\nwill turn on whether the employer had established and disseminated\n\nan anti-discrimination policy, complete with a known complaint\nprocedure.   Such was the case here.       As the district court observed\n\nin denying Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law, \"[o]ne of\n\nthe most hotly contested issues in [the] case, and which depended\n\nentirely   on   the   credibility   of     the   witnesses,   was   precisely\n\nwhether . . . Goya had in effect a policy against discrimination\n\nand whether it installed posters to that end.\"\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       The defense is not a bar to liability for a \"tangible\nemployment action\" (such as \"hiring, firing, failing to promote,\nreassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a\ndecision causing a significant change in benefits\") that would be\nactionable under Title VII independent of a hostile work\nenvironment. Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 761. Citing that rule, Goya\nargues that the district court erred in instructing the jury that\nMarrero had alleged that an \"adverse action\" had been taken against\nher.   It maintains that, because of that instruction, the jury\nmight have thought that Goya was not entitled to the affirmative\ndefense. That argument need not detain us. Marrero did attempt to\nprove that Goya took adverse action against her: she hoped to show\nthat Goya (not Cárdenas) retaliated against her and constructively\ndischarged her. But the jury instructions made clear that Goya\nstill could avoid liability for Marrero's hostile work environment\nclaim (which did not involve allegations of a tangible employment\naction) if it proved the two elements described above. The verdict\nform shows that the jury rejected the affirmative defense, not\nbecause Marrero proved a \"tangible employment action,\" but because,\nin the words of the verdict form, Goya failed to prove that it had\n\"exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any\nsexually harassing behavior\" and that \"Marrero unreasonably failed\nto take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities\nprovided by Goya.\"\n\n                                    -19-\n\f            On the one hand, Marrero and her co-worker Zelma Miranda-\n\nRivera   testified   that   they   did    not   receive    any   orientation\n\nregarding sex discrimination; that they were not given any written\npolicy on sexual harassment or available grievance procedures; that\n\nthey were not aware of any complaint procedure; and that they never\n\nsaw   any    anti-harassment   literature       posted    anywhere   in   the\nworkplace.     Marrero also testified, without contradiction, that\n\nGoya ignored her request -- first lodged on October 31, 1996 -- for\n\na copy of the company's anti-discrimination policy.\n\n            On the other hand, Nieves testified that Goya had asked\n\nan outside law firm to draft a written policy on sexual harassment,\n\nand that it received that policy in August or September of 1995.\n\nThe policy was not dated, however, and on cross-examination Marrero\nestablished that Nieves had stated in his deposition that he used\n\nthe same policy during Marrero's orientation in April of 1995\n\n(several months before he later claimed to have received it).\nMoreover, although the policy had a signature line so that the\n\nemployee could certify that she had received it, Goya could not\n\nproduce a copy signed by Marrero. Nieves testified that Goya never\n\nasked its employees to sign the policy.\n\n             Nieves also testified that Goya began to use anti-sexual\n\nharassment posters in 1991, 1992, or 1993 -- he was not sure when.\n\nNieves stated that the posters were placed all around Goya's\n\nfacilities, including the glass doors of the entrance to the lobby\n\n\"so that anyone who would go to Goya would be able to see the\n\nposter.\"    However, in the film of Goya's facilities that was shown\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fto the jury, there were no posters to be seen anywhere on the\n\npremises, including the glass doors of the lobby.\n\n            We   need    not   decide    which   party   presented   the   most\npersuasive testimony.          \"[I]t is for jurors, not judges, to weigh\n\nthe evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses.\" Ins. Co.\n\nof N. Am. v. Musa, 785 F.2d 370, 372 (1st Cir. 1986).                Thus, in\nreviewing the district court's denial of Goya's Rule 50 motion, we\n\n\"cannot evaluate the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in\n\ntestimony, or evaluate the weight of evidence.\"               Criado v. IBM\n\nCorp., 145 F.3d 437, 441 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    We can grant judgment as a matter of law only if \"the\n\nevidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nverdict, could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion,\nnamely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\"              Lama v.\n\nBorras, 16 F.3d 473, 477 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            That standard is especially exacting where, as here, the\nmoving party bears the burden of proof on the issue in question.\n\nSee Serv. Auto Supply Co. v. Harte & Co., Inc., 533 F.2d 23, 24\n\n(1st Cir. 1976).        We have said that the party with the burden of\n\nproof is entitled to judgment as a matter of law only if it has\n\nestablished its case by \"testimony that the jury is not at liberty\n\nto disbelieve.\"     Jordan v. United States Lines, Inc., 738 F.2d 48,\n\n49 (1st Cir. 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).                In that\n\nsituation, relief under Rule 50 is warranted only if the moving\n\nparty's evidence is \"'uncontradicted and unimpeached.'\" Serv. Auto\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fSupply Co., 533 F.2d at 25 (quoting Fed. Ins. Co. v. Summers, 403\n\nF.2d 971, 975-76 (1st Cir. 1968)).\n\n          Goya   has   not    satisfied    that    strict   standard   here.\nAlthough Goya's witnesses testified that the company had an anti-\n\ndiscrimination policy in place during the relevant period and that\n\nit disseminated the policy to its employees, that testimony was\ncontradicted by Marrero and her co-worker Miranda-Rivera and called\n\ninto question by the video tape and Nieves's conflicting statements\n\nduring his deposition.       The jury was \"at liberty to disbelieve\"\n\nGoya's witnesses, Jordan, 738 F.2d at 49, and to credit the\n\ntestimony by Marrero and Miranda-Rivera.\n\n          In order to qualify for judgment as a matter of law on\n\nits affirmative defense, Goya had to show that a reasonable jury\nwas compelled to find in its favor on both elements of the defense.\n\nWe have concluded that Goya has not satisfied that standard with\n\nrespect to the first prong -- the existence of an antiharassment\npolicy with a known complaint procedure.          Accordingly, we need not\n\nconsider whether the evidence presented at trial compelled a\nfinding in Goya's favor on the second prong.4           See Faragher, 524\n\nU.S. at 808.\n\n                             IV.   RETALIATION\n\n          Goya argues that there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport the jury's finding of retaliation.          In order to make out a\n\n\n     4\n       Nor need we consider Goya's claim that the district court\nerred in excluding certain evidence that, Goya insists, would have\nstrengthened its case under the second element of the affirmative\ndefense.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fprima facie case of retaliation, Marrero had to prove that (1) she\n\nengaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2) she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action was causally\nconnected       to   the   protected    activity.     Hernandez-Torres      v.\n\nIntercontinental Trading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nGoya does not dispute that Marrero engaged in conduct that is\nprotected by Title VII when she filed her sexual harassment charge.\n\nIt maintains, however, that Marrero never suffered an \"adverse\n\nemployment action\" as a result of that conduct.\n\n            We have explained that \"[a]dverse employment actions\n\ninclude    'demotions,      disadvantageous     transfers    or   assignments,\n\nrefusals to promote, unwarranted negative job evaluations, and\n\ntoleration of harassment by other employees.'\"              White, 221 F.3d at\n\n262 (quoting Hernandez-Torres, 158 F.3d at 47); accord Graham v.\n\nState Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1283 (11th Cir. 1999).\n\nWhether    an    employment    action   is    \"adverse\"    --   and   therefore\nactionable under Title VII -- is gauged by an objective standard.\n\nBlackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 725 (1st Cir. 1996).               \"Work places\n\nare rarely idyllic retreats, and the mere fact that an employee is\n\ndispleased by an employer's act or omission does not elevate that\n\nact or omission to the level of a materially adverse employment\n\naction.\"    Id.\n\n            Here, Marrero's retaliation claim rests on two separate,\n\nand allegedly adverse, employment actions:                her transfer to the\n\nHuman Resources Department; and Goya's toleration of harassment by\n\nother employees.       We address those claims in turn.\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f            A.          Disadvantageous Transfer\n\n            Marrero filed a charge of employment discrimination with\n\nthe EEOC on November 13, 1996.               She returned to work on Wednesday,\n\nNovember 22, to find that she had been transferred to the Human\n\nResources Department, where she was to serve as Nieves's secretary.\n\nMarrero   concedes       that    the    transfer     was    not,       on    its   face,   a\n\ndemotion.   She continued to serve as secretary to a Vice President\n\nin the company, and her general job description and salary remained\n\nthe same.        Nevertheless, Marrero argues that the transfer was\n\n\"disadvantageous\"        because       she    was   required      to    do    more   work,\nsubjected to \"extreme supervision,\" and forced to undergo a period\n\nof probation.\n            \"The    clear       trend    of    authority     is    to       hold   that    a\npurely lateral transfer, that is, a transfer that does not involve\n\na demotion in form or substance, cannot rise to the level of a\nmaterially adverse employment action.\"                    Ledergerber v. Stangler,\n\n122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); accord Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc., 97 F.3d\n\n876, 885 (6th Cir. 1996) (\"[R]eassignments without salary or work\nhour   changes     do    not    ordinarily      constitute     adverse         employment\n\ndecisions in employment discrimination claims.\").                            Similarly, a\ntransfer or reassignment that involves only minor changes in\nworking   conditions        normally         does   not    constitute         an   adverse\n\nemployment action. See Jones v. Fitzgerald, 285 F.3d 705, 714 (8th\n\nCir. 2002); Crady v. Liberty Nat'l Bank and Trust Co., 993 F.2d\n\n132, 136 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"[A] materially adverse change in the\n\n                                         -24-\n\fterms and conditions of employment must be more disruptive than a\n\nmere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.\").\n\n\"Otherwise       every     trivial        personnel          action    that    an\nirritable . . . employee did not like would form the basis of a\n\ndiscrimination suit.\"           Williams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 85\n\nF.3d 270, 274 (7th Cir. 1996).\n            At the same time, however, \"Title VII does not limit\n\nadverse job action to strictly monetary considerations.\"                 Collins\n\nv.   Illinois,   830     F.2d    692,   703    (7th   Cir.    1987).    Congress\n\nrecognized that job discrimination can take many forms, and does\n\nnot always manifest itself in easily documentable sanctions such as\n\nsalary   cuts    or    demotions.       Accordingly,     Congress      \"cast   the\n\nprohibitions of Title VII broadly\" to encompass changes in working\nconditions that are somewhat more subtle, but equally adverse.\n\nRodriguez v. Bd. of Educ., 620 F.2d 362, 364 (2d Cir. 1980).\n\nConsistent with that broad statutory mandate, courts have rejected\nany bright line rule that a transfer cannot qualify as an \"adverse\n\nemployment action\" unless it results in a diminution in salary or\na loss of benefits.\n\n            For example, the Second Circuit held in Rodriguez that\n\nthe district court erred in dismissing the sex discrimination suit\n\nof a junior high school art teacher who was transferred to an\n\nelementary school in the same system, notwithstanding the fact that\n\nthe transfer did not entail a reduction of salary or other monetary\n\nbenefits.    See id.     It emphasized that the plaintiff had spent her\n\nentire career teaching junior high school students, and in fact had\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\frecently earned a doctoral degree in art education with a focus on\n\nprograms for such students.           See id.    The art programs at the\n\nelementary    level,    the   court    explained,   \"were   so     profoundly\ndifferent from those in the junior high school as to render utterly\n\nuseless [the plaintiff's] twenty years of experience and study in\n\ndeveloping art programs for middle school children.\"             Id.    at 366.\nDescribing the transfer as \"a severe professional trauma,\" the\n\ncourt concluded that such a \"radical change in the nature of the\n\nwork [the plaintiff] was called upon to perform\" constituted an\n\nadverse employment action.       Id.\n\n            Similarly, the Seventh Circuit found adverse employment\n\naction in Collins, where the plaintiff was transferred from her\n\npost as a consultant in the \"development group\" at the Chicago\nPublic Library to a newly-created job in the library's reference\n\nunit.    830 F.2d at 704.     The court noted that the plaintiff's new\n\nsupervisors    in    the   reference     unit   \"seemed   unsure       of   what\nplaintiff's responsibility and authority would be.\" Id. Moreover,\n\nalthough the plaintiff previously had her own office, a telephone\n\nat her desk, printed business cards, and listings in professional\n\npublications as a library consultant, she lost those benefits after\n\nthe transfer.       See id.   In her new position, the plaintiff was\n\nplaced at a desk \"out in the open,\" where \"a receptionist's desk\n\ntypically would be located.\"          Id.    She \"had no telephone at her\n\ndesk with which she could conduct her business responsibilities.\"\n\nId.     She \"was not allowed to have business cards printed and she\n\nwas no longer listed in professional publications as a library\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fconsultant.\"   Id.       Finally, rather than doing the consulting work\n\nshe enjoyed, the plaintiff \"was relegated to doing reference work.\"\n\nId.\n          In contrast to cases such as Rodriguez and Collins, the\n\nevidence presented here showed -- at most -- that the transfer\n\nresulted in some minor, likely temporary, changes in Marrero's\nworking conditions. As we explained above, Marrero was transferred\n\nfrom the Sales and Exports Departments to the Human Resources\n\nDepartment, where she was to serve as Nieves's secretary. Although\n\nMarrero's basic job description and duties remained the same, the\n\njury could have found that she would have been required to do more\n\nwork after the transfer.          Marrero was the only employee who knew\n\nhow to prepare certain paper work for the Exports Department.\nTherefore, as a practical matter, she was forced to do that work\n\neven after she was transferred to the Human Resources Department\n\nand assumed her new duties there.          Marrero was not compensated for\nthat extra work.\n\n          Such a minor increase in work responsibilities is not\n\nenough to render a lateral transfer materially adverse.                 That is\n\nespecially true where, as here, there is no indication that the\n\nincrease would have been permanent.              Just as Marrero had to go\n\nthrough a training period in her new position, the employee who\n\nreplaced her in the Sales and Exports Departments would need to be\n\ntrained before     she    could    take   over   all   of   Marrero's   duties.\n\nHowever, Marrero testified that she could not remember whether she\n\nhad trained the employee who assumed her old post.              She conceded,\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fmoreover, that she never complained to Nieves or anyone else at\n\nGoya regarding her continuing work in the Exports Department. Most\n\nimportantly, Marrero left work after spending no more than three\ndays in her new position.      Given that short time span, she could\n\nnot show that the increase in work was anything other than an\n\nunintended and temporary inconvenience caused by the transition.\n            Marrero   also   presented   evidence   regarding   the   less\n\ntangible aspects of the transfer.        She testified that, during the\n\nthree days she spent in the Human Resources Department, Maritza\n\nRamos \"precluded [her] from performing some of the basic duties of\n\nher position.\"   Ramos told Marrero not to open Nieves's mail but to\n\npass it along to her, and not to handle any confidential phone\n\ncalls.      Moreover, Nieves and Ramos subjected her to \"extreme\nsupervision\" -- watching her while she did her filing, and standing\n\nbehind her when she talked on the phone.       Marrero felt that Nieves\n\nand Ramos were \"exerting pressure on [her].\"\n            Finally, Marrero was forced to undergo a probationary\n\nperiod in her new post, which she perceived as a loss of job\n\nsecurity.     She did not feel that she was a real part of the\n\ndepartment; she believed her supervisors \"hadn't taken [her] into\n\naccount.\" A departmental meeting was held while Marrero was there,\n\nbut she was not invited.      She believed that the other members of\n\nthe department \"had snubbed\" her.\n\n            That evidence -- even when examined in the light most\n\nfavorable to Marrero -- \"is insufficient to prove that, viewed\n\nobjectively, this transfer was an adverse personnel action.\" Serna\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\fv. City of San Antonio, 244 F.3d 479, 484 (5th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\nadded).           It is not enough that Marrero felt stigmatized and\n\npunished by the transfer.            A more \"tangible change in duties or\nworking conditions\" is needed before we can conclude that the\n\ntransfer was, in substance, a demotion.              Phillips v. Collings, 256\n\nF.3d 843, 848 (8th Cir. 2001).                As the Eighth Circuit recently\nexplained, the sort of \"intensified personal animus, hostility,\n\ndisrespect, and ostracism\" that Marrero alleged here \"fails to\n\nconstitute         a   material   employment     disadvantage\"     sufficient      to\n\ntransform an ostensibly lateral transfer into an adverse employment\n\naction.       Jones, 285 F.3d at 714; see also Manning v. Metropolitan\n\nLife Ins. Co., 127 F.3d 686, 693 (8th Cir. 1997) (holding that\n\nevidence of \"disrespect and ostracization by . . . supervisors\" did\nnot establish an adverse employment action).                  Rather, in order to\n\nprove that the transfer was materially adverse, Marrero had to show\n\nthat       Goya    \"[took]   something   of     consequence    from     [her],    say,\nby . . . reducing her salary, or divesting her of significant\n\nresponsibilities,\"           or   that   it      \"withh[e]ld     from     [her]    an\n\naccouterment of the employment relationship, say, by failing to\n\nfollow a customary practice of considering her for promotion after\n\na particular period of service.\"                Blackie, 75 F.3d at 725.          Such\n\nproof is wholly lacking here.5\n\n       5\n       We note that, on different facts, the imposition of a\nprobationary period could tip the scales in the employee's favor.\nJob security is \"something of consequence,\" Blackie, 75 F.3d at\n725, the deprivation of which could constitute an adverse\nemployment action. Here, however, there was no evidence from which\nthe jury could have gauged the effect, if any, Marrero's\nprobationary status had on her job security. For example, Marrero\n\n                                         -29-\n\f               B.       Toleration of Harassment\n\n               Marrero also alleges that Goya retaliated against her by\n\ntolerating harassment by its employees.                 As we explained in the\n\nprevious section, \"environmental\" harm such as harassment by co-\n\nworkers or supervisors is actionable under Title VII if it is so\n\nsevere     or       pervasive   that    it    alters   the   conditions      of   the\n\nplaintiff's employment.            Just as an employer will be liable for\n\ndiscrimination if it tolerates a racially or sexually hostile work\n\nenvironment, it will be liable for retaliation if it tolerates\n\nsevere    or     pervasive      harassment     motivated     by    the   plaintiff's\nprotected conduct.         See White, 221 F.3d at 262; Richardson v. N.Y.\n\nState Dep't of Correctional Serv., 180 F.3d 426, 446 (2d Cir.\n1999).\n               Here, however, any suggestion that Marrero was subjected\n\nto   a   retaliatory       hostile     work   environment     is    belied   by   the\nundisputed fact that she spent less than three days at Goya after\nfiling her complaint with the EEOC.               See Conto v. Concord Hosp.,\n\nInc., 265 F.3d 79, 82 (1st Cir. 2001) (rejecting as a matter of law\na hostile work environment claim based on harassment occurring\nduring a four-day period on the ground, inter alia, that the\n\n\"greatly        abbreviated\"     time    period    \"substantially        undermined\n\n\n\ndid not present any evidence that her one and a half years at Goya\ngave her a particular kind or degree of security that dissolved\nonce she was placed on probation. Absent such evidence, the jury\ncould not reasonably have concluded that Goya took something of\nconsequence from Marrero, or withheld an accouterment of the\nemployment relationship from her, by forcing her to go through a\nprobationary period in her new position.\n\n                                         -30-\n\f[plaintiff's] contention that the [harassing] conduct was either\n\nsufficiently    frequent      or    severe\"   (footnote   omitted)).      Her\n\nretaliation claim is, by definition, based on the events that\noccurred within that three-day period.           Obviously, no one at Goya\n\ncould have harassed Marrero in retaliation for her protected\n\nconduct until after she engaged in that conduct.\n\n          That said, the preceding year and a half of sexual\n\nharassment undoubtedly colored Marrero's perception of the events\n\nin her last three days at Goya, as it would for any reasonable\n\nemployee in her position.          Thus, we do not view those three days in\n\na vacuum, but consider them in light of all that came before.              To\n\nthat limited extent, Marrero's experiences before engaging in the\n\nprotected conduct are relevant to her retaliation claim.\n          Even when examined in that light, however, the evidence\n\nof retaliatory harassment falls far short of the mark.                 Marrero\n\ntestified that, during the time she spent in the Human Resources\nDepartment,    Nieves   and    Ramos     \"pressured\"   and   \"snubbed\"    her.\n\nMoreover, Cárdenas continued to bother her in her new position.\n\nThe jury reasonably could have found that some of that harassment\n\nwas motivated by Marrero's protected conduct.             Cárdenas once said\n\nto Marrero:    \"you thought that you were going to get me into hot\n\nwaters but you ended up being in hot waters.\"             He also laughed at\n\nher in a taunting fashion, indicating, \"I got away with it.\"\n\n          A few incidents over the course of three days cannot\n\nreasonably     be   deemed         \"pervasive\"   retaliatory     harassment,\n\nparticularly when those incidents are of the same type and kind\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fthat repeatedly occurred in the workplace before the plaintiff\n\nengaged in the protected activity.            Thus, it was incumbent on\n\nMarrero to show that the retaliatory harassment was so severe that\nit rendered her work environment objectively hostile and abusive\n\nnotwithstanding the extremely short time span.           See Faragher, 524\n\nU.S.   at     788   (explaining   that   \"isolated    incidents\"       are   not\nsufficient to create actionable harassment \"unless [they are]\n\nextremely serious\").        The conduct by Nieves and Ramos, while\n\ncertainly unpleasant, was not particularly severe.                As such, it\n\ndoes not support the imposition of liability under Title VII.\n\n              Cárdenas's comments present a slightly closer question.\n\nGiven that Marrero had endured a year and a half of harassment\n\nwhile under his supervision, it would not be unreasonable for her\nto find his taunting especially offensive.               Moreover, Marrero\n\npresented evidence from which the jury could have found that Nieves\n\nwas aware of Cárdenas's behavior.        That fact surely contributed to\nher feeling that the environment in the Human Resources Department\n\nwas hostile.        But the question remains whether these acts were\n\nsevere enough, \"without the added weight of repetition over time or\n\ncumulation with other acts of [retaliatory] harassment, to stand\n\nalone as the basis for a harassment claim.\"           Hostetler v. Quality\n\nDining, Inc., 218 F.3d 798, 808 (7th Cir. 2000) (finding sufficient\n\nseverity based on two incidents of forcible sexual contact with\n\n\"overtones of . . . attempted sexual assault\").           We conclude that\n\nthey   were    not.     Title   VII   does   not   \"guarantee[]    a    working\n\nenvironment free from stress.\"        Calhoun, 798 F.2d at 561 (internal\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fquotation marks omitted). Something more \"egregious\" than rudeness\n\nand   mockery    is   needed    before    we   can   permit   a    finding   of   a\n\nretaliatory hostile work environment based on intermittent contact\nover a three-day period.\n\n           In sum, we conclude that the district court erred in\n\ndenying Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law on Marrero's\nclaim of retaliation. Even when viewed in the light most favorable\n\nto the verdict, the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to\n\nestablish that Marrero was subjected to an adverse employment\n\naction as a result of her protected conduct.\n\n                         V.    CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE\n\n             Marrero left Goya on November 22, 1996, and -- after\nseveral months of sick leave -- formally resigned in March of 1997.\nShe claims that she was forced to leave in order to escape the\n\nintolerable      working conditions at Goya.          Thus, she sought \"post\nquit\" damages in the form of back pay, on the ground that she was\nconstructively discharged.           Barbara Lindeman & Paul Grossman,\n\nEmployment Discrimination Law ch. 21, at 838 (3d ed. 1996); see\n\nHernandez-Torres, 158 F.3d at 47 (explaining that a \"discharge\"\nunder Title VII \"may be constructive as well as a direct firing\").\n\nAlthough the verdict form did not require the jury to state\nexplicitly      its   conclusion   on    Marrero's    claim   of    constructive\ndischarge (as it did with respect to her hostile work environment\n\nand retaliation claims), the jury apparently credited her version\nof events, as it awarded her $11,250 in back pay.\n\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\f                 Goya       argues    that    Marrero's      claim    of    constructive\n\ndischarge must stand or fall with her retaliation claim.                                  It\n\nmaintains that if we find (as we have) that the evidence was\ninsufficient           to    support    the   jury's      verdict    on    the   issue    of\n\nretaliation,           we    must    vacate   the    award   of     back   pay    as   well.\n\nHowever,         the    evidence      presented      at   trial,6    the   arguments      by\ncounsel,7 and the district court's jury instructions8 all show that\n\nMarrero claimed that two separate stressors forced her to retire:\n\nsevere and pervasive harassment by Cárdenas, and the retaliation by\n\nGoya.       Although we have concluded that Marrero failed to establish\n\nthat       the   events       that   occurred       during   the    alleged      period   of\n\nretaliation rose to the level of an adverse employment action, the\n\nevidence drawn from that period remains relevant to her claim of\nconstructive discharge.                Just as an act of harassment that is not\n\nactionable in and of itself may form part of a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim, see Morgan, 122 S. Ct. at 2073, Marrero's\n\nexperiences during her last week of work -- although insufficient\n\nto establish liability on their own -- are properly part of her\n\n\n       6\n      For example, Marrero testified that she was forced to resign\n\"because of the retaliation and the hostile work environment.\"\n       7\n      Marrero's counsel stated in his closing argument that Marrero\n\"was forced to resign her employment because the sexual harassment\ncreated intolerable working conditions\" and that \"she was\nconstructively discharged because she complained of the sexual\nharassment to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\"\n       8\n       The judge told the jurors that Marrero claimed \"that she was\nforced to resign because of defendant's discriminatory and\nretaliatory conduct\" and instructed them that they could award back\npay if they found that \"she was exposed to sexual harassment and/or\nretaliation.\"\n\n                                              -34-\n\fconstructive discharge claim.      Therefore, we must examine that\n\nclaim in light of all the evidence presented at trial.\n\n          In   order   to   establish   that   Goya    should    be   held\nresponsible for the economic losses she suffered as a result of\n\nquitting, Marrero had to show that her working conditions were \"so\n\ndifficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in [her] shoes\nwould have felt compelled to resign.\" Alicea Rosado v. Garcia\n\nSantiago, 562 F.2d 114, 119 (1st Cir. 1977).          The standard is an\n\nobjective one; it \"cannot be triggered solely by the employee's\n\nsubjective beliefs, no matter how sincerely held.\"              Suarez v.\n\nPueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2000); see also\n\nCalhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp., 798 F.2d 559, 561 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n(\"[T]he law does not permit an employee's subjective perceptions to\ngovern a claim of constructive discharge.\" (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)).\n\n          We conclude that the jury reasonably could have found\nthat Marrero's working conditions were objectively intolerable,\n\ncompelling her resignation.      Marrero was subjected to constant\n\nharassment by Cárdenas during the year and a half she spent at\n\nGoya.   To be sure, the fact that the plaintiff endured a hostile\n\nwork environment -- without more -- will not always support a\n\nfinding of constructive discharge.        See Landgraf v. USI Film\n\nProds., 968 F.2d 427, 430 (5th Cir. 1992) (\"To prove constructive\n\ndischarge, the plaintiff must demonstrate a greater severity or\n\npervasiveness of harassment than the minimum required to prove a\n\nhostile working environment.\").     Rather, the jury must find that\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\fthe working conditions were so unpleasant that \"staying on the job\n\nwhile seeking redress [would have been] intolerable.\"                         Keeler v.\n\nPutnam Fid. Trust Co., 238 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2001).                                In\naddressing that question, however, the jury reasonably can take\n\ninto    account    how   the    employer      responded      to     the      plaintiff's\n\ncomplaints, if any.        An employee's assessment of whether she can\nremain at work while pursuing remedies for the harassment she has\n\nendured obviously will be affected by the likelihood that the\n\nharassment will continue unabated.\n\n              Here, Marrero repeatedly complained about the harassment\n\nto her supervisors Rivera and Diaz, and to Nieves in the Human\n\nResources Department. Nothing was done until she filed a charge of\n\nsexual harassment with the EEOC.               Even then, Goya took no action\nagainst Cárdenas. Instead, it transferred Marrero to a new post as\n\nNieves's secretary.\n\n              Although    Marrero      was       no   longer       under      Cárdenas's\nsupervision, she was still stationed near his office.                         Goya knew\n\nthat Cárdenas would continue to interact with Marrero in her new\n\nposition because Cárdenas's duties required him to go to her work\n\narea,   and    Marrero's    desk      was    near     the   office      of    Cárdenas's\n\nsupervisor.       Yet Goya refused Marrero's request that she be moved\n\nto   another    building,      away   from       Cárdenas.        Not   surprisingly,\n\ntherefore,     Cárdenas     continued       to    harass     her    even      after   the\n\ntransfer.\n\n              Based on that evidence, the jury reasonably could have\n\nfound that \"a reasonable person in [Marrero's] shoes would have\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\ffelt compelled to resign.\"        Alicea-Rosado, 562 F.2d at 119.          Given\n\nthe inadequacy of the transfer after a long history of hostility\n\nand frequent complaints, Marrero reasonably believed that her\nworking conditions at Goya would not change and that she could only\n\nanticipate more of the same intolerable harassment.                If she wanted\n\nto avoid further harm, she would have to leave work entirely.                   See\n\nCortes v. Maxus Exploration Co., 977 F.2d 195, 200-01 (5th Cir.\n\n1992) (affirming finding of constructive discharge where employer\n\nrefused to take adequate corrective measures to protect employee\n\nfrom future harassment).\n\n            Indeed, the jury could have found that the transfer\n\nactually made things worse for Marrero.                  Not only did Cárdenas\n\ncontinue to harass her sexually, but he also taunted her for her\n(apparently unsuccessful) attempts to remedy the situation by\n\ncomplaining to Goya officials.            Nieves -- the official to whom\n\nMarrero had brought her complaint -- was aware of Cárdenas's\nbehavior, but did nothing to stop it.                  Adding insult to injury,\n\nNieves made Marrero feel as if she were the problem employee.                   He\n\n\"pressured\"    her    and    subjected   her      to    \"extreme   supervision,\"\n\nincluding listening to her phone calls.\n\n            As we explained in the previous section, absent some more\n\nsubstantial and tangible changes in Marrero's duties or work\n\nconditions,    such    personal    unpleasantness          is   insufficient    to\n\nestablish   that     the    transfer   was    a   materially    adverse   act   of\n\nretaliation.   And, given the fact that Marrero remained in her new\n\nposition for less than three days, the harassment by Cárdenas and\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fthe   pressure   from   Nieves        and     Ramos    were   neither      severe   nor\n\npervasive    enough     to        establish     a     retaliatory    hostile        work\n\nenvironment.     However, when combined with the harassment Marrero\nendured during the previous year and a half, the events during\n\nthose final days provide further support for the jury's finding of\n\nconstructive discharge.\n            Unlike Marrero's retaliation claim -- which by definition\n\nis confined to the three-day period she spent at work after filing\n\nher charge of sexual harassment -- her claim of constructive\n\ndischarge is based on the totality of her experience at Goya.\n\nAccordingly, in assessing that claim, the jurors were entitled to\n\ndraw on all the evidence of harassment, and Goya's response.                         In\n\norder to override the verdict, we must conclude that all of that\nevidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nverdict, is insufficient to support the jury's finding that a\n\nreasonable employee in Marrero's position would have felt compelled\nto quit.    We see no basis for such a conclusion here.                      The jury\n\nreasonably could have found that Marrero's working conditions,\n\nhostile and abusive before the transfer, became even worse after\n\nthe transfer, and that a reasonable employee would have believed\n\nthat she had no choice but to resign.\n\n                             VI.     PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\n            Goya argues, finally, that Marrero was not entitled to\n\npunitive    damages.         It    points     out     that,   in   cases    involving\nmisconduct by a supervisor, the employer will not be liable for\n\npunitive damages if it made a \"good-faith effort to comply with the\n\n                                        -38-\n\frequirements of Title VII.\" Romano v. U-Haul, Int'l, 233 F.3d 655,\n\n669 (1st Cir. 2000).           Based on the evidence presented at trial,\n\nhowever, the jury reasonably could have found that Goya made no\nsuch    effort,   but    rather    acted   with   \"reckless    disregard\"      for\n\nMarrero's rights.       Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 536\n\n(1999).     Marrero complained about Cárdenas's behavior to her\nsupervisors in the Exports Department -- first Rivera, and then\n\nDiaz.     Neither did anything.            Indeed, on one occasion Rivera\n\ncautioned Marrero that she should keep in mind that Cárdenas was a\n\nvice president and had worked at Goya for many years, whereas she\n\nwas a relative newcomer.          Marrero also complained to Nieves, who\n\nsimply advised her to \"ignore\" Cárdenas.           It was not until Marrero\n\nfiled a sexual harassment charge with the EEOC that Goya took\naction.\n\n            Moreover,     as     we   explained   with    respect      to   Goya's\n\naffirmative defense, the jury was justified in finding that Goya\ndid not have a sexual harassment policy in effect during the\n\nrelevant events.        Even if such a policy existed, Goya did not\n\npresent any evidence that it had implemented it, either through\n\neducating its employees or enforcing its mandate.              See Romano, 233\n\nF.3d at 670 (holding that the defendant employer is responsible for\n\nproving   that    it    made   good   faith   efforts    to   comply    with   the\n\nrequirements of Title VII, and that the mere existence of an\n\nantidiscrimination policy was insufficient absent proof that the\n\nemployer actually implemented the policy).              Thus, we see no merit\n\n\n\n\n                                       -39-\n\fto Goya's claim that the punitive damages award should be set\n\naside.\n\n                               VII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We affirm the judgment of the district court with respect\n\nto Marrero's hostile work environment and constructive discharge\n\nclaims, her entitlement to punitive damages, and Goya's attempt to\n\nestablish the Faragher/Ellerth affirmative defense. We reverse the\n\ndistrict court's judgment with respect to Marrero's claim of\n\nretaliation, concluding that Goya was entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on that claim.\n            That leaves the matter of damages.              As noted, the jury\n\nawarded Marrero $175,000 in compensatory damages, $11,250 in back\npay, and $75,000 in punitive damages.            We have no way of knowing\nwhat portion, if any, of the compensatory and punitive damages\n\nawards was based on the jury's erroneous finding of retaliation.\nAccordingly, we have no choice but to remand for a new trial as to\ndamages for the hostile work environment and the constructive\n\ndischarge.\n            Finally, based on its finding that Marrero was the\n\"prevailing party\" in this action, the district court awarded her\n\nattorney's fees and the costs of litigation.                    See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-5(k).        On remand, the court should consider whether an\nadjustment in that award is appropriate in light of our holding\n\nwith respect to Marrero's claim of retaliation.                See Andrade v.\n\nJamestown    Hous.    Auth.,    82    F.3d   1179,   1191    (1st   Cir.   1996)\n\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\f(explaining that \"a court should award only that amount of fees\n\nthat is reasonable in relation to the results obtained\").\n\n          Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

(Goya), under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.</i> Marrero alleged that sexual harassment by her former supervisor, Ram&#243;n C&#225;rdenas, created a hostile work environment; that Goya retaliated against her when she complained about C&#225;rdenas's behavior; and that, as a result of the retaliation and continuing harassment, she was forced to resign. She sought compensatory damages, back pay, and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to trial, and at the close of the evidence Goya moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Goya argued, first, that much of the alleged harassment fell outside Title VII's statute of limitations, leaving events within the limitations period that did not rise to the level of a hostile work environment. Second, Goya maintained that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support Marrero's claims of retaliation and constructive discharge, and her request for punitive damages. Finally, it urged the court to enter judgment in its favor on the basis of the affirmative defense recognized in <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998), and <i>Burlington Industries, Inc. v.

After several hours of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in Marrero's favor, awarding her $175,000 in compensatory damages, $11,250 in back pay, and $75,000 in punitive damages. Goya duly renewed its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial. This time, the district court rejected the motion, concluding that Goya had forfeited the statute of limitations defense; that there was ample evidence to support the jury's findings of a hostile work environment and retaliation, its award of back pay for constructive discharge, and the punitive damages; and that the jury reasonably concluded that Goya had not established the elements of the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the court's denial of Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law. <i>White v. N.H. Dep't of Corrections,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2000). Like the district court, we examine the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to Marrero. <i>Id.</i> We \"may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\" <i>Katz v. City Metal Co.,</i> 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). We must affirm unless \"reasonable persons could not have reached the conclusion that the jury embraced.\" <i>Negron-Rivera v. Rivera-Claudio,</i> 204 F.3d 287, 290 (1st Cir.2000). We review the district court's denial of Goya's request for a new trial for an abuse of discretion, recognizing that \"[a] new trial should be ordered only if the court believes that the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Ramos v. Davis &amp; Geck, Inc.,</i> 167 F.3d 727, 731 (1st Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Marrero's hostile work environment claim was supported by sufficient evidence and was not barred by the statute of limitations. We also conclude that Goya was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> affirmative defense, or the issue of constructive discharge. However, we hold that the district court erred in accepting the verdict for Marrero on her claim of retaliation. Because it is impossible to determine what portion (if any) of the compensatory and punitive damages awards was based on the jury's erroneous finding of retaliation, we remand for a new trial on damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could have found the following facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Marrero began work at Goya in April of 1995, where she served as a secretary in the Sales Department, under the supervision of Ram&#243;n C&#225;rdenas, the Vice President for sales. Marrero also had duties in the Exports Department, where her supervisor was Wilberto Rivera and &#8212; later &#8212; Jos&#233; Luis Diaz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero was subjected to sexual harassment by C&#225;rdenas throughout her tenure at Goya. The harassment consisted primarily of sexual comments, often accompanied by lascivious looks and offensive gestures. C&#225;rdenas also would contrive to \"bump into\" Marrero in the narrow hallway between their work spaces, and on several occasions rubbed his body against hers as she used the photocopier machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1995, Marrero confronted C&#225;rdenas about his behavior. After a brief respite, the harassment began again, now accompanied by more \"vulgar\" comments made \"with a gross tone.\" In addition, C&#225;rdenas began to criticize Marrero for work-related matters. He would scold her for no reason, sometimes yelling at her in front of other employees. On other occasions C&#225;rdenas would startle Marrero by slapping her desk with his fist; he then would ask, \"Aren't you tough? Are you scared?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C&#225;rdenas also used his authority to \"punish\" Marrero in several ways. He often gave her extra work just as she was leaving for the day, making her stay extra hours without pay for overtime. Although he was aware that she was hypoglycemic, C&#225;rdenas changed Marrero's lunch hour so that she was forced to work for more than five hours without a break. He also used his power in more petty ways, such as refusing Marrero's requests to leave her desk to use the bathroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C&#225;rdenas's conduct made Marrero feel \"offended, humiliated, embarrassed, depressed.\" By the fall of 1995, she had become \"very anxious, very nervous\" at work. Marrero had difficulty concentrating; she \"had to make a super-human effort\" in order to perform her duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 1995, Marrero suffered a nervous breakdown. She \"couldn't function the way [she] was feeling.\" Her family physician prescribed antidepressants and tranquilizers, and referred her to a psychiatrist, Dr. Fernando Cabrera. Marrero met with Dr. Cabrera several times during December, 1995, and January, 1996. During her first visit, she mentioned that C&#225;rdenas was bothering and pressuring her at work, but she did not provide any details. Dr. Cabrera described Marrero as \"disorganized, confused, and unable to talk in a coherent and logical way\" about what was bothering her. He diagnosed a major depression with psychotic features and a panic disorder, and recommended that Marrero take a five-week medical leave from work. During that time, he treated her aggressively with antidepressants, tranquilizers, and anti-psychotic drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero returned to work on February 5, 1996. She did not feel that she had recovered fully, but \"needed the money\" from work. She was greeted by more of the same harassment by C&#225;rdenas. He continued to make sexual comments, and \"was always getting on [Marrero's] case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, the situation \"became intolerable,\" and on August 15, 1996, Marrero suffered another emotional breakdown. She was taken by a Goya nurse to the emergency ward of a psychiatric hospital, and from there to Dr. Cabrera's office. Marrero told Dr. Cabrera \"I cannot work anymore\" and that C&#225;rdenas was \"making her feel bad.\" Dr. Cabrera interviewed the Goya nurse, who confirmed that it \"was true, that [Marrero] was being harassed by ... Mr. C&#225;rdenas.\" Dr. Cabrera issued a medical certificate to Goya excusing Marrero from work for two weeks. The certificate stated that Marrero was suffering from \"depression and anxiety caused by work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero returned to work after two weeks of sick leave. Again, she was subjected to continuing harassment by C&#225;rdenas, culminating in the events of October 31, 1996. C&#225;rdenas told Marrero that he was going out to buy Halloween presents. He gave her \"a direct penetrating look with lust,\" and said: \"I have a little present for you that you're never going to forget and if you don't do the things I tell you and order you to do I am going to fire you.\" Marrero interpreted that comment as a sexual invitation, and a threat that if she did not submit, she would be fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero immediately reported the incident to Diaz (her supervisor in the Exports Department). Marrero had discussed C&#225;rdenas's behavior with Diaz previously, as she had with his predecessor, Rivera. She also had complained to Remigio Nieves, the Vice President of the Human Resources Department. Following the \"Halloween presents\" incident, Marrero sent a memo to Nieves, requesting a copy of Goya's policy on discrimination and harassment. When Nieves did not respond, Marrero decided to seek advice from the Department of Labor for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. She met with Nieves several days later and informed him that she planned to file a formal grievance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero went on sick leave from November 13 to 20, 1996. During that time, she filed a charge of sexual harassment with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against C&#225;rdenas and Goya. She also retained legal counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero returned to work on Wednesday, November 20. That morning, she met with Nieves and Goya's in-house counsel, Horacio Cabrera. The three discussed Marrero's problems with C&#225;rdenas, and Marrero confirmed that she had filed a charge with the EEOC. Nieves then handed her a letter stating that she had been transferred to the Human Resources Department, where she would serve as his secretary. In that job, Marrero would no longer be under C&#225;rdenas's direct supervision; however, her new desk would be approximately the same distance from C&#225;rdenas's office as her original location. She asked Nieves why she could not be transferred to an available secretarial position in another building, away from C&#225;rdenas. Nieves responded that the decision had been made; he urged her to view the transfer as a promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her new position as Nieves's secretary, Marrero would perform largely the same duties as she had as secretary for the Sales and Exports Departments. Nevertheless, Nieves told her that she would have to undergo a probationary period \"to see whether [she] could perform the new duties.\" Marrero viewed the probationary period as a threat to her job security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero remained at the new position for the final two days of the work week. She was trained by Maritza Ramos, secretary to the President of Goya. Marrero felt threatened by Ramos, who &#8212; together with Nieves &#8212; subjected her to \"extreme supervision.\" Moreover, C&#225;rdenas continued to bother Marrero in her new position. He stared at her, made faces, and laughed at her. At one point he said, \"[you] thought [I] was going to be screwed,\" but \"it was [you] who ended up screwed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the continuing harassment and the hostility she felt in her new job, and acting on advice from Dr. Cabrera, Marrero did not return to work after Friday, November 22. She hoped that she would be able to go back to Goya once her emotional condition improved. However, by March of 1997 &#8212; after continuous psychiatric treatment, and on the recommendation of Dr. Cabrera &#8212; Marrero decided she had no choice but to resign. She gave notice of her retirement on March 24, 1997. Shortly thereafter, she filed a second charge with the EEOC alleging retaliation and constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero's complaint alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> that the constant sexual harassment by C&#225;rdenas created a hostile work environment actionable under Title VII. In order to prevail on that claim, she had to establish that the harassment was so \"severe or pervasive\" as to alter the terms of her employment, creating a work environment that was both objectively hostile and perceived as hostile by Marrero herself. <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 786, 118 S.Ct. 2275 (internal quotation marks omitted). As explained below, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Before we reach that issue, however, we first must address Goya's argument that Marrero's hostile work environment claim is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Title VII, a plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC \"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e). In a \"deferral jurisdiction\" such as Puerto Rico, that period is extended to 300 days. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1); <i>Mohasco Corp. v. Silver,</i> 447 U.S. 807, 814 n. 16, 100 S.Ct. 2486, 65 L.Ed.2d 532 (1980).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Here, Marrero filed her hostile work environment charge on November 13, 1996. Counting back 300 days, Goya maintains that she can recover only for events occurring on or after January 18, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first time Goya presented that argument in any detail was in its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, filed at the close of Marrero's case. Marrero responded on two fronts. First, she argued that Goya had forfeited the statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it earlier in the litigation. Second, she maintained that her hostile work environment claim was governed by the so-called \"continuing violation doctrine,\" and therefore was immune from Title VII's time bar. Under the continuing violation doctrine, Marrero argued, a plaintiff may recover for events outside the 300-day limitations period \"if they are deemed part of an ongoing series of discriminatory acts and there is some violation within the statute of limitations period that anchors the earlier claims.\" <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 730 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Marrero contended that the \"chain\" of harassment by C&#225;rdenas, which continued into the limitations period, satisfied that standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya did not dispute that Marrero's allegations of sexual harassment, if true, would satisfy the relatedness requirement of the continuing violation doctrine. It emphasized, however, that we had refused to apply the continuing violation doctrine in cases where the plaintiff was \"aware that [she] was being unlawfully discriminated against while the earlier acts, now untimely, were taking place.\" <i>Provencher v. CVS Pharm.,</i> 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998). Goya insisted that Marrero was aware of the discrimination at least as early as December of 1995, when &#8212; according to her own testimony &#8212; she suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of C&#225;rdenas's behavior. Thus, Goya argued that Marrero was obligated to file a charge within the next 300 days and, having failed to do so, could not recover for the earlier (now untimely) events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not address the merits of Marrero's continuing violation claim, or Goya's response. Instead, it held that Goya had forfeited its statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it earlier in the proceedings. We express no view on the forfeiture issue because the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), makes clear that Goya's statute of limitations defense fails on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Morgan,</i> the Court distinguished between hostile work environment claims and claims involving discrete acts of discrimination or retaliation, such as a discharge, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire. <i>Id.</i> at 2070-72. As noted, a Title VII plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e). The Court reasoned that \"[a] discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act `occurred'\" for purposes of the statute of limitations \"on the day that it `happened.'\" <i>Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2070. Therefore, the plaintiff must file a charge within 300 days \"of the date of the act or lose the ability to recover for it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2071.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hostile work environment claims are different. A hostile work environment, the Court explained, is created by \"repeated conduct\" &#8212; \"a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one `unlawful employment practice.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 2073-74 (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1)). As such, hostile work environment claims do not \"turn on single acts but on an aggregation of hostile acts extending over a period of time.\" <i>Havercombe v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 250 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001). It follows that the \"unlawful employment practice\" that triggers the statute of limitations occurs, not \"on any particular day,\" but \"over a series of days or perhaps years.\" <i>Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2073. Thus, the Court concluded, the statute of limitations is satisfied as long as the plaintiff files a charge within 300 days of one of the many acts that, taken together, created the hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so holding, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the view &#8212; advanced by Goya here &#8212; that \"the plaintiff may not base a suit on individual acts that occurred outside the statute of limitations unless it would have been unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to sue before the statute ran on such conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2075. Title VII, the Court explained, \"does not separate individual acts that are part of the hostile work environment claim from the whole for purposes of timely filing and liability.\" <i>Id.</i> Rather, the \"incidents comprising a hostile work environment are part of one unlawful employment practice\" and, in order to comply with the statute of limitations, \"the employee need only file a charge within [300] days of any act that is part of the hostile work environment.\" <i>Id.</i> That standard clearly is satisfied here: Marrero filed her charge on November 13, 1996, less than one month after the \"Halloween presents\" incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues that, even if the jury was entitled to consider C&#225;rdenas's conduct throughout the course of Marrero's employment, the evidence was insufficient to establish harassment of the requisite severity or pervasiveness. Although it does not dispute that Marrero subjectively perceived her work environment as hostile and abusive, Goya insists that any harassment by C&#225;rdenas, while perhaps \"inappropriate,\" was too \"mild[]\" to create an objectively hostile work environment. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no \"mathematically precise test\" for determining when conduct in the workplace moves beyond the \"merely offensive\" and enters the realm of unlawful discrimination. <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). Rather, the question whether the environment is objectively \"hostile or abusive\" must be answered by reference to \"all the circumstances,\" including the \"frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367. \"Subject to some policing at the outer bounds,\" it is for the jury to weigh those factors and decide whether the harassment was of a kind or to a degree that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected the conditions of her employment. <i>Gorski v. N.H. Dep't of Corrections,</i> 290 F.3d 466, 474 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jury reasonably could have found that Marrero was subjected to harassment on a daily basis, including humiliating sexual remarks and innuendos. For example, C&#225;rdenas constantly referred to Marrero as \"the redhead\" and frequently made comments such as \"the redhead is really hot,\" \"the redhead is on fire,\" or \"if this is what hell is like then the devil can take me with him.\" C&#225;rdenas also made repeated comments about Marrero's lips, legs, and clothing. He even used Marrero's hypoglycemia as an avenue for innuendo: making a reference to his diabetes, C&#225;rdenas told her \"what goes down in you goes up in me,\" and asked her \"are you sweet to men?\" At other times, C&#225;rdenas was more explicit: he once asked Marrero \"what are you going to do with the thing you have between your legs?\" Finally, the jury could have found that C&#225;rdenas's \"Halloween presents\" comment was a sexual invitation, coupled with a threat that Marrero would be fired if she did not accept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken together, such comments support the jury's finding of a hostile work environment. <i>See O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 729 (\"Evidence of sexual remarks, innuendoes, ridicule, and intimidation may be sufficient to support a jury verdict for a hostile work environment.\"); <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 260-61 (finding a hostile work environment where, <i>inter alia,</i> \"disgusting comments\" and conversations occurred \"everyday\"). It bears emphasis that the harassment here was more or less constant from Marrero's first day of work in April of 1995 until she left in November of 1996. Thus, this case is easily distinguished from those in which courts have refused to find a hostile work environment based solely on sexual comments that are few and far between. <i>See, e.g., Chamberlin v. 101 Realty, Inc.,</i> 915 F.2d 777, 783 (1st Cir.1990) (expressing doubt as to whether five sexual comments made over the course of a four to five week period constituted harassment severe and pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment). As we have observed elsewhere, \"[t]he workplace is not a cocoon, and those who labor in it are expected to have reasonably thick skins.\" <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2000). However, it is one thing to say that employees must learn to tolerate \"simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious).\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 778, 118 S.Ct. 2275 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). It is quite another to require employees to suffer the constant attentions of a lascivious supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did C&#225;rdenas limit himself to a purely private dialogue. He also discussed Marrero's appearance with other employees. For example, he told Marrero's co-workers that she \"would be the model that would be used for any future female employees that Goya would hire.\" Another time, C&#225;rdenas invited a male employee to assess what sort of underwear Marrero was wearing under her skirt. It was hardly unreasonable for Marrero to find such behavior humiliating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero also testified that C&#225;rdenas subjected her to unwelcome physical touching. On approximately five occasions, C&#225;rdenas made full \"body to body\" contact with her in the hallway. At other times, he would just \"brush[] by\" her, or would stand in her way and &#8212; when she tried to pass him &#8212; pretend that they were dancing. When Marrero had to use the photocopier machine, C&#225;rdenas often hovered over her with his hands on her shoulders, or stood close by, rubbing the side of his body against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On other occasions, C&#225;rdenas harassed Marrero in ways that were not explicitly sexual. Using his power as her supervisor, he altered her work hours knowing that it would exacerbate her hypoglycemia. He often stood at her desk and stared angrily at her, and when she did not pay attention to him he would pound her desk with his fist to startle her. He criticized her work unfairly, sometimes embarrassing her by yelling at her in front of her co-workers. Our cases make clear that, \"where a plaintiff endures harassing conduct, although not explicitly sexual in nature, which undermines her ability to succeed at her job, those acts should be considered along with overtly sexually abusive conduct in assessing a hostile work environment claim.\" <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 729.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that Marrero's work was adversely affected by the harassment. She became anxious and depressed, and often found it difficult to concentrate. Marrero's supervisors noticed the change, and &#8212; after the first few months of her employment &#8212; her performance evaluations dropped from \"excellent\" to \"regular.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, there was ample evidence to support the verdict on Marrero's hostile work environment claim. As we noted at the outset, \"[o]verriding a jury verdict is warranted only if the evidence is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\" <i>Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 100 F.3d 203, 208 (1st Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is not the state of the evidence in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the hostile work environment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. GOYA'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues, next, that it cannot be held liable for C&#225;rdenas's behavior even if a hostile work environment existed. As a general rule, an employer is vicariously liable for an actionable hostile work environment created by a supervisor. <i>See Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275; <i>Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257. However, the Supreme Court has recognized an affirmative defense to employer liability that \"look[s] to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of [the] plaintiff victim.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 781, 118 S.Ct. 2275; <i>see also Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257 (describing the affirmative defense). Goya maintains that it established that affirmative defense here, and that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on that ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> affirmative defense has two necessary elements, and the employer bears the burden of proof as to both. <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275; <i>Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257. First, the employer must show that it \"exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\" <i>Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257. That requirement typically is addressed by proof that the employer \"had promulgated an antiharassment policy with [a] complaint procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> Second, the employer must establish \"that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" <i>Id.</i> That prong is usually addressed by proof that the plaintiff unreasonably ignored an established complaint procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the availability of the affirmative defense often will turn on whether the employer had established and disseminated an anti-discrimination policy, complete with a known complaint procedure. Such was the case here. As the district court observed in denying Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law, \"[o]ne of the most hotly contested issues in [the] case, and which depended entirely on the credibility of the witnesses, was precisely whether ... Goya had in effect a policy against discrimination and whether it installed posters to that end.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, Marrero and her co-worker Zelma Miranda-Rivera testified that they did not receive any orientation regarding sex discrimination; that they were not given any written policy on sexual harassment or available grievance procedures; that they were not aware of any complaint procedure; and that they never saw any anti-harassment literature posted anywhere in the workplace. Marrero also testified, without contradiction, that Goya ignored her request &#8212; first lodged on October 31, 1996 &#8212; for a copy of the company's anti-discrimination policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, Nieves testified that Goya had asked an outside law firm to draft a written policy on sexual harassment, and that it received that policy in August or September of 1995. The policy was not dated, however, and on cross-examination Marrero established that Nieves had stated in his deposition that he used the same policy during Marrero's orientation in April of 1995 (several months before he later claimed to have received it). Moreover, although the policy had a signature line so that the employee could certify that she had received it, Goya could not produce a copy signed by Marrero. Nieves testified that Goya never asked its employees to sign the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves also testified that Goya began to use anti-sexual harassment posters in 1991, 1992, or 1993 &#8212; he was not sure when. Nieves stated that the posters were placed all around Goya's facilities, including the glass doors of the entrance to the lobby \"so that anyone who would go to Goya would be able to see the poster.\" However, in the film of Goya's facilities that was shown to the jury, there were no posters to be seen anywhere on the premises, including the glass doors of the lobby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide which party presented the most persuasive testimony. \"[I]t is for jurors, not judges, to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses.\" <i>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Musa,</i> 785 F.2d 370, 372 (1st Cir.1986). Thus, in reviewing the district court's denial of Goya's Rule 50 motion, we \"cannot evaluate the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of evidence.\" <i>Criado v. IBM Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 437, 441 (1st Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). We can grant judgment as a matter of law only if \"the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion, namely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\" <i>Lama v. Borras,</i> 16 F.3d 473, 477 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That standard is especially exacting where, as here, the moving party bears the burden of proof on the issue in question. <i>See Serv. Auto Supply Co. v. Harte &amp; Co., Inc.,</i> 533 F.2d 23, 24 (1st Cir.1976). We have said that the party with the burden of proof is entitled to judgment as a matter of law only if it has established its case by \"testimony that the jury is not at liberty to disbelieve.\" <i>Jordan v. United States Lines, Inc.,</i> 738 F.2d 48, 49 (1st Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). In that situation, relief under Rule 50 is warranted only if the moving party's evidence is \"`uncontradicted and unimpeached.'\" <i>Serv. Auto Supply Co.,</i> 533 F.2d at 25 (quoting <i>Fed. Ins. Co. v. Summers,</i> 403 F.2d 971, 975-76 (1st Cir.1968)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya has not satisfied that strict standard here. Although Goya's witnesses testified that the company had an anti-discrimination policy in place during the relevant period and that it disseminated the policy to its employees, that testimony was contradicted by Marrero and her co-worker Miranda-Rivera and called into question by the video tape and Nieves's conflicting statements during his deposition. The jury was \"at liberty to disbelieve\" Goya's witnesses, <i>Jordan,</i> 738 F.2d at 49, and to credit the testimony by Marrero and Miranda-Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to qualify for judgment as a matter of law on its affirmative defense, Goya had to show that a reasonable jury was compelled to find in its favor on <i>both</i> elements of the defense. We have concluded that Goya has not satisfied that standard with respect to the first prong &#8212; the existence of an antiharassment policy with a known complaint procedure. Accordingly, we need not consider whether the evidence presented at trial compelled a finding in Goya's favor on the second prong.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 808, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. RETALIATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of retaliation. In order to make out a prima facie case of retaliation, Marrero had to prove that (1) she engaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action was causally connected to the protected activity. <i>Hernandez-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading, Inc.,</i> 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.1998). Goya does not dispute that Marrero engaged in conduct that is protected by Title VII when she filed her sexual harassment charge. It maintains, however, that Marrero never suffered an \"adverse employment action\" as a result of that conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have explained that \"[a]dverse employment actions include `demotions, disadvantageous transfers or assignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted negative job evaluations, and toleration of harassment by other employees.'\" <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 262 (quoting <i>Hernandez-Torres,</i> 158 F.3d at 47); <i>accord Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 193 F.3d 1274, 1283 (11th Cir.1999). Whether an employment action is \"adverse\" &#8212; and therefore actionable under Title VII &#8212; is gauged by an objective standard. <i>Blackie v. Maine,</i> 75 F.3d 716, 725 (1st Cir.1996). \"Work places are rarely idyllic retreats, and the mere fact that an employee is displeased by an employer's act or omission does not elevate that act or omission to the level of a materially adverse employment action.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Marrero's retaliation claim rests on two separate, and allegedly adverse, employment actions: her transfer to the Human Resources Department; and Goya's toleration of harassment by other employees. We address those claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Disadvantageous Transfer</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero filed a charge of employment discrimination with the EEOC on November 13, 1996. She returned to work on Wednesday, November 22, to find that she had been transferred to the Human Resources Department, where she was to serve as Nieves's secretary. Marrero concedes that the transfer was not, on its face, a demotion. She continued to serve as secretary to a Vice President in the company, and her general job description and salary remained the same. Nevertheless, Marrero argues that the transfer was \"disadvantageous\" because she was required to do more work, subjected to \"extreme supervision,\" and forced to undergo a period of probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The clear trend of authority is to hold that a <i>purely</i> lateral transfer, that is, a transfer that does not involve a demotion in form or substance, cannot rise to the level of a materially adverse employment action.\" <i>Ledergerber v. Stangler,</i> 122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc.,</i> 97 F.3d 876, 885 (6th Cir.1996) (\"[R]eassignments without salary or work hour changes do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment decisions in employment discrimination claims.\"). Similarly, a transfer or reassignment that involves only minor changes in working conditions normally does not constitute an adverse employment action. <i>See Jones v. Fitzgerald,</i> 285 F.3d 705, 714 (8th Cir.2002); <i>Crady v. Liberty Nat'l Bank and Trust Co.,</i> 993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir.1993) (\"[A] materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.\"). \"Otherwise every trivial personnel action that an irritable ... employee did not like would form the basis of a discrimination suit.\" <i>Williams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,</i> 85 F.3d 270, 274 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, however, \"Title VII does not limit adverse job action to strictly monetary considerations.\" <i>Collins v. Illinois,</i> 830 F.2d 692, 703 (7th Cir.1987). Congress recognized that job discrimination can take many forms, and does not always manifest itself in easily documentable sanctions such as salary cuts or demotions. Accordingly, Congress \"cast the prohibitions of Title VII broadly\" to encompass changes in working conditions that are somewhat more subtle, but equally adverse. <i>Rodriguez v. Bd. of</i> <i>Educ.,</i> 620 F.2d 362, 364 (2d Cir.1980). Consistent with that broad statutory mandate, courts have rejected any bright line rule that a transfer cannot qualify as an \"adverse employment action\" unless it results in a diminution in salary or a loss of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the Second Circuit held in <i>Rodriguez</i> that the district court erred in dismissing the sex discrimination suit of a junior high school art teacher who was transferred to an elementary school in the same system, notwithstanding the fact that the transfer did not entail a reduction of salary or other monetary benefits. <i>See id.</i> It emphasized that the plaintiff had spent her entire career teaching junior high school students, and in fact had recently earned a doctoral degree in art education with a focus on programs for such students. <i>See id.</i> The art programs at the elementary level, the court explained, \"were so profoundly different from those in the junior high school as to render utterly useless [the plaintiff's] twenty years of experience and study in developing art programs for middle school children.\" <i>Id.</i> at 366. Describing the transfer as \"a severe professional trauma,\" the court concluded that such a \"radical change in the nature of the work [the plaintiff] was called upon to perform\" constituted an adverse employment action. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Seventh Circuit found adverse employment action in <i>Collins,</i> where the plaintiff was transferred from her post as a consultant in the \"development group\" at the Chicago Public Library to a newly-created job in the library's reference unit. 830 F.2d at 704. The court noted that the plaintiff's new supervisors in the reference unit \"seemed unsure of what plaintiff's responsibility and authority would be.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, although the plaintiff previously had her own office, a telephone at her desk, printed business cards, and listings in professional publications as a library consultant, she lost those benefits after the transfer. <i>See id.</i> In her new position, the plaintiff was placed at a desk \"out in the open,\" where \"a receptionist's desk typically would be located.\" <i>Id.</i> She \"had no telephone at her desk with which she could conduct her business responsibilities.\" <i>Id.</i> She \"was not allowed to have business cards printed and she was no longer listed in professional publications as a library consultant.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, rather than doing the consulting work she enjoyed, the plaintiff \"was relegated to doing reference work.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to cases such as <i>Rodriguez</i> and <i>Collins,</i> the evidence presented here showed &#8212; at most &#8212; that the transfer resulted in some minor, likely temporary, changes in Marrero's working conditions. As we explained above, Marrero was transferred from the Sales and Exports Departments to the Human Resources Department, where she was to serve as Nieves's secretary. Although Marrero's basic job description and duties remained the same, the jury could have found that she would have been required to do more work after the transfer. Marrero was the only employee who knew how to prepare certain paper work for the Exports Department. Therefore, as a practical matter, she was forced to do that work even after she was transferred to the Human Resources Department and assumed her new duties there. Marrero was not compensated for that extra work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a minor increase in work responsibilities is not enough to render a lateral transfer materially adverse. That is especially true where, as here, there is no indication that the increase would have been permanent. Just as Marrero had to go through a training period in her new position, the employee who replaced her in the Sales and Exports Departments would need to be trained before she could take over all of Marrero's duties. However, Marrero testified that she could not remember whether she had trained the employee who assumed her old post. She conceded, moreover, that she never complained to Nieves or anyone else at Goya regarding her continuing work in the Exports Department. Most importantly, Marrero left work after spending no more than three days in her new position. Given that short time span, she could not show that the increase in work was anything other than an unintended and temporary inconvenience caused by the transition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero also presented evidence regarding the less tangible aspects of the transfer. She testified that, during the three days she spent in the Human Resources Department, Maritza Ramos \"precluded [her] from performing some of the basic duties of her position.\" Ramos told Marrero not to open Nieves's mail but to pass it along to her, and not to handle any confidential phone calls. Moreover, Nieves and Ramos subjected her to \"extreme supervision\" &#8212; watching her while she did her filing, and standing behind her when she talked on the phone. Marrero felt that Nieves and Ramos were \"exerting pressure on [her].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Marrero was forced to undergo a probationary period in her new post, which she perceived as a loss of job security. She did not feel that she was a real part of the department; she believed her supervisors \"hadn't taken [her] into account.\" A departmental meeting was held while Marrero was there, but she was not invited. She believed that the other members of the department \"had snubbed\" her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That evidence &#8212; even when examined in the light most favorable to Marrero &#8212; \"is insufficient to prove that, viewed <i>objectively,</i> this transfer was an adverse personnel action.\" <i>Serna v. City of San Antonio,</i> 244 F.3d 479, 484 (5th Cir.2001) (emphasis added). It is not enough that Marrero felt stigmatized and punished by the transfer. A more \"tangible change in duties or working conditions\" is needed before we can conclude that the transfer was, in substance, a demotion. <i>Phillips v. Collings,</i> 256 F.3d 843, 848 (8th Cir.2001). As the Eighth Circuit recently explained, the sort of \"intensified personal animus, hostility, disrespect, and ostracism\" that Marrero alleged here \"fails to constitute a material employment disadvantage\" sufficient to transform an ostensibly lateral transfer into an adverse employment action. <i>Jones,</i> 285 F.3d at 714; <i>see also Manning v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,</i> 127 F.3d 686, 693 (8th Cir.1997) (holding that evidence of \"disrespect and ostracization by ... supervisors\" did not establish an adverse employment action). Rather, in order to prove that the transfer was materially adverse, Marrero had to show that Goya \"[took] something of consequence from [her], say, by ... reducing her salary, or divesting her of significant responsibilities,\" or that it \"withh[e]ld from [her] an accouterment of the employment relationship, say, by failing to follow a customary practice of considering her for promotion after a particular period of service.\" <i>Blackie,</i> 75 F.3d at 725. Such proof is wholly lacking here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Toleration of Harassment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero also alleges that Goya retaliated against her by tolerating harassment by its employees. As we explained in the previous section, \"environmental\" harm such as harassment by co-workers or supervisors is actionable under Title VII if it is so severe or pervasive that it alters the conditions of the plaintiff's employment. Just as an employer will be liable for discrimination if it tolerates a racially or sexually hostile work environment, it will be liable for retaliation if it tolerates severe or pervasive harassment motivated by the plaintiff's protected conduct. <i>See White,</i> 221 F.3d at 262; <i>Richardson v. N.Y. State Dep't of Correctional Serv.,</i> 180 F.3d 426, 446 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, any suggestion that Marrero was subjected to a retaliatory hostile work environment is belied by the undisputed fact that she spent less than three days at Goya after filing her complaint with the EEOC. <i>See Conto v. Concord Hosp., Inc.,</i> 265 F.3d 79, 82 (1st Cir.2001) (rejecting as a matter of law a hostile work environment claim based on harassment occurring during a four-day period on the ground, <i>inter alia,</i> that the \"greatly abbreviated\" time period \"substantially undermined [plaintiff's] contention that the [harassing] conduct was either sufficiently frequent or severe\" (footnote omitted)). Her retaliation claim is, by definition, based on the events that occurred within that three-day period. Obviously, no one at Goya could have harassed Marrero in retaliation for her protected conduct until <i>after</i> she engaged in that conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the preceding year and a half of sexual harassment undoubtedly colored Marrero's perception of the events in her last three days at Goya, as it would for any reasonable employee in her position. Thus, we do not view those three days in a vacuum, but consider them in light of all that came before. To that limited extent, Marrero's experiences before engaging in the protected conduct are relevant to her retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when examined in that light, however, the evidence of retaliatory harassment falls far short of the mark. Marrero testified that, during the time she spent in the Human Resources Department, Nieves and Ramos \"pressured\" and \"snubbed\" her. Moreover, C&#225;rdenas continued to bother her in her new position. The jury reasonably could have found that some of that harassment was motivated by Marrero's protected conduct. C&#225;rdenas once said to Marrero: \"you thought that you were going to get me into hot waters but you ended up being in hot waters.\" He also laughed at her in a taunting fashion, indicating, \"I got away with it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few incidents over the course of three days cannot reasonably be deemed \"pervasive\" retaliatory harassment, particularly when those incidents are of the same type and kind that repeatedly occurred in the workplace before the plaintiff engaged in the protected activity. Thus, it was incumbent on Marrero to show that the <i>retaliatory</i> harassment was so severe that it rendered her work environment objectively hostile and abusive notwithstanding the extremely short time span. <i>See Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275 (explaining that \"isolated incidents\" are not sufficient to create actionable harassment \"unless [they are] extremely serious\"). The conduct by Nieves and Ramos, while certainly unpleasant, was not particularly severe. As such, it does not support the imposition of liability under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C&#225;rdenas's comments present a slightly closer question. Given that Marrero had endured a year and a half of harassment while under his supervision, it would not be unreasonable for her to find his taunting especially offensive. Moreover, Marrero presented evidence from which the jury could have found that Nieves was aware of C&#225;rdenas's behavior. That fact surely contributed to her feeling that the environment in the Human Resources Department was hostile. But the question remains whether these acts were severe enough, \"without the added weight of repetition over time or cumulation with other acts of [retaliatory] harassment, to stand alone as the basis for a harassment claim.\" <i>Hostetler v. Quality Dining, Inc.,</i> 218 F.3d 798, 808 (7th Cir.2000) (finding sufficient severity based on two incidents of forcible sexual contact with \"overtones of ... attempted sexual assault\"). We conclude that they were not. Title VII does not \"guarantee[] a working environment free from stress.\" <i>Calhoun,</i> 798 F.2d at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted). Something more \"egregious\" than rudeness and mockery is needed before we can permit a finding of a retaliatory hostile work environment based on intermittent contact over a three-day period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law on Marrero's claim of retaliation. Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish that Marrero was subjected to an adverse employment action as a result of her protected conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero left Goya on November 22, 1996, and &#8212; after several months of sick leave &#8212; formally resigned in March of 1997. She claims that she was forced to leave in order to escape the intolerable working conditions at Goya. Thus, she sought \"post quit\" damages in the form of back pay, on the ground that she was constructively discharged. Barbara Lindeman &amp; Paul Grossman, <i>Employment Discrimination Law</i> ch. 21, at 838 (3d ed. 1996); <i>see Hernandez-Torres,</i> 158 F.3d at 47 (explaining that a \"discharge\" under Title VII \"may be constructive as well as a direct firing\"). Although the verdict form did not require the jury to state explicitly its conclusion on Marrero's claim of constructive discharge (as it did with respect to her hostile work environment and retaliation claims), the jury apparently credited her version of events, as it awarded her $11,250 in back pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues that Marrero's claim of constructive discharge must stand or fall with her retaliation claim. It maintains that if we find (as we have) that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict on the issue of retaliation, we must vacate the award of back pay as well. However, the evidence presented at trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the arguments by counsel,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and the district court's jury instructions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> all show that Marrero claimed that two separate stressors forced her to retire: severe and pervasive harassment by C&#225;rdenas, and the retaliation by Goya. Although we have concluded that Marrero failed to establish that the events that occurred during the alleged period of retaliation rose to the level of an adverse employment action, the evidence drawn from that period remains relevant to her claim of constructive discharge. Just as an act of harassment that is not actionable in and of itself may form part of a hostile work environment claim, <i>see Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2073, Marrero's experiences during her last week of work &#8212; although insufficient to establish liability on their own &#8212; are properly part of her constructive discharge claim. Therefore, we must examine that claim in light of all the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish that Goya should be held responsible for the economic losses she suffered as a result of quitting, Marrero had to show that her working conditions were \"so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in [her] shoes would have felt compelled to resign.\" <i>Alicea Rosado v. Garcia Santiago,</i> 562 F.2d 114, 119 (1st Cir.1977). The standard is an objective one; it \"cannot be triggered solely by the employee's subjective beliefs, no matter how sincerely held.\" <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp.,</i> 798 F.2d 559, 561 (1st Cir.1986) (\"[T]he law does not permit an employee's subjective perceptions to govern a claim of constructive discharge.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that Marrero's working conditions were objectively intolerable, compelling her resignation. Marrero was subjected to constant harassment by C&#225;rdenas during the year and a half she spent at Goya. To be sure, the fact that the plaintiff endured a hostile work environment &#8212; without more &#8212; will not always support a finding of constructive discharge. <i>See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,</i> 968 F.2d 427, 430 (5th Cir.1992) (\"To prove constructive discharge, the plaintiff must demonstrate a greater severity or pervasiveness of harassment than the minimum required to prove a hostile working environment.\"). Rather, the jury must find that the working conditions were so unpleasant that \"staying on the job while seeking redress [would have been] intolerable.\" <i>Keeler v. Putnam Fid. Trust Co.,</i> 238 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.2001). In addressing that question, however, the jury reasonably can take into account how the employer responded to the plaintiff's complaints, if any. An employee's assessment of whether she can remain at work while pursuing remedies for the harassment she has endured obviously will be affected by the likelihood that the harassment will continue unabated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Marrero repeatedly complained about the harassment to her supervisors Rivera and Diaz, and to Nieves in the Human Resources Department. Nothing was done until she filed a charge of sexual harassment with the EEOC. Even then, Goya took no action against C&#225;rdenas. Instead, it transferred Marrero to a new post as Nieves's secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Marrero was no longer under C&#225;rdenas's supervision, she was still stationed near his office. Goya knew that C&#225;rdenas would continue to interact with Marrero in her new position because C&#225;rdenas's duties required him to go to her work area, and Marrero's desk was near the office of C&#225;rdenas's supervisor. Yet Goya refused Marrero's request that she be moved to another building, away from C&#225;rdenas. Not surprisingly, therefore, C&#225;rdenas continued to harass her even after the transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on that evidence, the jury reasonably could have found that \"a reasonable person in [Marrero's] shoes would have felt compelled to resign.\" <i>Alicea Rosado,</i> 562 F.2d at 119. Given the inadequacy of the transfer after a long history of hostility and frequent complaints, Marrero reasonably believed that her working conditions at Goya would not change and that she could only anticipate more of the same intolerable harassment. If she wanted to avoid further harm, she would have to leave work entirely. <i>See Cortes v. Maxus Exploration Co.,</i> 977 F.2d 195, 200-01 (5th Cir.1992) (affirming finding of constructive discharge where employer refused to take adequate corrective measures to protect employee from future harassment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the jury could have found that the transfer actually made things worse for Marrero. Not only did C&#225;rdenas continue to harass her sexually, but he also taunted her for her (apparently unsuccessful) attempts to remedy the situation by complaining to Goya officials. Nieves &#8212; the official to whom Marrero had brought her complaint &#8212; was aware of C&#225;rdenas's behavior, but did nothing to stop it. Adding insult to injury, Nieves made Marrero feel as if <i>she</i> were the problem employee. He \"pressured\" her and subjected her to \"extreme supervision,\" including listening to her phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explained in the previous section, absent some more substantial and tangible changes in Marrero's duties or work conditions, such personal unpleasantness is insufficient to establish that the transfer was a materially adverse act of retaliation. And, given the fact that Marrero remained in her new position for less than three days, the harassment by C&#225;rdenas and the pressure from Nieves and Ramos were neither severe nor pervasive enough to establish a retaliatory hostile work environment. However, when combined with the harassment Marrero endured during the previous year and a half, the events during those final days provide further support for the jury's finding of constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike Marrero's retaliation claim &#8212; which by definition is confined to the three-day period she spent at work after filing her charge of sexual harassment &#8212; her claim of constructive discharge is based on the totality of her experience at Goya. Accordingly, in assessing that claim, the jurors were entitled to draw on <i>all</i> the evidence of harassment, and Goya's response. In order to override the verdict, we must conclude that all of that evidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, is insufficient to support the jury's finding that a reasonable employee in Marrero's position would have felt compelled to quit. We see no basis for such a conclusion here. The jury reasonably could have found that Marrero's working conditions, hostile and abusive before the transfer, became even worse after the transfer, and that a reasonable employee would have believed that she had no choice but to resign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. PUNITIVE DAMAGES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues, finally, that Marrero was not entitled to punitive damages. It points out that, in cases involving misconduct by a supervisor, the employer will not be liable for punitive damages if it made a \"good-faith effort to comply with the requirements of Title VII.\" <i>Romano v. U-Haul, Int'l,</i> 233 F.3d 655, 669 (1st Cir. 2000). Based on the evidence presented at trial, however, the jury reasonably could have found that Goya made no such effort, but rather acted with \"reckless disregard\" for Marrero's rights. <i>Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n,</i> 527 U.S. 526, 536, 119 S.Ct. 2118, 144 L.Ed.2d 494 (1999). Marrero complained about C&#225;rdenas's behavior to her supervisors in the Exports Department &#8212; first Rivera, and then Diaz. Neither did anything. Indeed, on one occasion Rivera cautioned Marrero that she should keep in mind that C&#225;rdenas was a vice president and had worked at Goya for many years, whereas she was a relative newcomer. Marrero also complained to Nieves, who simply advised her to \"ignore\" C&#225;rdenas. It was not until Marrero filed a sexual harassment charge with the EEOC that Goya took action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as we explained with respect to Goya's affirmative defense, the jury was justified in finding that Goya did not have a sexual harassment policy in effect during the relevant events. Even if such a policy existed, Goya did not present any evidence that it had implemented it, either through educating its employees or enforcing its mandate. <i>See Romano,</i> 233 F.3d at 670 (holding that the defendant employer is responsible for proving that it made good faith efforts to comply with the requirements of Title VII, and that the mere existence of an antidiscrimination policy was insufficient absent proof that the employer actually implemented the policy). Thus, we see no merit to Goya's claim that the punitive damages award should be set aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to Marrero's hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims, her entitlement to punitive damages, and Goya's attempt to establish the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> affirmative defense. We reverse the district court's judgment with respect to Marrero's claim of retaliation, concluding that Goya was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves the matter of damages. As noted, the jury awarded Marrero $175,000 in compensatory damages, $11,250 in back pay, and $75,000 in punitive damages. We have no way of knowing what portion, if any, of the compensatory and punitive damages awards was based on the jury's erroneous finding of retaliation. Accordingly, we have no choice but to remand for a new trial as to damages for the hostile work environment and the constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, based on its finding that Marrero was the \"prevailing party\" in this action, the district court awarded her attorney's fees and the costs of litigation. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(k). On remand, the court should consider whether an adjustment in that award is appropriate in light of our holding with respect to Marrero's claim of retaliation. <i>See Andrade v. Jamestown Hous. Auth.,</i> 82 F.3d 1179, 1191 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that \"a court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We provide a sense of the case here.

If a complainant files later than that (but not more than 300 days after the practice complained of), his right to seek relief under Title VII will nonetheless be preserved if the State happens to complete its consideration of the charge prior to the 300-day period.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Thomas v.

Citing that rule, Goya argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury that Marrero had alleged that an \"adverse action\" had been taken against her. It maintains that, because of that instruction, the jury might have thought that Goya was not entitled to the affirmative defense. That argument need not detain us. Marrero <i>did</i> attempt to prove that Goya took adverse action against her: she hoped to show that Goya (not C&#225;rdenas) retaliated against her and constructively discharged her. But the jury instructions made clear that Goya still could avoid liability for Marrero's hostile work environment claim (which did not involve allegations of a tangible employment action) if it proved the two elements described above. The verdict form shows that the jury rejected the affirmative defense, not because Marrero proved a \"tangible employment action,\" but because, in the words of the verdict form, Goya failed to prove that it had \"exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any sexually harassing behavior\" and that \"Marrero unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by Goya.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Nor need we consider Goya's claim that the district court erred in excluding certain evidence that, Goya insists, would have strengthened its case under the second element of the affirmative defense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that, on different facts, the imposition of a probationary period could tip the scales in the employee's favor.

Here, however, there was no evidence from which the jury could have gauged the effect, if any, Marrero's probationary status had on her job security. For example, Marrero did not present any evidence that her one and a half years at Goya gave her a particular kind or degree of security that dissolved once she was placed on probation. Absent such evidence, the jury could not reasonably have concluded that Goya took something of consequence from Marrero, or withheld an accouterment of the employment relationship from her, by forcing her to go through a probationary period in her new position.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> For example, Marrero testified that she was forced to resign \"because of the retaliation and the hostile work environment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Marrero's counsel stated in his closing argument that Marrero \"was forced to resign her employment because the sexual harassment created intolerable working conditions\" and that \"she was constructively discharged because she complained of the sexual harassment to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The judge told the jurors that Marrero claimed \"that she was forced to resign because of defendant's discriminatory and retaliatory conduct\" and instructed them that they could award back pay if they found that \"she was exposed to sexual harassment and/or retaliation.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(Goya), under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.</i> Marrero alleged that sexual harassment by her former supervisor, Ram&#243;n C&#225;rdenas, created a hostile work environment; that Goya retaliated against her when she complained about C&#225;rdenas's behavior; and that, as a result of the retaliation and continuing harassment, she was forced to resign.

Goya argued, first, that much of the alleged harassment fell outside Title VII's statute of limitations, leaving events within the limitations period that did not rise to the level of a hostile work environment. Second, Goya maintained that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support Marrero's claims of retaliation and constructive discharge, and her request for punitive damages.

Goya duly renewed its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial. This time, the district court rejected the motion, concluding that Goya had forfeited the statute of limitations defense; that there was ample evidence to support the jury's findings of a hostile work environment and retaliation, its award of back pay for constructive discharge, and the punitive damages; and that the jury reasonably concluded that Goya had not established the elements of the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the court's denial of Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law. <i>White v.

However, we hold that the district court erred in accepting the verdict for Marrero on her claim of retaliation. Because it is impossible to determine what portion (if any) of the compensatory and punitive damages awards was based on the jury's erroneous finding of retaliation, we remand for a new trial on damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could have found the following facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Marrero began work at Goya in April of 1995, where she served as a secretary in the Sales Department, under the supervision of Ram&#243;n C&#225;rdenas, the Vice President for sales. Marrero also had duties in the Exports Department, where her supervisor was Wilberto Rivera and &#8212; later &#8212; Jos&#233; Luis Diaz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero was subjected to sexual harassment by C&#225;rdenas throughout her tenure at Goya. The harassment consisted primarily of sexual comments, often accompanied by lascivious looks and offensive gestures. C&#225;rdenas also would contrive to \"bump into\" Marrero in the narrow hallway between their work spaces, and on several occasions rubbed his body against hers as she used the photocopier machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1995, Marrero confronted C&#225;rdenas about his behavior. After a brief respite, the harassment began again, now accompanied by more \"vulgar\" comments made \"with a gross tone.\" In addition, C&#225;rdenas began to criticize Marrero for work-related matters. He would scold her for no reason, sometimes yelling at her in front of other employees. On other occasions C&#225;rdenas would startle Marrero by slapping her desk with his fist; he then would ask, \"Aren't you tough? Are you scared?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C&#225;rdenas also used his authority to \"punish\" Marrero in several ways. He often gave her extra work just as she was leaving for the day, making her stay extra hours without pay for overtime. Although he was aware that she was hypoglycemic, C&#225;rdenas changed Marrero's lunch hour so that she was forced to work for more than five hours without a break. He also used his power in more petty ways, such as refusing Marrero's requests to leave her desk to use the bathroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C&#225;rdenas's conduct made Marrero feel \"offended, humiliated, embarrassed, depressed.\" By the fall of 1995, she had become \"very anxious, very nervous\" at work. Marrero had difficulty concentrating; she \"had to make a super-human effort\" in order to perform her duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 1995, Marrero suffered a nervous breakdown. She \"couldn't function the way [she] was feeling.\" Her family physician prescribed antidepressants and tranquilizers, and referred her to a psychiatrist, Dr. Fernando Cabrera. Marrero met with Dr. Cabrera several times during December, 1995, and January, 1996. During her first visit, she mentioned that C&#225;rdenas was bothering and pressuring her at work, but she did not provide any details. Dr. Cabrera described Marrero as \"disorganized, confused, and unable to talk in a coherent and logical way\" about what was bothering her. He diagnosed a major depression with psychotic features and a panic disorder, and recommended that Marrero take a five-week medical leave from work. During that time, he treated her aggressively with antidepressants, tranquilizers, and anti-psychotic drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero returned to work on February 5, 1996. She did not feel that she had recovered fully, but \"needed the money\" from work. She was greeted by more of the same harassment by C&#225;rdenas. He continued to make sexual comments, and \"was always getting on [Marrero's] case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, the situation \"became intolerable,\" and on August 15, 1996, Marrero suffered another emotional breakdown. She was taken by a Goya nurse to the emergency ward of a psychiatric hospital, and from there to Dr. Cabrera's office. Marrero told Dr. Cabrera \"I cannot work anymore\" and that C&#225;rdenas was \"making her feel bad.\" Dr. Cabrera interviewed the Goya nurse, who confirmed that it \"was true, that [Marrero] was being harassed by ... Mr. C&#225;rdenas.\" Dr. Cabrera issued a medical certificate to Goya excusing Marrero from work for two weeks. The certificate stated that Marrero was suffering from \"depression and anxiety caused by work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero returned to work after two weeks of sick leave. Again, she was subjected to continuing harassment by C&#225;rdenas, culminating in the events of October 31, 1996. C&#225;rdenas told Marrero that he was going out to buy Halloween presents. He gave her \"a direct penetrating look with lust,\" and said: \"I have a little present for you that you're never going to forget and if you don't do the things I tell you and order you to do I am going to fire you.\" Marrero interpreted that comment as a sexual invitation, and a threat that if she did not submit, she would be fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero immediately reported the incident to Diaz (her supervisor in the Exports Department). Marrero had discussed C&#225;rdenas's behavior with Diaz previously, as she had with his predecessor, Rivera. She also had complained to Remigio Nieves, the Vice President of the Human Resources Department. Following the \"Halloween presents\" incident, Marrero sent a memo to Nieves, requesting a copy of Goya's policy on discrimination and harassment. When Nieves did not respond, Marrero decided to seek advice from the Department of Labor for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. She met with Nieves several days later and informed him that she planned to file a formal grievance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero went on sick leave from November 13 to 20, 1996. During that time, she filed a charge of sexual harassment with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against C&#225;rdenas and Goya. She also retained legal counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero returned to work on Wednesday, November 20. That morning, she met with Nieves and Goya's in-house counsel, Horacio Cabrera. The three discussed Marrero's problems with C&#225;rdenas, and Marrero confirmed that she had filed a charge with the EEOC. Nieves then handed her a letter stating that she had been transferred to the Human Resources Department, where she would serve as his secretary. In that job, Marrero would no longer be under C&#225;rdenas's direct supervision; however, her new desk would be approximately the same distance from C&#225;rdenas's office as her original location. She asked Nieves why she could not be transferred to an available secretarial position in another building, away from C&#225;rdenas. Nieves responded that the decision had been made; he urged her to view the transfer as a promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her new position as Nieves's secretary, Marrero would perform largely the same duties as she had as secretary for the Sales and Exports Departments. Nevertheless, Nieves told her that she would have to undergo a probationary period \"to see whether [she] could perform the new duties.\" Marrero viewed the probationary period as a threat to her job security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero remained at the new position for the final two days of the work week. She was trained by Maritza Ramos, secretary to the President of Goya. Marrero felt threatened by Ramos, who &#8212; together with Nieves &#8212; subjected her to \"extreme supervision.\" Moreover, C&#225;rdenas continued to bother Marrero in her new position. He stared at her, made faces, and laughed at her. At one point he said, \"[you] thought [I] was going to be screwed,\" but \"it was [you] who ended up screwed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the continuing harassment and the hostility she felt in her new job, and acting on advice from Dr. Cabrera, Marrero did not return to work after Friday, November 22. She hoped that she would be able to go back to Goya once her emotional condition improved. However, by March of 1997 &#8212; after continuous psychiatric treatment, and on the recommendation of Dr. Cabrera &#8212; Marrero decided she had no choice but to resign. She gave notice of her retirement on March 24, 1997. Shortly thereafter, she filed a second charge with the EEOC alleging retaliation and constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero's complaint alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> that the constant sexual harassment by C&#225;rdenas created a hostile work environment actionable under Title VII. In order to prevail on that claim, she had to establish that the harassment was so \"severe or pervasive\" as to alter the terms of her employment, creating a work environment that was both objectively hostile and perceived as hostile by Marrero herself. <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 786, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2275</span></a></span> (internal quotation marks omitted). As explained below, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Before we reach that issue, however, we first must address Goya's argument that Marrero's hostile work environment claim is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Title VII, a plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC \"within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e).

Marrero responded on two fronts. First, she argued that Goya had forfeited the statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it earlier in the litigation. Second, she maintained that her hostile work environment claim was governed by the so-called \"continuing violation doctrine,\" and therefore was immune from Title VII's time bar. Under the continuing violation doctrine, Marrero argued, a plaintiff may recover for events outside the 300-day limitations period \"if they are deemed part of an ongoing series of discriminatory acts and there is some violation within the statute of limitations period that anchors the earlier claims.\" <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771503\"><a href=\"/opinion/771503/julia-m-orourke-v-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 730 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Marrero contended that the \"chain\" of harassment by C&#225;rdenas, which continued into the limitations period, satisfied that standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya did not dispute that Marrero's allegations of sexual harassment, if true, would satisfy the relatedness requirement of the continuing violation doctrine. It emphasized, however, that we had refused to apply the continuing violation doctrine in cases where the plaintiff was \"aware that [she] was being unlawfully discriminated against while the earlier acts, now untimely, were taking place.\" <i>Provencher v. CVS Pharm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754633\"><a href=\"/opinion/754633/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1569-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45393-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir. 1998). Goya insisted that Marrero was aware of the discrimination at least as early as December of 1995, when &#8212; according to her own testimony &#8212; she suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of C&#225;rdenas's behavior. Thus, Goya argued that Marrero was obligated to file a charge within the next 300 days and, having failed to do so, could not recover for the earlier (now untimely) events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not address the merits of Marrero's continuing violation claim, or Goya's response. Instead, it held that Goya had forfeited its statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it earlier in the proceedings.

As noted, a Title VII plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e). The Court reasoned that \"[a] discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act `occurred'\" for purposes of the statute of limitations \"on the day that it `happened.'\" <i>Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2070. Therefore, the plaintiff must file a charge within 300 days \"of the date of the act or lose the ability to recover for it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2071.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hostile work environment claims are different. A hostile work environment, the Court explained, is created by \"repeated conduct\" &#8212; \"a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one `unlawful employment practice.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 2073-74 (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1)). As such, hostile work environment claims do not \"turn on single acts but on an aggregation of hostile acts extending over a period of time.\" <i>Havercombe v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199405\"><a href=\"/opinion/199405/havercombe-v-dept-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2001). It follows that the \"unlawful employment practice\" that triggers the statute of limitations occurs, not \"on any particular day,\" but \"over a series of days or perhaps years.\" <i>Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2073. Thus, the Court concluded, the statute of limitations is satisfied as long as the plaintiff files a charge within 300 days of one of the many acts that, taken together, created the hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so holding, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the view &#8212; advanced by Goya here &#8212; that \"the plaintiff may not base a suit on individual acts that occurred outside the statute of limitations unless it would have been unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to sue before the statute ran on such conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2075. Title VII, the Court explained, \"does not separate individual acts that are part of the hostile work environment claim from the whole for purposes of timely filing and liability.\" <i>Id.</i> Rather, the \"incidents comprising a hostile work environment are part of one unlawful employment practice\" and, in order to comply with the statute of limitations, \"the employee need only file a charge within [300] days of any act that is part of the hostile work environment.\" <i>Id.</i> That standard clearly is satisfied here: Marrero filed her charge on November 13, 1996, less than one month after the \"Halloween presents\" incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues that, even if the jury was entitled to consider C&#225;rdenas's conduct throughout the course of Marrero's employment, the evidence was insufficient to establish harassment of the requisite severity or pervasiveness. Although it does not dispute that Marrero subjectively perceived her work environment as hostile and abusive, Goya insists that any harassment by C&#225;rdenas, while perhaps \"inappropriate,\" was too \"mild[]\" to create an objectively hostile work environment. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no \"mathematically precise test\" for determining when conduct in the workplace moves beyond the \"merely offensive\" and enters the realm of unlawful discrimination. <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span> (1993). Rather, the question whether the environment is objectively \"hostile or abusive\" must be answered by reference to \"all the circumstances,\" including the \"frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>. \"Subject to some policing at the outer bounds,\" it is for the jury to weigh those factors and decide whether the harassment was of a kind or to a degree that a reasonable person would have felt that it affected the conditions of her employment. <i>Gorski v. N.H. Dep't of Corrections,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199974\"><a href=\"/opinion/199974/gorski-v-new-hampshire-depart/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 474 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jury reasonably could have found that Marrero was subjected to harassment on a daily basis, including humiliating sexual remarks and innuendos. For example, C&#225;rdenas constantly referred to Marrero as \"the redhead\" and frequently made comments such as \"the redhead is really hot,\" \"the redhead is on fire,\" or \"if this is what hell is like then the devil can take me with him.\" C&#225;rdenas also made repeated comments about Marrero's lips, legs, and clothing. He even used Marrero's hypoglycemia as an avenue for innuendo: making a reference to his diabetes, C&#225;rdenas told her \"what goes down in you goes up in me,\" and asked her \"are you sweet to men?\" At other times, C&#225;rdenas was more explicit: he once asked Marrero \"what are you going to do with the thing you have between your legs?\" Finally, the jury could have found that C&#225;rdenas's \"Halloween presents\" comment was a sexual invitation, coupled with a threat that Marrero would be fired if she did not accept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken together, such comments support the jury's finding of a hostile work environment. <i>See O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 729 (\"Evidence of sexual remarks, innuendoes, ridicule, and intimidation may be sufficient to support a jury verdict for a hostile work environment.\"); <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 260-61 (finding a hostile work environment where, <i>inter alia,</i> \"disgusting comments\" and conversations occurred \"everyday\"). It bears emphasis that the harassment here was more or less constant from Marrero's first day of work in April of 1995 until she left in November of 1996. Thus, this case is easily distinguished from those in which courts have refused to find a hostile work environment based solely on sexual comments that are few and far between. <i>See, e.g., Chamberlin v. 101 Realty, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548932\"><a href=\"/opinion/548932/54-fair-emplpraccas-101-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40282-katherine-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span>, 783 (1st Cir.1990) (expressing doubt as to whether five sexual comments made over the course of a four to five week period constituted harassment severe and pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment). As we have observed elsewhere, \"[t]he workplace is not a cocoon, and those who labor in it are expected to have reasonably thick skins.\" <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770706\"><a href=\"/opinion/770706/ramon-m-suarez-v-pueblo-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2000). However, it is one thing to say that employees must learn to tolerate \"simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious).\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 778, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2275</span></a></span> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). It is quite another to require employees to suffer the constant attentions of a lascivious supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did C&#225;rdenas limit himself to a purely private dialogue. He also discussed Marrero's appearance with other employees. For example, he told Marrero's co-workers that she \"would be the model that would be used for any future female employees that Goya would hire.\" Another time, C&#225;rdenas invited a male employee to assess what sort of underwear Marrero was wearing under her skirt. It was hardly unreasonable for Marrero to find such behavior humiliating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero also testified that C&#225;rdenas subjected her to unwelcome physical touching. On approximately five occasions, C&#225;rdenas made full \"body to body\" contact with her in the hallway. At other times, he would just \"brush[] by\" her, or would stand in her way and &#8212; when she tried to pass him &#8212; pretend that they were dancing. When Marrero had to use the photocopier machine, C&#225;rdenas often hovered over her with his hands on her shoulders, or stood close by, rubbing the side of his body against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On other occasions, C&#225;rdenas harassed Marrero in ways that were not explicitly sexual. Using his power as her supervisor, he altered her work hours knowing that it would exacerbate her hypoglycemia. He often stood at her desk and stared angrily at her, and when she did not pay attention to him he would pound her desk with his fist to startle her. He criticized her work unfairly, sometimes embarrassing her by yelling at her in front of her co-workers. Our cases make clear that, \"where a plaintiff endures harassing conduct, although not explicitly sexual in nature, which undermines her ability to succeed at her job, those acts should be considered along with overtly sexually abusive conduct in assessing a hostile work environment claim.\" <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 729.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that Marrero's work was adversely affected by the harassment. She became anxious and depressed, and often found it difficult to concentrate. Marrero's supervisors noticed the change, and &#8212; after the first few months of her employment &#8212; her performance evaluations dropped from \"excellent\" to \"regular.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, there was ample evidence to support the verdict on Marrero's hostile work environment claim. As we noted at the outset, \"[o]verriding a jury verdict is warranted only if the evidence is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\" <i>Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197080\"><a href=\"/opinion/197080/colasanto-v-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 208 (1st Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is not the state of the evidence in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the hostile work environment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. GOYA'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues, next, that it cannot be held liable for C&#225;rdenas's behavior even if a hostile work environment existed. As a general rule, an employer is vicariously liable for an actionable hostile work environment created by a supervisor. <i>See Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, the Supreme Court has recognized an affirmative defense to employer liability that \"look[s] to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of [the] plaintiff victim.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 781, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2257</span></a></span>. First, the employer must show that it \"exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\" <i>Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. at 765, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2257</span></a></span>. That requirement typically is addressed by proof that the employer \"had promulgated an antiharassment policy with [a] complaint procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> Second, the employer must establish \"that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" <i>Id.</i> That prong is usually addressed by proof that the plaintiff unreasonably ignored an established complaint procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the availability of the affirmative defense often will turn on whether the employer had established and disseminated an anti-discrimination policy, complete with a known complaint procedure. Such was the case here. As the district court observed in denying Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law, \"[o]ne of the most hotly contested issues in [the] case, and which depended entirely on the credibility of the witnesses, was precisely whether ... Goya had in effect a policy against discrimination and whether it installed posters to that end.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, Marrero and her co-worker Zelma Miranda-Rivera testified that they did not receive any orientation regarding sex discrimination; that they were not given any written policy on sexual harassment or available grievance procedures; that they were not aware of any complaint procedure; and that they never saw any anti-harassment literature posted anywhere in the workplace. Marrero also testified, without contradiction, that Goya ignored her request &#8212; first lodged on October 31, 1996 &#8212; for a copy of the company's anti-discrimination policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, Nieves testified that Goya had asked an outside law firm to draft a written policy on sexual harassment, and that it received that policy in August or September of 1995. The policy was not dated, however, and on cross-examination Marrero established that Nieves had stated in his deposition that he used the same policy during Marrero's orientation in April of 1995 (several months before he later claimed to have received it). Moreover, although the policy had a signature line so that the employee could certify that she had received it, Goya could not produce a copy signed by Marrero. Nieves testified that Goya never asked its employees to sign the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves also testified that Goya began to use anti-sexual harassment posters in 1991, 1992, or 1993 &#8212; he was not sure when. Nieves stated that the posters were placed all around Goya's facilities, including the glass doors of the entrance to the lobby \"so that anyone who would go to Goya would be able to see the poster.\" However, in the film of Goya's facilities that was shown to the jury, there were no posters to be seen anywhere on the premises, including the glass doors of the lobby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide which party presented the most persuasive testimony. \"[I]t is for jurors, not judges, to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses.\" <i>Ins.

Although Goya's witnesses testified that the company had an anti-discrimination policy in place during the relevant period and that it disseminated the policy to its employees, that testimony was contradicted by Marrero and her co-worker Miranda-Rivera and called into question by the video tape and Nieves's conflicting statements during his deposition. The jury was \"at liberty to disbelieve\" Goya's witnesses, <i>Jordan,</i> 738 F.2d at 49, and to credit the testimony by Marrero and Miranda-Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to qualify for judgment as a matter of law on its affirmative defense, Goya had to show that a reasonable jury was compelled to find in its favor on <i>both</i> elements of the defense. We have concluded that Goya has not satisfied that standard with respect to the first prong &#8212; the existence of an antiharassment policy with a known complaint procedure. Accordingly, we need not consider whether the evidence presented at trial compelled a finding in Goya's favor on the second prong.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 808, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In order to make out a prima facie case of retaliation, Marrero had to prove that (1) she engaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action was causally connected to the protected activity. <i>Hernandez-Torres v.

Goya does not dispute that Marrero engaged in conduct that is protected by Title VII when she filed her sexual harassment charge.

She returned to work on Wednesday, November 22, to find that she had been transferred to the Human Resources Department, where she was to serve as Nieves's secretary. Marrero concedes that the transfer was not, on its face, a demotion. She continued to serve as secretary to a Vice President in the company, and her general job description and salary remained the same. Nevertheless, Marrero argues that the transfer was \"disadvantageous\" because she was required to do more work, subjected to \"extreme supervision,\" and forced to undergo a period of probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The clear trend of authority is to hold that a <i>purely</i> lateral transfer, that is, a transfer that does not involve a demotion in form or substance, cannot rise to the level of a materially adverse employment action.\" <i>Ledergerber v.

Congress recognized that job discrimination can take many forms, and does not always manifest itself in easily documentable sanctions such as salary cuts or demotions. Accordingly, Congress \"cast the prohibitions of Title VII broadly\" to encompass changes in working conditions that are somewhat more subtle, but equally adverse. <i>Rodriguez v. Bd. of</i> <i>Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377811\"><a href=\"/opinion/377811/22-fair-emplpraccas-1259-23-empl-prac-dec-p-30921-carmen-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 364 (2d Cir.1980). Consistent with that broad statutory mandate, courts have rejected any bright line rule that a transfer cannot qualify as an \"adverse employment action\" unless it results in a diminution in salary or a loss of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the Second Circuit held in <i>Rodriguez</i> that the district court erred in dismissing the sex discrimination suit of a junior high school art teacher who was transferred to an elementary school in the same system, notwithstanding the fact that the transfer did not entail a reduction of salary or other monetary benefits. <i>See id.</i> It emphasized that the plaintiff had spent her entire career teaching junior high school students, and in fact had recently earned a doctoral degree in art education with a focus on programs for such students. <i>See id.</i> The art programs at the elementary level, the court explained, \"were so profoundly different from those in the junior high school as to render utterly useless [the plaintiff's] twenty years of experience and study in developing art programs for middle school children.\" <i>Id.</i> at 366. Describing the transfer as \"a severe professional trauma,\" the court concluded that such a \"radical change in the nature of the work [the plaintiff] was called upon to perform\" constituted an adverse employment action. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Seventh Circuit found adverse employment action in <i>Collins,</i> where the plaintiff was transferred from her post as a consultant in the \"development group\" at the Chicago Public Library to a newly-created job in the library's reference unit. 830 F.2d at 704. The court noted that the plaintiff's new supervisors in the reference unit \"seemed unsure of what plaintiff's responsibility and authority would be.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, although the plaintiff previously had her own office, a telephone at her desk, printed business cards, and listings in professional publications as a library consultant, she lost those benefits after the transfer. <i>See id.</i> In her new position, the plaintiff was placed at a desk \"out in the open,\" where \"a receptionist's desk typically would be located.\" <i>Id.</i> She \"had no telephone at her desk with which she could conduct her business responsibilities.\" <i>Id.</i> She \"was not allowed to have business cards printed and she was no longer listed in professional publications as a library consultant.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, rather than doing the consulting work she enjoyed, the plaintiff \"was relegated to doing reference work.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to cases such as <i>Rodriguez</i> and <i>Collins,</i> the evidence presented here showed &#8212; at most &#8212; that the transfer resulted in some minor, likely temporary, changes in Marrero's working conditions. As we explained above, Marrero was transferred from the Sales and Exports Departments to the Human Resources Department, where she was to serve as Nieves's secretary. Although Marrero's basic job description and duties remained the same, the jury could have found that she would have been required to do more work after the transfer. Marrero was the only employee who knew how to prepare certain paper work for the Exports Department. Therefore, as a practical matter, she was forced to do that work even after she was transferred to the Human Resources Department and assumed her new duties there. Marrero was not compensated for that extra work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a minor increase in work responsibilities is not enough to render a lateral transfer materially adverse. That is especially true where, as here, there is no indication that the increase would have been permanent. Just as Marrero had to go through a training period in her new position, the employee who replaced her in the Sales and Exports Departments would need to be trained before she could take over all of Marrero's duties. However, Marrero testified that she could not remember whether she had trained the employee who assumed her old post. She conceded, moreover, that she never complained to Nieves or anyone else at Goya regarding her continuing work in the Exports Department. Most importantly, Marrero left work after spending no more than three days in her new position. Given that short time span, she could not show that the increase in work was anything other than an unintended and temporary inconvenience caused by the transition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero also presented evidence regarding the less tangible aspects of the transfer. She testified that, during the three days she spent in the Human Resources Department, Maritza Ramos \"precluded [her] from performing some of the basic duties of her position.\" Ramos told Marrero not to open Nieves's mail but to pass it along to her, and not to handle any confidential phone calls. Moreover, Nieves and Ramos subjected her to \"extreme supervision\" &#8212; watching her while she did her filing, and standing behind her when she talked on the phone. Marrero felt that Nieves and Ramos were \"exerting pressure on [her].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Marrero was forced to undergo a probationary period in her new post, which she perceived as a loss of job security. She did not feel that she was a real part of the department; she believed her supervisors \"hadn't taken [her] into account.\" A departmental meeting was held while Marrero was there, but she was not invited. She believed that the other members of the department \"had snubbed\" her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That evidence &#8212; even when examined in the light most favorable to Marrero &#8212; \"is insufficient to prove that, viewed <i>objectively,</i> this transfer was an adverse personnel action.\" <i>Serna v. City of San Antonio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772573\"><a href=\"/opinion/772573/onofre-serna-v-the-city-of-san-antonio-al-philippus/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 484 (5th Cir.2001) (emphasis added). It is not enough that Marrero felt stigmatized and punished by the transfer. A more \"tangible change in duties or working conditions\" is needed before we can conclude that the transfer was, in substance, a demotion. <i>Phillips v. Collings,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773992\"><a href=\"/opinion/773992/larry-phillips-v-cathy-collings/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span>, 848 (8th Cir.2001). As the Eighth Circuit recently explained, the sort of \"intensified personal animus, hostility, disrespect, and ostracism\" that Marrero alleged here \"fails to constitute a material employment disadvantage\" sufficient to transform an ostensibly lateral transfer into an adverse employment action. <i>Jones,</i> 285 F.3d at 714; <i>see also Manning v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747211\"><a href=\"/opinion/747211/joe-earl-manning-jr-tomi-foust-constance-a-pritchett-gerald-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 693 (8th Cir.1997) (holding that evidence of \"disrespect and ostracization by ... supervisors\" did not establish an adverse employment action). Rather, in order to prove that the transfer was materially adverse, Marrero had to show that Goya \"[took] something of consequence from [her], say, by ... reducing her salary, or divesting her of significant responsibilities,\" or that it \"withh[e]ld from [her] an accouterment of the employment relationship, say, by failing to follow a customary practice of considering her for promotion after a particular period of service.\" <i>Blackie,</i> 75 F.3d at 725. Such proof is wholly lacking here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Toleration of Harassment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero also alleges that Goya retaliated against her by tolerating harassment by its employees. As we explained in the previous section, \"environmental\" harm such as harassment by co-workers or supervisors is actionable under Title VII if it is so severe or pervasive that it alters the conditions of the plaintiff's employment. Just as an employer will be liable for discrimination if it tolerates a racially or sexually hostile work environment, it will be liable for retaliation if it tolerates severe or pervasive harassment motivated by the plaintiff's protected conduct. <i>See White,</i> 221 F.3d at 262; <i>Richardson v. N.Y. State Dep't of Correctional Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764823\"><a href=\"/opinion/764823/cynthia-a-richardson-v-new-york-state-department-of-correctional-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 446 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, any suggestion that Marrero was subjected to a retaliatory hostile work environment is belied by the undisputed fact that she spent less than three days at Goya after filing her complaint with the EEOC. <i>See Conto v. Concord Hosp., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199607\"><a href=\"/opinion/199607/conto-v-concord-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2001) (rejecting as a matter of law a hostile work environment claim based on harassment occurring during a four-day period on the ground, <i>inter alia,</i> that the \"greatly abbreviated\" time period \"substantially undermined [plaintiff's] contention that the [harassing] conduct was either sufficiently frequent or severe\" (footnote omitted)). Her retaliation claim is, by definition, based on the events that occurred within that three-day period. Obviously, no one at Goya could have harassed Marrero in retaliation for her protected conduct until <i>after</i> she engaged in that conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the preceding year and a half of sexual harassment undoubtedly colored Marrero's perception of the events in her last three days at Goya, as it would for any reasonable employee in her position. Thus, we do not view those three days in a vacuum, but consider them in light of all that came before. To that limited extent, Marrero's experiences before engaging in the protected conduct are relevant to her retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when examined in that light, however, the evidence of retaliatory harassment falls far short of the mark. Marrero testified that, during the time she spent in the Human Resources Department, Nieves and Ramos \"pressured\" and \"snubbed\" her. Moreover, C&#225;rdenas continued to bother her in her new position. The jury reasonably could have found that some of that harassment was motivated by Marrero's protected conduct. C&#225;rdenas once said to Marrero: \"you thought that you were going to get me into hot waters but you ended up being in hot waters.\" He also laughed at her in a taunting fashion, indicating, \"I got away with it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few incidents over the course of three days cannot reasonably be deemed \"pervasive\" retaliatory harassment, particularly when those incidents are of the same type and kind that repeatedly occurred in the workplace before the plaintiff engaged in the protected activity. Thus, it was incumbent on Marrero to show that the <i>retaliatory</i> harassment was so severe that it rendered her work environment objectively hostile and abusive notwithstanding the extremely short time span. <i>See Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 788, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2275</span></a></span> (explaining that \"isolated incidents\" are not sufficient to create actionable harassment \"unless [they are] extremely serious\"). The conduct by Nieves and Ramos, while certainly unpleasant, was not particularly severe. As such, it does not support the imposition of liability under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C&#225;rdenas's comments present a slightly closer question. Given that Marrero had endured a year and a half of harassment while under his supervision, it would not be unreasonable for her to find his taunting especially offensive. Moreover, Marrero presented evidence from which the jury could have found that Nieves was aware of C&#225;rdenas's behavior. That fact surely contributed to her feeling that the environment in the Human Resources Department was hostile. But the question remains whether these acts were severe enough, \"without the added weight of repetition over time or cumulation with other acts of [retaliatory] harassment, to stand alone as the basis for a harassment claim.\" <i>Hostetler v. Quality Dining, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769432\"><a href=\"/opinion/769432/ann-m-hostetler-v-quality-dining-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span>, 808 (7th Cir.2000) (finding sufficient severity based on two incidents of forcible sexual contact with \"overtones of ... attempted sexual assault\"). We conclude that they were not. Title VII does not \"guarantee[] a working environment free from stress.\" <i>Calhoun,</i> 798 F.2d at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted). Something more \"egregious\" than rudeness and mockery is needed before we can permit a finding of a retaliatory hostile work environment based on intermittent contact over a three-day period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Goya's motion for judgment as a matter of law on Marrero's claim of retaliation. Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish that Marrero was subjected to an adverse employment action as a result of her protected conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero left Goya on November 22, 1996, and &#8212; after several months of sick leave &#8212; formally resigned in March of 1997. She claims that she was forced to leave in order to escape the intolerable working conditions at Goya. Thus, she sought \"post quit\" damages in the form of back pay, on the ground that she was constructively discharged. Barbara Lindeman &amp; Paul Grossman, <i>Employment Discrimination Law</i> ch. 21, at 838 (3d ed. 1996); <i>see Hernandez-Torres,</i> 158 F.3d at 47 (explaining that a \"discharge\" under Title VII \"may be constructive as well as a direct firing\"). Although the verdict form did not require the jury to state explicitly its conclusion on Marrero's claim of constructive discharge (as it did with respect to her hostile work environment and retaliation claims), the jury apparently credited her version of events, as it awarded her $11,250 in back pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues that Marrero's claim of constructive discharge must stand or fall with her retaliation claim. It maintains that if we find (as we have) that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict on the issue of retaliation, we must vacate the award of back pay as well. However, the evidence presented at trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the arguments by counsel,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and the district court's jury instructions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> all show that Marrero claimed that two separate stressors forced her to retire: severe and pervasive harassment by C&#225;rdenas, and the retaliation by Goya. Although we have concluded that Marrero failed to establish that the events that occurred during the alleged period of retaliation rose to the level of an adverse employment action, the evidence drawn from that period remains relevant to her claim of constructive discharge. Just as an act of harassment that is not actionable in and of itself may form part of a hostile work environment claim, <i>see Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2073, Marrero's experiences during her last week of work &#8212; although insufficient to establish liability on their own &#8212; are properly part of her constructive discharge claim. Therefore, we must examine that claim in light of all the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish that Goya should be held responsible for the economic losses she suffered as a result of quitting, Marrero had to show that her working conditions were \"so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in [her] shoes would have felt compelled to resign.\" <i>Alicea Rosado v. Garcia Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349221\"><a href=\"/opinion/349221/israel-alicea-rosado-v-ramon-garcia-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir.1977).

Marrero was subjected to constant harassment by C&#225;rdenas during the year and a half she spent at Goya. To be sure, the fact that the plaintiff endured a hostile work environment &#8212; without more &#8212; will not always support a finding of constructive discharge. <i>See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586328\"><a href=\"/opinion/586328/59-fair-emplpraccas-bna-897-59-empl-prac-dec-p-41662-barbara/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 430 (5th Cir.1992) (\"To prove constructive discharge, the plaintiff must demonstrate a greater severity or pervasiveness of harassment than the minimum required to prove a hostile working environment.\").

In addressing that question, however, the jury reasonably can take into account how the employer responded to the plaintiff's complaints, if any. An employee's assessment of whether she can remain at work while pursuing remedies for the harassment she has endured obviously will be affected by the likelihood that the harassment will continue unabated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Marrero repeatedly complained about the harassment to her supervisors Rivera and Diaz, and to Nieves in the Human Resources Department. Nothing was done until she filed a charge of sexual harassment with the EEOC. Even then, Goya took no action against C&#225;rdenas. Instead, it transferred Marrero to a new post as Nieves's secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Marrero was no longer under C&#225;rdenas's supervision, she was still stationed near his office. Goya knew that C&#225;rdenas would continue to interact with Marrero in her new position because C&#225;rdenas's duties required him to go to her work area, and Marrero's desk was near the office of C&#225;rdenas's supervisor. Yet Goya refused Marrero's request that she be moved to another building, away from C&#225;rdenas. Not surprisingly, therefore, C&#225;rdenas continued to harass her even after the transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on that evidence, the jury reasonably could have found that \"a reasonable person in [Marrero's] shoes would have felt compelled to resign.\" <i>Alicea Rosado,</i> 562 F.2d at 119. Given the inadequacy of the transfer after a long history of hostility and frequent complaints, Marrero reasonably believed that her working conditions at Goya would not change and that she could only anticipate more of the same intolerable harassment. If she wanted to avoid further harm, she would have to leave work entirely. <i>See Cortes v. Maxus Exploration Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592243\"><a href=\"/opinion/592243/tiffany-cortes-v-maxus-exploration-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 200-01 (5th Cir.1992) (affirming finding of constructive discharge where employer refused to take adequate corrective measures to protect employee from future harassment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the jury could have found that the transfer actually made things worse for Marrero. Not only did C&#225;rdenas continue to harass her sexually, but he also taunted her for her (apparently unsuccessful) attempts to remedy the situation by complaining to Goya officials. Nieves &#8212; the official to whom Marrero had brought her complaint &#8212; was aware of C&#225;rdenas's behavior, but did nothing to stop it. Adding insult to injury, Nieves made Marrero feel as if <i>she</i> were the problem employee. He \"pressured\" her and subjected her to \"extreme supervision,\" including listening to her phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explained in the previous section, absent some more substantial and tangible changes in Marrero's duties or work conditions, such personal unpleasantness is insufficient to establish that the transfer was a materially adverse act of retaliation. And, given the fact that Marrero remained in her new position for less than three days, the harassment by C&#225;rdenas and the pressure from Nieves and Ramos were neither severe nor pervasive enough to establish a retaliatory hostile work environment. However, when combined with the harassment Marrero endured during the previous year and a half, the events during those final days provide further support for the jury's finding of constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike Marrero's retaliation claim &#8212; which by definition is confined to the three-day period she spent at work after filing her charge of sexual harassment &#8212; her claim of constructive discharge is based on the totality of her experience at Goya. Accordingly, in assessing that claim, the jurors were entitled to draw on <i>all</i> the evidence of harassment, and Goya's response. In order to override the verdict, we must conclude that all of that evidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, is insufficient to support the jury's finding that a reasonable employee in Marrero's position would have felt compelled to quit. We see no basis for such a conclusion here. The jury reasonably could have found that Marrero's working conditions, hostile and abusive before the transfer, became even worse after the transfer, and that a reasonable employee would have believed that she had no choice but to resign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. PUNITIVE DAMAGES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goya argues, finally, that Marrero was not entitled to punitive damages. It points out that, in cases involving misconduct by a supervisor, the employer will not be liable for punitive damages if it made a \"good-faith effort to comply with the requirements of Title VII.\" <i>Romano v. U-Haul, Int'l,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771255\"><a href=\"/opinion/771255/karen-romano-v-u-haul-international-u-haul-company-of-maine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 669 (1st Cir. 2000). Based on the evidence presented at trial, however, the jury reasonably could have found that Goya made no such effort, but rather acted with \"reckless disregard\" for Marrero's rights. <i>Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118313\"><a href=\"/opinion/118313/kolstad-v-american-dental-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 536, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118313\"><a href=\"/opinion/118313/kolstad-v-american-dental-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2118</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118313\"><a href=\"/opinion/118313/kolstad-v-american-dental-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span> (1999). Marrero complained about C&#225;rdenas's behavior to her supervisors in the Exports Department &#8212; first Rivera, and then Diaz. Neither did anything. Indeed, on one occasion Rivera cautioned Marrero that she should keep in mind that C&#225;rdenas was a vice president and had worked at Goya for many years, whereas she was a relative newcomer. Marrero also complained to Nieves, who simply advised her to \"ignore\" C&#225;rdenas. It was not until Marrero filed a sexual harassment charge with the EEOC that Goya took action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as we explained with respect to Goya's affirmative defense, the jury was justified in finding that Goya did not have a sexual harassment policy in effect during the relevant events. Even if such a policy existed, Goya did not present any evidence that it had implemented it, either through educating its employees or enforcing its mandate. <i>See Romano,</i> 233 F.3d at 670 (holding that the defendant employer is responsible for proving that it made good faith efforts to comply with the requirements of Title VII, and that the mere existence of an antidiscrimination policy was insufficient absent proof that the employer actually implemented the policy). Thus, we see no merit to Goya's claim that the punitive damages award should be set aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to Marrero's hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims, her entitlement to punitive damages, and Goya's attempt to establish the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> affirmative defense. We reverse the district court's judgment with respect to Marrero's claim of retaliation, concluding that Goya was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves the matter of damages. As noted, the jury awarded Marrero $175,000 in compensatory damages, $11,250 in back pay, and $75,000 in punitive damages. We have no way of knowing what portion, if any, of the compensatory and punitive damages awards was based on the jury's erroneous finding of retaliation. Accordingly, we have no choice but to remand for a new trial as to damages for the hostile work environment and the constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, based on its finding that Marrero was the \"prevailing party\" in this action, the district court awarded her attorney's fees and the costs of litigation. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(k). On remand, the court should consider whether an adjustment in that award is appropriate in light of our holding with respect to Marrero's claim of retaliation. <i>See Andrade v. Jamestown Hous. Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717546\"><a href=\"/opinion/717546/helen-ruth-andrade-v-jamestown-housing-authority-estate-of-barrett-gross/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span>, 1191 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that \"a court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We provide a sense of the case here.

If a complainant files later than that (but not more than 300 days after the practice complained of), his right to seek relief under Title VII will nonetheless be preserved if the State happens to complete its consideration of the charge prior to the 300-day period.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765085\"><a href=\"/opinion/765085/myrtle-thomas-v-eastman-kodak-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 47 n. 5 (1st Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Those subtleties are of no import here. Marrero filed her charge less than one month after one of the instances of harassment that makes up her hostile work environment claim. As we explain below, that is enough to satisfy the statute of limitations here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The defense is not a bar to liability for a \"tangible employment action\" (such as \"hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits\") that would be actionable under Title VII independent of a hostile work environment<i>Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. at 761, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2257</span></a></span>. Citing that rule, Goya argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury that Marrero had alleged that an \"adverse action\" had been taken against her. It maintains that, because of that instruction, the jury might have thought that Goya was not entitled to the affirmative defense. That argument need not detain us. Marrero <i>did</i> attempt to prove that Goya took adverse action against her: she hoped to show that Goya (not C&#225;rdenas) retaliated against her and constructively discharged her. But the jury instructions made clear that Goya still could avoid liability for Marrero's hostile work environment claim (which did not involve allegations of a tangible employment action) if it proved the two elements described above. The verdict form shows that the jury rejected the affirmative defense, not because Marrero proved a \"tangible employment action,\" but because, in the words of the verdict form, Goya failed to prove that it had \"exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any sexually harassing behavior\" and that \"Marrero unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by Goya.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Nor need we consider Goya's claim that the district court erred in excluding certain evidence that, Goya insists, would have strengthened its case under the second element of the affirmative defense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that, on different facts, the imposition of a probationary period could tip the scales in the employee's favor. Job security is \"something of consequence,\"<i>Blackie,</i> 75 F.3d at 725, the deprivation of which could constitute an adverse employment action. Here, however, there was no evidence from which the jury could have gauged the effect, if any, Marrero's probationary status had on her job security. For example, Marrero did not present any evidence that her one and a half years at Goya gave her a particular kind or degree of security that dissolved once she was placed on probation. Absent such evidence, the jury could not reasonably have concluded that Goya took something of consequence from Marrero, or withheld an accouterment of the employment relationship from her, by forcing her to go through a probationary period in her new position.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> For example, Marrero testified that she was forced to resign \"because of the retaliation and the hostile work environment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Marrero's counsel stated in his closing argument that Marrero \"was forced to resign her employment because the sexual harassment created intolerable working conditions\" and that \"she was constructively discharged because she complained of the sexual harassment to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The judge told the jurors that Marrero claimed \"that she was forced to resign because of defendant's discriminatory and retaliatory conduct\" and instructed them that they could award back pay if they found that \"she was exposed to sexual harassment and/or retaliation.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
