Benson Eziamaka Onwuamaegbu\n\nappeals from the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (BIA) denial of his\n\nmotion to reconsider its summary affirmance of an immigration\n\njudge’s decision, which refused to waive inadmissibility pursuant\n\neither to § 212(h) or (i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n\n(INA).   See INA § 212(h), (i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), (i).           We vacate\n\nthe denial, and remand to the BIA for written clarification of its\n\ngrounds for summary affirmance.\n\n                                    I\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n           Onwuamaegbu, a native and citizen of Nigeria, came to the\n\nUnited States in the early 1980s on a temporary student visa.\n\nDuring 1986, he (i) married a lawful permanent resident (LPR); (ii)\n\nwas convicted of larceny by check in Massachusetts and received a\n\nsuspended six-month sentence; and (iii) applied for adjustment to\n\nLPR status based on his recent marriage to an LPR.                   In his\n\napplication, however, Onwuamaegbu falsely responded “no” to the\n\nquestion: “Have you ever, in or outside the United States, been\n\narrested, cited, charged, indicted, convicted, fined, or imprisoned\n\nfor breaking or violating any law or ordinance, including traffic\n\nviolations?”    In 1988, Onwuamaegbu was convicted on two occasions\n\nfor   forgery   in   New   Hampshire,    and    again   received   suspended\n\nsentences. Nevertheless, Onwuamaegbu was granted unconditional LPR\n\nstatus in 1989.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f           At some point prior to March 14, 2000, Onwuamaegbu took\n\na trip of unknown duration to Nigeria.                     Upon returning to the\n\nUnited   States,     he   was    charged       with      inadmissibility     by    the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS), based on his three\n\nprior convictions for crimes of moral turpitude (viz., larceny by\n\ncheck    and   forgery),    INA     §    212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),         8   U.S.C.      §\n\n1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),       and     for       his       willful   misrepresentation\n\nregarding his Massachusetts conviction in his 1986 application for\n\nadjustment     of   status,      INA     §     212(a)(6)(C)(i),      8   U.S.C.      §\n\n1182(a)(6)(C)(i). Onwuamaegbu conceded removability, but contended\n\nthat his deportation would result in “extreme hardship” to his\n\nfamily, and requested waivers of inadmissibility pursuant to INA §\n\n212(h) and (i).\n\n           Following a hearing, the immigration judge (IJ) found\n\nOnwuamaegbu    removable        under    INA       §    212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)    or     §\n\n212(a)(6)(C)(i).      Although the IJ determined that Onwuamaegbu’s\n\nfamily would suffer extreme hardship if he were to be deported, she\n\ndenied his request for a § 212(h) and (i) waiver due to the fact\n\nthat he had previously been admitted as an LPR, but had not accrued\n\nthe requisite seven years of continuous lawful residence in the\n\nUnited States.      Onwuamaegbu appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA,\n\ncontending that the IJ had erred in denying him a § 212(h) or (i)\n\nwaiver, given that: (i) Onwuamaegbu had achieved LPR status in\n\n1989; (ii) the fact that he achieved that status by fraudulent\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fmeans was not relevant to his entitlement to a § 212(h) waiver;\n\n(iii) he therefore had lived lawfully and continuously in the\n\nUnited States from 1989 to 2000 (viz., more than the requisite\n\nseven years); and (iv) his brief trip to Nigeria could not – as a\n\nmatter of law – have retolled the seven-year continuous residence\n\nrequirement.     In September 2004, the BIA summarily affirmed the\n\nIJ’s decision.     Onwuamaegbu did not petition for review of that\n\ndenial, electing instead to file a timely motion to reconsider the\n\nBIA's denial of his appeal.         The BIA denied the motion for\n\nreconsideration,    and   Onwuamaegbu   filed   a   timely   petition   for\n\nreview.\n\n                                   II\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n          As Onwuamaegbu filed no petition for review from the\n\nBIA’s September 2004 denial of his appeal from the IJ’s decision,\n\nand that denial became final after 30 days,1 we lack jurisdiction\n\nto review it.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1); Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d\n\n289, 292 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that “[the] need to timely appeal\n\nis a strict jurisdictional requirement”).           Rather, Onwuamaegbu\n\nsubmitted a timely petition for review from only the BIA’s January\n\n     1\n      The filing of the motion to reconsider did not toll the 30-\nday period within which Onwuamaegbu was permitted to seek review of\nthe BIA’s denial of his appeal. See Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357,\n359-60 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 405-06\n(1995)).\n\n                                  -4-\n\f2005 denial of his motion for reconsideration of the September 2004\n\nBIA decision.       See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).               Although we have\n\njurisdiction to review this BIA decision, see Nascimento v. INS,\n\n274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001), our standard of review is more\n\ncircumscribed than it otherwise would have been had Onwuamaegbu\n\npetitioned for review from the BIA’s denial of his appeal.                     We\n\nreview the denial of a motion to reconsider only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     See Zhang, 348 F.3d at 293; see also Esenwah v.\n\nAshcroft, 378 F.3d 763, 765 (8th Cir. 2004) (noting that abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion     review   of   the   BIA’s        denial     of   a   motion    for\n\nreconsideration is “considerably more deferential than the ordinary\n\nadministrative-law standard that governs our review of agency\n\ndecisions”), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 962 (2005).                     In order to\n\nsurmount     this   higher   standard     of     review,    Onwuamaegbu      must\n\ndemonstrate that the BIA’s denial was “made without a ‘rational\n\nexplanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or\n\nrested on an impermissible basis’ (such as race).” Zhang, 348 F.3d\n\nat 293 (citation omitted).\n\n           Although we normally review BIA decisions, and not IJ\n\ndecisions, we directly review the IJ’s decision in this case\n\nbecause the BIA summarily affirmed it. See Stroni v. Gonzales, 454\n\nF.3d 82, 86-87 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nB.   Removability   Pursuant       to     INA     §   212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)       &\n     212(a)(6)(C)(i)\n\n           First, Onwuamaegbu asserts that the IJ erred in ruling\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthat he was removable due to his previous conviction for a crime of\n\nmoral turpitude (viz., the May 1986 Massachusetts conviction for\n\nlarceny by check), INA § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),2 and that he had\n\nconceded      that   he   was     removable      for   failing    to   disclose    that\n\nconviction in his September 1986 application for lawful permanent\n\nresident       status,     see     INA     §   212(a)(6)(C)(i),         8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1182(a)(6)(C)(i).3         Onwuamaegbu points out that, at the time of\n\nthat       conviction,    the     INA    excepted      convictions     for   a   “petty\n\noffense,” see INA § 212(a)(9), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9) (repealed),\n\nand argues that his state conviction meets this criterion given\n\nthat       larceny   by   check    is    classified      and/or   punishable      as   a\n\n“misdemeanor” under Massachusetts law, see Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch.\n\n274, § 1.       He further contends that his failure to disclose this\n\n“misdemeanor” conviction on his 1986 LPR application was therefore,\n\nby definition, not “material,” hence not an additional ground for\n\n\n       2\n      Subsection   212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)   provides:  “[A]ny   alien\nconvicted of, or who admits having committed, or who admits\ncommitting acts which constitute the essential elements of – a\ncrime involving moral turpitude (other than a purely political\noffense) or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime . . .\nis   inadmissible.”   INA  §   212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),  8  U.S.C.   §\n1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Larceny is generally considered a crime of\nmoral turpitude. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 221,\n226-67 (1st Cir. 2006).\n       3\n      Subsection 212(a)(6)(C)(i)provides: “Any alien who, by fraud\nor willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or\nhas sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation,\nor admission into the United States or other benefit provided under\nthis chapter is inadmissible.” INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. §\n1182(a)(6)(C)(i).\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fremovability under § 212(a)(6)(C)(i).\n\n           We    need     not   address   these   questions,    however,   as\n\nOnwuamaegbu failed to raise them before the BIA, either by appeal\n\nfrom the IJ’s decision, or in his motion for reconsideration.\n\nInstead, he simply challenged the IJ’s decision to deny him a\n\nwaiver of inadmissibility under INA § 212(h) and (i), see infra.\n\nArguments not raised on appeal to the BIA are deemed waived, for\n\nfailure   to    exhaust    administrative    remedies.    See    Susanto   v.\n\nGonzales, 439 F.3d 57, 61 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nC.   The Section 212(h) Waiver of Inadmissibility\n\n           Next, Onwuamaegbu challenges the IJ’s determination that\n\nhe was ineligible for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility\n\nunder INA § 212(h), which provides in pertinent part:\n\n           The Attorney General may, in his discretion,\n           waive [inadmissibility] . . .\n\n           [1](B) in the case of an immigrant who is the\n           spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a citizen\n           of the United States or an alien lawfully\n           admitted for permanent residence if it is\n           established to the satisfaction of the\n           Attorney General that the alien's denial of\n           admission would result in extreme hardship to\n           the United States citizen or lawfully resident\n           spouse, parent, son, or daughter of such alien\n           . . . .\n\n           [2] No waiver shall be granted under this\n           subsection in the case of an alien who has\n           previously been admitted to the United States\n           as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent\n           residence if . . . the alien has not lawfully\n           resided continuously in the United States for\n           a period of not less than 7 years immediately\n           preceding   the   date   of   initiation   of\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            proceedings to      remove       the   alien   from    the\n            United States.\n\nINA § 212(h)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h)(1)(B) (emphasis added).\n\nHence,   subsection    1     invests   the     Attorney     General      with   the\n\ndiscretion to grant a waiver to an immigrant who demonstrates that\n\nhis   deportation     will    result     in    familial     hardship,      whereas\n\nsubsection 2 defines several subcategories of immigrants who are\n\nper se ineligible for this waiver even if they can establish\n\n“extreme hardship”.\n\n            The IJ found that Onwuamaegbu satisfied the “extreme\n\nhardship” criterion of § 212(h)(1)(B), but went on to deny the\n\nwaiver because Onwuamaegbu (i) was an immigrant “previously . . .\n\nadmitted”   for   lawful     permanent    residence,       and    (ii)   had    “not\n\nlawfully resided continuously in the United States for a period of\n\nnot less than seven years.”              The IJ noted that the BIA had\n\ninterpreted the unambiguous phrase “previously . . . admitted” to\n\nrefer to any immigrant who had in fact obtained LPR status,\n\nregardless of whether he had done so by lawful or unlawful means.\n\nSee In re Ayala, 22 I. & N. Dec. 398, 401 (BIA 1998).               Thus, the IJ\n\nnoted that Onwuamaegbu’s admission as an LPR in 1987, even if he\n\nobtained that status by making a material misrepresentation in his\n\napplication, satisfied the “previously . . . admitted” criterion of\n\n§ 212(h), and Onwuamaegbu was therefore “bound” by the requirement\n\nthat he must have lawfully resided continuously in the United\n\nStates for at least seven years.         The IJ noted that Onwuamaegbu was\n\n                                       -8-\n\fa “returning alien” in March 2000, and therefore did not satisfy\n\nthe seven-year requirement.\n\n            In the petition for review, Onwuamaegbu maintains that\n\nthe IJ’s decision is erroneous, as a matter of law, in that it used\n\nMarch 2000 as the measuring point for the “seven year” period,\n\nwhereas    the   IJ    should     have   inquired    whether   Onwuamaegbu     had\n\ncontinuously resided in the United States from March 1993 to March\n\n2000.     The answer, Onwuamaegbu suggests, is plainly \"yes.\"                  He\n\ncontends    that      the   BIA   abused   its   discretion    in    denying   his\n\nreconsideration motion because Ayala, the sole basis for the IJ’s\n\ndecision, does not provide a definition of the critical phrase\n\n“lawfully resided continuously”.            Furthermore, Onwuamaegbu posits\n\nthat the IJ could not have determined that his trip abroad had\n\ntolled his period of continuous United States residence without\n\nfirst determining the circumstances and duration of the trip, which\n\nshe unquestionably did not do.\n\n     1.     Ayala and the “Previously Admitted” Factor\n\n            Section 212(h) embodies two distinct concepts:                     (i)\n\nprevious admission \"as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent\n\nresidence,”      and   (ii)   continuous       lawful   residence.     (Emphasis\n\nadded.)     The Ayala case notes that the former concept is a\n\nthreshold criterion, in that it defines the class of aliens who are\n\nrequired to satisfy the latter “lawful residence” criterion, which\n\nis contained in a pendant “if” clause.              See Ayala, 22 I. & N. Dec.\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fat 401.     Once an immigrant has been admitted as an LPR, he may\n\nobtain a waiver only if he meets the seven-year rule.                 If an\n\nimmigrant has never before been admitted as an LPR (viz., if he is\n\nan illegal alien), he is not disqualified from obtaining a § 212(h)\n\nwaiver, whether or not he has lawfully resided continuously in the\n\nUnited States for seven years.\n\n            Although it may seem incongruous that Congress accorded\n\nsuch preferential treatment to a non-LPR immigrant over one who has\n\nalready achieved LPR status, the courts uniformly have upheld this\n\nstatutory distinction against equal protection challenges.              See,\n\ne.g., De Leon-Reynoso v. Ashcroft, 293 F.3d 633, 640 (3d Cir.\n\n2002); Lukowski v. INS, 279 F.3d 644, 647-48 (8th Cir. 2002); Lara-\n\nRuiz v. INS, 241 F.3d 934, 947 (7th Cir. 2001).                The purported\n\n“rational basis” for the distinction made by Congress is that LPR\n\nimmigrants have enjoyed the benefits and advantages that attend\n\ntheir “lawful” status, and should they engage in unlawful acts\n\nwhile     remaining    LPRs,   they    should   be   subject    to   harsher\n\nconsequences than a non-LPR immigrant.          See De Leon-Reynoso, 293\n\nF.3d at 639-40.       That is precisely the import of Ayala:         even an\n\nimmigrant who has obtained LPR status by unlawful means goes on to\n\nenjoy the same special benefits of LPR status as one who obtained\n\nit by lawful means.        By using the term “previously admitted,”\n\nrather than (for example) “previously and lawfully admitted,”\n\nCongress demonstrated that it specifically intended to penalize\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fthose immigrants who sought and gained LPR status only to abuse its\n\nbenefits.\n\n              Thus,   based   on   the   extant     BIA   precedent,   the   IJ\n\nrationally concluded, as a threshold matter, that Onwuamaegbu was\n\nan immigrant “previously . . . admitted . . . as an alien lawfully\n\nadmitted for permanent residence,” even though he had fraudulently\n\nmisrepresented a material fact in his 1986 LPR application, and the\n\nIJ determined that Onwuamaegbu therefore was “bound,” by subsection\n\n212(h), to satisfy the seven-year rule.           See Ayala, 22 I. & N. Dec.\n\nat 401 (“We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that we\n\nshould read his proposed distinction into the law by focusing on\n\nthe term ‘lawfully admitted’ and disregarding the entire phrase\n\nthat provides the context for that term, namely ‘previously been\n\nadmitted’ to the United States as an alien lawfully admitted for\n\npermanent residence.”); cf. In re Koloamatangi, 23 I. & N. Dec.\n\n548, 551 (BIA 2003) (defining, for purposes of cancellation of\n\nremoval under INA § 240A(a), the phrase “lawfully admitted for\n\npermanent residence” to exclude admissions acquired by fraudulent\n\nmeans, but expressly distinguishing Ayala because of § 212(h)’s\n\ndiffering choice of language); cf. also Savoury v. U.S. Attorney\n\nGen.,   449    F.3d   1307,   1315   (11th   Cir.    2006)   (observing   same\n\ndistinction between Ayala and Koloamatangi); Obioha v. Gonzales,\n\n431 F.3d 400, 409 n.10 (4th Cir. 2005) (same).               In a word, then,\n\nlike Ayala, Onwuamaegbu was not a non-LPR, viz., an illegal alien\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fentitled to escape the strictures of the seven-year test.\n\n     2.   The Lawful Continuous Residence Factor\n\n          After resolving this threshold eligibility question under\n\nAyala, however, the IJ still was required to determine whether\n\nOnwuamaegbu had “lawfully resided continuously in the United States\n\nfor a period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the\n\ndate of initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the\n\nUnited States.” (Emphasis added.)     Ayala, which dealt exclusively\n\nwith the threshold term “‘previously been admitted’ to the United\n\nStates as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,” did\n\nnot reach the issue of the seven-year test’s distinct concept of\n\nlawful and continuous residence.\n\n          With respect to the latter requirement, the IJ set forth\n\na very terse holding, which provides in toto:\n\n          Because the respondent was admitted to the\n          United States on March 14, 2000 as a returning\n          LPR, he has not lawfully resided continuously\n          in the United States for seven years,\n          rendering him ineligible for a waiver under §\n          212(h) of the Act.      As such, he remains\n          removable under § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the\n          Act.\n\n\nRespondent argues that we should assume from this statement that\n\nthe IJ denied the § 212(h) waiver because she determined that\n\nOnwuamaegbu had obtained his LPR status in 1989 by fraudulent\n\nmeans, and therefore his requisite period of seven-years “lawful”\n\nresidence under § 212(h) never commenced in 1989.\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f            The problem with the IJ’s concise holding, however, is\n\nthat it fails to pinpoint with sufficient clarity the IJ’s precise\n\nrationale,    and   because   the   BIA    summarily   affirmed   the   IJ’s\n\ndecision, leaves us without an adequate basis for deciding whether\n\nthe   BIA     abused   its    discretion     in   denying   Onwuamaegbu’s\n\nreconsideration.       See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4) (noting that the\n\nBIA’s summary affirmance connotes only the BIA’s agreement with the\n\nresult reached by the IJ, rather than the IJ’s specific rationale).\n\nWe explain.\n\n            The IJ’s bare reference to the term “returning alien”\n\nseems to direct us implicitly to INA § 1101(a)(13), which governs\n\nthe status of LPRs returning to the United States from a trip\n\nabroad.     As a returning LPR, Onwuamaegbu presumptively would not\n\nhave been regarded as an applicant for admission (viz., would not\n\nhave been placed in deportation proceedings), unless he fell under\n\none of six exceptions:\n\n            (i) has abandoned or relinquished that status,\n\n            (ii) has been absent from the United States\n            for a continuous period in excess of 180 days,\n\n            (iii) has engaged in illegal activity after\n            having departed the United States,\n\n            (iv) has departed from the United States while\n            under legal process seeking removal of the\n            alien from the United States, including\n            removal proceedings under this chapter and\n            extradition proceedings,\n\n            (v) has committed an offense identified in\n            section 1182(a)(2) of this title, unless since\n\n                                    -13-\n\f                  such offense the alien has been granted relief\n                  under section 1182(h) or 1229b(a) of this\n                  title, or\n\n                  (vi) is attempting to enter at a time or place\n                  other than as designated by immigration\n                  officers or has not been admitted to the\n                  United    States    after    inspection    and\n                  authorization by an immigration officer.\n\nINA § 101(a)(13)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C).                   The IJ did not\n\nspecify which exception she relied on in determining Onwuamaegbu\n\ninadmissible.            Because Onwuamaegbu left the United States in 2000\n\nto travel to Nigeria, he was a “returning alien” presumptively\n\nentitled to readmission, but his circumstances – viz., his trip\n\nabroad and his prior conviction for crimes of moral turpitude –\n\npotentially barred his readmission as an LPR under exceptions (i),\n\n(ii), and/or (v) to subsection 101(a)(13).\n\n                  As we have noted, however, see supra Section II.C.1,\n\nAyala was the only case discussed at length by the IJ.                  Although\n\nthe IJ correctly determined that Onwuamaegbu was required to\n\nestablish seven-years' residence under § 212(h) to obtain a waiver,\n\nAyala       did    not    reach   the   issue   of   the   lawful-and-continuous-\n\nresidence requirement, and does not constitute a valid ground for\n\ndenying Onwuamaegbu a § 212(h) waiver.4                At the present juncture,\n\nwe cannot determine whether or not the IJ rested the § 212(h)\n\ndenial entirely on Ayala, and by extension, whether or not the BIA\n\n\n        4\n      In fact, on appeal before the BIA, the respondent argued that\nthe IJ had incorrectly relied on Ayala as a basis for measuring the\nseven-year residency requirement.\n\n                                          -14-\n\faccordingly interpreted the IJ’s holding, thereby abusing its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n             Moreover,     Onwuamaegbu       plausibly    contends   that   it   is\n\nimpossible for us to determine with sufficient certainty the\n\nrationale underlying the IJ’s laconic holding as to the § 212(h)\n\n“lawful” and “continuous” residency requirement, and that for all\n\nwe know she may have rested her decision – for example – solely on\n\nthe    interruption   in    Onwuamaegbu's        “continuous”    United     States\n\nresidency occasioned by his Nigerian trip in 2000.                The IJ simply\n\nnoted that Onwuamaegbu “has not lawfully resided continuously in\n\nthe United States for seven years,” without specifying whether the\n\nfatal defect consisted of a lack of lawfulness, continuity, or\n\nboth.    Moreover, by adverting to the date March 14, 2000, the IJ\n\ninvited an inference that Onwuamaegbu’s Nigerian trip somehow may\n\nhave retolled his seven-year residency period, setting the clock\n\nback    to   zero.    If    the   IJ   did    rely   on   the   Nigerian    trip’s\n\ninterruption of Onwuamaegbu’s seven-year residency period (from\n\nMarch 1993 to March 2000), such a finding is not supported by\n\n“substantial evidence” in the record, since no evidence was adduced\n\nat the hearing concerning the duration of Onwuamaegbu’s trip to\n\nNigeria, let alone any evidence that his trip had lasted more than\n\nthe 180 days prescribed by § 1101(a)(13)(ii). Once again, it would\n\nhave been an abuse of discretion had the BIA so interpreted the\n\nIJ’s holding, and affirmed on that ground.\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f            Given these alternative interpretations of the IJ’s ratio\n\ndecidendi, the efficacy of the respondent’s contention that the IJ\n\nmust have denied the § 212(h) waiver pursuant to exception (v) of\n\nINA § 101(a)(13)(C) because the IJ determined that Onwuamaegbu had\n\nobtained his LPR status in 1989 by fraudulent means and that his\n\n“residence” for purposes of § 212(h) was “unlawful” ab initio, can\n\nhardly be deemed incontestable.    Were that the intended rationale,\n\none reasonably could expect some mention of the date of the\n\ninception of Onwuamaegbu’s unconditional LPR status in 1989, and\n\nnot March 14, 2000, as the date of primary significance.    Although\n\nthe hearing transcript reveals that the IJ explored the “ab initio”\n\ntheory with the parties, there is no such definitive ore tenus\n\nholding.     Had the IJ ultimately decided to rely on the ab initio\n\ntheory, moreover, one reasonably would expect some statement in her\n\nwritten opinion that this was the conceptual basis for denying the\n\n§ 212(h) waiver.     Once again we are left with a double-layered\n\nambiguity:     what was the basis for the IJ’s decision, and what\n\ninferences did the BIA draw regarding the basis for the IJ’s\n\ndecision?\n\n            Moreover, it is not at all obvious that the IJ would have\n\nrelied on the “ab initio” principle as constituting settled and\n\nclear-cut law.     In support of that principle, respondent cites\n\ncases which distantly predate the 1996 enactment of § 212(h), and\n\nwhich plainly turn upon the appropriate interpretation of the\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fdistinct term “lawful admission,” rather than “lawful residence.”\n\nSee, e.g., Matter of Longstaff, 716 F.2d 1439, 1441 (5th Cir.\n\n1983); cf. In re Koloamatangi, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 550-51 (defining,\n\nfor purposes of cancellation of removal under INA § 240A(a), the\n\nphrase “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” to exclude\n\nadmissions acquired by fraudulent means).    The terms “admission”\n\nand “residence” plainly are not incontestably coterminous.      No\n\nextant court or BIA decision has interpreted the term “lawfully” in\n\n§ 212(h), and the statute itself affords no definition. See Yepez-\n\nRazo v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 1216, 1219 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006).5\n\nOnwuamaegbu was “lawfully” admitted, per Ayala, and it is at least\n\narguable that, as a “lawful permanent resident,” he “resided”\n\nlawfully in the United States for the requisite seven years.\n\n          In any event, since the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ, it\n\nnever set forth its own rationale for affirming the IJ’s denial of\n\nthe § 212(h) waiver.   See Zhang, 348 F.3d at 293 (noting that the\n\n\n\n     5\n      As the agency administering the INA, respondent (acting\nthrough the BIA) would be first in line to interpret this undefined\nstatutory term, at which point the courts would accord Chevron\ndeference to the BIA's interpretation, provided it were a\npermissible one. See Yepez-Razo, 445 F.3d at 1219 n.6 (noting that\nthe court would need to defer to BIA’s interpretation of undefined\nphrase “lawfully resided continuously” in § 212(h)).      Normally,\nChevron   deference   is  to   be   accorded   only  to   statutory\ninterpretations by the BIA, however, not to IJ interpretations.\nSee, e.g., Lin v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 416 F.3d 184,\n189-191 (2d Cir. 2005). The BIA summarily affirmed, which simply\nconnotes the BIA’s agreement with the result reached by the IJ,\nrather than its specific rationale.      See id. at 190 (citing 8\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)).\n\n                               -17-\n\fBIA   abuses    its    discretion        if   its    denial     is   “made    without   a\n\n‘rational explanation’”) (citation omitted).                    The BIA’s “[f]ailure\n\nto explain a decision adequately provides a ground for reversal. .\n\n. . [since] cursory, summary or conclusory statements from the\n\nBoard   leave    us    to    presume      nothing       other    than   an     abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.”     Zhao v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 265 F.3d 83,\n\n97 (2d Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).                   Moreover, the BIA may have\n\naffirmed on some other ground not apparent to us.                            Yet, it is\n\nextremely problematic for appeals courts to assess an exercise of\n\nthe BIA’s discretion absent a reasonably clear signal as to the\n\nprecise rationale for its exercise of discretion.\n\n           Finally, the equities in the present case are especially\n\ntroublesome, and the personal stakes for Onwuamaegbu ought not be\n\ndetermined      on    the   basis    of       mere   supposition.            Onwuamaegbu\n\nadmittedly      passed      bad   checks,        then    concealed      his       criminal\n\nconvictions at the time he obtained an \"adjustment of status\" in\n\n1989.   On the other hand, he has since resided in the United States\n\nfor nearly twenty years without further criminal behavior, and has\n\na spouse and children. Moreover, the IJ found that his deportation\n\nwould result in extreme hardship to Onwuamaegbu's family. In these\n\nextraordinary circumstances, it is essential that the case be\n\nremanded   to    the     BIA,     with    instructions        to     issue    a   written\n\nclarification of the grounds for its affirmance of the IJ’s denial\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fof a § 212(h) waiver.6\n\n                                          III\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n               Onwuamaegbu   has    waived      any    challenge      to   the   IJ’s\n\ndetermination that he was in fact subject to removal under §\n\n212(a)(6)(C)(i).        See supra Section II.B.             As we cannot determine\n\nwith       sufficient   certainty   the    basis      for    the   BIA’s   denial   of\n\nOnwuamaegbu’s motion for reconsideration, however, we vacate the\n\ndenial and remand the case to the BIA for its issuance, in due\n\ncourse, of a written clarification of its rationale for accepting\n\nthe IJ’s denial of the § 212(h) waiver application.\n\n          We hereby grant the petition for review of the BIA’s\ndenial of the motion for reconsideration, and remand the case to\nthe BIA for an order of clarification consistent with the opinion\nherein. SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      At this juncture, we need not address Onwuamaegbu’s argument\nthat he was entitled to a § 212(i) waiver as well, which prescribes\nrelief   for   some  aliens   who   are  excludable   for   willful\nmisrepresentation of a material fact, and who establish extreme\nhardship. INA § 212(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(i). Even if he were to\nqualify for a § 212(i) waiver, Onwuamaegbu is independently\nremovable under § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) due to his conviction of a\ncrime of moral turpitude.     The latter ground for removability\ncannot be waived under § 212(i).\n\n                                       -19-\n\f",

During 1986, he (i) married a lawful permanent resident (LPR); (ii) was convicted of larceny by check in Massachusetts and received a suspended six-month sentence; and (iii) applied for adjustment to LPR status based on his recent marriage to an LPR. In his application, however, Onwuamaegbu falsely responded \"no\" to the question: \"Have you ever, in or outside the United States, been arrested, cited, charged, indicted, convicted, fined, or imprisoned for breaking or violating any law or ordinance, including traffic violations?\" In 1988, Onwuamaegbu was convicted on two occasions for forgery in New Hampshire, and again received suspended sentences. Nevertheless, Onwuamaegbu was granted unconditional LPR status in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point prior to March 14, 2000, Onwuamaegbu took a trip of unknown duration to Nigeria. Upon returning to the United States, he was charged with inadmissibility by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), based on his three prior convictions for crimes of moral turpitude (<i>viz.,</i> larceny by check and forgery), INA &#167; 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and for his willful misrepresentation regarding his Massachusetts conviction in his 1986 application for adjustment of status, INA &#167; 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). Onwuamaegbu conceded removability, but contended that his deportation would result in \"extreme hardship\" to his family, and requested waivers of inadmissibility pursuant to INA &#167; 212(h) and (i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, the immigration judge (IJ) found Onwuamaegbu removable under INA &#167; 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) or &#167; 212(a)(6)(C)(i). Although the IJ determined that Onwuamaegbu's family would suffer extreme hardship if he were to be deported, she denied his request for a &#167; 212(h) and (i) waiver due to the fact that he had previously been admitted as an LPR, but had not accrued the requisite seven years of continuous lawful residence in the United States. Onwuamaegbu appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA, contending that the IJ had erred in denying him a &#167; 212(h) or (i) waiver, given that: (i) Onwuamaegbu had achieved LPR status in 1989; (ii) the fact that he achieved that status by fraudulent means was not relevant to his entitlement to a &#167; 212(h) waiver; (iii) he therefore had lived lawfully and continuously in the United States from 1989 to 2000 (<i>viz.,</i> more than the requisite seven years); and (iv) his brief trip to Nigeria could not&#8212;as a matter of law&#8212; have retolled the seven-year continuous residence requirement. In September 2004, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision. Onwuamaegbu did not petition for review of that denial, electing instead to file a timely motion to reconsider the BIA's denial of his appeal. The BIA denied the motion for reconsideration, and Onwuamaegbu filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Onwuamaegbu filed no petition for review from the BIA's September 2004 denial of his appeal from the IJ's decision, and that denial became final after 30 days,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we lack jurisdiction to review it. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(1); <i>Zhang v.

Although we have jurisdiction to review this BIA decision, <i>see Nascimento v. INS,</i> 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2001), our standard of review is more circumscribed than it otherwise would have been had Onwuamaegbu petitioned for review from the BIA's denial of his appeal.

Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 274, &#167; 1. He further contends that his failure to disclose this \"misdemeanor\" conviction on his 1986 LPR application was therefore, by definition, not \"material,\" hence not an additional ground for removability under &#167; 212(a)(6)(C)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address these questions, however, as Onwuamaegbu failed to raise them before the BIA, either by appeal from the IJ's decision, or in his motion for reconsideration.

Dec. 398, 401 (BIA 1998). Thus, the IJ noted that Onwuamaegbu's admission as an LPR in 1987, even if he obtained that status by making a material misrepresentation in his application, satisfied the \"previously . . . admitted\" criterion of &#167; 212(h), and Onwuamaegbu was therefore \"bound\" by the requirement that he must have lawfully resided continuously in the United States for at least seven years. The IJ noted that Onwuamaegbu was a \"returning alien\" in March 2000, and therefore did not satisfy the seven-year requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the petition for review, Onwuamaegbu maintains that the IJ's decision is erroneous, as a matter of law, in that it used March 2000 as the measuring point for the \"seven year\" period, whereas the IJ should have inquired whether Onwuamaegbu had continuously resided in the United States from March 1993 to March 2000. The answer, Onwuamaegbu suggests, is plainly \"yes.\" He contends that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his reconsideration motion because <i>Ayala,</i> the sole basis for the IJ's decision, does not provide a definition of the critical phrase \"lawfully resided continuously\". Furthermore, Onwuamaegbu posits that the IJ could not have determined that his trip abroad had tolled his period of continuous United States residence without first determining the circumstances and duration of the trip, which she unquestionably did not do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Ayala and the \"Previously Admitted\" Factor</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 212(h) embodies two distinct concepts: (i) previous admission \"as an alien <i>lawfully admitted</i> for permanent residence,\" and (ii) <i>continuous lawful residence.</i> (Emphasis added.) The <i>Ayala</i> case notes that the former concept is a <i>threshold</i> criterion, in that it defines the class of aliens who are required to satisfy the latter \"lawful residence\" criterion, which is contained in a pendant \"if\" clause. <i>See Ayala,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 401. Once an immigrant has been admitted as an LPR, he may obtain a waiver only if he meets the seven-year rule. If an immigrant has never before been admitted as an LPR (<i>viz.,</i> if he is an illegal alien), he is <i>not</i> disqualified from obtaining a &#167; 212(h) waiver, whether or not he has lawfully resided continuously in the United States for seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it may seem incongruous that Congress accorded such preferential treatment to a non-LPR immigrant over one who has already achieved LPR status, the courts uniformly have upheld this statutory distinction against equal protection challenges. <i>See, e.g., De Leon-Reynoso v. Ashcroft,</i> 293 F.3d 633, 640 (3d Cir.2002); <i>Lukowski v. INS,</i> 279 F.3d 644, 647-48 (8th Cir.2002); <i>Lara-Ruiz v. INS,</i> 241 F.3d 934, 947 (7th Cir.2001). The purported \"rational basis\" for the distinction made by Congress is that LPR immigrants have enjoyed the benefits and advantages that attend their \"lawful\" status, and should they engage in unlawful acts while remaining LPRs, they should be subject to harsher consequences than a non-LPR immigrant. <i>See De Leon-Reynoso,</i> 293 F.3d at 639-40. That is precisely the import of <i>Ayala:</i> even an immigrant who has obtained LPR status by unlawful means goes on to enjoy the same special benefits of LPR status as one who obtained it by lawful means. By using the term \"<i>previously</i> admitted,\" rather than (for example) \"previously and lawfully admitted,\" Congress demonstrated that it specifically intended to penalize those immigrants who sought and gained LPR status only to abuse its benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, based on the extant BIA precedent, the IJ rationally concluded, as a threshold matter, that Onwuamaegbu was an immigrant \"previously ... admitted ... as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,\" even though he had fraudulently misrepresented a material fact in his 1986 LPR application, and the IJ determined that Onwuamaegbu therefore was \"bound,\" by subsection 212(h), to satisfy the seven-year rule. <i>See Ayala,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 401 (\"We are not persuaded by the respondent's argument that we should read his proposed distinction into the law by focusing on the term `lawfully admitted' and disregarding the entire phrase that provides the context for that term, namely `previously been admitted' to the United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\"); <i>cf. In re Koloamatangi,</i> 2003 WL 77728, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 548, 551 (BIA 2003) (defining, for purposes of cancellation of removal under INA &#167; 240A(a), the phrase \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" to exclude admissions acquired by fraudulent means, but expressly distinguishing <i>Ayala</i> because of &#167; 212(h)'s differing choice of language); <i>cf. also Savoury v.

Gonzales,</i> 431 F.3d 400, 409 n. 10 (4th Cir.2005) (same).

As a returning LPR, Onwuamaegbu presumptively would not have been regarded as an applicant for admission (<i>viz.,</i> would not have been placed in deportation proceedings), unless he fell under one of six exceptions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) has abandoned or relinquished that status,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) has been absent from the United States for a continuous period in excess of 180 days,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) has engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iv) has departed from the United States while under legal process seeking removal of the alien from the United States, including removal proceedings under this chapter and extradition proceedings,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(v) has committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2) of this title, unless since such offense the alien has been granted relief under section 1182(h) or 1229b(a) of this title, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(vi) is attempting to enter at a time or place other than as designated by immigration officers or has not been admitted to the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 101(a)(13)(C), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(13)(C). The IJ did not specify which exception she relied on in determining Onwuamaegbu inadmissible. Because Onwuamaegbu left the United States in 2000 to travel to Nigeria, he was a \"returning alien\" presumptively entitled to readmission, but his circumstances&#8212;<i>viz.,</i> his trip abroad and his prior conviction for crimes of moral turpitude&#8212;potentially barred his readmission as an LPR under exceptions (i), (ii), and/or (v) to subsection 101(a)(13).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted, however, <i>see supra</i> Section II.C.1, <i>Ayala</i> was the only case discussed at length by the IJ. Although the IJ correctly determined that Onwuamaegbu was <i>required to</i> establish seven-years' residence under &#167; 212(h) to obtain a waiver, <i>Ayala</i> did not reach the issue of the lawful-and-continuous-residence requirement, and does not constitute a valid ground for denying Onwuamaegbu a &#167; 212(h) waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> At the present juncture, we cannot determine whether or not the IJ rested the &#167; 212(h) denial entirely on <i>Ayala,</i> and by extension, whether or not the BIA accordingly interpreted the IJ's holding, thereby abusing its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Onwuamaegbu plausibly contends that it is impossible for us to determine with sufficient certainty the rationale underlying the IJ's laconic holding as to the &#167; 212(h) \"lawful\" and \"continuous\" residency requirement, and that for all we know she may have rested her decision&#8212; for example&#8212;solely on the interruption in Onwuamaegbu's \"continuous\" United States residency occasioned by his Nigerian trip in 2000. The IJ simply noted that Onwuamaegbu \"has not lawfully resided continuously in the United States for seven years,\" without specifying whether the fatal defect consisted of a lack of lawfulness, continuity, or both. Moreover, by adverting to the date March 14, 2000, the IJ invited an inference that Onwuamaegbu's Nigerian trip somehow may have <i>retolled</i> his seven-year residency period, setting the clock back to zero. If the IJ did rely on the Nigerian trip's interruption of Onwuamaegbu's seven-year residency period (from March 1993 to March 2000), such a finding is not supported by \"substantial evidence\" in the record, since no evidence was adduced at the hearing concerning the duration of Onwuamaegbu's trip to Nigeria, let alone any evidence that his trip had lasted more than the 180 days prescribed by &#167; 1101(a)(13)(ii). Once again, it would have been an abuse of discretion had the BIA so interpreted the IJ's holding, and affirmed on that ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these alternative interpretations of the IJ's <i>ratio decidendi,</i> the efficacy of the respondent's contention that the IJ must have denied the &#167; 212(h) waiver pursuant to exception (v) of INA &#167; 101(a)(13)(C) because the IJ determined that Onwuamaegbu had obtained his LPR status in 1989 by fraudulent means and that his \"residence\" for purposes of &#167; 212(h) was \"unlawful\" <i>ab initio,</i> can hardly be deemed incontestable. Were that the intended rationale, one reasonably could expect some mention of the date of the inception of Onwuamaegbu's unconditional LPR status in 1989, and not March 14, 2000, as the date of primary significance. Although the hearing transcript reveals that the IJ explored the \"<i>ab initio</i>\" theory with the parties, there is no such definitive <i>ore tenus</i> holding. Had the IJ ultimately decided to rely on the <i>ab initio</i> theory, moreover, one reasonably would expect some statement in her written opinion that this was the conceptual basis for denying the &#167; 212(h) waiver. Once again we are left with a double-layered ambiguity: what was the basis for the IJ's decision, and what inferences did the BIA draw regarding the basis for the IJ's decision?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, it is not at all obvious that the IJ would have relied on the \"<i>ab initio</i>\" principle as constituting settled and clear-cut law. In support of that principle, respondent cites cases which distantly predate the 1996 enactment of &#167; 212(h), and which plainly turn upon the appropriate interpretation of the distinct term \"lawful <i>admission,</i>\" rather than \"lawful <i>residence.</i>\" <i>See, e.g., Matter of Longstaff,</i> 716 F.2d 1439, 1441 (5th Cir.1983); <i>cf. In re Koloamatangi,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 550-51 (defining, for purposes of cancellation of removal under INA &#167; 240A(a), the phrase \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" to exclude admissions acquired by fraudulent means). The terms \"admission\" and \"residence\" plainly are not incontestably coterminous. No extant court or BIA decision has interpreted the term \"lawfully\" in &#167; 212(h), and the statute itself affords no definition. <i>See Yepez-Razo v. Gonzales,</i> 445 F.3d 1216, 1219 n. 6 (9th Cir.2006).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Onwuamaegbu was \"lawfully\" <i>admitted,</i> per <i>Ayala,</i> and it is at least arguable that, as a \"<i>lawful</i> permanent <i>resident,</i>\" he \"resided\" lawfully in the United States for the requisite seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, since the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ, it never set forth its own rationale for affirming the IJ's denial of the &#167; 212(h) waiver. <i>See Zhang,</i> 348 F.3d at 293 (noting that the BIA abuses its discretion if its denial is \"made without a `rational explanation'\") (citation omitted). The BIA's \"[f]ailure to explain a decision adequately provides a ground for reversal .... [since] cursory, summary or conclusory statements from the Board leave us to presume nothing other than an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Zhao v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> 265 F.3d 83, 97 (2d Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Moreover, the BIA may have affirmed on some other ground not apparent to us. Yet, it is extremely problematic for appeals courts to assess an exercise of the BIA's discretion absent a reasonably clear signal as to the precise rationale for its exercise of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the equities in the present case are especially troublesome, and the personal stakes for Onwuamaegbu ought not be determined on the basis of mere supposition. Onwuamaegbu admittedly passed bad checks, then concealed his criminal convictions at the time he obtained an \"adjustment of status\" in 1989. On the other hand, he has since resided in the United States for nearly twenty years without further criminal behavior, and has a spouse and children. Moreover, the IJ found that his deportation would result in extreme hardship to Onwuamaegbu's family. In these extraordinary circumstances, it is essential that the case be remanded to the BIA, with instructions to issue a written clarification of the grounds for its affirmance of the IJ's denial of a &#167; 212(h) waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Onwuamaegbu has waived any challenge to the IJ's determination that he was in fact subject to removal under &#167; 212(a)(6)(C)(i). <i>See supra</i> Section II.B.

During 1986, he (i) married a lawful permanent resident (LPR); (ii) was convicted of larceny by check in Massachusetts and received a suspended six-month sentence; and (iii) applied for adjustment to LPR status based on his recent marriage to an LPR. In his application, however, Onwuamaegbu falsely responded \"no\" to the question: \"Have you ever, in or outside the United States, been arrested, cited, charged, indicted, convicted, fined, or imprisoned for breaking or violating any law or ordinance, including traffic violations?\" In 1988, Onwuamaegbu was convicted on two occasions for forgery in New Hampshire, and again received suspended sentences. Nevertheless, Onwuamaegbu was granted unconditional LPR status in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point prior to March 14, 2000, Onwuamaegbu took a trip of unknown duration to Nigeria. Upon returning to the United States, he was charged with inadmissibility by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), based on his three prior convictions for crimes of moral turpitude (<i>viz.,</i> larceny by check and forgery), INA &#167; 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and for his willful misrepresentation regarding his Massachusetts conviction in his 1986 application for adjustment of status, INA &#167; 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). Onwuamaegbu conceded removability, but contended that his deportation would result in \"extreme hardship\" to his family, and requested waivers of inadmissibility pursuant to INA &#167; 212(h) and (i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, the immigration judge (IJ) found Onwuamaegbu removable under INA &#167; 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) or &#167; 212(a)(6)(C)(i). Although the IJ determined that Onwuamaegbu's family would suffer extreme hardship if he were to be deported, she denied his request for a &#167; 212(h) and (i) waiver due to the fact that he had previously been admitted as an LPR, but had not accrued the requisite seven years of continuous lawful residence in the United States. Onwuamaegbu appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA, contending that the IJ had erred in denying him a &#167; 212(h) or (i) waiver, given that: (i) Onwuamaegbu had achieved LPR status in 1989; (ii) the fact that he achieved that status by fraudulent means was not relevant to his entitlement to a &#167; 212(h) waiver; (iii) he therefore had lived lawfully and continuously in the United States from 1989 to 2000 (<i>viz.,</i> more than the requisite seven years); and (iv) his brief trip to Nigeria could not&#8212;as a matter of law&#8212; have retolled the seven-year continuous residence requirement. In September 2004, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision. Onwuamaegbu did not petition for review of that denial, electing instead to file a timely motion to reconsider the BIA's denial of his appeal. The BIA denied the motion for reconsideration, and Onwuamaegbu filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Onwuamaegbu filed no petition for review from the BIA's September 2004 denial of his appeal from the IJ's decision, and that denial became final after 30 days,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we lack jurisdiction to review it. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(1); <i>Zhang v.

Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 274, &#167; 1. He further contends that his failure to disclose this \"misdemeanor\" conviction on his 1986 LPR application was therefore, by definition, not \"material,\" hence not an additional ground for removability under &#167; 212(a)(6)(C)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address these questions, however, as Onwuamaegbu failed to raise them before the BIA, either by appeal from the IJ's decision, or in his motion for reconsideration.

Hence, subsection 1 invests the Attorney General with the discretion to grant a waiver to an immigrant who demonstrates that his deportation will result in familial hardship, whereas subsection 2 defines several subcategories of immigrants who are <i>per se</i> ineligible for this waiver even if they can establish \"extreme hardship\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found that Onwuamaegbu satisfied the \"extreme hardship\" criterion of &#167; 212(h)(1)(B), but went on to deny the waiver because Onwuamaegbu (i) was an immigrant \"previously ... admitted\" for lawful permanent residence, and (ii) had \"not lawfully resided continuously in the United States for a period of not less than seven years.\" The IJ noted that the BIA had interpreted the unambiguous phrase \"previously . . . admitted\" to refer to any immigrant who had in fact obtained LPR status, regardless of whether he had done so by lawful or unlawful means. <i>See In re Ayala-Arevalo,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">833810</span></span>, 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 398, 401 (BIA 1998). Thus, the IJ noted that Onwuamaegbu's admission as an LPR in 1987, even if he obtained that status by making a material misrepresentation in his application, satisfied the \"previously . . . admitted\" criterion of &#167; 212(h), and Onwuamaegbu was therefore \"bound\" by the requirement that he must have lawfully resided continuously in the United States for at least seven years. The IJ noted that Onwuamaegbu was a \"returning alien\" in March 2000, and therefore did not satisfy the seven-year requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the petition for review, Onwuamaegbu maintains that the IJ's decision is erroneous, as a matter of law, in that it used March 2000 as the measuring point for the \"seven year\" period, whereas the IJ should have inquired whether Onwuamaegbu had continuously resided in the United States from March 1993 to March 2000. The answer, Onwuamaegbu suggests, is plainly \"yes.\" He contends that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his reconsideration motion because <i>Ayala,</i> the sole basis for the IJ's decision, does not provide a definition of the critical phrase \"lawfully resided continuously\". Furthermore, Onwuamaegbu posits that the IJ could not have determined that his trip abroad had tolled his period of continuous United States residence without first determining the circumstances and duration of the trip, which she unquestionably did not do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Ayala and the \"Previously Admitted\" Factor</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 212(h) embodies two distinct concepts: (i) previous admission \"as an alien <i>lawfully admitted</i> for permanent residence,\" and (ii) <i>continuous lawful residence.</i> (Emphasis added.) The <i>Ayala</i> case notes that the former concept is a <i>threshold</i> criterion, in that it defines the class of aliens who are required to satisfy the latter \"lawful residence\" criterion, which is contained in a pendant \"if\" clause. <i>See Ayala,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 401. Once an immigrant has been admitted as an LPR, he may obtain a waiver only if he meets the seven-year rule. If an immigrant has never before been admitted as an LPR (<i>viz.,</i> if he is an illegal alien), he is <i>not</i> disqualified from obtaining a &#167; 212(h) waiver, whether or not he has lawfully resided continuously in the United States for seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it may seem incongruous that Congress accorded such preferential treatment to a non-LPR immigrant over one who has already achieved LPR status, the courts uniformly have upheld this statutory distinction against equal protection challenges. <i>See, e.g., De Leon-Reynoso v.

The purported \"rational basis\" for the distinction made by Congress is that LPR immigrants have enjoyed the benefits and advantages that attend their \"lawful\" status, and should they engage in unlawful acts while remaining LPRs, they should be subject to harsher consequences than a non-LPR immigrant. <i>See De Leon-Reynoso,</i> 293 F.3d at 639-40. That is precisely the import of <i>Ayala:</i> even an immigrant who has obtained LPR status by unlawful means goes on to enjoy the same special benefits of LPR status as one who obtained it by lawful means. By using the term \"<i>previously</i> admitted,\" rather than (for example) \"previously and lawfully admitted,\" Congress demonstrated that it specifically intended to penalize those immigrants who sought and gained LPR status only to abuse its benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, based on the extant BIA precedent, the IJ rationally concluded, as a threshold matter, that Onwuamaegbu was an immigrant \"previously ... admitted ... as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,\" even though he had fraudulently misrepresented a material fact in his 1986 LPR application, and the IJ determined that Onwuamaegbu therefore was \"bound,\" by subsection 212(h), to satisfy the seven-year rule. <i>See Ayala,</i> 22 I. &amp; N.

In a word, then, like Ayala, Onwuamaegbu was <i>not</i> a non-LPR, <i>viz.,</i> an illegal alien entitled to escape the strictures of the seven-year test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Lawful Continuous Residence Factor</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After resolving this threshold eligibility question under <i>Ayala,</i> however, the IJ still was required to determine whether Onwuamaegbu had \"lawfully resided continuously in the United States for a period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the United States.\" (Emphasis added.) <i>Ayala,</i> which dealt exclusively with the threshold term \"`previously been admitted' to the United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,\" did not reach the issue of the seven-year test's distinct concept of lawful and continuous <i>residence.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the latter requirement, the IJ set forth a very terse holding, which provides <i>in toto:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the respondent was admitted to the United States on March 14, 2000 as a returning LPR, he has not lawfully resided continuously in the United States for seven years, rendering him ineligible for a waiver under &#167; 212(h) of the Act. As such, he remains removable under &#167; 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent argues that we should assume from this statement that the IJ denied the &#167; 212(h) waiver because she determined that Onwuamaegbu had obtained his LPR status in 1989 by fraudulent means, and therefore his requisite period of seven-years \"lawful\" residence under &#167; 212(h) never commenced in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with the IJ's concise holding, however, is that it fails to pinpoint with sufficient clarity the IJ's precise rationale, and because the BIA <i>summarily</i> affirmed the IJ's decision, leaves us without an adequate basis for deciding whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying Onwuamaegbu's reconsideration. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) (noting that the BIA's summary affirmance connotes only the BIA's agreement with the <i>result</i> reached by the IJ, rather than the IJ's specific <i>rationale</i>). We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's bare reference to the term \"returning alien\" seems to direct us implicitly to INA &#167; 1101(a)(13), which governs the status of LPRs returning to the United States from a trip abroad. As a returning LPR, Onwuamaegbu presumptively would not have been regarded as an applicant for admission (<i>viz.,</i> would not have been placed in deportation proceedings), unless he fell under one of six exceptions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) has abandoned or relinquished that status,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) has been absent from the United States for a continuous period in excess of 180 days,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) has engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iv) has departed from the United States while under legal process seeking removal of the alien from the United States, including removal proceedings under this chapter and extradition proceedings,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(v) has committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2) of this title, unless since such offense the alien has been granted relief under section 1182(h) or 1229b(a) of this title, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(vi) is attempting to enter at a time or place other than as designated by immigration officers or has not been admitted to the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 101(a)(13)(C), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(13)(C). The IJ did not specify which exception she relied on in determining Onwuamaegbu inadmissible. Because Onwuamaegbu left the United States in 2000 to travel to Nigeria, he was a \"returning alien\" presumptively entitled to readmission, but his circumstances&#8212;<i>viz.,</i> his trip abroad and his prior conviction for crimes of moral turpitude&#8212;potentially barred his readmission as an LPR under exceptions (i), (ii), and/or (v) to subsection 101(a)(13).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted, however, <i>see supra</i> Section II.C.1, <i>Ayala</i> was the only case discussed at length by the IJ. Although the IJ correctly determined that Onwuamaegbu was <i>required to</i> establish seven-years' residence under &#167; 212(h) to obtain a waiver, <i>Ayala</i> did not reach the issue of the lawful-and-continuous-residence requirement, and does not constitute a valid ground for denying Onwuamaegbu a &#167; 212(h) waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> At the present juncture, we cannot determine whether or not the IJ rested the &#167; 212(h) denial entirely on <i>Ayala,</i> and by extension, whether or not the BIA accordingly interpreted the IJ's holding, thereby abusing its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Onwuamaegbu plausibly contends that it is impossible for us to determine with sufficient certainty the rationale underlying the IJ's laconic holding as to the &#167; 212(h) \"lawful\" and \"continuous\" residency requirement, and that for all we know she may have rested her decision&#8212; for example&#8212;solely on the interruption in Onwuamaegbu's \"continuous\" United States residency occasioned by his Nigerian trip in 2000. The IJ simply noted that Onwuamaegbu \"has not lawfully resided continuously in the United States for seven years,\" without specifying whether the fatal defect consisted of a lack of lawfulness, continuity, or both. Moreover, by adverting to the date March 14, 2000, the IJ invited an inference that Onwuamaegbu's Nigerian trip somehow may have <i>retolled</i> his seven-year residency period, setting the clock back to zero. If the IJ did rely on the Nigerian trip's interruption of Onwuamaegbu's seven-year residency period (from March 1993 to March 2000), such a finding is not supported by \"substantial evidence\" in the record, since no evidence was adduced at the hearing concerning the duration of Onwuamaegbu's trip to Nigeria, let alone any evidence that his trip had lasted more than the 180 days prescribed by &#167; 1101(a)(13)(ii). Once again, it would have been an abuse of discretion had the BIA so interpreted the IJ's holding, and affirmed on that ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these alternative interpretations of the IJ's <i>ratio decidendi,</i> the efficacy of the respondent's contention that the IJ must have denied the &#167; 212(h) waiver pursuant to exception (v) of INA &#167; 101(a)(13)(C) because the IJ determined that Onwuamaegbu had obtained his LPR status in 1989 by fraudulent means and that his \"residence\" for purposes of &#167; 212(h) was \"unlawful\" <i>ab initio,</i> can hardly be deemed incontestable. Were that the intended rationale, one reasonably could expect some mention of the date of the inception of Onwuamaegbu's unconditional LPR status in 1989, and not March 14, 2000, as the date of primary significance. Although the hearing transcript reveals that the IJ explored the \"<i>ab initio</i>\" theory with the parties, there is no such definitive <i>ore tenus</i> holding. Had the IJ ultimately decided to rely on the <i>ab initio</i> theory, moreover, one reasonably would expect some statement in her written opinion that this was the conceptual basis for denying the &#167; 212(h) waiver. Once again we are left with a double-layered ambiguity: what was the basis for the IJ's decision, and what inferences did the BIA draw regarding the basis for the IJ's decision?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, it is not at all obvious that the IJ would have relied on the \"<i>ab initio</i>\" principle as constituting settled and clear-cut law. In support of that principle, respondent cites cases which distantly predate the 1996 enactment of &#167; 212(h), and which plainly turn upon the appropriate interpretation of the distinct term \"lawful <i>admission,</i>\" rather than \"lawful <i>residence.</i>\" <i>See, e.g., Matter of Longstaff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424757\"><a href=\"/opinion/424757/in-the-matter-of-petition-for-naturalization-of-richard-john-longstaff/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span>, 1441 (5th Cir.1983); <i>cf. In re Koloamatangi,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 550-51 (defining, for purposes of cancellation of removal under INA &#167; 240A(a), the phrase \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" to exclude admissions acquired by fraudulent means). The terms \"admission\" and \"residence\" plainly are not incontestably coterminous. No extant court or BIA decision has interpreted the term \"lawfully\" in &#167; 212(h), and the statute itself affords no definition. <i>See Yepez-Razo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794132\"><a href=\"/opinion/794132/miriam-eliu-yepez-razo-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span>, 1219 n. 6 (9th Cir.2006).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Onwuamaegbu was \"lawfully\" <i>admitted,</i> per <i>Ayala,</i> and it is at least arguable that, as a \"<i>lawful</i> permanent <i>resident,</i>\" he \"resided\" lawfully in the United States for the requisite seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, since the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ, it never set forth its own rationale for affirming the IJ's denial of the &#167; 212(h) waiver. <i>See Zhang,</i> 348 F.3d at 293 (noting that the BIA abuses its discretion if its denial is \"made without a `rational explanation'\") (citation omitted). The BIA's \"[f]ailure to explain a decision adequately provides a ground for reversal .... [since] cursory, summary or conclusory statements from the Board leave us to presume nothing other than an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Zhao v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774878\"><a href=\"/opinion/774878/ke-zhen-zhao-v-united-states-department-of-justice-janet-reno-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 97 (2d Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Moreover, the BIA may have affirmed on some other ground not apparent to us. Yet, it is extremely problematic for appeals courts to assess an exercise of the BIA's discretion absent a reasonably clear signal as to the precise rationale for its exercise of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the equities in the present case are especially troublesome, and the personal stakes for Onwuamaegbu ought not be determined on the basis of mere supposition. Onwuamaegbu admittedly passed bad checks, then concealed his criminal convictions at the time he obtained an \"adjustment of status\" in 1989. On the other hand, he has since resided in the United States for nearly twenty years without further criminal behavior, and has a spouse and children. Moreover, the IJ found that his deportation would result in extreme hardship to Onwuamaegbu's family. In these extraordinary circumstances, it is essential that the case be remanded to the BIA, with instructions to issue a written clarification of the grounds for its affirmance of the IJ's denial of a &#167; 212(h) waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Onwuamaegbu has waived any challenge to the IJ's determination that he was in fact subject to removal under &#167; 212(a)(6)(C)(i). <i>See supra</i> Section II.B. As we cannot determine with sufficient certainty the basis for the BIA's denial of Onwuamaegbu's motion for reconsideration, however, we vacate the denial and remand the case to the BIA for its issuance, in due course, of a written clarification of its rationale for accepting the IJ's denial of the &#167; 212(h) waiver application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>We hereby grant the petition for review of the BIA's denial of the motion for reconsideration, and remand the case to the BIA for an order of clarification consistent with the opinion herein.
