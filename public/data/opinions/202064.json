José A. Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Isabel M.

Plaintiffs are employees of\n\nthe Administration of Corrections in Puerto Rico.             They filed suit\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that defendants demoted them in\n\nviolation of their First Amendment and due process rights.                  The\n\ncase went to trial, and a jury found in favor of plaintiffs,\n\nawarding them compensatory and punitive damages.              Defendants now\n\nappeal.    We affirm.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n            Defendants are contesting the jury's verdict in favor of\n\nthe plaintiffs.     In considering the issues raised on appeal, we do\n\nnot   evaluate    the   credibility    of   the   witnesses    or   weigh   the\n\nevidence.   Vázquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz, 385 F.3d 23, 29 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).      Rather, we construe all rational inferences in favor\n\nof the jury's verdict.         Id. at 29-30.        We now summarize the\n\nevidence presented at trial.\n\n            Discrimination based on political-party affiliation is\n\nrampant in government employment in Puerto Rico.          See, e.g., Pérez\n\nv. Zayas, 396 F. Supp. 2d 90 (D.P.R. 2005); Román Román v. Delgado\n\nAltieri, 390 F. Supp. 2d 94 (D.P.R. 2005); Padilla Román v.\n\nHernández Pérez, 381 F. Supp. 2d 17 (D.P.R. 2005); Sueiro Vázquez\n\nv. Torregrosa De la Rosa, 380 F. Supp. 2d 63 (D.P.R. 2005); Rovira\n\nRivera v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth., 364 F. Supp. 2d 154 (D.P.R.\n\n2005); Irizarry-López v. Torres-González, 363 F. Supp. 2d 7 (D.P.R.\n\n2005).    It has cost Puerto Rican taxpayers dearly in verdicts paid\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\ffrom public funds.      P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5142.        In an effort\n\nto combat political discrimination, Puerto Rico has an Electoral\n\nMoratorium    that    prohibits   certain     \"appointments,    promotions,\n\ndemotions, transfers and changes in the category of the employees\"\n\nfor the two months before and after a general election.           P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 3, § 1337.     In the year 2000, general elections were held\n\non November 8, 2000, so the Moratorium commenced on September 8,\n\n2000 and ended on January 8, 2001.\n\n            Before the 2000 election, the Governor of Puerto Rico was\n\na member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\").            Immediately prior\n\nto the commencement of the Electoral Moratorium, at least thirty-\n\nfour   personnel     changes   took   place   in    the   Administration   of\n\nCorrections (\"AOC\").      These personnel changes were authorized by\n\nthe Administrator of the AOC, Zoé Laboy (\"Laboy\"), who had been\n\nappointed by the NPP Governor.\n\n            In the 2000 election, a member of the Popular Democratic\n\nParty (\"PDP\") was elected Governor.           The new Governor appointed\n\ndefendant     Víctor      Rivera-González          (\"Rivera-González\")     as\n\nAdministrator of the AOC, who in turn appointed defendant Ana\n\nDávila-Lao (\"Dávila\") as his Chief Legal Advisor.                 The human\n\nresources director under the former administration, who later\n\nbecame Rivera-González's assistant, told Rivera-González that some\n\nappointments made by the previous administration may have been\n\nunlawful.    Rivera-González asked Dávila to investigate the matter.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fDávila then proceeded to conduct a review of the thirty-four\n\npersonnel changes that took place immediately before the Electoral\n\nMoratorium.      This list of thirty-four included every member of\n\nLaboy's staff, except for one who was a PDP member.1                      It was\n\ndetermined that eighteen of these thirty-four personnel changes\n\nwere illegal, and these personnel changes were revoked. Two of the\n\neighteen people affected were plaintiffs Mirla M. Rodríguez-Marín\n\n(\"Rodríguez\") and Ana I. Escobar-Pabón (\"Escobar\"). Dávila asserts\n\nthat    this    review    was    objective    and    denied     knowing   either\n\nRodríguez's or Escobar's political affiliation.\n\nA.    Mirla M. Rodríguez-Marín\n\n            Rodríguez began working for the AOC in 1994 in the\n\nposition of Social-Penal Technician I, a career position.2                  Over\n\nthe years, she was promoted to a number of trust positions: Special\n\nAssistant II, Director of Legal Affairs, and Executive Aide of\n\nCorrectional Services.          In the summer of 2000, the AOC implemented\n\na    Classification      and   Compensation   Plan   (\"the     Plan\"),    whereby\n\nemployees      were   evaluated     and   reclassified        into   appropriate\n\n\n1\n   The trial testimony did not clearly indicate whether this list\nof thirty-four consisted entirely of NPP supporters or affiliates,\nbut it is a reasonable inference to make from the testimony.\n2\n   A career position is subject to the merit principle, whereby a\ncompetitive process is used to fill the position. An employee in\na career position has a due process right to that position and\ncannot be removed without cause. In contrast, a trust position is\nnot subject to the merit principle, and an employee in a trust\nposition may be removed without cause.          Ruiz-Casillas v.\nCamacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127, 134 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpositions. Under the Plan, Rodríguez was classified as Director of\n\nthe Legal Division, a trust position. Rodríguez met with Laboy and\n\nrequested to be classified into the career position of attorney.\n\nOn September 7, 2000, one day before the commencement of the\n\nElectoral Moratorium, Rodríguez received four letters notifying her\n\nof changes in her employment status.           The first letter reinstated\n\nher to the career position of Social-Penal Technician I; the second\n\npromoted her to the career position of Attorney I, with a one-year\n\nprobationary period; the third raised her salary to the maximum\n\nallowable for that position; and the fourth ordered her to continue\n\nserving   in   her     current   trust   position,   indicating    that    her\n\nprobation term for the Attorney I position would begin at the\n\nconclusion of the trust position.\n\n           When      Rivera-González     was   appointed   Administrator    in\n\nJanuary   2001,   he    became   Rodríguez's     direct    supervisor.     She\n\ntestified that during this time, Rivera-González made several\n\ncomments to her to the effect that he was under political pressure\n\nfor leaving too many NPP members in cushy positions at the AOC.\n\nRivera-González denied making such statements.               In March 2001,\n\nRivera-González removed Rodríguez from her trust position and\n\nreinstated her to her career position of Attorney I.               Rodríguez\n\ndoes not contest the removal from her trust position.\n\n           Rodríguez alleges that she was mistreated because of her\n\npolitical affiliation.       At one point, she went to her office and\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdiscovered that her desk had been taken away, with her computer and\n\nother belongings strewn across the floor. After she complained, an\n\nold, surplus desk was placed in the office.         The person in charge\n\nof maintenance refused to clean her office because she was a member\n\nof the NPP.     Because of this mistreatment, Rodríguez asked to be\n\ntransferred to Ponce.\n\n           In Ponce, Rodríguez was litigating cases for the AOC and\n\nDávila was her supervisor.      In June 2001, four agents came to her\n\ndesk to deliver a letter annulling her promotion to Attorney I and\n\nreinstating her as a Social-Penal Technician I.              She found it\n\nhumiliating that four agents would be sent, implying that she was\n\na dangerous person.      She was not given a hearing or any warning\n\nbefore being demoted. She received another letter assigning her to\n\nthe Ponce maximum security facility, where dangerous criminals were\n\nheld and against whom she had litigated cases.          Because of this,\n\nshe feared working there.\n\n           Rodríguez went to see Rivera-González, and he referred\n\nher to Dávila because she was the chairperson of the committee\n\nreviewing the promotions and she had issued the recommendation that\n\nthe promotion was unlawful.        Dávila told her that she was not\n\nentitled   to   a   hearing   because    the   appointment   was   illegal.\n\nRodríguez testified that Dávila told her that she could not be left\n\nin such a cushy position with such a high salary, but Dávila denied\n\nsaying this.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f              The demotion letter stated that \"there [was] no evidence\n\non   file    of   compliance     with    the    due    process    of    law   in   the\n\nrecruitment and selection for [her] appointment.\"                  When Rodríguez\n\nwent to examine her personnel file, she discovered that it was\n\nbeing held by Dávila, even though access to a personnel file\n\nrequires the employee's authorization, and Rodríguez had not given\n\nauthorization.       Rodríguez discovered that papers documenting her\n\npromotion were missing from her file.                  This was corroborated by\n\nMarie Rivera, an employee in the human resources office, who\n\ntestified     that   documents    were    missing       from   Rodríguez's     file.\n\nRodríguez had the original versions of these missing papers, and\n\nshe showed them to Rivera-González.               Rodríguez threatened legal\n\naction over the missing documents, and the missing documents\n\nmysteriously reappeared in her file.                  Dávila insisted that even\n\nthough      the   missing   documents     had    been    replaced,      Rodríguez's\n\nappointment was still illegal. The director of recruitment, Héctor\n\nRivera-Rivera,       testified    that    he     certified       that   Rodríguez's\n\nappointment to Attorney I had been lawful.\n\n              In July 2002, one year after she had been demoted,\n\nRodríguez filed this suit.         In September 2002, after learning from\n\nHéctor Rivera-Rivera that the appointment had been lawful, Rivera-\n\nGonzález ordered that Rodríguez be reinstated.                     Rivera-González\n\ntestified that she was a competent employee. She received a letter\n\ninforming her of the reinstatement, which stated that her salary\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fwould be determined later.             For the first two months after being\n\nreinstated, she was not paid and was not given an office.                          She then\n\nwent to Rivera-González, and he assigned attorney Gloria Ortiz-\n\nMartínez to evaluate the situation.                  Ortiz testified that she was\n\nunable to work on the case because she needed Rodríguez's personnel\n\nfile and Dávila did not give it to her despite being asked to do\n\nso.   Rodríguez        testified       that,      after    again   going      to    Rivera-\n\nGonzález,    he    advised    her      to   wait     until    Dávila's        forthcoming\n\ntransfer to another government agency.                       He denied making this\n\nstatement.\n\n            Rodríguez      also     testified         as     to    Dávila's        personal\n\ninvolvement in revoking her promotion.                    She testified that Rivera-\n\nGonzález and Raymond Mira, the director of human resources, stated\n\nin depositions that Dávila was a member of the transition committee\n\nof the PDP for the corrections administration and was also a\n\npolitical liaison between the governor's office and the corrections\n\nadministration. She also testified that personnel directors stated\n\nin their depositions that Dávila initiated the review of the\n\nthirty-four       personnel     changes,       and    that    José    Ortiz,       who   was\n\ndirector     of    human   resources        at     the     time,     stated    that      her\n\nappointment was legal.\n\n            As     a   result     of    her       demotion,       Rodríguez        suffered\n\nemotionally and financially.                She suffered depression from the\n\nstigma of the demotion, which caused her to have nightmares and\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\ffight with her family.      She underwent emotional therapy for one\n\nyear.     With her greatly diminished salary, she was unable to pay\n\nher bills and her credit was damaged.\n\nB.   Ana I. Escobar-Pabón\n\n            Escobar began working for the AOC in 1986 in the career\n\nposition of Social-Penal Technician I, and she was later promoted\n\nto   Social-Penal    Technician      IV.      Beginning    in    1994,   she    was\n\nappointed to a number of trust positions.               In June 2000, the AOC\n\ncreated a new career position of Regional Head of Programs and\n\nServices (\"Regional Head\"). After this position was announced, the\n\nAOC decided to revise the job requirements because of complaints\n\nthat the requirements were not appropriate.                Laboy approved the\n\nrevised    job   requirements   on    September    7,     2000   and   made    them\n\neffective as of June 1, 2000.              Laboy appointed Escobar Regional\n\nHead on September 6, 2000, which was one day before the approval of\n\nthe revised requirements and two days before the commencement of\n\nthe Electoral Moratorium.\n\n            Escobar testified that after the election on November 7,\n\n2000, her co-workers started harassing her because of her political\n\naffiliation, stating that they would \"ravage\" NPP members.                     She\n\ntestified that her supervisor, Ramón Díaz-Ferrera, was an active\n\nmember of the PDP and would criticize her when she used the term\n\n\"government of Puerto Rico\" and insisted that she say \"Commonwealth\n\nof Puerto Rico,\" a term preferred by the PDP.                He denied making\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fsuch statements on a regular basis but did admit to once correcting\n\nan employee who used the term \"state government\" and instructed him\n\nto    use    the   term   \"central   government\"   when   referring   to   the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.           Another officer of the agency, José\n\nCordero-Padró, told her that they were going to \"drag away\" NPP\n\nmembers and put an end to corruption.\n\n              In July 2001, four employees came to her desk to deliver\n\na letter informing her that her appointment as Regional Head had\n\nbeen declared null.          She was reinstated to her previous vested\n\ncareer position of Social-Penal Technician IV.            She had no notice\n\nthat her appointment was being evaluated.           Her letter also stated\n\n\"there [was] no evidence on file of compliance with the due process\n\nof law in the recruitment and selection for [her] appointment.\"\n\nShe met with Dávila, who told her that necessary documentation was\n\nnot present in her file.       She had copies of these missing documents\n\nand gave them to Dávila.        Dávila later told her that even with all\n\nof the documentation she had not complied with all the requirements\n\nfor    the    position.       Héctor    Rivera-Rivera,    the   director    of\n\nrecruitment, testified that he certified that Escobar satisfied the\n\noriginally posted requirements for the position of Regional Head\n\nand also that she was qualified under the amended job requirements\n\ndated September 7, 2001.             Raymond Mira, the director of human\n\nresources, testified that Escobar's appointment was void because\n\nthe job description was amended after her appointment and that this\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fviolated the principle of merit.           Neither Rivera-Rivera nor Mira\n\ngave further explanation as to the legality or illegality of\n\nEscobar's appointment.\n\n           As a result of her demotion, Escobar testified that she\n\nhad to seek psychological help, was unable to sleep, and because\n\nshe could not afford to pay her bills, her credit was harmed.\n\nWhile this lawsuit was pending, she was promoted to Correctional\n\nFacilities Superintendent II, but was then again demoted to her\n\ncurrent position of Social Penal Technician IV.\n\nC.   Procedural History\n\n           Rodríguez and Escobar filed suit against Rivera-González\n\nand Dávila, claiming political discrimination and a violation of\n\nprocedural due process rights.         After a five-day trial, the jury\n\nfound in favor of Rodríguez and Escobar on both their political\n\ndiscrimination and procedural due process claims. The jury awarded\n\nRodríguez back pay of $3,500 per month, $180,000 in compensatory\n\ndamages, and $120,000 in punitive damages against Dávila. The jury\n\nawarded   Escobar   back   pay    of   $3,306   per   month,   $105,000   in\n\ncompensatory damages, and $195,000 in punitive damages against\n\nDávila.\n\n           Defendants made the full panoply of motions, moving for\n\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), judgment as a matter of law under\n\nRules 50(a) and 50(b), a new trial under Rule 59(a), and an altered\n\njudgment under Rule 59(e).       The district court denied all of their\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fmotions.   Defendants now appeal the denial of all of their motions\n\non various grounds: (1) the denial of their Rule 50(a), 50(b),\n\n59(a),   and   59(e)    motions    contesting          the   jury's      finding      that\n\ndefendants violated plaintiffs' procedural due process rights; (2)\n\nthe denial of their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions\n\ncontesting     the     jury's     finding       that    defendants        politically\n\ndiscriminated against plaintiffs; (3) the denial of their Rule\n\n12(b)(6), 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions asserting the\n\nqualified immunity defense; and (4) the denial of their Rule 50(b),\n\n59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages awards as excessive.         Because we affirm the jury's verdict\n\nthat defendants politically discriminated against plaintiffs, we\n\ndecline to consider the alternative ground that defendants violated\n\nplaintiffs' due process rights.            We address defendants' arguments\n\nin turn.\n\n                       II.   Political Discrimination\n\n           The jury found that defendants discriminated against both\n\nplaintiffs on the basis of their political affiliation. On appeal,\n\ndefendants challenge the jury's verdict on three grounds: (1) there\n\nwas   insufficient     evidence     of    discriminatory        animus;3        (2)    the\n\ndistrict   court     erred   in   instructing      the       jury   on    the   defense\n\n\n\n3\n  Defendants separately argue that Escobar presented insufficient\nevidence that defendants had knowledge of her political\naffiliation. We consider this argument along with the argument\nalleging insufficient evidence of discriminatory animus.\n\n                                         -12-\n\farticulated in Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\n\n429 U.S. 274 (1977); and (3) there was sufficient evidence for a\n\njury to grant the Mt. Healthy defense.\n\nA.   Insufficient Evidence of Discriminatory Animus\n\n           The First Amendment protects the right of public career\n\nemployees -- those not in trust or policy-making positions -- to\n\nengage in political activities without fear of adverse employment\n\nactions.   Padilla-García v. José Guillermo Rodríguez, 212 F.3d 69,\n\n74 (1st Cir. 2000).     It is undisputed that Rodríguez and Escobar\n\nwere public career employees at the time they suffered adverse\n\nemployment actions.     The plaintiffs here \"bear[] the burden of\n\nproducing sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which\n\na jury reasonably may infer that [their] constitutionally protected\n\nconduct -- in this case, political affiliation with the NPP -- was\n\na 'substantial' or 'motivating' factor behind [their demotions].\"\n\nVázquez-Valentín, 385 F.3d at 30 (internal quotation marks and\n\nalterations omitted).\n\n           Defendants assert on appeal that the district court\n\nimproperly denied their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions\n\ncontesting the jury's finding of political discrimination.       In\n\ntheir brief, defendants developed only the argument that the\n\nevidence was insufficient for a jury to find discriminatory animus.\n\nWe thus address only defendants' Rule 50 argument and consider the\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fother arguments waived.4        Acevedo-García v. Monroig, 351 F.3d 547,\n\n561 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"We have steadfastly deemed waived issues\n\nraised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by\n\ndeveloped argumentation.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).            We\n\nreview the denial of a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw de novo.    Zachar v. Lee, 363 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir. 2004).           We\n\nwill affirm \"unless the evidence, together with all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the verdict, could lead a reasonable person\n\nto only one conclusion, namely, that the moving party was entitled\n\nto judgment.\"       Sheils Title Co. v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins.\n\nCo., 184 F.3d 10, 19 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).       We have no trouble finding that plaintiffs\n\npresented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that\n\nplaintiffs' political affiliations were a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor behind their demotions.\n\n            First, plaintiffs presented ample evidence that their\n\ndemotions    were    improper     and     the   result   of   discrimination.\n\nRodríguez and Escobar were long-standing employees of the AOC --\n\nRodríguez since 1994 and Escobar since 1986 -- and both were\n\nconsidered competent employees. It is suspicious that both of them\n\nwere demoted without being given any notice or opportunity to\n\n\n\n4\n    Defendants also assert in their Rule 50 argument that the\ndistrict court erred in allowing hearsay testimony and other\nimproper evidence.  These arguments are also not developed and\nconsidered waived.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fdefend their promotions, especially since the initial explanation\n\noffered for the demotions was simply missing documentation.                        One\n\nwould expect that Rodríguez and Escobar would first be consulted to\n\ndetermine    if     the   necessary     documentation     had    been     misplaced.\n\nFurther, these missing documents mysteriously reappeared after\n\nRodríguez    and     Escobar    presented      their   copies    of     the     missing\n\ndocuments, and Rodríguez threatened an investigation over the\n\nmissing documents. Even after the missing documents were replaced,\n\nRodríguez     and     Escobar    were     not    reinstated;          rather,    other\n\njustifications were given for their demotions.              Finally, Rodríguez\n\nand Escobar's demotions appeared to be punitive.                       Rodríguez --\n\ndespite   her      competency,    experience,       law   degree,        and    notary\n\ncertification -- was reinstated into the low position of Social-\n\nPenal Technician I and placed in a dangerous environment at the\n\nmaximum security prison in Ponce.               Similarly, Escobar -- despite\n\nher 14 years of experience with the AOC and having nearly finished\n\nher probationary period as Regional Head -- was demoted to Social-\n\nPenal Technician IV.\n\n            Second, plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that\n\nDávila made the decision to demote them.               Dávila wrote a letter to\n\nthe human resources department, asking that the personnel files of\n\nthirty-four       employees,     including      Rodríguez       and     Escobar,    be\n\nevaluated.      After Rodríguez was demoted, she went to see Rivera-\n\nGonzález, and he referred her to Dávila.               Dávila told her that her\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fpromotion was unlawful and that she was not entitled to a hearing.\n\nWhen Rodríguez sought to examine her personnel file, she discovered\n\nthat Dávila was in possession of it. When another attorney, Gloria\n\nOrtiz, was assigned to evaluate Rodríguez's case, Dávila did not\n\ngive Ortiz the file despite being asked to do so.                      Escobar also\n\nconsulted Rivera-González after being demoted, and he advised her\n\nto speak with Dávila.          Dávila told her that documents were missing\n\nfrom   her    file,    and     Escobar   supplied     Dávila    with       the   missing\n\ndocuments.     At a later meeting, Dávila told her that even with all\n\nthe documentation, her demotion would stand because she had not met\n\nall the requirements for the position.\n\n              Third, plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that the\n\ndiscrimination was based on political affiliation.                    The review was\n\ninstigated     by     Dávila    (acting    on    behalf   of    the    incoming       PDP\n\nadministration) and every employee of Zoé Laboy (a member of the\n\noutgoing NPP administration) had his or her file reviewed except\n\nfor one, who happened to be a member of the PDP.                  Such a review is\n\nnot necessarily improper, as the PDP administration may certainly\n\ninvestigate         potential      illegal       appointments         by     the      NPP\n\nadministration.        However, it suggests that Dávila knew that both\n\nRodríguez and Escobar were NPP supporters.                     Rodríguez testified\n\nthat   both    Rivera-González       and     Dávila   made     statements        to   her\n\nindicating that her demotion was politically motivated.                          Rivera-\n\nGonzález and Dávila denied making such statements, but it is for\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fthe jury to resolve such issues of credibility.                            Finally, both\n\nRodríguez and Escobar testified that co-workers harassed them\n\nbecause of their political affiliation.                      This harassment provides\n\nfurther evidence that Rodríguez and Escobar's political affiliation\n\nwas known among the employees of the AOC and indirect evidence that\n\nDávila would also have been aware of their political affiliation.\n\nB.    Mt. Healthy Defense\n\n              Under certain circumstances, defendants may still prevail\n\neven if plaintiffs show that their political affiliations were a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor behind their demotions.                                Mt.\n\nHealthy,      429     U.S.    at    287.      The    Mt.     Healthy    defense    is    an\n\naffirmative defense available to defendants, whereby defendants\n\nmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiffs\n\nwould       have    been     dismissed        regardless        of     their   political\n\naffiliation. Id.; Vázquez-Valentín, 385 F.3d at 30. Thus, even if\n\npolitical affiliation was an improper consideration, defendants\n\nwill    prevail       if     they      can   show    that     plaintiffs'       political\n\naffiliation        was     not   the    \"but-for\"     cause     of   their     demotions.\n\nTejada-Batista v. Morales, 424 F.3d 97, 102 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nSánchez-López v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 130 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThe purpose of the defense is to prevent a plaintiff from being put\n\n\"in     a    better      position       as   a      result     of    the   exercise      of\n\nconstitutionally protected conduct than [she] would have occupied\n\nhad [she] done nothing.\"               Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 285.\n\n\n                                             -17-\n\f           Defendants assert on appeal that the district court\n\nimproperly denied their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions\n\nregarding their Mt. Healthy defense.            In their brief, they develop\n\nonly two arguments: first, that they presented sufficient evidence\n\nfor a jury to find a successful Mt. Healthy defense, and second,\n\nthat the district court improperly refused to include a jury\n\ninstruction describing the Mt. Healthy defense.                We address these\n\narguments in turn.\n\n           We    first   address    defendants'        argument      of   sufficient\n\nevidence for the Mt. Healthy defense.            In their brief, defendants\n\nstate the \"evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find\n\nthat Defendants prevailed in their Mt. Healthy defense.\"                         They\n\nfurther note that they \"presented evidence proving that they would\n\nhave   made     the   same     employment     determinations      based     on   the\n\nlegitimate nondiscriminatory justification of complying with Puerto\n\nRico personnel law.\"         In support of this argument, defendants cite\n\nonly one case, Vázquez-Valentín, for their proposition that \"the\n\ndemotion of a public employee resulting from the failure of her\n\nappointment      to   comply    with   personnel       laws    and    regulations,\n\nconstituted sufficient evidence to satisfy Mt. Healthy.\"\n\n           Defendants'        argument,     however,    does   not     address   the\n\nrequired legal standard.          In order for defendants to prevail on\n\nthis Rule 50 or sufficiency of the evidence claim, they need to\n\nshow that no reasonable jury could have denied their Mt. Healthy\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fdefense.   See Sheils Title Co., 184 F.3d at 19.          A showing that\n\ndefendants presented sufficient evidence for a jury to grant their\n\nMt. Healthy defense clearly does not meet this burden.           The case\n\nthey rely on, Vázquez-Valentín, does not support the proposition\n\nthey cite it for and did not even reach the Mt. Healthy defense.\n\nIn Vázquez-Valentín, we found that no reasonable jury could have\n\nfound \"that plaintiff's political affiliation was a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor in [the] adverse employment action.\" 385 F.3d at\n\n40.\n\n           Even if defendants had argued that no reasonable jury\n\ncould deny their Mt. Healthy defense under the appropriate legal\n\nstandard, they would be incorrect.          At trial, plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants presented conflicting evidence as to the legality of\n\nplaintiffs'     appointments.   Notably,    Héctor   Rivera-Rivera,   the\n\ndirector   of    recruitment,   testified   that     he   certified   that\n\nplaintiffs' appointments were legal.         A reasonable jury could\n\ncertainly find that political affiliation, not the legality of the\n\nappointments, was the \"but-for\" cause of the demotions. Therefore,\n\ndefendants' Mt. Healthy defense must fail.\n\n           We next address defendants' contention that the district\n\ncourt improperly refused to include a jury instruction describing\n\nthe Mt. Healthy defense.        Defendants submitted proposed jury\n\ninstructions for the Mt. Healthy defense.      Defendants contend that\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fthey properly preserved this issue for appeal.           The portion of the\n\ntranscript cited by defendants follows:\n\n           MS. RODRIGUEZ: Okay. And regarding the good\n           faith defense and the personal --\n\n           THE COURT: What do you mean by \"good faith\"?\n\n           MS.   RODRIGUEZ:   It  is   the defendants'\n           reasonable belief that they were acting by\n           authority of a valid statute.\n\n           THE COURT: I gave the instruction that says,\n           \"If there were other reasons, whether good or\n           bad,   proper   or   improper,   likeable   or\n           unlikeable, that motivated their actions, that\n           were not political discrimination, there is no\n           case.\" I said that.\n\n           THE COURT: That's it.       Very well.\n\nTo preserve an objection to a jury instruction for appeal, a party\n\nmust \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of\n\nthe objection.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(1).      Defendants' statement\n\nabove   does   not   constitute   an   objection    to   the   Mt.   Healthy\n\ninstruction. Indeed, in another portion of defendants' brief, they\n\nargue that this exact same language constitutes an objection to the\n\ndistrict court's jury instructions on qualified immunity.\n\n           Because defendants did not object to the district court's\n\njury instructions regarding the Mt. Healthy defense, we review for\n\nplain error.    Drohan v. Vaughn, 176 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\"Thus, we reverse only if there is a 'plain' or 'obvious' error\n\nthat 'affect[s] substantial rights' and which has resulted in a\n\n'miscarriage of justice or has undermined the integrity of the\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fjudicial process.'\"         Id. (quoting Wilson v. Maritime Overseas\n\nCorp., 150 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n            We find no plain error.          The district court gave a jury\n\ninstruction regarding the Mt. Healthy defense: \"It is sufficient if\n\nthe plaintiffs prove that their protected political activities were\n\nthe determinative factor in the consideration that was made, and\n\nthat it made a difference in the defendants' decision.\"                  This\n\ninstruction contains the substance of the Mt. Healthy defense.             In\n\norder to prevail on the Mt. Healthy defense, defendants must show\n\nthat   plaintiffs   would    have   been     demoted   regardless   of   their\n\npolitical affiliation.       Thus, if plaintiffs' political affiliation\n\nwas a \"determinative factor\" or \"made a difference,\" defendants\n\ncannot claim that plaintiffs would have been demoted regardless of\n\ntheir political affiliation.          Although the district court could\n\nhave been clearer in instructing the jury on the Mt. Healthy\n\ndefense and should have included the Mt. Healthy defense on the\n\nverdict form,5 the trial was certainly not a \"miscarriage of\n\njustice\" and did not \"undermine[] the integrity of the judicial\n\nprocess.\"     Wilson,   150    F.3d    at    7   (internal   quotation   marks\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n5\n  We suggested in Sánchez-López (published after the trial in this\ncase) that district courts include a question on the jury verdict\nform that explicitly incorporates the Mt. Healthy defense.\nSánchez-López, 375 F.3d at 135. Defendants have not contested the\njury verdict form on appeal.\n\n                                      -21-\n\f                              III.    Qualified Immunity\n\n            \"Qualified immunity specially protects public officials\n\nfrom the specter of damages liability for judgment calls made in a\n\nlegally uncertain environment.\"              Ryder v. United States, 515 U.S.\n\n177, 185 (1995).         An official is entitled to qualified immunity\n\nunless (1) \"the plaintiffs' allegations, if true, establish a\n\nconstitutional violation,\" (2) \"the right was clearly established\n\nat the time of the alleged violation,\" and (3) \"a reasonable\n\n[official],      similarly           situated,     would       understand     that     the\n\nchallenged conduct violated that established right.\"                              Suboh v.\n\nDist. Attorney's Office, 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).                              The\n\nfirst two    prongs of this test are questions of law for the court\n\nto decide.       Id.    The third prong is also a question of law, but\n\nfactual questions, to the extent they are antecedent to this\n\ndetermination,         must    be     determined    by     a     jury.      Id.      While\n\npreliminary factual questions regarding qualified immunity are sent\n\nto the jury, the legal question of the availability of qualified\n\nimmunity    is    \"ultimately         committed     to     the    court's    judgment.\"\n\nAcevedo-García, 351 F.3d at 563.\n\n            Defendants first contend that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to instruct the jury on qualified immunity.                         Defendants,\n\nhowever, are not entitled to a jury instruction regarding qualified\n\nimmunity, since it is a legal question for the court to decide.\n\nSee id.     Defendants are entitled to have a jury determine any\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fpreliminary factual questions, but defendants have not stated,\n\neither at trial or on appeal, precisely what factual questions\n\nwould need to be resolved before the court could determine the\n\nlegal issue of the official's reasonableness.                     In finding that\n\ndefendants politically discriminated against plaintiffs, the jury\n\nfound     that     defendants        intentionally        violated    plaintiffs'\n\nconstitutional rights.            Thus, it appears that any factual finding\n\nthe jury could make would not benefit defendants.                     We find no\n\nerror.\n\n            Defendants also argue that the court erred in failing to\n\ngrant them qualified immunity.                We review de novo the district\n\ncourt's denial of a qualified immunity defense. Suboh, 298 F.3d at\n\n90.      Defendants      remarkably     contest     all   three    prongs   of   the\n\nqualified immunity analysis.           We need not long consider the first\n\ntwo prongs.      Plaintiffs' allegations, if true, clearly established\n\na violation of their First Amendment rights, and such right was\n\nwell established at the time of the violation. See Acevedo-García,\n\n351 F.3d at 564.        In light of the jury's verdict and our affirmance\n\nof it, the third prong is also unavailing.                As just mentioned, the\n\njury    found    that   defendants     intentionally       violated   plaintiffs'\n\nconstitutional rights.             Any reasonable official would clearly\n\nunderstand       that   it   is    improper    to   intentionally     violate     an\n\nemployee's First Amendment rights.             See id. at 564-65.      Defendants\n\nwere not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f                      IV.   Excessive Damages\n\nA.   Compensatory Damages\n\n           Defendants contend that the compensatory damages award\n\nlacked evidentiary support and also that it was excessive.       In\n\nmaking these claims, they do not cite any First Circuit precedent.\n\nThey do cite a Fourth Circuit case, Price v. City of Charlotte, 93\n\nF.3d 1241 (4th Cir. 1996), which they miscite as a First Circuit\n\ncase, and an unpublished decision from the District of Puerto Rico,\n\nLaracuente-Pabón v. Rodríguez, No. 95-1528, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis\n\n22430 (D.P.R. Mar. 30, 1998).    They also cite three Supreme Court\n\ncases for the proposition that actual injury is required for an\n\naward of compensatory damages.    Further, in making this argument,\n\ndefendants were obliged to present the facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict but failed to do so.6      See Anthony v.\n\nG.M.D. Airline Servs., Inc., 17 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nGiven the defendants' failure to specify the applicable law and\n\ntheir failure to present the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nthe verdict, this argument is not sufficiently developed and thus\n\n\n\n6\n    Rodríguez testified that as a result of her demotion and\ntransfer to a dangerous, high-security prison, she sought emotional\ntherapy through state insurance. Defendants stated that Rodríguez\nvoluntarily decided to seek state benefits and was not compelled to\ndo so. Escobar testified that as a result of her demotion she was\nforced to seek psychological help, she needed medication to sleep\nwell, and her credit was harmed. Defendants argue, without any\nevidentiary support, that Escobar's emotional condition was not the\nresult defendants' actions but caused by her poor credit history\nand divorce.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fwaived.   See Colón v. R.K. Grace & Co., 358 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).     Even    assuming   that    this   argument    was   sufficiently\n\ndeveloped, the jury's award of compensatory damages was amply\n\nsupported by the record.\n\nB.   Punitive Damages\n\n           The    jury   awarded   punitive    damages    of   $120,000   to\n\nRodríguez and $195,000 to Escobar.            The punitive damages were\n\nassessed against Dávila.      Dávila argues that the punitive damages\n\naward was excessive.     We review this claim de novo.         Romano v. U-\n\nHaul Int'l, 233 F.3d 655, 672 (1st Cir. 2000).             The purpose of\n\npunitive damages is to punish and deter reprehensible conduct. Id.\n\nA punitive damages award will stand unless we find it \"certain that\n\nthe amount in question exceeds that necessary to punish and deter\n\nthe alleged misconduct.\"      Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Supreme Court has presented three guideposts to consider in\n\ndetermining the excessiveness of a punitive damages award: \"(1) the\n\ndegree of reprehensibility of a defendant's conduct; (2) the ratio\n\nbetween punitive and actual and potential damages; and (3) a\n\ncomparison of the punitive damages figure and other civil and\n\ncriminal penalties imposed for comparable conduct.\"            Id. at 672-73\n\n(citing BMW of N. Am. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 574-75 (1996)).\n\n           The first guidepost is \"perhaps the most important\" in\n\nthis determination.      BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 575.           Punitive\n\ndamages are justified \"'when the defendant's conduct is shown to be\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fmotivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or\n\ncallous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.'\"\n\nKolstad v. Ada, 527 U.S. 526, 536 (1999) (quoting Smith v. Wade,\n\n461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983)).         We have previously affirmed the award\n\npunitive damages to state employees suffering adverse employments\n\nactions in violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights.    Acevedo-García, 351 F.3d at 571; Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz\n\nVélez, 341 F.3d 86, 102 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Defendants' only argument against punitive damages is\n\nthat they did not violate plaintiffs' First or Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights.      Since the jury found otherwise and we construe all\n\nevidence in favor of the jury's verdict, this argument is to no\n\navail. The jury found that Dávila intentionally demoted plaintiffs\n\nbecause    of    their   political      affiliation.         Dávila's    act    also\n\njeopardized      plaintiffs'    livelihood.        As    a     result    of    their\n\ndemotions,      Rodríguez's    salary    was   reduced    by    60   percent     and\n\nEscobar's salary was reduced by 43 percent.                     Both plaintiffs\n\nsuffered harms to their professional careers, were unable to meet\n\ntheir financial obligations because of their reduced salaries, and\n\nsuffered     emotional    distress      for    which    they    sought        medical\n\nattention.\n\n            Dávila addresses only the first guidepost, but the other\n\ntwo guideposts also favor plaintiffs. In addition to back pay, the\n\njury awarded Rodríguez compensatory damages of $180,000 and Escobar\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fcompensatory      damages   of   $105,000.      Thus,    for   Rodríguez,      the\n\npunitive damages were less than the compensatory damages, and for\n\nEscobar, the punitive damages were less than twice the compensatory\n\ndamages.     The ratio of punitive to compensatory damages and the\n\nmagnitude of the punitive damages are far from extraordinary.                  See\n\nRivera-Torres, 341 F.3d at 102 (finding punitive damages \"well\n\nwithin acceptable bounds\" in a political employment discrimination\n\nsuit where the jury awarded $185,000 in compensatory damages to the\n\nplaintiff, $135,000 in compensatory damages to plaintiff's family,\n\nand $250,000 in punitive damages); see also Tapalian v. Tusino, 377\n\nF.3d   1,   8-9   (1st   Cir.    2004)    (upholding    an   award   $58,843    in\n\ncompensatory damages and $150,000 in punitive damages); Davis v.\n\nRennie, 264 F.3d 86, 117 (1st Cir. 2001) (awarding punitive damages\n\nof about one million dollars, ten times the amount of compensatory\n\ndamages); Romano, 233 F.3d at 673 (awarding punitive damages\n\nnineteen times greater than compensatory damages).\n\n                                 V.   Conclusion\n\n            At the conclusion of the trial, the district court stated\n\n\"it is incredible that anybody would believe that there was not the\n\nslightest political motivation in what happened in this case.                  It\n\nis just unbelievable.       It is an insult to the intelligence of the\n\nhuman being to think otherwise.\"            We agree.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\f",

It has cost Puerto Rican taxpayers dearly in verdicts paid from public funds. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5142. In an effort to combat political discrimination, Puerto Rico has an Electoral Moratorium that prohibits certain \"appointments, promotions, demotions, transfers and changes in the category of the employees\" for the two months before and after a general election. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1337. In the year 2000, general elections were held on November 8, 2000, so the Moratorium commenced on September 8, 2000 and ended on January 8, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the 2000 election, the Governor of Puerto Rico was a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"). Immediately prior to the commencement of the Electoral Moratorium, at least thirty-four personnel changes took place in the Administration of Corrections (\"AOC\"). These personnel changes were authorized by the Administrator of the AOC, Zo&#233; Laboy (\"Laboy\"), who had been appointed by the NPP Governor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 2000 election, a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") was elected Governor. The new Governor appointed defendant V&#237;ctor Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez (\"Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez\") as Administrator of the AOC, who in turn appointed defendant Ana D&#225;vila-Lao (\"D&#225;vila\") as his Chief Legal Advisor. The human resources director under the former administration, who later became Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez's assistant, told Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez that some appointments made by the previous administration may have been unlawful. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez asked D&#225;vila to investigate the matter. D&#225;vila then proceeded to conduct a review of the thirty-four personnel changes that took place immediately before the Electoral Moratorium. This list of thirty-four included every member of Laboy's staff, except for one who was a PDP member.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> It was determined that eighteen of these thirty-four personnel changes were illegal, and these personnel changes were revoked. Two of the eighteen people affected were plaintiffs Mirla M. Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n (\"Rodr&#237;guez\") and Ana I. Escobar-Pab&#243;n (\"Escobar\"). D&#225;vila asserts that this review was objective and denied knowing either Rodr&#237;guez's or Escobar's political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mirla M. Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez began working for the AOC in 1994 in the position of Social-Penal Technician I, a career position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Over the years, she was promoted to a number of trust positions: Special Assistant II, Director of Legal Affairs, and Executive Aide of Correctional Services. In the summer of 2000, the AOC implemented a Classification and Compensation Plan (\"the Plan\"), whereby employees were evaluated and reclassified into appropriate positions. Under the Plan, Rodr&#237;guez was classified as Director of the Legal Division, a trust position. Rodr&#237;guez met with Laboy and requested to be classified into the career position of attorney. On September 7, 2000, one day before the commencement of the Electoral Moratorium, Rodr&#237;guez received four letters notifying her of changes in her employment status. The first letter reinstated her to the career position of Social-Penal Technician I; the second promoted her to the career position of Attorney I, with a one-year probationary period; the third raised her salary to the maximum allowable for that position; and the fourth ordered her to continue serving in her current trust position, indicating that her probation term for the Attorney I position would begin at the conclusion of the trust position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez was appointed Administrator in January 2001, he became Rodr&#237;guez's direct supervisor. She testified that during this time, Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez made several comments to her to the effect that he was under political pressure for leaving too many NPP members in cushy positions at the AOC. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez denied making such statements. In March 2001, Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez removed Rodr&#237;guez from her trust position and reinstated her to her career position of Attorney I. Rodr&#237;guez does not contest the removal from her trust position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez alleges that she was mistreated because of her political affiliation. At one point, she went to her office and discovered that her desk had been taken away, with her computer and other belongings strewn across the floor. After she complained, an old, surplus desk was placed in the office. The person in charge of maintenance refused to clean her office because she was a member of the NPP. Because of this mistreatment, Rodr&#237;guez asked to be transferred to Ponce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ponce, Rodr&#237;guez was litigating cases for the AOC and D&#225;vila was her supervisor. In June 2001, four agents came to her desk to deliver a letter annulling her promotion to Attorney I and reinstating her as a Social-Penal Technician I. She found it humiliating that four agents would be sent, implying that she was a dangerous person. She was not given a hearing or any warning before being demoted. She received another letter assigning her to the Ponce maximum security facility, where dangerous criminals were held and against whom she had litigated cases. Because of this, she feared working there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez went to see Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez, and he referred her to D&#225;vila because she was the chairperson of the committee reviewing the promotions and she had issued the recommendation that the promotion was unlawful. D&#225;vila told her that she was not entitled to a hearing because the appointment was illegal. Rodr&#237;guez testified that D&#225;vila told her that she could not be left in such a cushy position with such a high salary, but D&#225;vila denied saying this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The demotion letter stated that \"there [was] no evidence on file of compliance with the due process of law in the recruitment and selection for [her] appointment.\" When Rodr&#237;guez went to examine her personnel file, she discovered that it was being held by D&#225;vila, even though access to a personnel file requires the employee's authorization, and Rodr&#237;guez had not given authorization. Rodr&#237;guez discovered that papers documenting her promotion were missing from her file. This was corroborated by Marie Rivera, an employee in the human resources office, who testified that documents were missing from Rodr&#237;guez's file. Rodr&#237;guez had the original versions of these missing papers, and she showed them to Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez. Rodr&#237;guez threatened legal action over the missing documents, and the missing documents mysteriously reappeared in her file. D&#225;vila insisted that even though the missing documents had been replaced, Rodr&#237;guez's appointment was still illegal. The director of recruitment, H&#233;ctor Rivera-Rivera, testified that he certified that Rodr&#237;guez's appointment to Attorney I had been lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2002, one year after she had been demoted, Rodr&#237;guez filed this suit. In September 2002, after learning from H&#233;ctor Rivera-Rivera that the appointment had been lawful, Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez ordered that Rodr&#237;guez be reinstated. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez testified that she was a competent employee. She received a letter informing her of the reinstatement, which stated that her salary would be determined later. For the first two months after being reinstated, she was not paid and was not given an office. She then went to Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez, and he assigned attorney Gloria Ortiz-Mart&#237;nez to evaluate the situation. Ortiz testified that she was unable to work on the case because she needed Rodr&#237;guez's personnel file and D&#225;vila did not give it to her despite being asked to do so. Rodr&#237;guez testified that, after again going to Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez, he advised her to wait until D&#225;vila's forthcoming transfer to another government agency. He denied making this statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez also testified as to D&#225;vila's personal involvement in revoking her promotion. She testified that Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez and Raymond Mira, the director of human resources, stated in depositions that D&#225;vila was a member of the transition committee of the PDP for the corrections administration and was also a political liaison between the governor's office and the corrections administration. She also testified that personnel directors stated in their depositions that D&#225;vila initiated the review of the thirty-four personnel changes, and that Jos&#233; Ortiz, who was director of human resources at the time, stated that her appointment was legal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of her demotion, Rodr&#237;guez suffered emotionally and financially. She suffered depression from the stigma of the demotion, which caused her to have nightmares and fight with her family. She underwent emotional therapy for one year. With her greatly diminished salary, she was unable to pay her bills and her credit was damaged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ana I. Escobar-Pab&#243;n</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Escobar began working for the AOC in 1986 in the career position of Social-Penal Technician I, and she was later promoted to Social-Penal Technician IV. Beginning in 1994, she was appointed to a number of trust positions. In June 2000, the AOC created a new career position of Regional Head of Programs and Services (\"Regional Head\"). After this position was announced, the AOC decided to revise the job requirements because of complaints that the requirements were not appropriate. Laboy approved the revised job requirements on September 7, 2000 and made them effective as of June 1, 2000. Laboy appointed Escobar Regional Head on September 6, 2000, which was one day before the approval of the revised requirements and two days before the commencement of the Electoral Moratorium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Escobar testified that after the election on November 7, 2000, her co-workers started harassing her because of her political affiliation, stating that they would \"ravage\" NPP members. She testified that her supervisor, Ram&#243;n D&#237;az-Ferrera, was an active member of the PDP and would criticize her when she used the term \"government of Puerto Rico\" and insisted that she say \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\" a term preferred by the PDP. He denied making such statements on a regular basis but did admit to once correcting an employee who used the term \"state government\" and instructed him to use the term \"central government\" when referring to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Another officer of the agency, Jos&#233; Cordero-Padr&#243;, told her that they were going to \"drag away\" NPP members and put an end to corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2001, four employees came to her desk to deliver a letter informing her that her appointment as Regional Head had been declared null. She was reinstated to her previous vested career position of Social-Penal Technician IV. She had no notice that her appointment was being evaluated. Her letter also stated \"there [was] no evidence on file of compliance with the due process of law in the recruitment and selection for [her] appointment.\" She met with D&#225;vila, who told her that necessary documentation was not present in her file. She had copies of these missing documents and gave them to D&#225;vila. D&#225;vila later told her that even with all of the documentation she had not complied with all the requirements for the position. H&#233;ctor Rivera-Rivera, the director of recruitment, testified that he certified that Escobar satisfied the originally posted requirements for the position of Regional Head and also that she was qualified under the amended job requirements dated September 7, 2000. Raymond Mira, the director of human resources, testified that Escobar's appointment was void because the job description was amended after her appointment and that this violated the principle of merit. Neither Rivera-Rivera nor Mira gave further explanation as to the legality or illegality of Escobar's appointment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of her demotion, Escobar testified that she had to seek psychological help, was unable to sleep, and because she could not afford to pay her bills, her credit was harmed. While this lawsuit was pending, she was promoted to Correctional Facilities Superintendent II, but was then again demoted to her current position of Social Penal Technician IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar filed suit against Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez and D&#225;vila, claiming political discrimination and a violation of procedural due process rights. After a five-day trial, the jury found in favor of Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar on both their political discrimination and procedural due process claims. The jury awarded Rodr&#237;guez back pay of $3,500 per month, $180,000 in compensatory damages, and $120,000 in punitive damages against D&#225;vila. The jury awarded Escobar back pay of $3,306 per month, $105,000 in compensatory damages, and $195,000 in punitive damages against D&#225;vila.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants made the full panoply of motions, moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), judgment as a matter of law under Rules 50(a) and 50(b), a new trial under Rule 59(a), and an altered judgment under Rule 59(e). The district court denied all of their motions. Defendants now appeal the denial of all of their motions on various grounds: (1) the denial of their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the jury's finding that defendants violated plaintiffs' procedural due process rights; (2) the denial of their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the jury's finding that defendants politically discriminated against plaintiffs; (3) the denial of their Rule 12(b)(6), 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions asserting the qualified immunity defense; and (4) the denial of their Rule 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the compensatory and punitive damages awards as excessive. Because we affirm the jury's verdict that defendants politically discriminated against plaintiffs, we decline to consider the alternative ground that defendants violated plaintiffs' due process rights. We address defendants' arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Political Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found that defendants discriminated against both plaintiffs on the basis of their political affiliation. On appeal, defendants challenge the jury's verdict on three grounds: (1) there was insufficient evidence of discriminatory animus;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (2) the district court erred in instructing the jury on the defense articulated in <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); and (3) there was sufficient evidence for a jury to grant the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Insufficient Evidence of Discriminatory Animus</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment protects the right of public career employees &#8212; those not in trust or policy-making positions &#8212; to engage in political activities without fear of adverse employment actions. <i>Padilla-Garc&#237;a v. Jos&#233; Guillermo Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 212 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir.2000). It is undisputed that Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar were public career employees at the time they suffered adverse employment actions. The plaintiffs here \"bear[] the burden of producing sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that [their] constitutionally protected conduct &#8212; in this case, political affiliation with the NPP &#8212; was a `substantial' or `motivating' factor behind [their demotions].\" <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> 385 F.3d at 30 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert on appeal that the district court improperly denied their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the jury's finding of political discrimination. In their brief, defendants developed only the argument that the evidence was insufficient for a jury to find discriminatory animus. We thus address only defendants' Rule 50 argument and consider the other arguments waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Acevedo-Garc&#237;a v. Monroig,</i> 351 F.3d 547, 561 (1st Cir.2003) (\"We have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We review the denial of a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law <i>de novo. Zachar v. Lee,</i> 363 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir.2004). We will affirm \"unless the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion, namely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\" <i>Sheils Title Co. v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co.,</i> 184 F.3d 10, 19 (1st Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have no trouble finding that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that plaintiffs' political affiliations were a substantial or motivating factor behind their demotions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, plaintiffs presented ample evidence that their demotions were improper and the result of discrimination. Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar were long-standing employees of the AOC &#8212; Rodr&#237;guez since 1994 and Escobar since 1986 &#8212; and both were considered competent employees. It is suspicious that both of them were demoted without being given any notice or opportunity to defend their promotions, especially since the initial explanation offered for the demotions was simply missing documentation. One would expect that Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar would first be consulted to determine if the necessary documentation had been misplaced. Further, these missing documents mysteriously reappeared after Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar presented their copies of the missing documents, and Rodr&#237;guez threatened an investigation over the missing documents. Even after the missing documents were replaced, Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar were not reinstated; rather, other justifications were given for their demotions. Finally, Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar's demotions appeared to be punitive. Rodr&#237;guez &#8212; despite her competency, experience, law degree, and notary certification &#8212; was reinstated into the low position of Social-Penal Technician I and placed in a dangerous environment at the maximum security prison in Ponce. Similarly, Escobar &#8212; despite her 14 years of experience with the AOC and having nearly finished her probationary period as Regional Head &#8212; was demoted to Social-Penal Technician IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that D&#225;vila made the decision to demote them. D&#225;vila wrote a letter to the human resources department, asking that the personnel files of thirty-four employees, including Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar, be evaluated. After Rodr&#237;guez was demoted, she went to see Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez, and he referred her to D&#225;vila. D&#225;vila told her that her promotion was unlawful and that she was not entitled to a hearing. When Rodr&#237;guez sought to examine her personnel file, she discovered that D&#225;vila was in possession of it. When another attorney, Gloria Ortiz, was assigned to evaluate Rodr&#237;guez's case, D&#225;vila did not give Ortiz the file despite being asked to do so. Escobar also consulted Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez after being demoted, and he advised her to speak with D&#225;vila. D&#225;vila told her that documents were missing from her file, and Escobar supplied D&#225;vila with the missing documents. At a later meeting, D&#225;vila told her that even with all the documentation, her demotion would stand because she had not met all the requirements for the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that the discrimination was based on political affiliation. The review was instigated by D&#225;vila (acting on behalf of the incoming PDP administration) and every employee of Zo&#233; Laboy (a member of the outgoing NPP administration) had his or her file reviewed except for one, who happened to be a member of the PDP. Such a review is not necessarily improper, as the PDP administration may certainly investigate potential illegal appointments by the NPP administration. However, it suggests that D&#225;vila knew that both Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar were NPP supporters. Rodr&#237;guez testified that both Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez and D&#225;vila made statements to her indicating that her demotion was politically motivated. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez and D&#225;vila denied making such statements, but it is for the jury to resolve such issues of credibility. Finally, both Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar testified that co-workers harassed them because of their political affiliation. This harassment provides further evidence that Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar's political affiliation was known among the employees of the AOC and indirect evidence that D&#225;vila would also have been aware of their political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Mt. Healthy</i> Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under certain circumstances, defendants may still prevail even if plaintiffs show that their political affiliations were a substantial or motivating factor behind their demotions. <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. The <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense is an affirmative defense available to defendants, whereby defendants must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiffs would have been dismissed regardless of their political affiliation. <i>Id.; V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> 385 F.3d at 30. Thus, even if political affiliation was an improper consideration, defendants will prevail if they can show that plaintiffs' political affiliation was not the \"but-for\" cause of their demotions. <i>Tejada-Batista v. Morales,</i> 424 F.3d 97, 102 (1st Cir.2005); <i>S&#225;nchez-L&#243;pez v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 130 (1st Cir.2004). The purpose of the defense is to prevent a plaintiff from being put \"in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than [she] would have occupied had [she] done nothing.\" <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 285, 97 S.Ct. 568.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert on appeal that the district court improperly denied their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions regarding their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. In their brief, they develop only two arguments: first, that they presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find a successful <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense, and second, that the district court improperly refused to include a jury instruction describing the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address defendants' argument of sufficient evidence for the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. In their brief, defendants state the \"evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Defendants prevailed in their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense.\" They further note that they \"presented evidence proving that they would have made the same employment determinations based on the legitimate nondiscriminatory justification of complying with Puerto Rico personnel law.\" In support of this argument, defendants cite only one case, <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> for their proposition that \"the demotion of a public employee resulting from the failure of her appointment to comply with personnel laws and regulations, constituted sufficient evidence to satisfy <i>Mt. Healthy.</i>\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' argument, however, does not address the required legal standard. In order for defendants to prevail on this Rule 50 or sufficiency of the evidence claim, they need to show that no reasonable jury could have denied their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. <i>See Sheils Title Co.,</i> 184 F.3d at 19. A showing that defendants presented sufficient evidence for a jury to grant their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense clearly does not meet this burden. The case they rely on, <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> does not support the proposition they cite it for and did not even reach the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. In <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> we found that no reasonable jury could have found \"that plaintiff's political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in [the] adverse employment action.\" 385 F.3d at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if defendants had argued that no reasonable jury could deny their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense under the appropriate legal standard, they would be incorrect. At trial, plaintiffs and defendants presented conflicting evidence as to the legality of plaintiffs' appointments. Notably, H&#233;ctor Rivera-Rivera, the director of recruitment, testified that he certified that plaintiffs' appointments were legal. A reasonable jury could certainly find that political affiliation, not the legality of the appointments, was the \"but-for\" cause of the demotions. Therefore, defendants' <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next address defendants' contention that the district court improperly refused to include a jury instruction describing the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. Defendants submitted proposed jury instructions for the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. Defendants contend that they properly preserved this issue for appeal. The portion of the transcript cited by defendants follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. RODRIGUEZ: Okay. And regarding the good faith defense and the personal &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: What do you mean by \"good faith\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. RODRIGUEZ: It is the defendants' reasonable belief that they were acting by authority of a valid statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: I gave the instruction that says, \"If there were other reasons, whether good or bad, proper or improper, likeable or unlikeable, that motivated their actions, that were not political discrimination, there is no case.\" I said that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: That's it. Very well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To preserve an objection to a jury instruction for appeal, a party must \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1). Defendants' statement above does not constitute an objection to the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> instruction. Indeed, in another portion of defendants' brief, they argue that this exact same language constitutes an objection to the district court's jury instructions on qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because defendants did not object to the district court's jury instructions regarding the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense, we review for plain error. <i>Drohan v. Vaughn,</i> 176 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1999). \"Thus, we reverse only if there is a `plain' or `obvious' error that `affect[s] substantial rights' and which has resulted in a `miscarriage of justice or has undermined the integrity of the judicial process.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Wilson v. Maritime Overseas Corp.,</i> 150 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no plain error. The district court gave a jury instruction regarding the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense: \"It is sufficient if the plaintiffs prove that their protected political activities were the <i>determinative factor</i> in the consideration that was made, and that it <i>made a difference</i> in the defendants' decision.\" This instruction contains the substance of the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. In order to prevail on the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense, defendants must show that plaintiffs would have been demoted regardless of their political affiliation. Thus, if plaintiffs' political affiliation was a \"determinative factor\" or \"made a difference,\" defendants cannot claim that plaintiffs would have been demoted regardless of their political affiliation. Although the district court could have been clearer in instructing the jury on the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense and should have included the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense on the verdict form,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the trial was certainly not a \"miscarriage of justice\" and did not \"undermine[] the integrity of the judicial process.\" <i>Wilson,</i> 150 F.3d at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Qualified immunity specially protects public officials from the specter of damages liability for judgment calls made in a legally uncertain environment.\" <i>Ryder v. United States,</i> 515 U.S. 177, 185, 115 S.Ct. 2031, 132 L.Ed.2d 136 (1995). An official is entitled to qualified immunity unless (1) \"the plaintiffs' allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation,\" (2) \"the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation,\" and (3) \"a reasonable [official], similarly situated, would understand that the challenged conduct violated that established right.\" <i>Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002). The first two prongs of this test are questions of law for the court to decide. <i>Id.</i> The third prong is also a question of law, but factual questions, to the extent they are antecedent to this determination, must be determined by a jury. <i>Id.</i> While preliminary factual questions regarding qualified immunity are sent to the jury, the legal question of the availability of qualified immunity is \"ultimately committed to the court's judgment.\" <i>Acevedo-Garc&#237;a,</i> 351 F.3d at 563.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants first contend that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on qualified immunity. Defendants, however, are not entitled to a jury instruction regarding qualified immunity, since it is a legal question for the court to decide. <i>See id.</i> Defendants are entitled to have a jury determine any preliminary factual questions, but defendants have not stated, either at trial or on appeal, precisely what factual questions would need to be resolved before the court could determine the legal issue of the official's reasonableness. In finding that defendants politically discriminated against plaintiffs, the jury found that defendants intentionally violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Thus, it appears that any factual finding the jury could make would not benefit defendants. We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the court erred in failing to grant them qualified immunity. We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's denial of a qualified immunity defense. <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90. Defendants remarkably contest all three prongs of the qualified immunity analysis. We need not long consider the first two prongs. Plaintiffs' allegations, if true, clearly established a violation of their First Amendment rights, and such right was well established at the time of the violation. <i>See Acevedo-Garc&#237;a,</i> 351 F.3d at 564. In light of the jury's verdict and our affirmance of it, the third prong is also unavailing. As just mentioned, the jury found that defendants intentionally violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Any reasonable official would clearly understand that it is improper to intentionally violate an employee's First Amendment rights. <i>See id.</i> at 564-65. Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Excessive Damages</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Compensatory Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the compensatory damages award lacked evidentiary support and also that it was excessive. In making these claims, they do not cite any First Circuit precedent. They do cite a Fourth Circuit case, <i>Price v. City of Charlotte,</i> 93 F.3d 1241 (4th Cir.1996), which they miscite as a First Circuit case, and an unpublished decision from the District of Puerto Rico, <i>Laracuente-Pab&#243;n v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> No. 95-1528, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 22430 (D.P.R. Mar. 30, 1998). They also cite three Supreme Court cases for the proposition that actual injury is required for an award of compensatory damages. Further, in making this argument, defendants were obliged to present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict but failed to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline Servs., Inc.,</i> 17 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir.1994). Given the defendants' failure to specify the applicable law and their failure to present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, this argument is not sufficiently developed and thus waived. <i>See Col&#243;n v. R.K. Grace &amp; Co.,</i> 358 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2003). Even assuming that this argument was sufficiently developed, the jury's award of compensatory damages was amply supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Punitive Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded punitive damages of $120,000 to Rodr&#237;guez and $195,000 to Escobar. The punitive damages were assessed against D&#225;vila. D&#225;vila argues that the punitive damages award was excessive. We review this claim <i>de novo. Romano v. U-Haul Int'l,</i> 233 F.3d 655, 672 (1st Cir.2000). The purpose of punitive damages is to punish and deter reprehensible conduct. <i>Id.</i> A punitive damages award will stand unless we find it \"certain that the amount in question exceeds that necessary to punish and deter the alleged misconduct.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has presented three guideposts to consider in determining the excessiveness of a punitive damages award: \"(1) the degree of reprehensibility of a defendant's conduct; (2) the ratio between punitive and actual and potential damages; and (3) a comparison of the punitive damages figure and other civil and criminal penalties imposed for comparable conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 672-73 (citing <i>BMW of N. Am. v. Gore,</i> 517 U.S. 559, 574-75, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first guidepost is \"perhaps the most important\" in this determination. <i>BMW of N. Am.,</i> 517 U.S. at 575, 116 S.Ct. 1589. Punitive damages are justified \"`when the defendant's conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.'\" <i>Kolstad v. ADA,</i> 527 U.S. 526, 536, 119 S.Ct. 2118, 144 L.Ed.2d 494 (1999) (quoting <i>Smith v. Wade,</i> 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983)). We have previously affirmed the award punitive damages to state employees suffering adverse employments actions in violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. <i>Acevedo-Garc&#237;a,</i> 351 F.3d at 571; <i>Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz V&#233;lez,</i> 341 F.3d 86, 102 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' only argument against punitive damages is that they did not violate plaintiffs' First or Fourteenth Amendment rights. Since the jury found otherwise and we construe all evidence in favor of the jury's verdict, this argument is to no avail. The jury found that D&#225;vila intentionally demoted plaintiffs because of their political affiliation. D&#225;vila's act also jeopardized plaintiffs' livelihood. As a result of their demotions, Rodr&#237;guez's salary was reduced by 60 percent and Escobar's salary was reduced by 43 percent. Both plaintiffs suffered harms to their professional careers, were unable to meet their financial obligations because of their reduced salaries, and suffered emotional distress for which they sought medical attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#225;vila addresses only the first guidepost, but the other two guideposts also favor plaintiffs. In addition to back pay, the jury awarded Rodr&#237;guez compensatory damages of $180,000 and Escobar compensatory damages of $105,000. Thus, for Rodr&#237;guez, the punitive damages were less than the compensatory damages, and for Escobar, the punitive damages were less than twice the compensatory damages. The ratio of punitive to compensatory damages and the magnitude of the punitive damages are far from extraordinary. <i>See Rivera-Torres,</i> 341 F.3d at 102 (finding punitive damages \"well within acceptable bounds\" in a political employment discrimination suit where the jury awarded $185,000 in compensatory damages to the plaintiff, $135,000 in compensatory damages to plaintiff's family, and $250,000 in punitive damages); <i>see also Tapalian v. Tusino,</i> 377 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.2004) (upholding an award $58,843 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in punitive damages); <i>Davis v. Rennie,</i> 264 F.3d 86, 117 (1st Cir.2001) (awarding punitive damages of about one million dollars, ten times the amount of compensatory damages); <i>Romano,</i> 233 F.3d at 673 (awarding punitive damages nineteen times greater than compensatory damages).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.

Defendants argue, without any evidentiary support, that Escobar's emotional condition was not the result defendants' actions but caused by her poor credit history and divorce</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In an effort to combat political discrimination, Puerto Rico has an Electoral Moratorium that prohibits certain \"appointments, promotions, demotions, transfers and changes in the category of the employees\" for the two months before and after a general election. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1337. In the year 2000, general elections were held on November 8, 2000, so the Moratorium commenced on September 8, 2000 and ended on January 8, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the 2000 election, the Governor of Puerto Rico was a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"). Immediately prior to the commencement of the Electoral Moratorium, at least thirty-four personnel changes took place in the Administration of Corrections (\"AOC\"). These personnel changes were authorized by the Administrator of the AOC, Zo&#233; Laboy (\"Laboy\"), who had been appointed by the NPP Governor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 2000 election, a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") was elected Governor. The new Governor appointed defendant V&#237;ctor Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez (\"Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez\") as Administrator of the AOC, who in turn appointed defendant Ana D&#225;vila-Lao (\"D&#225;vila\") as his Chief Legal Advisor. The human resources director under the former administration, who later became Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez's assistant, told Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez that some appointments made by the previous administration may have been unlawful. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez asked D&#225;vila to investigate the matter. D&#225;vila then proceeded to conduct a review of the thirty-four personnel changes that took place immediately before the Electoral Moratorium. This list of thirty-four included every member of Laboy's staff, except for one who was a PDP member.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> It was determined that eighteen of these thirty-four personnel changes were illegal, and these personnel changes were revoked. Two of the eighteen people affected were plaintiffs Mirla M. Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n (\"Rodr&#237;guez\") and Ana I. Escobar-Pab&#243;n (\"Escobar\"). D&#225;vila asserts that this review was objective and denied knowing either Rodr&#237;guez's or Escobar's political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mirla M. Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez began working for the AOC in 1994 in the position of Social-Penal Technician I, a career position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Over the years, she was promoted to a number of trust positions: Special Assistant II, Director of Legal Affairs, and Executive Aide of Correctional Services. In the summer of 2000, the AOC implemented a Classification and Compensation Plan (\"the Plan\"), whereby employees were evaluated and reclassified into appropriate positions. Under the Plan, Rodr&#237;guez was classified as Director of the Legal Division, a trust position. Rodr&#237;guez met with Laboy and requested to be classified into the career position of attorney. On September 7, 2000, one day before the commencement of the Electoral Moratorium, Rodr&#237;guez received four letters notifying her of changes in her employment status. The first letter reinstated her to the career position of Social-Penal Technician I; the second promoted her to the career position of Attorney I, with a one-year probationary period; the third raised her salary to the maximum allowable for that position; and the fourth ordered her to continue serving in her current trust position, indicating that her probation term for the Attorney I position would begin at the conclusion of the trust position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez was appointed Administrator in January 2001, he became Rodr&#237;guez's direct supervisor. She testified that during this time, Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez made several comments to her to the effect that he was under political pressure for leaving too many NPP members in cushy positions at the AOC. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez denied making such statements. In March 2001, Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez removed Rodr&#237;guez from her trust position and reinstated her to her career position of Attorney I. Rodr&#237;guez does not contest the removal from her trust position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez alleges that she was mistreated because of her political affiliation. At one point, she went to her office and discovered that her desk had been taken away, with her computer and other belongings strewn across the floor. After she complained, an old, surplus desk was placed in the office. The person in charge of maintenance refused to clean her office because she was a member of the NPP. Because of this mistreatment, Rodr&#237;guez asked to be transferred to Ponce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ponce, Rodr&#237;guez was litigating cases for the AOC and D&#225;vila was her supervisor. In June 2001, four agents came to her desk to deliver a letter annulling her promotion to Attorney I and reinstating her as a Social-Penal Technician I. She found it humiliating that four agents would be sent, implying that she was a dangerous person. She was not given a hearing or any warning before being demoted. She received another letter assigning her to the Ponce maximum security facility, where dangerous criminals were held and against whom she had litigated cases. Because of this, she feared working there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez went to see Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez, and he referred her to D&#225;vila because she was the chairperson of the committee reviewing the promotions and she had issued the recommendation that the promotion was unlawful. D&#225;vila told her that she was not entitled to a hearing because the appointment was illegal. Rodr&#237;guez testified that D&#225;vila told her that she could not be left in such a cushy position with such a high salary, but D&#225;vila denied saying this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The demotion letter stated that \"there [was] no evidence on file of compliance with the due process of law in the recruitment and selection for [her] appointment.\" When Rodr&#237;guez went to examine her personnel file, she discovered that it was being held by D&#225;vila, even though access to a personnel file requires the employee's authorization, and Rodr&#237;guez had not given authorization. Rodr&#237;guez discovered that papers documenting her promotion were missing from her file. This was corroborated by Marie Rivera, an employee in the human resources office, who testified that documents were missing from Rodr&#237;guez's file. Rodr&#237;guez had the original versions of these missing papers, and she showed them to Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez. Rodr&#237;guez threatened legal action over the missing documents, and the missing documents mysteriously reappeared in her file. D&#225;vila insisted that even though the missing documents had been replaced, Rodr&#237;guez's appointment was still illegal. The director of recruitment, H&#233;ctor Rivera-Rivera, testified that he certified that Rodr&#237;guez's appointment to Attorney I had been lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2002, one year after she had been demoted, Rodr&#237;guez filed this suit. In September 2002, after learning from H&#233;ctor Rivera-Rivera that the appointment had been lawful, Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez ordered that Rodr&#237;guez be reinstated. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez testified that she was a competent employee. She received a letter informing her of the reinstatement, which stated that her salary would be determined later. For the first two months after being reinstated, she was not paid and was not given an office. She then went to Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez, and he assigned attorney Gloria Ortiz-Mart&#237;nez to evaluate the situation. Ortiz testified that she was unable to work on the case because she needed Rodr&#237;guez's personnel file and D&#225;vila did not give it to her despite being asked to do so. Rodr&#237;guez testified that, after again going to Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez, he advised her to wait until D&#225;vila's forthcoming transfer to another government agency. He denied making this statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez also testified as to D&#225;vila's personal involvement in revoking her promotion. She testified that Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez and Raymond Mira, the director of human resources, stated in depositions that D&#225;vila was a member of the transition committee of the PDP for the corrections administration and was also a political liaison between the governor's office and the corrections administration. She also testified that personnel directors stated in their depositions that D&#225;vila initiated the review of the thirty-four personnel changes, and that Jos&#233; Ortiz, who was director of human resources at the time, stated that her appointment was legal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of her demotion, Rodr&#237;guez suffered emotionally and financially. She suffered depression from the stigma of the demotion, which caused her to have nightmares and fight with her family. She underwent emotional therapy for one year. With her greatly diminished salary, she was unable to pay her bills and her credit was damaged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ana I. Escobar-Pab&#243;n</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Escobar began working for the AOC in 1986 in the career position of Social-Penal Technician I, and she was later promoted to Social-Penal Technician IV. Beginning in 1994, she was appointed to a number of trust positions. In June 2000, the AOC created a new career position of Regional Head of Programs and Services (\"Regional Head\"). After this position was announced, the AOC decided to revise the job requirements because of complaints that the requirements were not appropriate. Laboy approved the revised job requirements on September 7, 2000 and made them effective as of June 1, 2000. Laboy appointed Escobar Regional Head on September 6, 2000, which was one day before the approval of the revised requirements and two days before the commencement of the Electoral Moratorium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Escobar testified that after the election on November 7, 2000, her co-workers started harassing her because of her political affiliation, stating that they would \"ravage\" NPP members. She testified that her supervisor, Ram&#243;n D&#237;az-Ferrera, was an active member of the PDP and would criticize her when she used the term \"government of Puerto Rico\" and insisted that she say \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\" a term preferred by the PDP. He denied making such statements on a regular basis but did admit to once correcting an employee who used the term \"state government\" and instructed him to use the term \"central government\" when referring to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Another officer of the agency, Jos&#233; Cordero-Padr&#243;, told her that they were going to \"drag away\" NPP members and put an end to corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2001, four employees came to her desk to deliver a letter informing her that her appointment as Regional Head had been declared null. She was reinstated to her previous vested career position of Social-Penal Technician IV. She had no notice that her appointment was being evaluated. Her letter also stated \"there [was] no evidence on file of compliance with the due process of law in the recruitment and selection for [her] appointment.\" She met with D&#225;vila, who told her that necessary documentation was not present in her file. She had copies of these missing documents and gave them to D&#225;vila. D&#225;vila later told her that even with all of the documentation she had not complied with all the requirements for the position. H&#233;ctor Rivera-Rivera, the director of recruitment, testified that he certified that Escobar satisfied the originally posted requirements for the position of Regional Head and also that she was qualified under the amended job requirements dated September 7, 2000. Raymond Mira, the director of human resources, testified that Escobar's appointment was void because the job description was amended after her appointment and that this violated the principle of merit. Neither Rivera-Rivera nor Mira gave further explanation as to the legality or illegality of Escobar's appointment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of her demotion, Escobar testified that she had to seek psychological help, was unable to sleep, and because she could not afford to pay her bills, her credit was harmed. While this lawsuit was pending, she was promoted to Correctional Facilities Superintendent II, but was then again demoted to her current position of Social Penal Technician IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar filed suit against Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez and D&#225;vila, claiming political discrimination and a violation of procedural due process rights. After a five-day trial, the jury found in favor of Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar on both their political discrimination and procedural due process claims. The jury awarded Rodr&#237;guez back pay of $3,500 per month, $180,000 in compensatory damages, and $120,000 in punitive damages against D&#225;vila. The jury awarded Escobar back pay of $3,306 per month, $105,000 in compensatory damages, and $195,000 in punitive damages against D&#225;vila.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants made the full panoply of motions, moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), judgment as a matter of law under Rules 50(a) and 50(b), a new trial under Rule 59(a), and an altered judgment under Rule 59(e). The district court denied all of their motions. Defendants now appeal the denial of all of their motions on various grounds: (1) the denial of their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the jury's finding that defendants violated plaintiffs' procedural due process rights; (2) the denial of their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the jury's finding that defendants politically discriminated against plaintiffs; (3) the denial of their Rule 12(b)(6), 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions asserting the qualified immunity defense; and (4) the denial of their Rule 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the compensatory and punitive damages awards as excessive. Because we affirm the jury's verdict that defendants politically discriminated against plaintiffs, we decline to consider the alternative ground that defendants violated plaintiffs' due process rights. We address defendants' arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Political Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found that defendants discriminated against both plaintiffs on the basis of their political affiliation. On appeal, defendants challenge the jury's verdict on three grounds: (1) there was insufficient evidence of discriminatory animus;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (2) the district court erred in instructing the jury on the defense articulated in <i>Mt.

It is undisputed that Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar were public career employees at the time they suffered adverse employment actions. The plaintiffs here \"bear[] the burden of producing sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that [their] constitutionally protected conduct &#8212; in this case, political affiliation with the NPP &#8212; was a `substantial' or `motivating' factor behind [their demotions].\" <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> 385 F.3d at 30 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert on appeal that the district court improperly denied their Rule 50(a), 50(b), 59(a), and 59(e) motions contesting the jury's finding of political discrimination. In their brief, defendants developed only the argument that the evidence was insufficient for a jury to find discriminatory animus.

We have no trouble finding that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that plaintiffs' political affiliations were a substantial or motivating factor behind their demotions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, plaintiffs presented ample evidence that their demotions were improper and the result of discrimination. Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar were long-standing employees of the AOC &#8212; Rodr&#237;guez since 1994 and Escobar since 1986 &#8212; and both were considered competent employees. It is suspicious that both of them were demoted without being given any notice or opportunity to defend their promotions, especially since the initial explanation offered for the demotions was simply missing documentation. One would expect that Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar would first be consulted to determine if the necessary documentation had been misplaced. Further, these missing documents mysteriously reappeared after Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar presented their copies of the missing documents, and Rodr&#237;guez threatened an investigation over the missing documents. Even after the missing documents were replaced, Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar were not reinstated; rather, other justifications were given for their demotions. Finally, Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar's demotions appeared to be punitive. Rodr&#237;guez &#8212; despite her competency, experience, law degree, and notary certification &#8212; was reinstated into the low position of Social-Penal Technician I and placed in a dangerous environment at the maximum security prison in Ponce. Similarly, Escobar &#8212; despite her 14 years of experience with the AOC and having nearly finished her probationary period as Regional Head &#8212; was demoted to Social-Penal Technician IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that D&#225;vila made the decision to demote them. D&#225;vila wrote a letter to the human resources department, asking that the personnel files of thirty-four employees, including Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar, be evaluated. After Rodr&#237;guez was demoted, she went to see Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez, and he referred her to D&#225;vila. D&#225;vila told her that her promotion was unlawful and that she was not entitled to a hearing. When Rodr&#237;guez sought to examine her personnel file, she discovered that D&#225;vila was in possession of it. When another attorney, Gloria Ortiz, was assigned to evaluate Rodr&#237;guez's case, D&#225;vila did not give Ortiz the file despite being asked to do so. Escobar also consulted Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez after being demoted, and he advised her to speak with D&#225;vila. D&#225;vila told her that documents were missing from her file, and Escobar supplied D&#225;vila with the missing documents. At a later meeting, D&#225;vila told her that even with all the documentation, her demotion would stand because she had not met all the requirements for the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that the discrimination was based on political affiliation. The review was instigated by D&#225;vila (acting on behalf of the incoming PDP administration) and every employee of Zo&#233; Laboy (a member of the outgoing NPP administration) had his or her file reviewed except for one, who happened to be a member of the PDP. Such a review is not necessarily improper, as the PDP administration may certainly investigate potential illegal appointments by the NPP administration. However, it suggests that D&#225;vila knew that both Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar were NPP supporters. Rodr&#237;guez testified that both Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez and D&#225;vila made statements to her indicating that her demotion was politically motivated. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez and D&#225;vila denied making such statements, but it is for the jury to resolve such issues of credibility. Finally, both Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar testified that co-workers harassed them because of their political affiliation. This harassment provides further evidence that Rodr&#237;guez and Escobar's political affiliation was known among the employees of the AOC and indirect evidence that D&#225;vila would also have been aware of their political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Mt.

Thus, even if political affiliation was an improper consideration, defendants will prevail if they can show that plaintiffs' political affiliation was not the \"but-for\" cause of their demotions. <i>Tejada-Batista v.

Healthy</i> defense. In their brief, they develop only two arguments: first, that they presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find a successful <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense, and second, that the district court improperly refused to include a jury instruction describing the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address defendants' argument of sufficient evidence for the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. In their brief, defendants state the \"evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Defendants prevailed in their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense.\" They further note that they \"presented evidence proving that they would have made the same employment determinations based on the legitimate nondiscriminatory justification of complying with Puerto Rico personnel law.\" In support of this argument, defendants cite only one case, <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> for their proposition that \"the demotion of a public employee resulting from the failure of her appointment to comply with personnel laws and regulations, constituted sufficient evidence to satisfy <i>Mt. Healthy.</i>\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' argument, however, does not address the required legal standard. In order for defendants to prevail on this Rule 50 or sufficiency of the evidence claim, they need to show that no reasonable jury could have denied their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. <i>See Sheils Title Co.,</i> 184 F.3d at 19. A showing that defendants presented sufficient evidence for a jury to grant their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense clearly does not meet this burden. The case they rely on, <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> does not support the proposition they cite it for and did not even reach the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. In <i>V&#225;zquez-Valent&#237;n,</i> we found that no reasonable jury could have found \"that plaintiff's political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in [the] adverse employment action.\" 385 F.3d at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if defendants had argued that no reasonable jury could deny their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense under the appropriate legal standard, they would be incorrect. At trial, plaintiffs and defendants presented conflicting evidence as to the legality of plaintiffs' appointments. Notably, H&#233;ctor Rivera-Rivera, the director of recruitment, testified that he certified that plaintiffs' appointments were legal. A reasonable jury could certainly find that political affiliation, not the legality of the appointments, was the \"but-for\" cause of the demotions. Therefore, defendants' <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next address defendants' contention that the district court improperly refused to include a jury instruction describing the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. Defendants submitted proposed jury instructions for the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. Defendants contend that they properly preserved this issue for appeal. The portion of the transcript cited by defendants follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. RODRIGUEZ: Okay.

Defendants' statement above does not constitute an objection to the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> instruction. Indeed, in another portion of defendants' brief, they argue that this exact same language constitutes an objection to the district court's jury instructions on qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because defendants did not object to the district court's jury instructions regarding the <i>Mt.

The district court gave a jury instruction regarding the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense: \"It is sufficient if the plaintiffs prove that their protected political activities were the <i>determinative factor</i> in the consideration that was made, and that it <i>made a difference</i> in the defendants' decision.\" This instruction contains the substance of the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. In order to prevail on the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense, defendants must show that plaintiffs would have been demoted regardless of their political affiliation. Thus, if plaintiffs' political affiliation was a \"determinative factor\" or \"made a difference,\" defendants cannot claim that plaintiffs would have been demoted regardless of their political affiliation. Although the district court could have been clearer in instructing the jury on the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense and should have included the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense on the verdict form,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the trial was certainly not a \"miscarriage of justice\" and did not \"undermine[] the integrity of the judicial process.\" <i>Wilson,</i> 150 F.3d at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Qualified immunity specially protects public officials from the specter of damages liability for judgment calls made in a legally uncertain environment.\" <i>Ryder v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117945\"><a href=\"/opinion/117945/ryder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span>, 185, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117945\"><a href=\"/opinion/117945/ryder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span> (1995). An official is entitled to qualified immunity unless (1) \"the plaintiffs' allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation,\" (2) \"the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation,\" and (3) \"a reasonable [official], similarly situated, would understand that the challenged conduct violated that established right.\" <i>Suboh v.

The first two prongs of this test are questions of law for the court to decide. <i>Id.</i> The third prong is also a question of law, but factual questions, to the extent they are antecedent to this determination, must be determined by a jury. <i>Id.</i> While preliminary factual questions regarding qualified immunity are sent to the jury, the legal question of the availability of qualified immunity is \"ultimately committed to the court's judgment.\" <i>Acevedo-Garc&#237;a,</i> 351 F.3d at 563.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants first contend that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on qualified immunity. Defendants, however, are not entitled to a jury instruction regarding qualified immunity, since it is a legal question for the court to decide. <i>See id.</i> Defendants are entitled to have a jury determine any preliminary factual questions, but defendants have not stated, either at trial or on appeal, precisely what factual questions would need to be resolved before the court could determine the legal issue of the official's reasonableness. In finding that defendants politically discriminated against plaintiffs, the jury found that defendants intentionally violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Thus, it appears that any factual finding the jury could make would not benefit defendants. We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the court erred in failing to grant them qualified immunity. We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's denial of a qualified immunity defense. <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90. Defendants remarkably contest all three prongs of the qualified immunity analysis. We need not long consider the first two prongs. Plaintiffs' allegations, if true, clearly established a violation of their First Amendment rights, and such right was well established at the time of the violation. <i>See Acevedo-Garc&#237;a,</i> 351 F.3d at 564. In light of the jury's verdict and our affirmance of it, the third prong is also unavailing. As just mentioned, the jury found that defendants intentionally violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Any reasonable official would clearly understand that it is improper to intentionally violate an employee's First Amendment rights. <i>See id.</i> at 564-65. Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Excessive Damages</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Compensatory Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the compensatory damages award lacked evidentiary support and also that it was excessive. In making these claims, they do not cite any First Circuit precedent. They do cite a Fourth Circuit case, <i>Price v. City of Charlotte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725016\"><a href=\"/opinion/725016/darrell-a-price-david-h-holland-robert-a-holl-oswald-d-holshouser/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1996), which they miscite as a First Circuit case, and an unpublished decision from the District of Puerto Rico, <i>Laracuente-Pab&#243;n v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> No. 95-1528, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 22430 (D.P.R. Mar. 30, 1998). They also cite three Supreme Court cases for the proposition that actual injury is required for an award of compensatory damages. Further, in making this argument, defendants were obliged to present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict but failed to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195230\"><a href=\"/opinion/195230/anthony-v-gmd-airline-serv/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 493 (1st Cir.1994). Given the defendants' failure to specify the applicable law and their failure to present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, this argument is not sufficiently developed and thus waived. <i>See Col&#243;n v. R.K. Grace &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200781\"><a href=\"/opinion/200781/colon-v-rk-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2003). Even assuming that this argument was sufficiently developed, the jury's award of compensatory damages was amply supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Punitive Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded punitive damages of $120,000 to Rodr&#237;guez and $195,000 to Escobar. The punitive damages were assessed against D&#225;vila. D&#225;vila argues that the punitive damages award was excessive. We review this claim <i>de novo. Romano v.

The purpose of punitive damages is to punish and deter reprehensible conduct. <i>Id.</i> A punitive damages award will stand unless we find it \"certain that the amount in question exceeds that necessary to punish and deter the alleged misconduct.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has presented three guideposts to consider in determining the excessiveness of a punitive damages award: \"(1) the degree of reprehensibility of a defendant's conduct; (2) the ratio between punitive and actual and potential damages; and (3) a comparison of the punitive damages figure and other civil and criminal penalties imposed for comparable conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 672-73 (citing <i>BMW of N.

Since the jury found otherwise and we construe all evidence in favor of the jury's verdict, this argument is to no avail. The jury found that D&#225;vila intentionally demoted plaintiffs because of their political affiliation. D&#225;vila's act also jeopardized plaintiffs' livelihood. As a result of their demotions, Rodr&#237;guez's salary was reduced by 60 percent and Escobar's salary was reduced by 43 percent. Both plaintiffs suffered harms to their professional careers, were unable to meet their financial obligations because of their reduced salaries, and suffered emotional distress for which they sought medical attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#225;vila addresses only the first guidepost, but the other two guideposts also favor plaintiffs. In addition to back pay, the jury awarded Rodr&#237;guez compensatory damages of $180,000 and Escobar compensatory damages of $105,000. Thus, for Rodr&#237;guez, the punitive damages were less than the compensatory damages, and for Escobar, the punitive damages were less than twice the compensatory damages. The ratio of punitive to compensatory damages and the magnitude of the punitive damages are far from extraordinary. <i>See Rivera-Torres,</i> 341 F.3d at 102 (finding punitive damages \"well within acceptable bounds\" in a political employment discrimination suit where the jury awarded $185,000 in compensatory damages to the plaintiff, $135,000 in compensatory damages to plaintiff's family, and $250,000 in punitive damages); <i>see also Tapalian v.
