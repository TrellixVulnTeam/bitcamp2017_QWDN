Lichoulas, Jr. owns or\n\nserves as trustee for five parcels of land (collectively, \"the\n\nAppleton Properties\") that were taken by eminent domain by the City\n\nof   Lowell,   Massachusetts.          Located         on   the   properties     is   a\n\nhydroelectric      power    facility       that       was   designed   to   generate\n\nelectricity from the flow of water between the Pawtucket and\n\nHamilton Canals.     Although the facility is inactive, its existence\n\nis the occasion for Lichoulas' federal law suit.                    The background\n\nevents are easily summarized.1\n\n            The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") granted\n\na license on July 18, 1986, to operate a hydroelectric power\n\nproject (\"the Project\") on the Appleton Properties.                    In 1994 the\n\nfacility ceased to operate, save perhaps for a short period of time\n\nin 2002.    On September 23, 2004, FERC concluded an exchange of\n\nletters with Lichoulas by stating that it deemed the project\n\nabandoned and that Lichoulas' license would be terminated unless\n\nthe project returned to operating condition.                   See 18 C.F.R. § 6.4\n\n(2008)    (\"[i]f   any     licensee    .    .     .    shall   abandon,     or   shall\n\ndiscontinue good faith operation of the project for a period of\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Because the district court granted a motion to dismiss, we\nassume the truth of the allegations of the complaint, Beddall v.\nState Street Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998), and\ntake judicial notice of the related FERC proceedings.       Town of\nNorwood v. New England Power Co., 202 F.3d 408, 412 n.1 (1st Cir.\n2000).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthree years, the Commission will deem it to be the intent of the\n\nlicensee to surrender the license....\").\n\n          Lichoulas replied two months later that repairs on the\n\nproject had been delayed by asbestos removal, but that he intended\n\nto develop a work plan by March of 2005, which he would forward to\n\nthe Commission.     The plan was never sent.   On April 25, 2006, the\n\nCity took the Appleton Properties by eminent domain under state law\n\nas part of an urban redevelopment project, thereafter informing\n\nFERC of its actions.     FERC in turn began proceedings to terminate\n\nLichoulas' license.\n\n          Lichoulas then filed the present law suit in federal\n\ndistrict court, challenging the legality of the taking and asking\n\nthat it be enjoined; his main theory was that section 807(a) of the\n\nFederal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. § 807(a)(2006), precluded the city\n\nfrom taking over a licensed hydroelectric facility unless it\n\nplanned to \"maintain, and operate\" the facility.       He also made a\n\nclaim seeking just compensation for the taking.\n\n          Lowell moved to dismiss, urging that section 807(a)\n\nconferred no private right of action and, in the alternative, the\n\nstatute by its terms only applies to hydroelectric projects that\n\nwere \"serviceable in the development, transmission or distribution\n\nof power . . . .\"    16 U.S.C. § 807(a).   Without ruling definitively\n\non these objections, the district court dismissed the complaint\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fpending the conclusion of the FERC proceedings and declined to\n\nconsider the request for compensation.\n\n           Lichoulas   has    appealed    from    the   district     court's\n\ndismissal.2 Since the district court's dismissal, FERC has entered\n\nan order terminating the license,         Order Terminating License By\n\nImplied Surrender, 124 FERC ¶ 61,255 (Sept. 18, 2008), reh'g\n\ndenied, 125 FERC ¶ 61,195 (Nov. 20, 2008) (Lichoulas has said that\n\nhe plans to seek review of the termination).            He offers several\n\nobjections to the district court's ruling, which we address after\n\nconsidering sua sponte a possible appellate jurisdictional issue.\n\n           The district court's decision did not determine the\n\nmerits and said that Lichoulas may refile the action \"after the\n\nconclusion of the FERC proceedings.\"         In certain cases, dismissals\n\nwithout prejudice with leave to amend are viewed as nonappealable\n\nbecause of the \"final judgment\" requirement. 28 U.S.C. § 1291\n\n(2006), e.g., North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Montilla, 600 F.2d 333,\n\n334-35 (1st Cir. 1979).\n\n           However, such cases generally involve easily remediable\n\ndefects,   see   generally   15A   Wright,    Miller,   &   Cooper   Federal\n\nPractice & Procedure, § 3914.6 at 145 n.18 (2d ed. Supp. 2000), and\n\na closer analogy to this case is a dismissal for lack of ripeness,\n\n\n\n     2\n      By a separate complaint, Lichoulas sought a memorandum of lis\npendens--a notice for public records that title to property is in\nlitigation--which the district court denied and from which he has\nalso appealed. We consolidated the two appeals for review.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fwhich does constitute an appealable order.        Bateman v. City of W.\n\nBountiful, 89 F.3d 704, 705-06 (10th Cir. 1996).          True enough, a\n\nstay of proceedings by the district court pending agency action\n\nwould ordinarily not be appealable, Fuchs, for and on Behalf of\n\nN.L.R.B v. Hood Indus., Inc., 590 F.2d 395, 396 (1st Cir. 1979);\n\nbut if the line between a stay and a dismissal is somewhat formal,\n\nformality is an element in determining what is or is not a final\n\njudgment.\n\n            Lichoulas' first claim on appeal is that his complaint\n\nalleged that the hydroelectric project was duly licensed and that\n\nthe license had not been \"abandoned or surrendered\" at the time of\n\nthe taking.   Accordingly, he says, the district court was required\n\non   the   motion   to   dismiss   to   accept   that   all   well-pleaded\n\nallegations in the complaint are true.       Rumford Pharmacy, Inc. v.\n\nCity of E. Providence, 970 F.2d 996, 997 (1st Cir. 1992).              The\n\nshort answer is that the court was entitled, so far as relevant, to\n\ntake judicial notice of the FERC proceeding.        Town of Norwood, 202\n\nF.3d at 412 n.1.\n\n            Lichoulas' more substantive objection is that (he argues)\n\nany supposed revocation of the license is irrelevant because state\n\nlaw assesses the legality of takings at the time the property is\n\nseized; subsequent events, the argument goes, cannot remedy a\n\ntainted taking. See Burwick v. Mass. Highway Dep't., 57 Mass. App.\n\nCt. 302, 309 (2003) (\"Where the statutory requirements for an order\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fof taking have been neglected, no subsequently entered order may\n\ncure the defect.\").\n\n          We need not resolve this objection nor others on which\n\nrelief on the merits might depend, such as whether there is a\n\nprivate right of action under section 807 or whether the city's\n\ntaking of a dormant plant would violate the statute.   This is not\n\na case where the taking had any effect on the ongoing production of\n\npower or where FERC has evidenced any concern. Lichoulas is simply\n\nseeking to have the federal court derail a state takings proceeding\n\nin which--given the Supremacy Clause--he could presumably raise his\n\nobjections.\n\n          The district court had no obligation to oblige.       In\n\ngeneral, declaratory and injunctive relief are both matters of\n\njudicial discretion.3   Here, the evident prospect that FERC would\n\nrevoke the license made clear that the federal interest, such as it\n\nwas, would likely be mooted; and any objection to the taking, or\n\ndeficiency in adequate compensation, could be and preferably is to\n\nbe done in state proceedings.    Williamson County Reg'l Planning\n\nComm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 194 (1985).\n\n\n\n     3\n      See, e.g., Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 288-89\n(1995) (noting that district court has discretion under Declaratory\nJudgment Act whether or not to exercise jurisdiction); Rossi v.\nGemma, 489 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir. 2007) (same); see also Ross-Simons\nof Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 217 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(\"district courts have broad discretion to . . . make\ndeterminations regarding the propriety of injunctive relief\")\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                -6-\n\f          Under   these   circumstances,   the   district   court   was\n\nentitled, as a matter of judicial judgment, to await the outcome of\n\na FERC proceeding that likely would eliminate any warrant for\n\nintervention by a federal court.       Whether a stay of proceedings\n\nmight have been used (rather than a dismissal without prejudice) is\n\nof no consequence here: FERC did in fact terminate the license.      If\n\nthat termination is undone through appeal of the FERC order,\n\nLichoulas has the district court's leave to refile his complaint.\n\n          To the extent that Lichoulas seeks compensation for the\n\ntaking, the claim is properly brought in state court, as Williamson\n\nmakes clear.   As for Lichoulas' appeal from the district court's\n\nrefusal to issue a lis pendens, M.G.L. c. 184, § 15(a)(2003), there\n\nis no federal suit currently pending so that request is moot.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

He also made a claim seeking just compensation for the taking.</p>\n<p>Lowell moved to dismiss, urging that section 807(a) conferred no private right of action and, in the alternative, the statute by its terms only applies to hydroelectric projects that were \"serviceable in the development, transmission or distribution of power. ...\" 16 U.S.C. § 807(a). Without ruling definitively on these objections, the district court dismissed the complaint pending the conclusion of the FERC proceedings and declined to consider the request for compensation.</p>\n<p>Lichoulas has appealed from the district court's dismissal.<sup>[2]</sup> Since the district court's dismissal, FERC has entered an order terminating the license, <i>Order Terminating License By Implied Surrender,</i> 124 FERC ¶ 61,255 (Sept. 18, 2008), <i>reh'g denied,</i> 125 FERC ¶ 61,195 (Nov. 20, 2008) (Lichoulas has said that he plans to seek review of the termination). He offers several objections to the district court's ruling, which we address after considering <i>sua sponte</i> a possible appellate jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p>The district court's decision did not determine the merits and said that Lichoulas may refile the action \"after the conclusion of the FERC proceedings.\" In certain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> cases, dismissals without prejudice with leave to amend are viewed as nonappealable because of the \"final judgment\" requirement. 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (2006), <i>e.g., </i><i>North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Montilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367071\"><a href=\"/opinion/367071/north-carolina-national-bank-v-cesar-montilla-jr-and-third-party-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 334-35 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p>However, such cases generally involve easily remediable defects, <i>see generally</i> 15A Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure,</i> § 3914.6 at 145 n. 18 (2d ed. Supp.2000), and a closer analogy to this case is a dismissal for lack of ripeness, which does constitute an appealable order. <i>Bateman v. City of W. Bountiful,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153651\"><a href=\"/opinion/153651/bateman-v-west-bountiful-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>, 705-06 (10th Cir. 1996). True enough, a stay of proceedings by the district court pending agency action would ordinarily not be appealable, <i>Fuchs, for and on Behalf of N.L.R.B v. Hood Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362773\"><a href=\"/opinion/362773/robert-s-fuchs-regional-director-of-the-first-region-of-the-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, 396 (1st Cir. 1979); but if the line between a stay and a dismissal is somewhat formal, formality is an element in determining what is or is not a final judgment.</p>\n<p>Lichoulas' first claim on appeal is that his complaint alleged that the hydroelectric project was duly licensed and that the license had not been \"abandoned or surrendered\" at the time of the taking. Accordingly, he says, the district court was required on the motion to dismiss to accept that all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint are true. <i>Rumford Pharmacy, Inc. v. City of E. Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587575\"><a href=\"/opinion/587575/rumford-pharmacy-inc-v-city-of-east-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span>, 997 (1st Cir.1992). The short answer is that the court was entitled, so far as relevant, to take judicial notice of the FERC proceeding. <i>Town of Norwood,</i> 202 F.3d at 412 n. 1.</p>\n<p>Lichoulas' more substantive objection is that (he argues) any supposed revocation of the license is irrelevant because state law assesses the legality of takings at the time the property is seized; subsequent events, the argument goes, cannot remedy a tainted taking. <i>See </i><i>Burwick v. Mass. Highway Dep't.,</i> 57 Mass.App.Ct. 302, 309, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">782</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></span> (2003) (\"Where the statutory requirements for an order of taking have been neglected, no subsequently entered order may cure the defect.\").</p>\n<p>We need not resolve this objection nor others on which relief on the merits might depend, such as whether there is a private right of action under section 807 or whether the city's taking of a dormant plant would violate the statute. This is not a case where the taking had any effect on the ongoing production of power or where FERC has evidenced any concern. Lichoulas is simply seeking to have the federal court derail a state takings proceeding in whichgiven the Supremacy Clause he could presumably raise his objections.</p>\n<p>The district court had no obligation to oblige. In general, declaratory and injunctive relief are both matters of judicial discretion.<sup>[3]</sup> Here, the evident prospect that FERC would revoke the license made clear that the federal interest, such as it was, would likely be mooted; and any objection to the taking, or deficiency in adequate compensation, could be and preferably is to be done in state proceedings. <i>Williamson County Reg'l Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 194, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span> (1985).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Under these circumstances, the district court was entitled, as a matter of judicial judgment, to await the outcome of a FERC proceeding that likely would eliminate any warrant for intervention by a federal court. Whether a stay of proceedings might have been used (rather than a dismissal without prejudice) is of no consequence here: FERC did in fact terminate the license. If that termination is undone through appeal of the FERC order, Lichoulas has the district court's leave to refile his complaint.</p>\n<p>To the extent that Lichoulas seeks compensation for the taking, the claim is properly brought in state court, as <i>Williamson</i> makes clear. As for Lichoulas' appeal from the district court's refusal to issue a lis pendens, M.G.L. c. 184, § 15(a)(2003), there is no federal suit currently pending so that request is moot.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Because the district court granted a motion to dismiss, we assume the truth of the allegations of the complaint, <i>Beddall v.

We consolidated the two appeals for review.</p>\n<p>[3]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Wilton v.
