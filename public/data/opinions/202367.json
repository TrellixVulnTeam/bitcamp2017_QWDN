WATMAN\n\n                               Debtor.\n\n\n                           AARON H.

Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                     Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Peter J. Haley, with whom Leslie F. Su and Gordon Haley LLP\nwere on brief, for appellant.\n     Joseph S.U. Bodoff, with whom Evan Slavitt and Bodoff & Slavit\nLLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           August 21, 2006\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Debtor Aaron H. Watman appeals the\n\nbankruptcy court's denial of his discharge of indebtness based on\n\nits finding that he fraudulently transferred property under 11\n\nU.S.C. § 727(a)(2)(A) and (a)(7).                This is the second time an\n\nappeal in this case has come before us.            In 1999, creditor Lawrence\n\nGroman initiated this adversary proceeding objecting to Watman's\n\ndischarge.    After a trial, the bankruptcy court entered a judgment\n\nin favor of Watman, and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\")\n\naffirmed.    In Groman v. Watman (In re Watman), 301 F.3d 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (\"Watman I\"), we vacated the judgment and remanded the case\n\nfor further proceedings in the bankruptcy court.              Specifically, we\n\nheld that the bankruptcy court failed to consider fully the extent\n\nof the transferred property and several indicia of fraudulent\n\nintent.   On remand, the bankruptcy court reconsidered its findings\n\nand   ultimately     found    in   favor    of     Groman,   denying    Watman's\n\ndischarge.    On appeal, the BAP remanded the case for additional\n\nfindings,    which   the     bankruptcy    court    provided,   again    denying\n\nWatman's discharge.          Watman filed another appeal, which Groman\n\nelected to present to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 158(c)(1)(B). The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's\n\ndecision.    Watman now appeals to us, arguing that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt erred in both its factual findings and its manner of inquiry\n\non remand following our decision in Watman I.                   After careful\n\nreview, we affirm.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                  I.\n\nA. Factual background\n\n            We restate the facts of this case, as described in Watman\n\nI, 301 F.3d at 3-7.     Watman, a dentist, joined Childrens Dental\n\nAssociates of Lowell (\"Childrens Dental\") in April 1988.     At that\n\ntime, Groman, also a dentist, was the sole shareholder, officer,\n\nand director of Childrens Dental.      The parties agreed that Watman\n\nwould be given the opportunity to purchase fifty percent of the\n\npractice at the end of one year if the two men worked well\n\ntogether.   Consistent with that plan, at the end of his first year\n\nwith Childrens Dental, Watman entered into an agreement to pay\n\nGroman on a monthly basis for ten years in exchange for a fifty\n\npercent ownership stake in the practice. In 1992, Watman agreed to\n\npurchase the other fifty percent of the practice from Groman, and\n\nthe payment period was extended an additional ten years to cover\n\nthe other half of the purchase price. Watman made the monthly\n\npayments to Groman until September of 1997, when Watman claimed\n\ndifficulties in making the payments. In response, Groman agreed to\n\nreduce the monthly payments from $ 5,600 to $ 3,000.\n\n            Watman made only two of the reduced monthly payments. In\n\nApril 1998, Groman filed suit against Watman and Childrens Dental\n\nas joint obligors for the remaining balance owed him.     On December\n\n14, 1998, Groman obtained a judgment against Watman and Childrens\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fDental in the amount of $ 437,918 in Middlesex Superior Court.\n\nNeither Watman nor Childrens Dental appealed that judgment.\n\n            In or about March 1999, Groman filed a complaint seeking\n\nthe appointment of a receiver for Childrens Dental.            A hearing on\n\nthe appointment of a receiver was scheduled for March 17, 1999 but\n\nwas continued by agreement of counsel to March 24, 1999.\n\n            On March 18, 1999, Watman wrote thirty-seven checks from\n\nthe Childrens Dental checking account, totaling $ 42,011.49.              He\n\nrecorded these transactions in Childrens Dental's books.            Of that\n\ntotal, $ 14,702.02 went to prepayments of Childrens Dental's\n\nanticipated expenses for the month of April, including office rent,\n\nequipment   rent,   health    insurance,    and    maintenance.    Although\n\npayroll was typically paid out every two weeks, Watman caused\n\npayroll withdrawals to be made from Childrens Dental's bank account\n\non March 10, 1999 and March 18, 1999 (the day after the original\n\ndate of the receivership hearing).              On March 19, 1999, on the\n\nadvice of counsel, Watman sent a letter of resignation to Michael\n\nDana   Rosen,   counsel      for    Childrens    Dental,   terminating   his\n\nemployment immediately.            On March 22, 1999, Watman filed his\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition. On March 24, 1999, Childrens Dental\n\nfiled its Chapter 11 petition.1         At the time that these petitions\n\nwere filed, Watman was the sole officer and director of Childrens\n\n\n1\n  According to Rosen's testimony at trial, Groman intended to\nobject to the confirmation of any Chapter 11 plan. The bankruptcy\njudge sua sponte converted the Childrens Dental case to Chapter 7.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fDental.   At the time of filing, Childrens Dental had cash in bank\n\naccounts in the amount of approximately $ 30,000 and accounts\n\nreceivable of about $ 69,000.   These assets were disclosed in the\n\nbankruptcy schedules and turned over to the bankruptcy trustee. On\n\nor about March 25, 1999, Watman informed Lowell Doctors Park,2 from\n\nwhom Childrens Dental was renting its office space, that Childrens\n\nDental would be terminating its occupancy of the premises.\n\n          From March 24, 1999 through March 31, 1999, Watman\n\noperated a dental practice under his own name at the office space\n\nthat had been occupied by Childrens Dental at 75 Arcand Drive, in\n\nLowell, Massachusetts (75 Arcand Drive location), using the same\n\nfurniture and equipment that Childrens Dental had used. Watman\n\noffered the employees of Childrens Dental positions in his practice\n\non the same terms as Childrens Dental was employing them.    Then, on\n\nMarch 31, 1999, Lowell Dentistry for Children, P.C. (\"Lowell\n\nDentistry\") was incorporated and began operations out of the same\n\n75 Arcand Drive location.    The corporate documentation to form\n\nLowell Dentistry had been prepared in January 1999 by the law firm\n\nof Devine, Millimet & Branch.   Childrens Dental paid the cost of\n\nthese services from a retainer that it had paid to that firm.\n\nWatman became, and continues to be, the president, sole shareholder\n\nand director of Lowell Dentistry.     Most of Childrens Dental's 3000\n\n\n\n2\n Lowell Doctors Park is a limited partnership in which Watman had\na 12.5 percent interest.\n\n                                -5-\n\fpatients became patients of Lowell Dentistry when Childrens Dental\n\nceased operating.\n\n            On August 27, 1999, Groman filed a complaint, alleging,\n\ninter   alia,    that    Watman's   actions   warranted     a    denial      of   his\n\ndischarge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2) and (a)(7).                      Watman\n\nsubsequently moved to dismiss Groman's complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim under Rule 7012 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n\nProcedure    and   Rule    12(b)(6)   of    the   Federal       Rules   of    Civil\n\nProcedure.      That motion was granted by the bankruptcy court.                   On\n\nappeal, the BAP reversed the bankruptcy court's dismissal of the\n\n§ 727 objections to discharge and remanded for a trial on the\n\nmerits.     After trial, the bankruptcy court entered judgment in\n\nfavor of Watman.        On appeal, the BAP affirmed the judgment of the\n\nbankruptcy court.       Groman appealed, and we vacated the judgment of\n\nthe bankruptcy court in Watman I.\n\nB.   Watman I and subsequent procedural history\n\n            During the bankruptcy court proceedings and on appeal,\n\nGroman argued that Watman's transfer of the assets of Childrens\n\nDental to Lowell Dentistry -- including patient records, office\n\nspace, equipment, and employees -- \"shifted all the goodwill of\n\nChildrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry, stripped Childrens Dental of\n\nits aggregate value as a going concern, and eliminated its ability\n\nto generate income for the estate, leaving Groman with an empty\n\nshell at Childrens Dental (save approximately $ 99,000 in cash and\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\faccounts receivable[]) against which to pursue collection of his\n\n$ 437,918 judgment.\"        Watman I, 301 F.3d at 9.      For his part,\n\nWatman argued that he formed Lowell Dentistry to preserve the\n\nassets of Childrens Dental so that he could pay the debts to\n\nGroman, and explained that he did so relying on advice of counsel.\n\nThe bankruptcy court, noting that Watman did not conceal his\n\nactions and emphasizing Watman's claim that he relied on counsel's\n\nadvice,   initially   concluded   that   Groman   had   not   established\n\nWatman's \"intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" under 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 727(a)(2).\n\n           In reviewing the bankruptcy court's reasoning, we found\n\nit problematic and incomplete in several respects.        We noted that\n\nWatman's claim that he formed Lowell Dentistry to preserve the\n\nassets of Childrens Dental \"was never memorialized in writing, is\n\nnot in any way referenced in any written memoranda, and was not\n\nreported in Childrens Dental's bankruptcy schedules.\"          Watman I,\n\n301 F.3d at 9.   We also observed that the bankruptcy court had not\n\naccounted for the fact that the assets of Childrens Dental were\n\ntransferred to Lowell Dentistry without consideration, and had not\n\nconsidered whether several other indicia of fraud were evident in\n\nthis case.   See id. at 12-13.     We therefore remanded the case for\n\nfurther findings.     Id.\n\n           On remand, the bankruptcy court held a status conference\n\nat which the parties agreed that no further evidence was needed to\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fmake the findings on remand. The bankruptcy court gave the parties\n\nan opportunity to submit further proposed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law.         After reviewing those submissions and the\n\nrecord, the bankruptcy court found in favor of Groman on Count II\n\nof his complaint, denying Watman a discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 727(a)(7).3    On appeal, the BAP found that the bankruptcy court\n\naddressed some, but not all, of the points mentioned in our Watman\n\nI   decision   and   thus   remanded   for   additional   findings.   The\n\n\n3\n  In Count I of his complaint, Groman objected to the discharge\nunder 11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2), based on Watman's transfer of the\nproperty of Childrens Dental. The bankruptcy court dismissed that\nclaim, holding that § 727(a)(2) applies to the fraudulent transfer\nof property in which the debtor had a direct proprietary interest,\nnot the transfer of the property of a corporation in which the\ndebtor may have derivative interest. See Riumbau v. Colodner (In\nre Colodner), 147 B.R. 90, 93 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1992); see also\nMCorp Management Solutions, Inc. v. Thurman (In re Thurman), 901\nF.2d 839, 841 (10th Cir. 1990) (\"Congress intended to limit the\nreach of § 727(a)(2)(A) only to those transfers of property in\nwhich the debtor has a direct proprietary interest.\"). Instead,\nthe bankruptcy court denied the discharge under 11 U.S.C.\n§ 727(a)(7).     A court may deny a debtor's discharge under\n§ 727(a)(7) if the debtor has committed an act specified in\n§ 727(a)(2) in connection with a bankruptcy case \"concerning an\ninsider.\"    11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(7).      Where the debtor is an\nindividual, the term \"insider\" is defined to include a \"corporation\nof which the debtor is a director, officer, or person in control.\"\n11 U.S.C. § 101(31)(A)(iv). In Count II of his complaint, Groman\nalleged that Childrens Dental is an \"insider\" of Watman and that\nWatman fraudulently transferred the property of Childrens Dental.\nAs we noted in Watman I, \"[i]n light of Watman's status as sole\nofficer, shareholder, and director of Childrens Dental, Childrens\nDental clearly qualifies as an 'insider' of Watman for purposes of\n§ 727(a)(7), and Watman does not argue otherwise.\" Watman I, 301\nF.3d at 8. In challenging Groman's § 727(a)(7) claim on appeal,\nWatman focuses on whether his actions concerning Childrens Dental\nare prohibited acts under § 727(a)(2). We thus examine whether\nGroman has established the elements of § 727(a)(2) with respect to\nthe property of Childrens Dental.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fbankruptcy court supplemented its findings but came to the same\n\nconclusion.       Watman filed another appeal, which Groman elected to\n\npresent to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(c)(1)(B).\n\nThe district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court.\n\nThis second appeal to us ensued.\n\n                                       II.\n\n             We review the bankruptcy court's conclusions of law de\n\nnovo and its factual findings for clear error.              See Davis v. Cox\n\n(In re Cox), 356 F.3d 76, 82 (1st Cir. 2004).4                     Although the\n\ndistrict court reviewed the bankruptcy court's decision in this\n\ncase, we \"exhibit no particular deference to the conclusions of\n\n.   .   .   the   district   court.\"         Brandt   v.   Repco    Printers   &\n\nLithographics, Inc. (In re HealthCo Int'l, Inc.), 132 F.3d 104, 107\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n             In this appeal, Watman asserts that the bankruptcy court\n\nclearly erred in its findings on (a) what property of Childrens\n\nDental was transferred to Lowell Dentistry and (b) whether Watman\n\nacted with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors.\n\nWatman also argues that the bankruptcy court erred in its approach\n\nto the inquiry on remand by reversing some of its initial factual\n\nfindings without hearing additional evidence and exceeding the\n\nscope of remand.      We address these arguments in turn.\n\n\n\n4\n  We discuss in more detail our approach to reviewing the\nbankruptcy court's findings of indicia of fraud in Part II.A.2.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fA.    The bankruptcy court's findings of fraudulent transfer under\n11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2)(A)\n\n            On remand, the bankruptcy court concluded that Watman is\n\nprecluded under 11 U.S.C. § 727 (a)(7), applying § 727(a)(2)(A),\n\nfrom receiving a discharge in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.          Section\n\n727(a)(2)(A) states:\n\n            The court shall grant the debtor a discharge,\n            unless . . . the debtor, with intent to\n            hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or an\n            officer of the estate charged with custody of\n            property under this title, has transferred,\n            removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed,\n            or has permitted to be transferred, removed,\n            destroyed, mutilated, or concealed [] property\n            of the debtor, within one year before the date\n            of the filing of the petition[.]\n\n11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2)(A).    We explained in Watman I that\n\n            in order for a debtor to be denied a discharge\n            under § 727(a)(2), an objector must show by a\n            preponderance of the evidence that (1) the\n            debtor   transferred,    removed,   destroyed,\n            mutilated, or concealed (2) his or her\n            property (or the property of the estate if the\n            transfer occurs post- petition) (3) within one\n            year of the petition filing date (for\n            prepetition transfers) (4) with intent to\n            hinder, delay or defraud a creditor.\n\n301 F.3d at 7.    Groman, as the party requesting the denial of the\n\ndischarge in this case, has the burden of establishing these\n\nelements.    Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4005; see also Watman I, 301 F.3d at\n\n7.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f               1. Property of Childrens Dental transferred to Lowell\nDentistry\n\n               Under the first two elements of the fraudulent transfer\n\ntest   under     11   U.S.C.      §   727(a)(2),    as    applicable    here    under\n\n§ 727(a)(7), Groman must show that Watman transferred or concealed\n\nproperty that belonged to Childrens Dental.                 The bankruptcy court,\n\nin its initial decision, concluded that there \"was no transfer here\n\nin the customary sense\" and that \"transfers, if they did take place\n\nat all, were not of the formal legal title nature, and to the\n\nextent that patients' files, records, et cetera, are property of\n\nthe estate . . . they haven't been transferred.\"                    In Watman I, we\n\nconcluded that this analysis was inadequate. 301 F.3d at 10.\n\nSpecifically, we questioned whether the bankruptcy court applied\n\nthe correct definition of \"transfer\" in its analysis, noting that\n\nbankruptcy law defines \"transfer\" broadly to include a transfer of\n\npossession, custody, or control even if there is no transfer of\n\nlegal title.          See Watman I, 301 F.3d at 10 (discussing the\n\nlegislative       history    of       11   U.S.C.   §    101(54),    which   defines\n\n\"transfer\" (citing S. Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong. 27 (1978), as\n\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5813)); see also Martin v.\n\nBajgar (In re Bajgar), 104 F.3d 495, 498 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting\n\nthe    broad    definition     of      \"transfer\"   in    bankruptcy    law).     We\n\nexplained that the bankruptcy court should have determined whether\n\n\"assets such as Childrens Dental's employees, patient files, office\n\nspace, goodwill and overall going concern value were (a) properly\n\n                                           -11-\n\fconsidered property of Childrens Dental such that they would have\n\nbeen included in the estate for the benefit of creditors; and (b)\n\nif   so,   whether    they   were   transferred        to   Watman    or     Lowell\n\nDentistry.\"    301 F.3d at 11-12 (footnote omitted).\n\n            On remand, the bankruptcy court concluded that Childrens\n\nDental's \"space, patient records, employees, and good will\" were\n\nproperty of Childrens Dental and that they were transferred to\n\nLowell Dentistry.      The bankruptcy court noted that Watman \"also\n\nused Childrens Dental's funds to prepay expenses that he knew he or\n\na new corporation would incur.\"            The bankruptcy court found that\n\nthe only property not transferred and thus \"remaining in [Childrens\n\nDental's] estate for liquidation by its Chapter 7 Trustee consisted\n\nof accounts receivable, an obsolete computer that Lowell Dentistry\n\noriginally used then stopped using at some point, furnishings,\n\ndecorations, and a box of dental supplies of unknown value.\"                    The\n\nbankruptcy    court   concluded     that    Watman's    actions      thus    harmed\n\nChildrens Dental's creditors.\n\n            Watman challenges these findings on two interrelated\n\ngrounds.     First, he argues that the bankruptcy court erred by\n\nfailing to calculate the specific value of these assets.                    Second,\n\nhe argues that the bankruptcy court's finding that Childrens\n\nDental's assets had some value was clearly erroneous.                       Both of\n\nthese arguments are specious.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f          a.   Calculating the value of the assets\n\n          The bankruptcy court was not required to calculate the\n\nprecise value of the assets of Childrens Dental in order to\n\ndetermine whether those assets were \"property\" capable of being\n\ntransferred in this context.   The question of whether those assets\n\nwere \"property\" capable of being transferred depends on whether\n\nthey are \"'susceptible of having value.'\"   Watman I, 301 F.3d at 12\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting Robinson v. Watts Detective Agency, 685\n\nF.2d 729, 734 (1st Cir. 1982)); see also Robinson, 685 F.2d at 734\n\n(explaining that the term \"property\" in the context of transfers is\n\ndefined generally as \"anything of value -- anything which has debt\n\npaying or debt securing power\"); Glosband v. Watts Detective\n\nAgency, Inc., 21 B.R. 963, 971 (D. Mass. 1981) (holding that the\n\nterm \"property\" in the context of transfers should be interpreted\n\n\"'most generously' to incorporate anything of value which but for\n\nthe transfer might have been preserved for the trustee to the\n\nultimate benefit of the bankrupt's creditors\" (quoting Segal v.\n\nRochelle, 382 U.S. 375, 379 (1966))).    Once the bankruptcy court\n\ndetermined that the assets of Childrens Dental had some value, it\n\ndid not have to calculate the precise value.\n\n          b.   Whether Childrens Dental's assets had value\n\n          Watman essentially argues that the assets of Childrens\n\nDental were valueless.   He focuses much of his argument on whether\n\nthe bankruptcy court properly determined the extent of Childrens\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fDental's goodwill and going concern value independent of Watman's\n\nown practice.       We need not reach those arguments, however, because\n\nthe evidence demonstrates that other assets of Childrens Dental had\n\nvalue.    As the district court aptly observed,\n\n            Watman, both as a solo petitioner and as part\n            of Lowell Dentistry, decided to operate at the\n            same location, use the same furniture,\n            equipment and supplies, employ the same\n            employees (including an orthodontist and\n            another dentist), retain the same patient\n            records, and service the same patients as\n            Childrens Dental.    Before Watman filed for\n            bankruptcy, he was willing to make monthly\n            payments for these combined Childrens Dental\n            assets.\n\nIn   re   Watman,    331   B.R.   502,    511   (D.   Mass.   2005)   (citations\n\nomitted). In addition, as the bankruptcy court noted, Watman \"used\n\nChildrens Dental's funds to prepay expenses that he knew he or a\n\nnew corporation would incur.\"              Watman transferred these assets\n\nidentified by the bankruptcy court precisely because they had\n\nvalue.    If Watman had walked away from Childrens Dental, he would\n\nhave had to expend resources to find a new location for his\n\npractice, buy new equipment, hire new employees, find new patients\n\nor encourage his old patients to follow him despite changes in\n\nlocation and employees, and develop new patient records or enter\n\ninto some arrangement to get the old records.                  Instead, Watman\n\nsimply transferred by possession these assets of Childrens Dental\n\nto Lowell Dentistry.        We therefore affirm the bankruptcy court's\n\nfinding that Childrens Dental's assets had value and that Watman\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fused those assets for his new practice.5   Given this finding, we\n\nconclude that Watman transferred the property of Childrens Dental\n\nto Lowell Property within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2)(A).6\n\n          2.   Intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor\n\n          Under the last element of § 727(a)(2)(A), Groman had to\n\nconvince the bankruptcy court that Watman acted with the intent to\n\nhinder, delay, or defraud his creditors.    Section 727 requires a\n\nshowing of actual intent, not constructive intent.   Watman I, 301\n\nF.3d at 8 (citing 6 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 727.02[3][a] (L. King\n\ned., 15th ed. 2002)).     \"Because a debtor rarely gives direct\n\nevidence of fraudulent intent, we have recognized that . . . intent\n\nto defraud a creditor can be proved by circumstantial evidence.\"\n\nMarrama v. Citizens Bank (In re Marrama), 445 F.3d 518, 522 (1st\n\n\n\n\n5\n  We therefore also affirm the bankruptcy court's finding that\nLowell Dentistry's use of these assets harmed the creditors of\nChildrens Dental. Watman's sole basis for challenging this finding\nis his contention that the assets of Childrens Dental had no value.\nWe have rejected that claim and thus find no merit in Watman's\nargument.\n6\n Because we affirm the bankruptcy court's conclusions on the basis\nof the findings mentioned above, we do not reach Watman's challenge\nto the bankruptcy court's finding that a noncompetition agreement\nbetween Watman and Childrens Dental was evidence of the independent\nvalue of Childrens Dental. While the district court observed that\na noncompetition agreement could support the inference of the\ngoodwill and going concern value of a business independent from the\npractitioner under certain circumstances, the court also noted that\nthe law on noncompetition agreements in the discharge context is in\n\"disarray\" and that a finding on this issue was not necessary to\nsupport the judgment.\n\n                               -15-\n\fCir. 2006).   There are several objective indicia of fraudulent\n\nintent:\n\n          (1) insider relationships between the parties;\n          (2) the retention of possession, benefit or\n          use of the property in question; (3) the lack\n          or inadequacy of consideration for the\n          transfer; (4) the financial condition of the\n          party sought to be charged both before and\n          after the transaction at issue; (5) the\n          existence or cumulative effect of the pattern\n          or series of transactions or course of conduct\n          after the incurring of debt, onset of\n          financial difficulties, or pendency or threat\n          of suits by creditors; (6) the general\n          chronology of the events and transactions\n          under inquiry; and (7) an attempt by debtor to\n          keep the transfer a secret.\n\nWatman I, 301 F.3d at 8 (citations omitted).        We have also\n\nrecognized that \"'[t]he shifting of assets by the debtor to a\n\ncorporation wholly controlled by him is another badge of fraud.'\"\n\nId. (quoting Salomon v. Kaiser (In re Kaiser), 722 F.2d 1574, 1583\n\n(2d Cir. 1983)).\n\n          Reviewing evidence of these indicia, we construe the\n\ngrounds for discharge liberally in favor of the debtor. See Boroff\n\nv. Tully (In re Tully), 818 F.2d 106, 110 (1st Cir. 1987).   Where\n\nthe intent issue turns on the credibility and demeanor of the\n\ndebtor, we typically defer to the bankruptcy court's conclusions.\n\nSee Palmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 785 (1st Cir. 1997).   The\n\ndetermination of actual intent is a factual finding and, \"[i]n all\n\nevents, we will affirm the bankruptcy court's findings of fact\n\nunless they appear to be clearly erroneous -- that is, unless we\n\n\n                              -16-\n\fare 'left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\n\nbeen committed.'\"       Watman I, 301 F.3d at 8 (quoting Anderson v.\n\nCity of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985)).\n\n            Watman asserts that the bankruptcy court ignored his\n\nclaims that he acted on advice of counsel and did not conceal his\n\nactions.    We reject that argument.          The bankruptcy court did not\n\nignore his claims; it simply found that other indicia of fraud were\n\nprevalent in the case. The court noted that Watman \"took virtually\n\nall of [Childrens Dental's] assets, tangible and intangible, and\n\ntransferred them to his new corporation,\" yet paid no consideration\n\nfor the transfer. The bankruptcy court found that Watman's actions\n\nresulted in the diminution and possibly the complete elimination of\n\nthe value of Childrens Dental as a whole.              The court rejected\n\nWatman's testimony and the testimony of his attorney that Watman\n\ncreated Lowell Dentistry to \"preserve the value\" of Childrens\n\nDental (on the theory that Lowell Dentistry could purportedly make\n\npayments to Childrens Dental) as \"not credible,\" given the lack of\n\nany memorialization of such an arrangement.            Instead, the court\n\nfound that Watman created Lowell Dentistry \"to get out from under\n\nhis and [Childrens Dental's] obligation to Groman.\"                The court\n\nrecognized that \"Watman's actions were not done in secret,\" but\n\nconcluded that the fact \"[t]hat they were not secretive, however,\n\nis   not   sufficient   to   overcome   the    conclusion   that   they   were\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fintended to hinder, delay and defraud Groman.\"   These findings are\n\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\nB.   The bankruptcy court's reconsideration of its initial findings\n\n           Watman also challenges the bankruptcy court's approach to\n\nthe inquiry on remand.    First, Watman argues that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt exceeded the scope of the remand by addressing the fraudulent\n\nintent issue.   Second, Watman asserts that the court should not\n\nhave reversed its initial finding that he lacked the requisite\n\nintent, particularly in terms of its credibility determination,\n\nwithout   hearing   additional   evidence.   These   arguments   are\n\nunavailing.\n\n           Watman insists that the scope of our remand was limited\n\nto addressing the issue of the value of the transferred property,\n\nprecluding reconsideration of the issue of fraudulent intent.\n\nHowever, we specifically noted in our first decision that remand\n\nwas required because the bankruptcy court had \"left unexamined\n\n. . . indicia of fraudulent intent.\"     Watman I, 301 F.3d at 13.\n\nThe bankruptcy court properly considered all of the issues that we\n\nidentified on remand.\n\n           There was also nothing improper in the bankruptcy court's\n\nreversal of its findings on the intent issue without hearing any\n\nadditional evidence. Our concern with its initial decision was the\n\nincompleteness of its analysis of the fraudulent intent issue. See\n\nid. at 12-13. In addition, we expressed our skepticism of Watman's\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fclaim that he formed Lowell Dentistry in order to preserve the\n\nassets    of     Childrens   Dental    given     the    lack    of   any    written\n\nmemorialization of that arrangement.             See id. at 8-9.       On remand,\n\nthe bankruptcy court considered all of the indicia of fraud in this\n\ncase    and    reevaluated   the    testimony.         Based   on    its   complete\n\nanalysis, the court reversed its credibility findings and its\n\nconclusion that Groman had not established Watman's intent to\n\nhinder, delay, or defraud his creditors.\n\n              In light of the bankruptcy court's incomplete analysis of\n\nthe issues in its first decision and our remand \"for adequate\n\nfindings on these issues,\" Watman I, 301 F.3d at 13, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt    acted    properly   in    considering    all    of    the   evidence   and\n\nreevaluating its findings accordingly.             See Ramey Constr. Co. v.\n\nApache Tribe of Mescalero Reservation, 673 F.2d 315, 318 (10th Cir.\n\n1982) (concluding that district court's reconsideration of its\n\nfindings on remand was proper where appellate court had concluded\n\nthat the initial findings were inadequate and incomplete); William\n\nG. Roe & Co. v. Armour & Co., 414 F.2d 862, 865 (5th Cir. 1969)\n\n(concluding that, where the appellate court had remanded for more\n\nspecific findings, \"it was . . . within the court's power on remand\n\nto find that it had been wrong the first time and reverse itself\").\n\nWe discern no error in the bankruptcy court's approach or its\n\nconclusions.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f                                  III.\n\n           The legal dispute between these parties began with state\n\ncourt proceedings in 1998, which produced a judgment for Groman\n\nagainst Watman and Childrens Dental in the amount of $ 437,918.\n\nThen, after bankruptcy filings by Watman and Childrens Dental, the\n\ncase has wound its way up and down the federal court system for the\n\nlast seven years.      With our affirmance here, one portion of this\n\nlong saga may finally have come to an end -- Watman is not entitled\n\nto a discharge of his indebtedness to Groman. The bankruptcy court\n\nproperly   concluded    that   Watman    transferred   the   property   of\n\nChildrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry and that he acted with actual\n\nintent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, in violation of\n\n§ 727(a)(2).   Its approach to our remand was appropriate, and the\n\ndistrict court correctly upheld the decision.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\f",

Watman appeals the bankruptcy court's denial of his discharge of indebtness based on its finding that he fraudulently transferred property under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2)(A) and (a)(7). This is the second time an appeal in this case has come before us. In 1999, creditor Lawrence Groman initiated this adversary proceeding objecting to Watman's discharge. After a trial, the bankruptcy court entered a judgment in favor of Watman, and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\") affirmed. In <i>Groman v. Watman (In re Watman</i>), 301 F.3d 3 (1st Cir.2002) (\"<i>Watman I</i>\"), we vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings in the bankruptcy court. Specifically, we held that the bankruptcy court failed to consider fully the extent of the transferred property and several indicia of fraudulent intent. On remand, the bankruptcy court reconsidered its findings and ultimately found in favor of Groman, denying Watman's discharge. On appeal, the BAP remanded the case for additional findings, which the bankruptcy court provided, again denying Watman's discharge. Watman filed another appeal, which Groman elected to present to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158(c)(1)(B). The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision. Watman now appeals to us, arguing that the bankruptcy court erred in both its factual findings and its manner of inquiry on remand following our decision in <i>Watman I.</i> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We restate the facts of this case, as described in <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 3-7. Watman, a dentist, joined Childrens Dental Associates of Lowell (\"Childrens Dental\") in April 1988. At that time, Groman, also a dentist, was the sole shareholder, officer, and director of Childrens Dental. The parties agreed that Watman would be given the opportunity to purchase fifty percent of the practice at the end of one year if the two men worked well together. Consistent with that plan, at the end of his first year with Childrens Dental, Watman entered into an agreement to pay Groman on a monthly basis for ten years in exchange for a fifty percent ownership stake in the practice. In 1992, Watman agreed to purchase the other fifty percent of the practice from Groman, and the payment period was extended an additional ten years to cover the other half of the purchase price. Watman made the monthly payments to Groman until September of 1997, when Watman claimed difficulties in making the payments. In response, Groman agreed to reduce the monthly payments from $ 5,600 to $ 3,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman made only two of the reduced monthly payments. In April 1998, Groman filed suit against Watman and Childrens Dental as joint obligors for the remaining balance owed him. On December 14, 1998, Groman obtained a judgment against Watman and Childrens Dental in the amount of $ 437,918 in Middlesex Superior Court. Neither Watman nor Childrens Dental appealed that judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or about March 1999, Groman filed a complaint seeking the appointment of a receiver for Childrens Dental. A hearing on the appointment of a receiver was scheduled for March 17, 1999 but was continued by agreement of counsel to March 24, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 1999, Watman wrote thirty-seven checks from the Childrens Dental checking account, totaling $ 42,011.49. He recorded these transactions in Childrens Dental's books. Of that total, $ 14,702.02 went to prepayments of Childrens Dental's anticipated expenses for the month of April, including office rent, equipment rent, health insurance, and maintenance. Although payroll was typically paid out every two weeks, Watman caused payroll withdrawals to be made from Childrens Dental's bank account on March 10, 1999 and March 18, 1999 (the day after the original date of the receivership hearing). On March 19, 1999, on the advice of counsel, Watman sent a letter of resignation to Michael Dana Rosen, counsel for Childrens Dental, terminating his employment immediately. On March 22, 1999, Watman filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. On March 24, 1999, Childrens Dental filed its Chapter 11 petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> At the time that these petitions were filed, Watman was the sole officer and director of Childrens Dental. At the time of filing, Childrens Dental had cash in bank accounts in the amount of approximately $ 30,000 and accounts receivable of about $ 69,000. These assets were disclosed in the bankruptcy schedules and turned over to the bankruptcy trustee. On or about March 25, 1999, Watman informed Lowell Doctors Park,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> from whom Childrens Dental was renting its office space, that Childrens Dental would be terminating its occupancy of the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From March 24, 1999 through March 31, 1999, Watman operated a dental practice under his own name at the office space that had been occupied by Childrens Dental at 75 Arcand Drive, in Lowell, Massachusetts (75 Arcand Drive location), using the same furniture and equipment that Childrens Dental had used. Watman offered the employees of Childrens Dental positions in his practice on the same terms as Childrens Dental was employing them. Then, on March 31, 1999, Lowell Dentistry for Children, P.C. (\"Lowell Dentistry\") was incorporated and began operations out of the same 75 Arcand Drive location. The corporate documentation to form Lowell Dentistry had been prepared in January 1999 by the law firm of Devine, Millimet &amp; Branch. Childrens Dental paid the cost of these services from a retainer that it had paid to that firm. Watman became, and continues to be, the president, sole shareholder and director of Lowell Dentistry. Most of Childrens Dental's 3000 patients became patients of Lowell Dentistry when Childrens Dental ceased operating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 27, 1999, Groman filed a complaint, alleging, inter alia, that Watman's actions warranted a denial of his discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2) and (a)(7). Watman subsequently moved to dismiss Groman's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 7012 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That motion was granted by the bankruptcy court. On appeal, the BAP reversed the bankruptcy court's dismissal of the &#167; 727 objections to discharge and remanded for a trial on the merits. After trial, the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of Watman. On appeal, the BAP affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court. Groman appealed, and we vacated the judgment of the bankruptcy court in <i>Watman I.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Watman I</i> and subsequent procedural history</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the bankruptcy court proceedings and on appeal, Groman argued that Watman's transfer of the assets of Childrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry&#8212;including patient records, office space, equipment, and employees&#8212;\"shifted all the goodwill of Childrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry, stripped Childrens Dental of its aggregate value as a going concern, and eliminated its ability to generate income for the estate, leaving Groman with an empty shell at Childrens Dental (save approximately $ 99,000 in cash and accounts receivable[]) against which to pursue collection of his $437,918 judgment.\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 9. For his part, Watman argued that he formed Lowell Dentistry to preserve the assets of Childrens Dental so that he could pay the debts to Groman, and explained that he did so relying on advice of counsel. The bankruptcy court, noting that Watman did not conceal his actions and emphasizing Watman's claim that he relied on counsel's advice, initially concluded that Groman had not established Watman's \"intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the bankruptcy court's reasoning, we found it problematic and incomplete in several respects. We noted that Watman's claim that he formed Lowell Dentistry to preserve the assets of Childrens Dental \"was never memorialized in writing, is not in any way referenced in any written memoranda, and was not reported in Childrens Dental's bankruptcy schedules.\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 9. We also observed that the bankruptcy court had not accounted for the fact that the assets of Childrens Dental were transferred to Lowell Dentistry without consideration, and had not considered whether several other indicia of fraud were evident in this case. <i>See id.</i> at 12-13. We therefore remanded the case for further findings. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the bankruptcy court held a status conference at which the parties agreed that no further evidence was needed to make the findings on remand. The bankruptcy court gave the parties an opportunity to submit further proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. After reviewing those submissions and the record, the bankruptcy court found in favor of Groman on Count II of his complaint, denying Watman a discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(7).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On appeal, the BAP found that the bankruptcy court addressed some, but not all, of the points mentioned in our <i>Watman I</i> decision and thus remanded for additional findings. The bankruptcy court supplemented its findings but came to the same conclusion.

The bankruptcy court, in its initial decision, concluded that there \"was no transfer here in the customary sense\" and that \"transfers, if they did take place at all, were not of the formal legal title nature, and to the extent that patients' files, records, et cetera, are property of the estate . . . they haven't been transferred.\" In <i>Watman I,</i> we concluded that this analysis was inadequate. 301 F.3d at 10. Specifically, we questioned whether the bankruptcy court applied the correct definition of \"transfer\" in its analysis, noting that bankruptcy law defines \"transfer\" broadly to include a transfer of possession, custody, or control even if there is no transfer of legal title. <i>See Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 10 (discussing the legislative history of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(54), which defines \"transfer\" (citing S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong. 27 (1978), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5813)); <i>see also Martin v. Bajgar</i> (<i>In re Bajgar</i>), 104 F.3d 495, 498 (1st Cir.1997) (noting the broad definition of \"transfer\" in bankruptcy law). We explained that the bankruptcy court should have determined whether \"assets such as Childrens Dental's employees, patient files, office space, goodwill and overall going concern value were (a) properly considered property of Childrens Dental such that they would have been included in the estate for the benefit of creditors; and (b) if so, whether they were transferred to Watman or Lowell Dentistry.\" 301 F.3d at 11-12 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the bankruptcy court concluded that Childrens Dental's \"space, patient records, employees, and good will\" were property of Childrens Dental and that they were transferred to Lowell Dentistry. The bankruptcy court noted that Watman \"also used Childrens Dental's funds to prepay expenses that he knew he or a new corporation would incur.\" The bankruptcy court found that the only property not transferred and thus \"remaining in [Childrens Dental's] estate for liquidation by its Chapter 7 Trustee consisted of accounts receivable, an obsolete computer that Lowell Dentistry originally used then stopped using at some point, furnishings, decorations, and a box of dental supplies of unknown value.\" The bankruptcy court concluded that Watman's actions thus harmed Childrens Dental's creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman challenges these findings on two interrelated grounds. First, he argues that the bankruptcy court erred by failing to calculate the specific value of these assets. Second, he argues that the bankruptcy court's finding that Childrens Dental's assets had some value was clearly erroneous. Both of these arguments are specious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Calculating the value of the assets</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court was not required to calculate the precise value of the assets of Childrens Dental in order to determine whether those assets were \"property\" capable of being transferred in this context. The question of whether those assets were \"property\" capable of being transferred depends on whether they are \"`<i>susceptible</i> of having value.'\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 12 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Robinson v. Watts Detective Agency,</i> 685 F.2d 729, 734 (1st Cir.1982)); <i>see also Robinson,</i> 685 F.2d at 734 (explaining that the term \"property\" in the context of transfers is defined generally as \"anything of value&#8212;anything which has debt paying or debt securing power\"); <i>Glosband v. Watts Detective Agency, Inc.,</i> 21 B.R. 963, 971 (D.Mass.1981) (holding that the term \"property\" in the context of transfers should be interpreted \"`most generously' to incorporate anything of value which but for the transfer might have been preserved for the trustee to the ultimate benefit of the bankrupt's creditors\" (quoting <i>Segal v. Rochelle,</i> 382 U.S. 375, 379, 86 S.Ct. 511, 15 L.Ed.2d 428 (1966))). Once the bankruptcy court determined that the assets of Childrens Dental had some value, it did not have to calculate the precise value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Whether Childrens Dental's assets had value</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman essentially argues that the assets of Childrens Dental were valueless. He focuses much of his argument on whether the bankruptcy court properly determined the extent of Childrens Dental's goodwill and going concern value independent of Watman's own practice. We need not reach those arguments, however, because the evidence demonstrates that other assets of Childrens Dental had value. As the district court aptly observed,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman, both as a solo petitioner and as part of Lowell Dentistry, decided to operate at the same location, use the same furniture, equipment and supplies, employ the same employees (including an orthodontist and another dentist), retain the same patient records, and service the same patients as Childrens Dental. Before Watman filed for bankruptcy, he was willing to make monthly payments for these combined Childrens Dental assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>In re Watman,</i> 331 B.R. 502, 511 (D.Mass. 2005) (citations omitted). In addition, as the bankruptcy court noted, Watman \"used Childrens Dental's funds to prepay expenses that he knew he or a new corporation would incur.\" Watman transferred these assets identified by the bankruptcy court precisely because they had value. If Watman had walked away from Childrens Dental, he would have had to expend resources to find a new location for his practice, buy new equipment, hire new employees, find new patients or encourage his old patients to follow him despite changes in location and employees, and develop new patient records or enter into some arrangement to get the old records. Instead, Watman simply transferred by possession these assets of Childrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry. We therefore affirm the bankruptcy court's finding that Childrens Dental's assets had value and that Watman used those assets for his new practice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Given this finding, we conclude that Watman transferred the property of Childrens Dental to Lowell Property within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Section 727 requires a showing of actual intent, not constructive intent. <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 8 (citing 6 <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 727.02[3][a] (L. King ed., 15th ed.2002)). \"Because a debtor rarely gives direct evidence of fraudulent intent, we have recognized that . . . intent to defraud a creditor can be proved by circumstantial evidence.\" <i>Marrama v. Citizens Bank</i> (<i>In re Marrama</i>), 445 F.3d 518, 522 (1st Cir.2006). There are several objective indicia of fraudulent intent:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) insider relationships between the parties; (2) the retention of possession, benefit or use of the property in question; (3) the lack or inadequacy of consideration for the transfer; (4) the financial condition of the party sought to be charged both before and after the transaction at issue; (5) the existence or cumulative effect of the pattern or series of transactions or course of conduct after the incurring of debt, onset of financial difficulties, or pendency or threat of suits by creditors; (6) the general chronology of the events and transactions under inquiry; and (7) an attempt by debtor to keep the transfer a secret.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 8 (citations omitted). We have also recognized that \"`[t]he shifting of assets by the debtor to a corporation wholly controlled by him is another badge of fraud.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Salomon v.

Tully</i> (<i>In re Tully</i>), 818 F.2d 106, 110 (1st Cir.1987). Where the intent issue turns on the credibility and demeanor of the debtor, we typically defer to the bankruptcy court's conclusions. <i>See Palmacci v. Umpierrez,</i> 121 F.3d 781, 785 (1st Cir.1997). The determination of actual intent is a factual finding and, \"[i]n all events, we will affirm the bankruptcy court's findings of fact unless they appear to be clearly erroneous&#8212;that is, unless we are `left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 8 (quoting <i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman asserts that the bankruptcy court ignored his claims that he acted on advice of counsel and did not conceal his actions. We reject that argument. The bankruptcy court did not ignore his claims; it simply found that other indicia of fraud were prevalent in the case. The court noted that Watman \"took virtually all of [Childrens Dental's] assets, tangible and intangible, and transferred them to his new corporation,\" yet paid no consideration for the transfer. The bankruptcy court found that Watman's actions resulted in the diminution and possibly the complete elimination of the value of Childrens Dental as a whole. The court rejected Watman's testimony and the testimony of his attorney that Watman created Lowell Dentistry to \"preserve the value\" of Childrens Dental (on the theory that Lowell Dentistry could purportedly make payments to Childrens Dental) as \"not credible,\" given the lack of any memorialization of such an arrangement. Instead, the court found that Watman created Lowell Dentistry \"to get out from under his and [Childrens Dental's] obligation to Groman.\" The court recognized that \"Watman's actions were not done in secret,\" but concluded that the fact \"[t]hat they were not secretive, however, is not sufficient to overcome the conclusion that they were intended to hinder, delay and defraud Groman.\" These findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

First, Watman argues that the bankruptcy court exceeded the scope of the remand by addressing the fraudulent intent issue. Second, Watman asserts that the court should not have reversed its initial finding that he lacked the requisite intent, particularly in terms of its credibility determination, without hearing additional evidence. These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman insists that the scope of our remand was limited to addressing the issue of the value of the transferred property, precluding reconsideration of the issue of fraudulent intent. However, we specifically noted in our first decision that remand was required because the bankruptcy court had \"left unexamined . . . indicia of fraudulent intent.\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 13. The bankruptcy court properly considered all of the issues that we identified on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also nothing improper in the bankruptcy court's reversal of its findings on the intent issue without hearing any additional evidence. Our concern with its initial decision was the incompleteness of its analysis of the fraudulent intent issue. <i>See id.</i> at 12-13. In addition, we expressed our skepticism of Watman's claim that he formed Lowell Dentistry in order to preserve the assets of Childrens Dental given the lack of any written memorialization of that arrangement. <i>See id.</i> at 8-9. On remand, the bankruptcy court considered all of the indicia of fraud in this case and reevaluated the testimony. Based on its complete analysis, the court reversed its credibility findings and its conclusion that Groman had not established Watman's intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the bankruptcy court's incomplete analysis of the issues in its first decision and our remand \"for adequate findings on these issues,\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 13, the bankruptcy court acted properly in considering all of the evidence and reevaluating its findings accordingly. <i>See Ramey Constr. Co. v. Apache Tribe of Mescalero Reservation,</i> 673 F.2d 315, 318 (10th Cir.1982) (concluding that district court's reconsideration of its findings on remand was proper where appellate court had concluded that the initial findings were inadequate and incomplete); <i>William G. Roe &amp; Co. v. Armour &amp; Co.,</i> 414 F.2d 862, 865 (5th Cir.1969) (concluding that, where the appellate court had remanded for more specific findings, \"it was . . . within the court's power on remand to find that it had been wrong the first time and reverse itself\").

Then, after bankruptcy filings by Watman and Childrens Dental, the case has wound its way up and down the federal court system for the last seven years. With our affirmance here, one portion of this long saga may finally have come to an end&#8212;Watman is not entitled to a discharge of his indebtedness to Groman. The bankruptcy court properly concluded that Watman transferred the property of Childrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry and that he acted with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, in violation of &#167; 727(a)(2). Its approach to our remand was appropriate, and the district court correctly upheld the decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to Rosen's testimony at trial, Groman intended to object to the confirmation of any Chapter 11 plan.

The bankruptcy court dismissed that claim, holding that &#167; 727(a)(2) applies to the fraudulent transfer of property in which the debtor had a direct proprietary interest, not the transfer of the property of a corporation in which the debtor may have derivative interest<i>See Riumbau v. Colodner</i> (<i>In re Colodner</i>), 147 B.R. 90, 93 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1992); <i>see also MCorp Management Solutions, Inc. v. Thurman</i> (<i>In re Thurman</i>), 901 F.2d 839, 841 (10th Cir.1990) (\"Congress intended to limit the reach of &#167; 727(a)(2)(A) only to those transfers of property in which the debtor has a direct proprietary interest.\"). Instead, the bankruptcy court denied the discharge under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(7). A court may deny a debtor's discharge under &#167; 727(a)(7) if the debtor has committed an act specified in &#167; 727(a)(2) in connection with a bankruptcy case \"concerning an insider.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(7). Where the debtor is an individual, the term \"insider\" is defined to include a \"corporation of which the debtor is a director, officer, or person in control.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(31)(A)(iv). In Count II of his complaint, Groman alleged that Childrens Dental is an \"insider\" of Watman and that Watman fraudulently transferred the property of Childrens Dental. As we noted in <i>Watman I,</i> \"[i]n light of Watman's status as sole officer, shareholder, and director of Childrens Dental, Childrens Dental clearly qualifies as an `insider' of Watman for purposes of &#167; 727(a)(7), and Watman does not argue otherwise.\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 8. In challenging Groman's &#167; 727(a)(7) claim on appeal, Watman focuses on whether his actions concerning Childrens Dental are prohibited acts under &#167; 727(a)(2). We thus examine whether Groman has established the elements of &#167; 727(a)(2) with respect to the property of Childrens Dental.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We discuss in more detail our approach to reviewing the bankruptcy court's findings of indicia of fraud in Part II.A.2</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We therefore also affirm the bankruptcy court's finding that Lowell Dentistry's use of these assets harmed the creditors of Childrens Dental.

While the district court observed that a non-competition agreement could support the inference of the goodwill and going concern value of a business independent from the practitioner under certain circumstances, the court also noted that the law on noncompetition agreements in the discharge context is in \"disarray\" and that a finding on this issue was not necessary to support the judgment</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

This is the second time an appeal in this case has come before us. In 1999, creditor Lawrence Groman initiated this adversary proceeding objecting to Watman's discharge.

On appeal, the BAP remanded the case for additional findings, which the bankruptcy court provided, again denying Watman's discharge. Watman filed another appeal, which Groman elected to present to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158(c)(1)(B). The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision. Watman now appeals to us, arguing that the bankruptcy court erred in both its factual findings and its manner of inquiry on remand following our decision in <i>Watman I.</i> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We restate the facts of this case, as described in <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 3-7. Watman, a dentist, joined Childrens Dental Associates of Lowell (\"Childrens Dental\") in April 1988. At that time, Groman, also a dentist, was the sole shareholder, officer, and director of Childrens Dental. The parties agreed that Watman would be given the opportunity to purchase fifty percent of the practice at the end of one year if the two men worked well together. Consistent with that plan, at the end of his first year with Childrens Dental, Watman entered into an agreement to pay Groman on a monthly basis for ten years in exchange for a fifty percent ownership stake in the practice. In 1992, Watman agreed to purchase the other fifty percent of the practice from Groman, and the payment period was extended an additional ten years to cover the other half of the purchase price. Watman made the monthly payments to Groman until September of 1997, when Watman claimed difficulties in making the payments. In response, Groman agreed to reduce the monthly payments from $ 5,600 to $ 3,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman made only two of the reduced monthly payments. In April 1998, Groman filed suit against Watman and Childrens Dental as joint obligors for the remaining balance owed him. On December 14, 1998, Groman obtained a judgment against Watman and Childrens Dental in the amount of $ 437,918 in Middlesex Superior Court. Neither Watman nor Childrens Dental appealed that judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or about March 1999, Groman filed a complaint seeking the appointment of a receiver for Childrens Dental. A hearing on the appointment of a receiver was scheduled for March 17, 1999 but was continued by agreement of counsel to March 24, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 1999, Watman wrote thirty-seven checks from the Childrens Dental checking account, totaling $ 42,011.49. He recorded these transactions in Childrens Dental's books. Of that total, $ 14,702.02 went to prepayments of Childrens Dental's anticipated expenses for the month of April, including office rent, equipment rent, health insurance, and maintenance. Although payroll was typically paid out every two weeks, Watman caused payroll withdrawals to be made from Childrens Dental's bank account on March 10, 1999 and March 18, 1999 (the day after the original date of the receivership hearing). On March 19, 1999, on the advice of counsel, Watman sent a letter of resignation to Michael Dana Rosen, counsel for Childrens Dental, terminating his employment immediately. On March 22, 1999, Watman filed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. On March 24, 1999, Childrens Dental filed its Chapter 11 petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> At the time that these petitions were filed, Watman was the sole officer and director of Childrens Dental. At the time of filing, Childrens Dental had cash in bank accounts in the amount of approximately $ 30,000 and accounts receivable of about $ 69,000. These assets were disclosed in the bankruptcy schedules and turned over to the bankruptcy trustee. On or about March 25, 1999, Watman informed Lowell Doctors Park,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> from whom Childrens Dental was renting its office space, that Childrens Dental would be terminating its occupancy of the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From March 24, 1999 through March 31, 1999, Watman operated a dental practice under his own name at the office space that had been occupied by Childrens Dental at 75 Arcand Drive, in Lowell, Massachusetts (75 Arcand Drive location), using the same furniture and equipment that Childrens Dental had used. Watman offered the employees of Childrens Dental positions in his practice on the same terms as Childrens Dental was employing them. Then, on March 31, 1999, Lowell Dentistry for Children, P.C. (\"Lowell Dentistry\") was incorporated and began operations out of the same 75 Arcand Drive location. The corporate documentation to form Lowell Dentistry had been prepared in January 1999 by the law firm of Devine, Millimet &amp; Branch. Childrens Dental paid the cost of these services from a retainer that it had paid to that firm. Watman became, and continues to be, the president, sole shareholder and director of Lowell Dentistry. Most of Childrens Dental's 3000 patients became patients of Lowell Dentistry when Childrens Dental ceased operating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 27, 1999, Groman filed a complaint, alleging, inter alia, that Watman's actions warranted a denial of his discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2) and (a)(7). Watman subsequently moved to dismiss Groman's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 7012 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That motion was granted by the bankruptcy court. On appeal, the BAP reversed the bankruptcy court's dismissal of the &#167; 727 objections to discharge and remanded for a trial on the merits. After trial, the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of Watman. On appeal, the BAP affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court. Groman appealed, and we vacated the judgment of the bankruptcy court in <i>Watman I.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Watman I</i> and subsequent procedural history</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the bankruptcy court proceedings and on appeal, Groman argued that Watman's transfer of the assets of Childrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry&#8212;including patient records, office space, equipment, and employees&#8212;\"shifted all the goodwill of Childrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry, stripped Childrens Dental of its aggregate value as a going concern, and eliminated its ability to generate income for the estate, leaving Groman with an empty shell at Childrens Dental (save approximately $ 99,000 in cash and accounts receivable[]) against which to pursue collection of his $437,918 judgment.\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 9. For his part, Watman argued that he formed Lowell Dentistry to preserve the assets of Childrens Dental so that he could pay the debts to Groman, and explained that he did so relying on advice of counsel. The bankruptcy court, noting that Watman did not conceal his actions and emphasizing Watman's claim that he relied on counsel's advice, initially concluded that Groman had not established Watman's \"intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the bankruptcy court's reasoning, we found it problematic and incomplete in several respects. We noted that Watman's claim that he formed Lowell Dentistry to preserve the assets of Childrens Dental \"was never memorialized in writing, is not in any way referenced in any written memoranda, and was not reported in Childrens Dental's bankruptcy schedules.\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 9. We also observed that the bankruptcy court had not accounted for the fact that the assets of Childrens Dental were transferred to Lowell Dentistry without consideration, and had not considered whether several other indicia of fraud were evident in this case. <i>See id.</i> at 12-13. We therefore remanded the case for further findings. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the bankruptcy court held a status conference at which the parties agreed that no further evidence was needed to make the findings on remand. The bankruptcy court gave the parties an opportunity to submit further proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. After reviewing those submissions and the record, the bankruptcy court found in favor of Groman on Count II of his complaint, denying Watman a discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(7).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On appeal, the BAP found that the bankruptcy court addressed some, but not all, of the points mentioned in our <i>Watman I</i> decision and thus remanded for additional findings. The bankruptcy court supplemented its findings but came to the same conclusion. Watman filed another appeal, which Groman elected to present to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158(c)(1)(B). The district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court. This second appeal to us ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the bankruptcy court's conclusions of law <i>de novo</i> and its factual findings for clear error. <i>See Davis v.

Watman also argues that the bankruptcy court erred in its approach to the inquiry on remand by reversing some of its initial factual findings without hearing additional evidence and exceeding the scope of remand.

The bankruptcy court, in its initial decision, concluded that there \"was no transfer here in the customary sense\" and that \"transfers, if they did take place at all, were not of the formal legal title nature, and to the extent that patients' files, records, et cetera, are property of the estate . . . they haven't been transferred.\" In <i>Watman I,</i> we concluded that this analysis was inadequate. 301 F.3d at 10. Specifically, we questioned whether the bankruptcy court applied the correct definition of \"transfer\" in its analysis, noting that bankruptcy law defines \"transfer\" broadly to include a transfer of possession, custody, or control even if there is no transfer of legal title. <i>See Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 10 (discussing the legislative history of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(54), which defines \"transfer\" (citing S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong. 27 (1978), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5813)); <i>see also Martin v.

We explained that the bankruptcy court should have determined whether \"assets such as Childrens Dental's employees, patient files, office space, goodwill and overall going concern value were (a) properly considered property of Childrens Dental such that they would have been included in the estate for the benefit of creditors; and (b) if so, whether they were transferred to Watman or Lowell Dentistry.\" 301 F.3d at 11-12 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the bankruptcy court concluded that Childrens Dental's \"space, patient records, employees, and good will\" were property of Childrens Dental and that they were transferred to Lowell Dentistry. The bankruptcy court noted that Watman \"also used Childrens Dental's funds to prepay expenses that he knew he or a new corporation would incur.\" The bankruptcy court found that the only property not transferred and thus \"remaining in [Childrens Dental's] estate for liquidation by its Chapter 7 Trustee consisted of accounts receivable, an obsolete computer that Lowell Dentistry originally used then stopped using at some point, furnishings, decorations, and a box of dental supplies of unknown value.\" The bankruptcy court concluded that Watman's actions thus harmed Childrens Dental's creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman challenges these findings on two interrelated grounds. First, he argues that the bankruptcy court erred by failing to calculate the specific value of these assets. Second, he argues that the bankruptcy court's finding that Childrens Dental's assets had some value was clearly erroneous. Both of these arguments are specious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

The question of whether those assets were \"property\" capable of being transferred depends on whether they are \"`<i>susceptible</i> of having value.'\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 12 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Robinson v.

He focuses much of his argument on whether the bankruptcy court properly determined the extent of Childrens Dental's goodwill and going concern value independent of Watman's own practice. We need not reach those arguments, however, because the evidence demonstrates that other assets of Childrens Dental had value. As the district court aptly observed,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman, both as a solo petitioner and as part of Lowell Dentistry, decided to operate at the same location, use the same furniture, equipment and supplies, employ the same employees (including an orthodontist and another dentist), retain the same patient records, and service the same patients as Childrens Dental. Before Watman filed for bankruptcy, he was willing to make monthly payments for these combined Childrens Dental assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>In re Watman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1824613\"><a href=\"/opinion/1824613/in-re-watman/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 511 (D.Mass. 2005) (citations omitted). In addition, as the bankruptcy court noted, Watman \"used Childrens Dental's funds to prepay expenses that he knew he or a new corporation would incur.\" Watman transferred these assets identified by the bankruptcy court precisely because they had value. If Watman had walked away from Childrens Dental, he would have had to expend resources to find a new location for his practice, buy new equipment, hire new employees, find new patients or encourage his old patients to follow him despite changes in location and employees, and develop new patient records or enter into some arrangement to get the old records. Instead, Watman simply transferred by possession these assets of Childrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry. We therefore affirm the bankruptcy court's finding that Childrens Dental's assets had value and that Watman used those assets for his new practice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Given this finding, we conclude that Watman transferred the property of Childrens Dental to Lowell Property within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(2)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Section 727 requires a showing of actual intent, not constructive intent. <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 8 (citing 6 <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 727.02[3][a] (L.

We reject that argument. The bankruptcy court did not ignore his claims; it simply found that other indicia of fraud were prevalent in the case. The court noted that Watman \"took virtually all of [Childrens Dental's] assets, tangible and intangible, and transferred them to his new corporation,\" yet paid no consideration for the transfer. The bankruptcy court found that Watman's actions resulted in the diminution and possibly the complete elimination of the value of Childrens Dental as a whole. The court rejected Watman's testimony and the testimony of his attorney that Watman created Lowell Dentistry to \"preserve the value\" of Childrens Dental (on the theory that Lowell Dentistry could purportedly make payments to Childrens Dental) as \"not credible,\" given the lack of any memorialization of such an arrangement. Instead, the court found that Watman created Lowell Dentistry \"to get out from under his and [Childrens Dental's] obligation to Groman.\" The court recognized that \"Watman's actions were not done in secret,\" but concluded that the fact \"[t]hat they were not secretive, however, is not sufficient to overcome the conclusion that they were intended to hinder, delay and defraud Groman.\" These findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

First, Watman argues that the bankruptcy court exceeded the scope of the remand by addressing the fraudulent intent issue. Second, Watman asserts that the court should not have reversed its initial finding that he lacked the requisite intent, particularly in terms of its credibility determination, without hearing additional evidence. These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watman insists that the scope of our remand was limited to addressing the issue of the value of the transferred property, precluding reconsideration of the issue of fraudulent intent. However, we specifically noted in our first decision that remand was required because the bankruptcy court had \"left unexamined . . . indicia of fraudulent intent.\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 13. The bankruptcy court properly considered all of the issues that we identified on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also nothing improper in the bankruptcy court's reversal of its findings on the intent issue without hearing any additional evidence. Our concern with its initial decision was the incompleteness of its analysis of the fraudulent intent issue. <i>See id.</i> at 12-13. In addition, we expressed our skepticism of Watman's claim that he formed Lowell Dentistry in order to preserve the assets of Childrens Dental given the lack of any written memorialization of that arrangement. <i>See id.</i> at 8-9. On remand, the bankruptcy court considered all of the indicia of fraud in this case and reevaluated the testimony. Based on its complete analysis, the court reversed its credibility findings and its conclusion that Groman had not established Watman's intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the bankruptcy court's incomplete analysis of the issues in its first decision and our remand \"for adequate findings on these issues,\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 13, the bankruptcy court acted properly in considering all of the evidence and reevaluating its findings accordingly. <i>See Ramey Constr.

We discern no error in the bankruptcy court's approach or its conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal dispute between these parties began with state court proceedings in 1998, which produced a judgment for Groman against Watman and Childrens Dental in the amount of $ 437,918. Then, after bankruptcy filings by Watman and Childrens Dental, the case has wound its way up and down the federal court system for the last seven years. With our affirmance here, one portion of this long saga may finally have come to an end&#8212;Watman is not entitled to a discharge of his indebtedness to Groman. The bankruptcy court properly concluded that Watman transferred the property of Childrens Dental to Lowell Dentistry and that he acted with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, in violation of &#167; 727(a)(2). Its approach to our remand was appropriate, and the district court correctly upheld the decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to Rosen's testimony at trial, Groman intended to object to the confirmation of any Chapter 11 plan.

The bankruptcy court dismissed that claim, holding that &#167; 727(a)(2) applies to the fraudulent transfer of property in which the debtor had a direct proprietary interest, not the transfer of the property of a corporation in which the debtor may have derivative interest<i>See Riumbau v. Colodner</i> (<i>In re Colodner</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1806649\"><a href=\"/opinion/1806649/in-re-colodner/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 93 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1992); <i>see also MCorp Management Solutions, Inc. v. Thurman</i> (<i>In re Thurman</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540117\"><a href=\"/opinion/540117/in-re-ca-thurman-debtor-mcorp-management-solutions-inc-v-ca/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span>, 841 (10th Cir.1990) (\"Congress intended to limit the reach of &#167; 727(a)(2)(A) only to those transfers of property in which the debtor has a direct proprietary interest.\"). Instead, the bankruptcy court denied the discharge under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(7). A court may deny a debtor's discharge under &#167; 727(a)(7) if the debtor has committed an act specified in &#167; 727(a)(2) in connection with a bankruptcy case \"concerning an insider.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727(a)(7). Where the debtor is an individual, the term \"insider\" is defined to include a \"corporation of which the debtor is a director, officer, or person in control.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(31)(A)(iv). In Count II of his complaint, Groman alleged that Childrens Dental is an \"insider\" of Watman and that Watman fraudulently transferred the property of Childrens Dental. As we noted in <i>Watman I,</i> \"[i]n light of Watman's status as sole officer, shareholder, and director of Childrens Dental, Childrens Dental clearly qualifies as an `insider' of Watman for purposes of &#167; 727(a)(7), and Watman does not argue otherwise.\" <i>Watman I,</i> 301 F.3d at 8. In challenging Groman's &#167; 727(a)(7) claim on appeal, Watman focuses on whether his actions concerning Childrens Dental are prohibited acts under &#167; 727(a)(2). We thus examine whether Groman has established the elements of &#167; 727(a)(2) with respect to the property of Childrens Dental.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We discuss in more detail our approach to reviewing the bankruptcy court's findings of indicia of fraud in Part II.A.2</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We therefore also affirm the bankruptcy court's finding that Lowell Dentistry's use of these assets harmed the creditors of Childrens Dental. Watman's sole basis for challenging this finding is his contention that the assets of Childrens Dental had no value. We have rejected that claim and thus find no merit in Watman's argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Because we affirm the bankruptcy court's conclusions on the basis of the findings mentioned above, we do not reach Watman's challenge to the bankruptcy court's finding that a noncompetition agreement between Watman and Childrens Dental was evidence of the independent value of Childrens Dental. While the district court observed that a non-competition agreement could support the inference of the goodwill and going concern value of a business independent from the practitioner under certain circumstances, the court also noted that the law on noncompetition agreements in the discharge context is in \"disarray\" and that a finding on this issue was not necessary to support the judgment</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
