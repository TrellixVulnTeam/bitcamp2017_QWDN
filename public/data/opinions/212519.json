Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH, Chief Judge.     On October 15, 2009, FirstBank\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc. (\"FirstBank\") brought claims against various\n\ndefendants under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n\n1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), Securities Exchange Commission Rule\n\n10b-5, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and Puerto Rico law.        FirstBank\n\nalleged that it held a warrant that gave it a right to acquire 15%\n\nof the common voting stock of Instituto de Banca y Comercio, Inc.\n\n(\"IBC\"), and that defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to\n\ndeprive FirstBank of this interest when they participated in the\n\nsale of all outstanding shares of IBC's stock to Leeds Equity\n\nPartners IV, LP (\"Leeds\") as part of a merger on March 15, 2007.\n\nThe alleged key to this fraudulent scheme was defendants' failure\n\nto provide FirstBank with notice and details of the sale and\n\nmerger, depriving FirstBank of the opportunity to participate and\n\nredeem the value of its 15% stake in the company.    FirstBank named\n\nas defendants IBC, its president and principal shareholder, and\n\nseveral employee shareholders; Leeds, its general partner, and one\n\nof its agents; and a transitional holding company.\n\n           The district court held that the federal suit was time-\n\nbarred by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's two-year statute of limitations,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1658(b)(1), and granted the defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss.   FirstBank P.R., Inc. v. Instituto de Banca y Comerico,\n\nInc., 708 F. Supp. 2d 188, 195 (D.P.R. 2010).   The court dismissed\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fwithout prejudice FirstBank's pendent claims under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.   Id.\n\n             FirstBank appeals, arguing primarily that the Supreme\n\nCourt's subsequent decision in Merck & Co., Inc. v. Reynolds, 130\n\nS. Ct. 1784 (2010), requires that we reverse the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.    Because it is clear that FirstBank's federal suit\n\nis time-barred and Merck does not alter the analysis that the\n\ndistrict court used, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n             Our review of a dismissal of a complaint on statute of\n\nlimitations grounds is de novo.    Santana-Castro v. Toledo-Dávila,\n\n579 F.3d 109, 113 (1st Cir. 2009).      We will affirm the dismissal\n\n\"when the pleader's allegations 'leave no doubt that an asserted\n\nclaim is time-barred.'\"    Gorelik v. Costin, 605 F.3d 118, 121 (1st\n\nCir. 2010) (quoting LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d\n\n507, 509 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n             Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1658(b), a claim under Section\n\n10(b) and Rule 10b-5 must \"be brought not later than the earlier\n\nof--(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the\n\nviolation; or (2) 5 years after such violation.\"     Id.   In Merck,\n\nthe Supreme Court clarified the meaning of the term \"discovery\" in\n\nthe first prong of this provision, holding that \"a cause of action\n\naccrues (1) when the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a\n\nreasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, 'the facts\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fconstituting the violation'--whichever comes first.\"     Merck, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 1789-90.      The Court also clarified that the facts\n\nconstituting the violation include \"facts showing scienter.\"    Id.\n\nat 1796.\n\n           Although this case does not require a lengthy explanation\n\nof the complex background facts, FirstBank's previous involvement\n\nin Puerto Rico court litigation with IBC is relevant.    On October\n\n5, 2007, FirstBank filed a motion in Puerto Rico court seeking to\n\ncompel IBC to produce a complete version of the merger agreement.1\n\nThis litigation is relevant as it demonstrates that FirstBank had\n\nactual notice of the merger and possessed part of the merger\n\nagreement before the trigger date for the statute of limitations in\n\nthis case; FirstBank does not contest this, and in fact admits that\n\nit knew of the merger and possessed an incomplete version of the\n\nmerger agreement by the summer of 2007. This litigation also makes\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          FirstBank filed its motion as part of an ongoing Puerto\nRico court action against IBC and its president and principal\nshareholder.    In that action, initiated on November 9, 2005,\nFirstBank alleged that the defendants had engaged in a longstanding\nfraudulent scheme to exclude FirstBank as a holder of a contractual\nright to become a shareholder for less than adequate consideration.\nFirstBank had some measure of success. On December 20, 2006, the\ncourt entered a partial judgment in FirstBank's favor, holding that\nFirstBank had effectively exercised its warrant on March 17, 2004\nand ordering IBC to issue the corresponding stock to FirstBank. On\nAugust 24, 2007, the Commonwealth Court of Appeals affirmed this\njudgment and recognized the atypical nature of a March 18, 2004\nsale of IBC stock by IBC's president to a group of IBC employees--a\nsale that would have allowed IBC to call the warrant, terminating\nFirstBank's purchase rights under it.\n\n                                -4-\n\fclear that FirstBank had actual notice of what it considered to be\n\na fraudulent scheme and defendants' scienter.\n\n            At the moment that FirstBank first knew of the merger, it\n\nnecessarily also knew that it had not been told of the merger\n\nearlier.    As the district court cogently held:\n\n            FirstBank knew prior to October 5, 2007, that\n            Defendants had executed the Merger Agreement\n            and that [they] had not given FirstBank notice\n            of said transaction. By that date, FirstBank\n            was aware that Defendants purposely avoided\n            FirstBank's participation in the Merger.\n            Moreover, FirstBank knew that its Warrant had\n            not been redeemed prior to the Merger.\n\nFirstBank, 708 F. Supp. 2d at 194 (emphasis added).          Those are the\n\nfacts that underlie the alleged fraud at issue here.\n\n            FirstBank argues that until it received a complete and\n\nunredacted version of the merger agreement on October 17, 2007, it\n\ndid not have full knowledge of all the facts that provided the\n\nbasis of its suit.       But it does not argue that it could not have\n\nsought and received the complete agreement earlier.               And in any\n\nevent, such an argument would not be germane, as it is clear that\n\nFirstBank had actual notice of the merger and events that it\n\nthought were fraudulent before October 15, 2007.\n\n            FirstBank also argues that the district court dismissed\n\nits claims on the basis of an \"inquiry notice\" standard for\n\ndiscovery   that   was   rejected   by    the   Supreme   Court   in   Merck.\n\nFirstBank points to the Court's explanation that when determining\n\nthe time at which the discovery of the relevant facts occurred,\n\n                                    -5-\n\f\"terms such as 'inquiry notice' and 'storm warnings' may be useful\n\nto the extent that they identify a time when the facts would have\n\nprompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating,\"\n\nbut that \"the limitations period does not begin to run until the\n\nplaintiff thereafter discovers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff\n\nwould have discovered 'the facts constituting the violation.'\"\n\nMerck, 130 S. Ct. at 1798.\n\n          FirstBank's reliance on Merck is misplaced.    The case\n\nbefore us is not about constructive discovery, nor is it about\n\n\"storm warnings\" or \"inquiry notice\" (although the district court\n\ndid use that language in referring to the Puerto Rico court\n\nfindings). Rather, this case involves FirstBank's actual notice of\n\nthe facts constituting the defendants' alleged Section 10(b) and\n\nRule 10b-5 violations, including scienter, and its failure, for\n\nwhatever reason, to file suit within two years.      The district\n\ncourt's grant of the defendants' motion to dismiss did not run\n\nafoul of Merck.\n\n                               II.\n\n          As FirstBank's own allegations leave no doubt that its\n\nsuit is time-barred, the judgment of dismissal is affirmed.   See\n\nGorelik, 605 F.3d at 121.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",

Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197923\"><a href=\"/opinion/197923/lachapelle-v-berkshire-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 509 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1658(b), a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 must \"be brought not later than the earlier of (1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation; or (2) 5 years after such violation.\" <i>Id.</i> In <i>Merck,</i> the Supreme Court clarified the meaning of the term \"discovery\" in the first prong of this provision, holding that \"a cause of action accrues (1) when the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, `the facts constituting the violation' whichever comes first.\" <i>Merck,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1789-90. The Court also clarified that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> the facts constituting the violation include \"facts showing scienter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1796.</p>\n<p>Although this case does not require a lengthy explanation of the complex background facts, FirstBank's previous involvement in Puerto Rico court litigation with IBC is relevant. On October 5, 2007, FirstBank filed a motion in Puerto Rico court seeking to compel IBC to produce a complete version of the merger agreement.<sup>[1]</sup> This litigation is relevant as it demonstrates that FirstBank had actual notice of the merger and possessed part of the merger agreement before the trigger date for the statute of limitations in this case; FirstBank does not contest this, and in fact admits that it knew of the merger and possessed an incomplete version of the merger agreement by the summer of 2007. This litigation also makes clear that FirstBank had actual notice of what it considered to be a fraudulent scheme and defendants' scienter.</p>\n<p>At the moment that FirstBank first knew of the merger, it necessarily also knew that it had not been told of the merger earlier. As the district court cogently held:</p>\n<blockquote>FirstBank <i>knew</i> prior to October 5, 2007, that Defendants had executed the Merger Agreement and that [they] had not given FirstBank notice of said transaction. By that date, FirstBank <i>was aware</i> that Defendants purposely avoided FirstBank's participation in the Merger. Moreover, FirstBank <i>knew</i> that its Warrant had not been redeemed prior to the Merger. <i>FirstBank,</i> 708 F.Supp.2d at 194 (emphasis added). Those are the facts that underlie the alleged fraud at issue here.</blockquote>\n<p>FirstBank argues that until it received a complete and unredacted version of the merger agreement on October 17, 2007, it did not have full knowledge of all the facts that provided the basis of its suit. But it does not argue that it could not have sought and received the complete agreement earlier. And in any event, such an argument would not be germane, as it is clear that FirstBank had actual notice of the merger and events that it thought were fraudulent before October 15, 2007.</p>\n<p>FirstBank also argues that the district court dismissed its claims on the basis of an \"inquiry notice\" standard for discovery that was rejected by the Supreme Court in <i>Merck.</i> FirstBank points to the Court's explanation that when determining the time at which the discovery of the relevant facts occurred, \"terms such as `inquiry notice' and `storm warnings' may be useful to the extent that they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating,\" but that \"the limitations period does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered `the facts constituting the violation.'\" <i>Merck,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1798.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> FirstBank's reliance on <i>Merck</i> is misplaced. The case before us is not about constructive discovery, nor is it about \"storm warnings\" or \"inquiry notice\" (although the district court did use that language in referring to the Puerto Rico court findings). Rather, this case involves FirstBank's actual notice of the facts constituting the defendants' alleged Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 violations, including scienter, and its failure, for whatever reason, to file suit within two years. The district court's grant of the defendants' motion to dismiss did not run afoul of <i>Merck.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>As FirstBank's own allegations leave no doubt that its suit is time-barred, the judgment of dismissal is affirmed. <i>See </i><i>Gorelik,</i> 605 F.3d at 121.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  FirstBank filed its motion as part of an ongoing Puerto Rico court action against IBC and its president and principal shareholder. In that action, initiated on November 9, 2005, FirstBank alleged that the defendants had engaged in a longstanding fraudulent scheme to exclude FirstBank as a holder of a contractual right to become a shareholder for less than adequate consideration. FirstBank had some measure of success. On December 20, 2006, the court entered a partial judgment in FirstBank's favor, holding that FirstBank had effectively exercised its warrant on March 17, 2004 and ordering IBC to issue the corresponding stock to FirstBank. On August 24, 2007, the Commonwealth Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment and recognized the atypical nature of a March 18, 2004 sale of IBC stock by IBC's president to a group of IBC employeesa sale that would have allowed IBC to call the warrant, terminating FirstBank's purchase rights under it.</p>\n\n</div>",
