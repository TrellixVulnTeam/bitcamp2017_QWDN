This diversity action originally\n\nwas brought by MRCo, Inc.1 (“MRCo”) against Banco Popular de Puerto\n\nRico, Inc. (“Banco Popular”).         MRCo later amended its complaint to\n\nname the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico (“Commissioner”) as\n\nan additional defendant.2        After MRCo and Banco Popular reached a\n\nsettlement and all claims between them were dismissed, MRCo moved\n\nfor   partial      summary   judgment       on   its        claims   against    the\n\nCommissioner.      The district court denied MRCo’s motion, and then\n\ndismissed the entire case on the ground that MRCo’s claims are\n\nbarred by Puerto Rico law. This timely appeal followed, and we now\n\nconsider whether MRCo’s claims should be resurrected.\n\n           I.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n           Plaintiff-appellant MRCo is a corporation organized and\n\nexisting   under    the   laws   of   the   State      of    Maryland,   with   its\n\nprincipal place of business in the District of Columbia.                   Former\n\ndefendant Banco Popular is a banking organization incorporated\n\nunder the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with its\n\nprincipal place of business in Puerto Rico.                   Defendant-appellee\n\nCommissioner is the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico, and is\n\n\n\n      1\n       The record reflects that MRCo’s parent corporation, ULLICO\nInc., undertook at least some of the actions that preceded this\nlitigation. For simplicity, however, we refer to MRCo and ULLICO\ncollectively as “MRCo.”\n      2\n      At the time MRCo amended its Complaint, the Commissioner was\nFermin Contreras Gómez.    He was succeeded by Dorelisse Juarbe-\nJimenez, who replaced him as co-defendant in March 2004.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fnamed solely in her capacity as liquidator of the Plan de Salud de\n\nla Federación de Maestros de Puerto Rico (“the Plan”)3.        The Plan\n\nis a nonprofit corporation which functions as a health service\n\norganization under the Insurance Code of Puerto Rico.         See P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 1901 et seq. (2005).           The Plan provides\n\ninsurance coverage to teachers, government employees, and certain\n\nprivate organizations.\n\n          In 2000, the Commissioner audited the Plan for the period\n\ncovering January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999.      As a result of\n\nthe audit, on October 11, 2000, the Commissioner notified the Plan\n\nthat there was a shortfall in the latter’s assets of approximately\n\n$13.2 million.    The Commissioner ordered the Plan to identify\n\nsufficient   assets   to   cover   the   shortfall   within   90   days.\n\nSubsequently, the Commissioner amended his audit report to reflect\n\nan actual shortfall of $13,516,725, which amount was confirmed at\n\na hearing before the Commissioner on December 13, 2000.             The\n\nCommissioner gave the Plan until February 28, 2001 to submit\n\nevidence that the shortfall had been covered; otherwise, the Plan\n\nwould be considered insolvent and placed into liquidation.\n\n          With the alleged overt support of the Commissioner the\n\nPlan solicited a loan from MRCo, the terms of which called for the\n\nPlan to borrow $13,516,725 pursuant to a Surplus Note Agreement\n\n\n\n     3\n       Translated, the name is “Health Plan for the Teachers\nFederation of Puerto Rico.”\n\n                                   -3-\n\f(“Surplus Note”).       MRCo and the Plan agreed to establish an escrow\n\naccount at Banco Popular, with Banco Popular acting as escrow\n\nagent, that would be used to disburse the loaned funds to the Plan.\n\n               The Surplus Note provided that the loan would be executed\n\nand     the    funds   disbursed   only        after   the   Plan   secured    the\n\nCommissioner’s express written approval of the loan transaction.\n\nThis condition reflected Puerto Rico’s statutory requirement that\n\nthe   Commissioner      give   prior     approval      before   a   surplus   loan\n\ntransaction is entered into by a Puerto Rico insurer.                   See P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 26, § 2930.         On March 21, 2001, in response to the\n\nPlan’s request for approval, the Commissioner sent to the Plan a\n\nletter which stated, in relevant part:\n\n               After evaluating the loan agreement and\n               certificate in the light of Articles 29,300\n               and 29,310 of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code,\n               we approve them, subject to your submitting\n               the duly signed originals of the loan\n               certificate and agreement with the corporate\n               seal of each corporation.\n\n               The letter contained additional requirements, including\n\nthe submission of a sworn statement by the chairmen of the Plan and\n\nMRCo that the loan agreement had been executed and implemented.\n\nMRCo alleges that this letter, specifically the portion excerpted\n\nabove,    as    well   as   statements    made    by   the   Commissioner,    were\n\nunderstood by both MRCo and the Plan to constitute approval of the\n\nloan.    The Commissioner, on the other hand, alleges that the loan\n\nwas never approved, and points to an internal file memorandum dated\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fApril    2,   2001    that   the   Commissioner    claims   contemporaneously\n\nrecorded that the letter expressed only approval of the form of the\n\nloan documentation - not approval of the loan itself.\n\n              In any event, MRCo and the Plan executed the Surplus Note\n\nand accompanying loan certificate on March 26, 2001.              On the same\n\ndate, MRCo entered into an escrow agreement (“Escrow Agreement”)\n\nwith Banco Popular establishing the terms under which the funds\n\nwould be available and used in accordance with the Surplus Note.\n\nMRCo deposited $13,516,725 in the escrow account and, almost\n\nimmediately, Banco Popular made several disbursements to the Plan,\n\ntotaling approximately $3.6 million, as well as a payment of\n\n$400,000 to itself on behalf of the Plan to cover an overdraft in\n\na Plan bank account, and $5,000 to itself as the fee for acting as\n\nescrow agent.        After the disbursements, approximately $8.8 million\n\nremained in escrow.4\n\n              On March 30, 2001, only days after the execution of the\n\nSurplus Note and Escrow Agreement, the Commissioner filed a sworn\n\npetition      to   the   Puerto    Rico    Court   of   First   Instance   (the\n\n“Liquidation Court”) to place the Plan into liquidation, and\n\n\n\n     4\n       The record appears to contain slight inconsistencies as to\nhow much money was disbursed from the escrow account. The precise\namounts, whatever they may actually be, are immaterial to our\ndecision. While the Liquidation Court has apparently reserved the\nprecise amount of $3,612,577 until this federal case is concluded,\nit is enough for the present purposes to record that MRCo is\nseeking to recover the approximately $3.6 million that was\ndisbursed to the Plan.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdeclared    therein   that    the    Plan   had    an   operating   deficit   of\n\n$13,516,725 (the exact amount of the loan).             The Liquidation Court\n\nissued an ex parte order provisionally placing the Plan into\n\nliquidation, which order was confirmed on May 25, 2001.\n\n            After it learned that the Plan had been placed into\n\nliquidation, MRCo demanded that Banco Popular return all of the\n\nfunds remaining in the escrow account.              Instead of returning the\n\nfunds, however, Banco Popular, at the apparent behest of the\n\nCommissioner, deposited the remaining funds in escrow in the\n\nregistry of the Liquidation Court, effectively denying MRCo access\n\nto the funds.      Also at about the same time, in a filing with the\n\nLiquidation Court, the Commissioner stated that he “never gave the\n\napproval to the loan transaction, which is a requirement of the\n\nInsurance   Code    for   a   loan   without      guarantee   of   the   assets.”\n\n            On July 3, 2001, MRCo filed its diversity action against\n\nBanco Popular in the District of Columbia, alleging that the loan\n\ncontract was never validly executed, since the Commissioner never\n\napproved the transaction as required by Puerto Rico law.                 Since no\n\nloan existed, MRCo alleged, the Plan never acquired any right,\n\ntitle, or interest in any of the funds that had been placed in\n\nescrow.     Thus, according to MRCo, Banco Popular had a duty to\n\nreturn the funds (the $8.8 million) that had remained in escrow to\n\nMRCo.   Banco Popular moved to dismiss the case or to change venue\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fto the District of Puerto Rico.      By order entered October 15, 2001,\n\nthe case was transferred to the District of Puerto Rico.\n\n            Once before the federal court in Puerto Rico, MRCo\n\namended its Complaint to name the Commissioner as an additional\n\ndefendant. Banco Popular once again moved to dismiss, arguing that\n\nthe Commissioner was an indispensable party that could not be added\n\nas a defendant because the pendency of the liquidation proceedings\n\nprecluded   any   action   against   the   Commissioner   as   liquidator,\n\npursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4021.          The district court\n\ndenied the motion on September 9, 2002.       On December 13, 2002, the\n\nCommissioner filed an “informative motion” advising the district\n\ncourt of its Resolution and Decision filed with the Liquidation\n\nCourt that same day, in which the Commissioner concluded that the\n\nfunds that had remained in escrow at Banco Popular at the time of\n\nliquidation were not assets of the Plan and belonged to MRCo.         The\n\nCommissioner purported to conclude, as well, that the approximately\n\n$3.6 million that was disbursed to the Plan prior to liquidation\n\nwas an asset of the Plan and therefore part of the liquidation\n\nestate, notwithstanding the Commissioner’s failure to approve the\n\nloan transaction as required.\n\n            In response to the Commissioner’s acknowledgment that the\n\n$8.8 million that had remained in escrow was not an asset of the\n\nPlan, MRCo moved the district court to order the transfer of the\n\nfunds from the Liquidation Court to the district court pursuant to\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe district court’s removal jurisdiction.              The district court\n\nordered the clerk of the Liquidation Court to transfer the $8.8\n\nmillion,    including    accrued     interest,   to   the    district   court,\n\nwhereupon the funds were paid to MRCo, less amounts paid to resolve\n\na claim against the funds and a sum requested by Banco Popular to\n\ncover its claims for escrow agent fees.\n\n            Eventually, MRCo and Banco Popular reached a settlement\n\nof their claims, and Banco Popular was dismissed from the action.\n\nMRCO and the Commissioner, however, continued to litigate over the\n\nfate of the $3.6 million that was disbursed to the Plan just prior\n\nto the commencement of the liquidation proceedings.                The crux of\n\nMRCo’s claims has always been that the loan to the Plan was never\n\napproved by the Commissioner and thus never actually executed.\n\nSince it was never executed, asserts MRCo, the loan proceeds never\n\nshould have been disbursed to the Plan, and never became an asset\n\nof the Plan.     In the meantime, the Commissioner filed motions on\n\ntwo separate occasions urging the dismissal of MRCo’s claims\n\nagainst    the   Commissioner   on    the   ground    that   the    liquidation\n\nproceeding precluded MRCo’s claims by operation of 26 P.R. Law Ann.\n\n§ 4021, the same ground previously argued (unsuccessfully) by Banco\n\nPopular.    The district court denied both motions.\n\n            MRCo moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that no\n\nlegally cognizable loan had materialized and that, as a result, the\n\napproximately     $3.6   million     disbursed   to    the   Plan    prior   to\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fliquidation never actually became an asset of the Plan and should\n\nbe returned to MRCo.      In its opinion and order on February 20,\n\n2007, from which this appeal is taken, the district court denied\n\nMRCo’s motion on the ground that disputed material facts precluded\n\nsummary judgment, but also dismissed the underlying claims against\n\nthe Commissioner on the ground that P.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021\n\nprecluded actions against the Commissioner during the pendency of\n\nthe proceeding in the Liquidation Court.        MRCo’s timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n            II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            This court’s jurisdiction is limited to final decisions\n\nof the district court.    28 U.S.C. § 1291.   A district court’s order\n\ndenying a motion for summary judgment is interlocutory and thus, in\n\nmost cases, not appealable.    Fletcher v. Town of Clinton, 196 F.3d\n\n41, 45 (1st Cir. 1999).    The order is reviewable, however, if the\n\ndistrict court simultaneously enters final judgment in the case.\n\nSee Swint v. Chambers County Comm’n, 514 U.S. 35, 42–43 (1995).\n\n“[A]n order or judgment is usually considered ‘final’ (hence,\n\nappealable) only when it resolves the contested matter, leaving\n\nnothing to be done except execution of the judgment.”     Petralia v.\n\nAT&T Global Info. Solutions Co., 114 F.3d 352, 354 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting Director, Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs, United States\n\nDep’t of Labor v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 853 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1988)).     Since the district court’s order dismissing all of the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\funderlying claims fully disposed of all the parties’ claims, we\n\nhave appellate jurisdiction under § 1291.\n\n            In a strict sense, the district court committed itself to\n\nthree decisions: it (1) denied MRCo’s motion for summary judgment;\n\n(2) interpreted substantive Puerto Rico law; and (3) dismissed the\n\naction based on its interpretation. Each of these are questions of\n\nlaw and thus subject to de novo review.   See Reich v. Newspapers of\n\nNew England, Inc., 44 F.3d 1060, 1069 (1st Cir. 1995) (“Appeals\n\ninvolving pure questions of law are generally reviewed de novo.”).\n\nBecause we believe the district court properly dismissed MRCo’s\n\nclaims, we need not reach the issue of whether the district court\n\nproperly denied MRCo’s motion for partial summary judgment inasmuch\n\nas the issue is moot.\n\n            III. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n            The district court dismissed MRCo’s claims against the\n\nCommissioner, finding the claims barred by Article 40.210 of the\n\nPuerto Rico Insurance Code (“Article 40.210”).        Article 40.210\n\nprovides:\n\n            Upon issuance of an order appointing a\n            liquidator of a domestic insurer or of an\n            alien insurer domiciled in Puerto Rico, no\n            action at law shall be brought against the\n            insurer or the liquidator, whether in Puerto\n            Rico or elsewhere, nor shall an action of that\n            nature be maintained or entered after issuance\n            of such order.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fP.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021(1).             On its face, the statute\n\nprovides that no “action at law” shall be brought or maintained\n\nagainst   an   insurer    or   liquidator   upon   issuance   of   the    order\n\nappointing the liquidator.         In arguing that its claims are not\n\nbarred, MRCo urges us to adopt one of three alternative, though not\n\nmutually exclusive, interpretations of the statute.\n\n           First, MRCo argues that its claims, being equitable in\n\nnature, are not barred by Article 40.210’s proscription against\n\n“action[s] at law.”      But while this construction appears initially\n\nto follow reasonably from the plain language of Article 40.210, it\n\ndoes not survive closer examination of the statute.                      In its\n\noriginal Spanish, Article 40.210 provides:\n\n           Al emitirse una orden nombrando un liquidador\n           de un asegurador del país o de un asegurador\n           foráneo domiciliado en Puerto Rico, no se\n           radicará ninguna acción judicial contra el\n           asegurador o contra el liquidador, ni en\n           Puerto Rico ni en cualquier otro lugar, ni se\n           mantendrá ni instará una acción de esa\n           naturaleza luego de emitida la orden.\n\n\nP.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021(1) (emphasis added).                 The widely\n\ndisseminated English translation of this section contains what is\n\narguably an important error.       While translated as barring “actions\n\nat law,” Article 40.210 actually and more broadly provides that\n\n“ninguna acción judicial” -- “no judicial action” -- may be brought\n\nor maintained against an insurer or liquidator after issuance of a\n\nliquidation order.       The original Spanish, in other words, makes no\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdistinction between actions at law and at equity, as is possibly\n\nimplied by the translation and argued by MRCo.\n\n           Moreover, the bar on all judicial actions comports with\n\nour understanding of Puerto Rico legal tradition.         While a concept\n\nof “equity” is not entirely absent from Puerto Rico law, Anglo-\n\nSaxon common law, with its traditional distinction between law and\n\nequity, has never been a force in Puerto Rico.          See, e.g., Dalmau\n\nv. Hernandez Saldana, 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 678 (1975).         It is true\n\nthat the Puerto Rico Civil Code provides that “[w]hen there is no\n\nstatute applicable to the case at issue, the court shall decide in\n\naccordance with equity.”      P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 7.       However,\n\nthe “equity” contemplated by the statute is not that developed\n\nthrough application of the common law, but rather that defined by\n\nthe Civil Code.     Dalmau, 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 678.         This latter\n\nconception of equity “means that natural justice, as embodied in\n\nthe   general   principles   of   jurisprudence   and   in   accepted   and\n\nestablished usages and customs, shall be taken into consideration.”\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 7.       This manifestation is sufficiently\n\namorphous that, even if we permitted MRCo its entreaty to equity,\n\nits chance of success on appeal would be uncertain.            But in any\n\nevent, there is no need for us to be sidetracked by this issue\n\nbecause it happens that there is a Puerto Rico statute applicable\n\nto this case - Article 40.210 - and that statute quite plainly\n\nprovides that no judicial action shall be brought or maintained\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fagainst an insurer or liquidator after the issuance of an order\n\nappointing the liquidator.         In short, MRCo’s appeal to equity is a\n\nnonstarter.\n\n            MRCo    next    argues     that     Article    40.210’s      apparent\n\nprohibition of actions against liquidators and insolvent insurers\n\napplies only to actions germane to the liquidation proceeding\n\nitself, i.e. actions involving creditor claims against the assets\n\nof the insurer.     As it claims to be seeking recovery only of its\n\nown assets, rather than any assets of the Plan, MRCo’s position is\n\nthat the prohibition of Article 40.210 is inapplicable. See, e.g.,\n\nMcDonough     Caperton     Shepherd    Group,    Inc.     v.    Acad.   of   Med.,\n\nCleveland,    888   F.2d    1392   (6th   Cir.    1989);       Bryant   v.   United\n\nShoreline Inc. Assurance Servs., N.A., 972 S.W.2d 26 (Tex. 1998);\n\nNova Ins. Group, Inc. v. Florida Dep’t of Ins., 606 So.2d 429 (Fla.\n\nDist. Ct. App. 1992).\n\n            MRCo’s position regarding the application of Article\n\n40.210 to claims involving nonassets may have merit; however, it is\n\nnot for this or any other court, state or federal, to determine in\n\nthe first instance what constitutes an “asset” of the Plan, for\n\npurposes of the liquidation proceedings. The Puerto Rico Insurance\n\nCode provides that, “after a liquidation order . . . the liquidator\n\nshall prepare in duplicate a list of the insurer’s assets.                    This\n\nlist shall be amended or supplemented from time to time, as the\n\nliquidator may determine.”            P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4022(1)\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f(emphasis added). This provision was interpreted, as it applies to\n\nthis very case, by the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals in Comm’r v.\n\nPlan de Salud de la Federacion de Maestros de Puerto Rico, Inc.,\n\nKLCE No. 2001-1111 (June 20, 2002), which arose from a writ of\n\ncertiorari filed by the Commissioner to review certain resolutions\n\nof the Liquidation Court.        The Court of Appeals explained that,\n\nwhile    the   Liquidation   Court    must   approve   any   effort   by   the\n\nCommissioner to “sell, transfer, abandon or in any other manner\n\ndispose of . . . any property of the insurer,” P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n26, § 4018, “it is the competence of the Commissioner to establish\n\nwhich are and, therefore, which are not the assets that constitute\n\nthe capital of the insurer.”         The Plan’s appeal was denied and the\n\nCommissioner ordered to act “pursuant to the faculties delegated on\n\nhim by the Insurance Code, one of which is to determine if the $8.8\n\nmillion form part of the assets of the Plan de Salud de la\n\nFederación     de   Maestros.”       Thus,   after   the   Commissioner    had\n\ndetermined that the $8.8 million that had remained in escrow never\n\nbecame part of the Plan’s assets, the Liquidation Court correctly\n\ndetermined that it lacked jurisdiction over the money and ordered\n\nthe Commissioner to return the funds to MRCo.5\n\n\n     5\n       We are unaware of any decision by the Puerto Rico Supreme\nCourt involving whether the Commissioner, as statutory liquidator,\nhas the authority to determine what constitutes an “asset” of an\ninsurer in liquidation. Therefore, we follow the rule laid down in\nCPC Int’l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess & Surplus Ins. Co., 962 F.2d\n77, 91 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting West v. A.T. & T. Co., 311 U.S.\n223, 237 (1940)), that “[w]here an intermediate appellate court\n\n                                      -14-\n\f            Thus,    we   think   that   MRCo’s     argument   again    is    ably\n\ndispatched by the plain language of the statute, as described\n\nabove.    Even if we do not construe Article 40.210 to apply to every\n\njudicial    action    that    conceivably     may    be   brought,     here   the\n\nCommissioner has determined that the $3.6 million still in dispute\n\nis to be classified as an “asset” of the Plan, and therefore this\n\ncase falls within the prohibition of Article 40.210.6                     Intaco\n\nEquip. Corp. v. Arelis Constr., 142 D.P.R. 648 (1997); see also\n\nCalderon, Rosa-Silva & Vargas v. Commonwealth Ins. Co., 111 D.P.R.\n\n153 (1981).\n\n            MRCo last argues that Puerto Rico cannot, either by\n\nstatute    or   judicial     fiat,   divest   the    federal   court     of    its\n\njurisdiction.     This argument similarly misses the mark because it\n\nis not correct to say, as MRCo suggests, that Puerto Rico has\n\ndivested the federal court of its subject matter jurisdiction over\n\n\nrests its considered judgment upon the rule of law which it\nannounces, that is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not\nto be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by\nother persuasive data that the highest court of the state would\ndecide otherwise.”\n     6\n       MRCo cites to Foster v. Progress Fed. Sav. & Loan, 697 A.2d\n1043 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1997) to show that a liquidation court may\nlack exclusive jurisdiction where, as alleged by MRCo here, funds\nmay have been inadvertently mingled with undisputed assets of an\ninsurer in liquidation. However, Foster is distinguishable because\nit involved a suit not against a liquidator, but rather by a\nliquidator against a bank alleged to have violated a suspension\norder which froze an insurer’s accounts.      Id. at 1044.    More\nimportantly, the suit apparently was not brought in the face of a\nstatute precluding any “judicial actions” against the statutory\nliquidator.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fmatters such as this.     “The jurisdiction of the federal courts -\n\ntheir power to adjudicate - is a grant of authority to them by\n\nCongress.”     Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 308 U.S.\n\n165, 167 (1939).       Once Congress has conferred subject matter\n\njurisdiction on the federal courts, state law cannot expand or\n\ncontract that grant of authority.           See, e.g., Goetzke v. Ferro\n\nCorp., 280 F.3d 766, 779 (7th Cir. 2002); see also Frink Co. v.\n\nErikson, 20 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1927).              In this case, the\n\nfederal diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, conferred subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction on the district court to adjudicate MRCo’s\n\nclaims.      Article 40.210 does nothing to affect that grant of\n\njurisdictional authority.\n\n            Whether there remains a viable cause of action is another\n\nmatter.   When a federal court exercises diversity jurisdiction, it\n\ndoes so as a neutral forum in which to present state law claims.\n\nSee Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 538 (1949).             As\n\nsuch, it must apply applicable substantive state laws to the case\n\nbefore it.    See Umsted v. Umsted, 446 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(applying    Rhode   Island   substantive    law   in   case   premised   on\n\ndiversity jurisdiction); Reyes-Cardona v. J.C. Penney Co., 694 F.2d\n\n894, 896-97 (1st Cir. 1982).      Thus, a federal forum, “when invoked\n\non grounds of diversity of citizenship, cannot give that which [the\n\nstate] has withheld.”         Angel v. Bullington, 330 U.S. 183, 192\n\n(1947). If state substantive law has denied a plaintiff a cause of\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\faction, the district court must dismiss the complaint for failure\n\nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted.             See Goetzke,\n\n280 F.3d at 779.\n\n           In    Goetzke,    the   Seventh   Circuit   Court    of   Appeals\n\nconsidered whether a provision of Indiana law, which gave the state\n\nworker’s compensation board exclusive jurisdiction to determine\n\nwhether   an    employer’s   worker’s   compensation    administrator    or\n\ncarrier “has committed an independent tort in adjusting or settling\n\na claim for compensation,” denied the plaintiff the ability to\n\nassert a remediable tortious interference claim against his former\n\nemployer’s worker’s compensation administrator.         Id. at 779.     The\n\nCourt, after holding that the statute did not deprive the district\n\ncourt of its subject matter jurisdiction, held that the statute did\n\nnot bar the plaintiff’s claim because the defendant compensation\n\nadministrator did not commit the alleged tort “in the context of\n\nadjusting or settling a claim for benefits,” i.e. the claim did not\n\nfall within the purview of the worker’s compensation board’s\n\nexclusive jurisdiction.      Id. at 779.\n\n           Here, given that Article 40.210 precludes any judicial\n\naction from being brought against the Plan or Commissioner, once\n\nthe Commissioner had been appointed as liquidator, the district\n\ncourt appropriately (if only impliedly) dismissed MRCo’s claim for\n\nfailure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6),\n\nrather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).   See, e.g., Goetzke, 280 F.3d at 779 (“If\n\nstate substantive law has denied a plaintiff a remedy for his cause\n\nof action, the district court [sitting in diversity] must dismiss\n\nthe complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\n\ngranted.”).\n\n            To hold that the district court may entertain MRCo’s\n\nclaims would, in effect, create a cause of action for MRCo that is\n\ndenied to citizens of Puerto Rico who are unable to invoke the\n\njurisdiction of the federal courts through diversity.    That being\n\nsaid, our decision does not strand MRCo without a potential remedy\n\nfor the wrong it alleges; it simply clarifies that the remedy, if\n\nany, lies with the liquidation proceedings rather than in the\n\nfederal district court.     See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4036(2)\n\n(providing that after the liquidator denies a claim, the claimant\n\nmay resort to a review by the Court of First Instance).7    We must\n\ntherefore turn back MRCo’s appeal and affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       The Puerto Rico Insurance Code also provides generally for\nappeals from orders of the Commissioner.

(\"Banco Popular\"). MRCo later amended its complaint to name the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico (\"Commissioner\") as an additional defendant.<sup>[2]</sup> After MRCo and Banco Popular reached a settlement and all claims between them were dismissed, MRCo moved for partial summary judgment on its claims against the Commissioner. The district court denied MRCo's motion, and then dismissed the entire case on the ground that MRCo's claims are barred by Puerto Rico law. This timely appeal followed, and we now consider whether MRCo's claims should be resurrected.</p>\n<p>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-appellant MRCo is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Maryland, with its principal place of business in the District of Columbia. Former defendant Banco Popular is a banking organization incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with its principal place of business in Puerto Rico. Defendant-appellee Commissioner is the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico, and is named solely in her capacity as liquidator of the Plan de Salud de la Federatión de Maestros de Puerto Rico (\"the Plan\")<sup>[3]</sup>. The Plan is a nonprofit corporation which functions as a health service organization under the Insurance Code of Puerto Rico. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 1901 et seq. (2005). The Plan provides insurance coverage to teachers, government employees, and certain private organizations.</p>\n<p>In 2000, the Commissioner audited the Plan for the period covering January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999. As a result of the audit, on October 11, 2000, the Commissioner notified the Plan that there was a shortfall in the latter's assets of approximately $13.2 million. The Commissioner ordered the Plan to identify sufficient assets to cover the shortfall within 90 days. Subsequently, the Commissioner amended his audit report to reflect an actual shortfall of $13,516,725, which amount was confirmed at a hearing before the Commissioner on December 13, 2000. The Commissioner gave the Plan until February 28, 2001 to submit evidence that the shortfall had been covered; otherwise, the Plan would be considered insolvent and placed into liquidation.</p>\n<p>With the alleged overt support of the Commissioner the Plan solicited a loan from MRCo, the terms of which called for the Plan to borrow $13,516,725 pursuant to a Surplus Note Agreement (\"Surplus Note\"). MRCo and the Plan agreed to establish an escrow account at Banco Popular, with Banco Popular acting as escrow agent, that would be used to disburse the loaned funds to the Plan.</p>\n<p>The Surplus Note provided that the loan would be executed and the funds disbursed only after the Plan secured the Commissioner's express written approval of the loan transaction. This condition reflected Puerto Rico's statutory requirement that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> the Commissioner give prior approval before a surplus loan transaction is entered into by a Puerto Rico insurer. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2930. On March 21, 2001, in response to the Plan's request for approval, the Commissioner sent to the Plan a letter which stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>After evaluating the loan agreement and certificate in the light of Articles 29,300 and 29,310 of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, we approve them, subject to your submitting the duly signed originals of the loan certificate and agreement with the corporate seal of each corporation.</blockquote>\n<p>The letter contained additional requirements, including the submission of a sworn statement by the chairmen of the Plan and MRCo that the loan agreement had been executed and implemented. MRCo alleges that this letter, specifically the portion excerpted above, as well as statements made by the Commissioner, were understood by both MRCo and the Plan to constitute approval of the loan. The Commissioner, on the other hand, alleges that the loan was never approved, and points to an internal file memorandum dated April 2, 2001 that the Commissioner claims contemporaneously recorded that the letter expressed only approval of the form of the loan documentation  not approval of the loan itself.</p>\n<p>In any event, MRCo and the Plan executed the Surplus Note and accompanying loan certificate on March 26, 2001. On the same date, MRCo entered into an escrow agreement (\"Escrow Agreement\") with Banco Popular establishing the terms under which the funds would be available and used in accordance with the Surplus Note. MRCo deposited $13,516,725 in the escrow account and, almost immediately, Banco Popular made several disbursements to the Plan, totaling approximately $3.6 million, as well as a payment of $400,000 to itself on behalf of the Plan to cover an overdraft in a Plan bank account, and $5,000 to itself as the fee for acting as escrow agent. After the disbursements, approximately $8.8 million remained in escrow.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>On March 30, 2001, only days after the execution of the Surplus Note and Escrow Agreement, the Commissioner filed a sworn petition to the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance (the \"Liquidation Court\") to place the Plan into liquidation, and declared therein that the Plan had an operating deficit of $13,516,725 (the exact amount of the loan). The Liquidation Court issued an ex parte order provisionally placing the Plan into liquidation, which order was confirmed on May 25, 2001.</p>\n<p>After it learned that the Plan had been placed into liquidation, MRCo demanded that Banco Popular return all of the funds remaining in the escrow account. Instead of returning the funds, however, Banco Popular, at the apparent behest of the Commissioner, deposited the remaining funds in escrow in the registry of the Liquidation Court, effectively denying MRCo access to the funds. Also at about the same time, in a filing with the Liquidation Court, the Commissioner stated that he \"never gave the approval to the loan transaction, which is a requirement of the Insurance Code for a loan without guarantee of the assets.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> On July 3, 2001, MRCo filed its diversity action against Banco Popular in the District of Columbia, alleging that the loan contract was never validly executed, since the Commissioner never approved the transaction as required by Puerto Rico law. Since no loan existed, MRCo alleged, the Plan never acquired any right, title, or interest in any of the funds that had been placed in escrow. Thus, according to MRCo, Banco Popular had a duty to return the funds (the $8.8 million) that had remained in escrow to MRCo. Banco Popular moved to dismiss the case or to change venue to the District of Puerto Rico. By order entered October 15, 2001, the case was transferred to the District of Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>Once before the federal court in Puerto Rico, MRCo amended its Complaint to name the Commissioner as an additional defendant. Banco Popular once again moved to dismiss, arguing that the Commissioner was an indispensable party that could not be added as a defendant because the pendency of the liquidation proceedings precluded any action against the Commissioner as liquidator, pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4021. The district court denied the motion on September 9, 2002. On December 13, 2002, the Commissioner filed an \"informative motion\" advising the district court of its Resolution and Decision filed with the Liquidation Court that same day, in which the Commissioner concluded that the funds that had remained in escrow at Banco Popular at the time of liquidation were not assets of the Plan and belonged to MRCo. The Commissioner purported to conclude, as well, that the approximately $3.6 million that was disbursed to the Plan prior to liquidation was an asset of the Plan and therefore part of the liquidation estate, notwithstanding the Commissioner's failure to approve the loan transaction as required.</p>\n<p>In response to the Commissioner's acknowledgment that the $8.8 million that had remained in escrow was not an asset of the Plan, MRCo moved the district court to order the transfer of the funds from the Liquidation Court to the district court pursuant to the district court's removal jurisdiction. The district court ordered the clerk of the Liquidation Court to transfer the $8.8 million, including accrued interest, to the district court, whereupon the funds were paid to MRCo, less amounts paid to resolve a claim against the funds and a sum requested by Banco Popular to cover its claims for escrow agent fees.</p>\n<p>Eventually, MRCo and Banco Popular reached a settlement of their claims, and Banco Popular was dismissed from the action. MRCO and the Commissioner, however, continued to litigate over the fate of the $3.6 million that was disbursed to the Plan just prior to the commencement of the liquidation proceedings. The crux of MRCo's claims has always been that the loan to the Plan was never approved by the Commissioner and thus never actually executed. Since it was never executed, asserts MRCo, the loan proceeds never should have been disbursed to the Plan, and never became an asset of the Plan. In the meantime, the Commissioner filed motions on two separate occasions urging the dismissal of MRCo's claims against the Commissioner on the ground that the liquidation proceeding precluded MRCo's claims by operation of 26 P.R. Law Ann. § 4021, the same ground previously argued (unsuccessfully) by Banco Popular. The district court denied both motions.</p>\n<p>MRCo moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that no legally cognizable loan had materialized and that, as a result, the approximately $3.6 million disbursed to the Plan prior to liquidation never actually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> became an asset of the Plan and should be returned to MRCo. In its opinion and order on February 20, 2007, from which this appeal is taken, the district court denied MRCo's motion on the ground that disputed material facts precluded summary judgment, but also dismissed the underlying claims against the Commissioner on the ground that P.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021 precluded actions against the Commissioner during the pendency of the proceeding in the Liquidation Court. MRCo's timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p>This court's jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of the district court. 28 U.S.C. § 1291. A district court's order denying a motion for summary judgment is interlocutory and thus, in most cases, not appealable. <i>Fletcher v. Town of Clinton,</i> 196 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir.1999). The order is reviewable, however, if the district court simultaneously enters final judgment in the case. <i>See </i><i>Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 35, 42-43, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995). \"[A]n order or judgment is usually considered `final' (hence, appealable) only when it resolves the contested matter, leaving nothing to be done except execution of the judgment.\" <i>Petralia v. AT &amp; T Global Info. Solutions Co.,</i> 114 F.3d 352, 354 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Director, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs, United States Dep't of Labor v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 853 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1988)). Since the district court's order dismissing all of the underlying claims fully disposed of all the parties' claims, we have appellate jurisdiction under § 1291.</p>\n<p>In a strict sense, the district court committed itself to three decisions: it (1) denied MRCo's motion for summary judgment; (2) interpreted substantive Puerto Rico law; and (3) dismissed the action based on its interpretation. Each of these are questions of law and thus subject to de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Reich v. Newspapers of New England, Inc.,</i> 44 F.3d 1060, 1069 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Appeals involving pure questions of law are generally reviewed <i>de novo</i>\"). Because we believe the district court properly dismissed MRCo's claims, we need not reach the issue of whether the district court properly denied MRCo's motion for partial summary judgment inasmuch as the issue is moot.</p>\n<p>III. LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p>The district court dismissed MRCo's claims against the Commissioner, finding the claims barred by Article 40.210 of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code (\"Article 40.210\"). Article 40.210 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Upon issuance of an order appointing a liquidator of a domestic insurer or of an alien insurer domiciled in Puerto Rico, no action at law shall be brought against the insurer or the liquidator, whether in Puerto Rico or elsewhere, nor shall an action of that nature be, maintained or entered after issuance of such order.</blockquote>\n<p>P.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021(1). On its face, the statute provides that no \"action at law\" shall be brought or maintained against an insurer or liquidator upon issuance of the order appointing the liquidator. In arguing that its claims are not barred, MRCo urges us to adopt one of three alternative, though not mutually exclusive, interpretations of the statute.</p>\n<p>First, MRCo argues that its claims, being equitable in nature, are not barred by Article 40.210's proscription against \"action[s] at law.\" But while this construction appears initially to follow reasonably from the plain language of Article 40.210, it does not survive closer examination of the statute. In its original Spanish, Article 40.210 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> Al emitirse una orden nombrando un liquidador de un asegurador del país o de un asegurador foráneo domiciliado en Puerto Rico, no se radicará ninguna <i>actión judicial</i> contra el asegurador o contra el liquidador, ni en Puerto Rico ni en cualquier otro lugar, ni se mantendrá ni instará una acción de esa naturaleza luego de emitida la orden.</blockquote>\n<p>P.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021(1) (emphasis added). The widely disseminated English translation of this section contains what is arguably an important error. While translated as barring \"actions at law,\" Article 40.210 actually and more broadly provides that \"ninguna acción judicial\"  \"no judicial action\"  may be brought or maintained against an insurer or liquidator after issuance of a liquidation order. The original Spanish, in other words, makes no distinction between actions at law and at equity, as is possibly implied by the translation and argued by MRCo.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the bar on <i>all</i> judicial actions comports with our understanding of Puerto Rico legal tradition. While a concept of \"equity\" is not entirely absent from Puerto Rico law, Anglo-Saxon common law, with its traditional distinction between law and equity, has never been a force in Puerto Rico. <i>See, e.g., Dalmau v. Hernandez Saldana,</i> 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 678 (1975). It is true that the Puerto Rico Civil Code provides that \"[w]hen there is no statute applicable to the case at issue, the court shall decide in accordance with equity.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 7. However, the \"equity\" contemplated by the statute is not that developed through application of the common law, but rather that defined by the Civil Code. <i>Dalman,</i> 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 678. This latter conception of equity \"means that natural justice, as embodied in the general principles of jurisprudence and in accepted and established usages and customs, shall be taken into consideration.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 7. This manifestation is sufficiently amorphous that, even if we permitted MRCo its entreaty to equity, its chance of success on appeal would be uncertain. But in any event, there is no need for us to be sidetracked by this issue because it happens that there is a Puerto Rico statute applicable to this case  Article 40.210  and that statute quite plainly provides that no judicial action shall be brought or maintained against an insurer or liquidator after the issuance of an order appointing the liquidator. In short, MRCo's appeal to equity is a nonstarter.</p>\n<p>MRCo next argues that Article 40.210's apparent prohibition of actions against liquidators and insolvent insurers applies only to actions germane to the liquidation proceeding itself, i.e. actions involving creditor claims against the assets of the insurer. As it claims to be seeking recovery only of <i>its own</i> assets, rather than any assets of the Plan, MRCo's position is that the prohibition of Article 40.210 is inapplicable. <i>See, e.g., McDonough Caperton Shepherd Group, Inc. v. Acad, of Med., Cleveland,</i> 888 F.2d 1392 (6th Cir. 1989); <i>Bryant v. United Shoreline Inc. Assurance Servs., N.A,</i> 972 S.W.2d 26 (Tex.1998); <i>Nova Ins. Group, Inc. v. Florida Dep't of Ins.,</i> 606 So.2d 429 (Fla.Dist. Ct.App.1992).</p>\n<p>MRCo's position regarding the application of Article 40.210 to claims involving nonassets may have merit; however, it is not for this or any other court, state or federal, to determine in the first instance what constitutes an \"asset\" of the Plan, for purposes of the liquidation proceedings. The Puerto Rico Insurance Code provides that, \"after a liquidation order . . . the <i>liquidator</i> shall prepare in duplicate a list of the insurer's assets. This list shall be amended or supplemented from time to time, as the <i>liquidator</i> may determine.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4022(1) (emphasis added). This provision was interpreted, <i>as it applies to this very case,</i> by the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals in <i>Comm'r v. Plan de Salud de la Federation de Maestros de Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> KLCE No. 2001-1111 (June 20, 2002), which arose from a writ of certiorari filed by the Commissioner to review certain resolutions of the Liquidation Court. The Court of Appeals explained that, while the Liquidation Court must approve any effort by the Commissioner to \"sell, transfer, abandon or in any other manner dispose of . . . any property of the insurer,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4018, \"it is the competence of the Commissioner to establish which are and, therefore, which are not the assets that constitute the capital of the insurer.\" The Plan's appeal was denied and the Commissioner ordered to act \"pursuant to the faculties delegated on him by the Insurance Code, one of which is to determine if the $8.8 million form part of the assets of the Plan de Salud de la Federación de Maestros.\" Thus, after the <i>Commissioner</i> had determined that the $8.8 million that had remained in escrow never became part of the Plan's assets, the Liquidation Court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the money and ordered the Commissioner to return the funds to MRCo.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, we think that MRCo's argument again is ably dispatched by the plain language of the statute, as described above. Even if we do not construe Article 40.210 to apply to every judicial action that conceivably may be brought, here the Commissioner has determined that the $3.6 million still in dispute is to be classified as an \"asset\" of the Plan, and therefore this case falls within the prohibition of Article 40.210.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Intaco Equip. Corp. v. Arelis Constr.,</i> 142 D.P.R. 648 (1997); <i>see also Calderon, Rosa-Silva &amp; Vargas v. Commonwealth Ins. Co.,</i> 111 D.P.R. 153 (1981).</p>\n<p>MRCo last argues that Puerto Rico cannot, either by statute or judicial fiat, divest the federal court of its jurisdiction. This argument similarly misses the mark because it is not correct to say, as MRCo suggests, that Puerto Rico has divested the federal court of its subject matter jurisdiction over matters such as this. \"The jurisdiction of the federal courts  their power to adjudicate  is a grant of authority to them by Congress.\" <i>Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,</i> 308 U.S. 165, 167, 60 S.Ct. 153, 84 L.Ed. 167 (1939). Once Congress has conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the federal courts, state law cannot expand or contract <span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> that grant of authority. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goetzke v. Ferro Corp.,</i> 280 F.3d 766, 779 (7th Cir.2002); <i>see also </i><i>Frink Co. v. Erikson,</i> 20 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1927). In this case, the federal diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1332; conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the district court to adjudicate MRCo's claims. Article 40.210 does nothing to affect that grant of jurisdictional authority.</p>\n<p>Whether there remains a viable cause of action is another matter. When a federal court exercises diversity jurisdiction, it does so as a neutral forum in which to present state law claims. <i>See </i><i>Woods v. Interstate Realty Co.,</i> 337 U.S. 535, 538, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949). As such, it must apply applicable substantive state laws to the case before it. <i>See </i><i>Umsted v. Umsted,</i> 446 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir.2006) (applying Rhode Island substantive law in case premised on diversity jurisdiction); <i>Reyes-Cardona v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> 694 F.2d 894, 896-97 (1st Cir.1982). Thus, a federal forum, \"when invoked on grounds of diversity of citizenship, cannot give that which [the state] has withheld.\" <i>Angel v. Bullington,</i> 330 U.S. 183, 192, 67 S.Ct. 657, 91 L.Ed. 832 (1947). If state substantive law has denied a plaintiff a cause of action, the district court must dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <i>See </i><i>Goetzke,</i> 280 F.3d at 779.</p>\n<p>In <i>Goetzke,</i> the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals considered whether a provision of Indiana law, which gave the state worker's compensation board exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether an employer's worker's compensation administrator or carrier \"has committed an independent tort in adjusting or settling a claim for compensation,\" denied the plaintiff the ability to assert a remediable tortious interference claim \"against his former employer's worker's compensation administrator. <i>Id.</i> at 779. The Court, after holding that the statute did not deprive the district court of its subject matter jurisdiction, held that the statute did not bar the plaintiffs claim because the defendant compensation administrator did not commit the alleged tort \"in the context of adjusting or settling a claim for benefits,\" i.e. the claim did not fall within the purview of the worker's compensation board's exclusive jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 779.</p>\n<p>Here, given that Article 40.210 precludes <i>any</i> judicial action from being brought against the Plan or Commissioner, once the Commissioner had been appointed as liquidator, the district court appropriately (if only impliedly) dismissed MRCo's claim for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), rather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goetzke,</i> 280 F.3d at 779 (\"If state substantive law has denied a plaintiff a remedy for his cause of action, the district court [sitting in diversity] must dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\").</p>\n<p>To hold that the district court may entertain MRCo's claims would, in effect, create a cause of action for MRCo that is denied to citizens of Puerto Rico who are unable to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts through diversity. That being said, our decision does not strand MRCo without a potential remedy for the wrong it alleges; it simply clarifies that the remedy, if any, lies with the liquidation proceedings rather than in the federal district court. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4036(2) (providing that after the liquidator denies a claim, the claimant may resort to a review by the Court of First <span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> Instance).<sup>[7]</sup> We must therefore turn back MRCo's appeal and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The record reflects that MRCo's parent corporation, ULLICO Inc., undertook at least some of the actions that preceded this litigation. For simplicity, however, we refer to MRCo and ULLICO collectively as \"MRCo.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  At the time MRCo amended its Complaint, the Commissioner was Fermin Contreras Gómez. He was succeeded by Dorelisse Juarbe-Jimenez, who replaced him as co-defendant in March 2004.</p>\n<p>[3]  Translated, the name is \"Health Plan for the Teachers Federation of Puerto Rico.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  The record appears to contain slight inconsistencies as to how much money was disbursed from the escrow account. The precise amounts, whatever they may actually be, are immaterial to our decision. While the Liquidation Court has apparently reserved the precise amount of $3,612,577 until this federal case is concluded, it is enough for the present purposes to record that MRCo is seeking to recover the approximately $3.6 million that was disbursed to the Plan.</p>\n<p>[5]  We are unaware of any decision by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court involving whether the Commissioner, as statutory liquidator, has the authority to determine what constitutes an \"asset\" of an insurer in liquidation. Therefore, we follow the rule laid down in <i>CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co.,</i> 962 F.2d 77, 91 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting <i>West v. AT &amp; T Co.,</i> 311 U.S. 223, 237, 61 S.Ct. 179, 85 L.Ed. 139 (1940)), that \"[w]here an intermediate appellate court rests its considered judgment upon the rule of law which it announces, that is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  MRCo cites to <i>Foster v. Progress Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan,</i> 697 A.2d 1043 (Pa.Commw.Ct. 1997) to show that a liquidation court may lack exclusive jurisdiction where, as alleged by MRCo here, funds may have been inadvertently mingled with undisputed assets of an insurer in liquidation. However, <i>Foster</i> is distinguishable because it involved a suit not against a liquidator, but rather by a liquidator against a bank alleged to have violated a suspension order which froze an insurer's accounts. <i>Id.</i> at 1044. More importantly, the suit apparently was not brought in the face of a statute precluding any \"judicial actions\" against the statutory liquidator.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Puerto Rico Insurance Code also provides generally for appeals from orders of the Commissioner. <i>See</i> P.R.

(\"Banco Popular\"). MRCo later amended its complaint to name the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico (\"Commissioner\") as an additional defendant.<sup>[2]</sup> After MRCo and Banco Popular reached a settlement and all claims between them were dismissed, MRCo moved for partial summary judgment on its claims against the Commissioner. The district court denied MRCo's motion, and then dismissed the entire case on the ground that MRCo's claims are barred by Puerto Rico law. This timely appeal followed, and we now consider whether MRCo's claims should be resurrected.</p>\n<p>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-appellant MRCo is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Maryland, with its principal place of business in the District of Columbia. Former defendant Banco Popular is a banking organization incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with its principal place of business in Puerto Rico. Defendant-appellee Commissioner is the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico, and is named solely in her capacity as liquidator of the Plan de Salud de la Federatión de Maestros de Puerto Rico (\"the Plan\")<sup>[3]</sup>. The Plan is a nonprofit corporation which functions as a health service organization under the Insurance Code of Puerto Rico. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 1901 et seq. (2005). The Plan provides insurance coverage to teachers, government employees, and certain private organizations.</p>\n<p>In 2000, the Commissioner audited the Plan for the period covering January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999. As a result of the audit, on October 11, 2000, the Commissioner notified the Plan that there was a shortfall in the latter's assets of approximately $13.2 million. The Commissioner ordered the Plan to identify sufficient assets to cover the shortfall within 90 days. Subsequently, the Commissioner amended his audit report to reflect an actual shortfall of $13,516,725, which amount was confirmed at a hearing before the Commissioner on December 13, 2000. The Commissioner gave the Plan until February 28, 2001 to submit evidence that the shortfall had been covered; otherwise, the Plan would be considered insolvent and placed into liquidation.</p>\n<p>With the alleged overt support of the Commissioner the Plan solicited a loan from MRCo, the terms of which called for the Plan to borrow $13,516,725 pursuant to a Surplus Note Agreement (\"Surplus Note\"). MRCo and the Plan agreed to establish an escrow account at Banco Popular, with Banco Popular acting as escrow agent, that would be used to disburse the loaned funds to the Plan.</p>\n<p>The Surplus Note provided that the loan would be executed and the funds disbursed only after the Plan secured the Commissioner's express written approval of the loan transaction. This condition reflected Puerto Rico's statutory requirement that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> the Commissioner give prior approval before a surplus loan transaction is entered into by a Puerto Rico insurer. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2930. On March 21, 2001, in response to the Plan's request for approval, the Commissioner sent to the Plan a letter which stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>After evaluating the loan agreement and certificate in the light of Articles 29,300 and 29,310 of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, we approve them, subject to your submitting the duly signed originals of the loan certificate and agreement with the corporate seal of each corporation.</blockquote>\n<p>The letter contained additional requirements, including the submission of a sworn statement by the chairmen of the Plan and MRCo that the loan agreement had been executed and implemented. MRCo alleges that this letter, specifically the portion excerpted above, as well as statements made by the Commissioner, were understood by both MRCo and the Plan to constitute approval of the loan. The Commissioner, on the other hand, alleges that the loan was never approved, and points to an internal file memorandum dated April 2, 2001 that the Commissioner claims contemporaneously recorded that the letter expressed only approval of the form of the loan documentation  not approval of the loan itself.</p>\n<p>In any event, MRCo and the Plan executed the Surplus Note and accompanying loan certificate on March 26, 2001. On the same date, MRCo entered into an escrow agreement (\"Escrow Agreement\") with Banco Popular establishing the terms under which the funds would be available and used in accordance with the Surplus Note. MRCo deposited $13,516,725 in the escrow account and, almost immediately, Banco Popular made several disbursements to the Plan, totaling approximately $3.6 million, as well as a payment of $400,000 to itself on behalf of the Plan to cover an overdraft in a Plan bank account, and $5,000 to itself as the fee for acting as escrow agent. After the disbursements, approximately $8.8 million remained in escrow.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>On March 30, 2001, only days after the execution of the Surplus Note and Escrow Agreement, the Commissioner filed a sworn petition to the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance (the \"Liquidation Court\") to place the Plan into liquidation, and declared therein that the Plan had an operating deficit of $13,516,725 (the exact amount of the loan). The Liquidation Court issued an ex parte order provisionally placing the Plan into liquidation, which order was confirmed on May 25, 2001.</p>\n<p>After it learned that the Plan had been placed into liquidation, MRCo demanded that Banco Popular return all of the funds remaining in the escrow account. Instead of returning the funds, however, Banco Popular, at the apparent behest of the Commissioner, deposited the remaining funds in escrow in the registry of the Liquidation Court, effectively denying MRCo access to the funds. Also at about the same time, in a filing with the Liquidation Court, the Commissioner stated that he \"never gave the approval to the loan transaction, which is a requirement of the Insurance Code for a loan without guarantee of the assets.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> On July 3, 2001, MRCo filed its diversity action against Banco Popular in the District of Columbia, alleging that the loan contract was never validly executed, since the Commissioner never approved the transaction as required by Puerto Rico law. Since no loan existed, MRCo alleged, the Plan never acquired any right, title, or interest in any of the funds that had been placed in escrow. Thus, according to MRCo, Banco Popular had a duty to return the funds (the $8.8 million) that had remained in escrow to MRCo. Banco Popular moved to dismiss the case or to change venue to the District of Puerto Rico. By order entered October 15, 2001, the case was transferred to the District of Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>Once before the federal court in Puerto Rico, MRCo amended its Complaint to name the Commissioner as an additional defendant. Banco Popular once again moved to dismiss, arguing that the Commissioner was an indispensable party that could not be added as a defendant because the pendency of the liquidation proceedings precluded any action against the Commissioner as liquidator, pursuant to P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4021. The district court denied the motion on September 9, 2002. On December 13, 2002, the Commissioner filed an \"informative motion\" advising the district court of its Resolution and Decision filed with the Liquidation Court that same day, in which the Commissioner concluded that the funds that had remained in escrow at Banco Popular at the time of liquidation were not assets of the Plan and belonged to MRCo. The Commissioner purported to conclude, as well, that the approximately $3.6 million that was disbursed to the Plan prior to liquidation was an asset of the Plan and therefore part of the liquidation estate, notwithstanding the Commissioner's failure to approve the loan transaction as required.</p>\n<p>In response to the Commissioner's acknowledgment that the $8.8 million that had remained in escrow was not an asset of the Plan, MRCo moved the district court to order the transfer of the funds from the Liquidation Court to the district court pursuant to the district court's removal jurisdiction. The district court ordered the clerk of the Liquidation Court to transfer the $8.8 million, including accrued interest, to the district court, whereupon the funds were paid to MRCo, less amounts paid to resolve a claim against the funds and a sum requested by Banco Popular to cover its claims for escrow agent fees.</p>\n<p>Eventually, MRCo and Banco Popular reached a settlement of their claims, and Banco Popular was dismissed from the action. MRCO and the Commissioner, however, continued to litigate over the fate of the $3.6 million that was disbursed to the Plan just prior to the commencement of the liquidation proceedings. The crux of MRCo's claims has always been that the loan to the Plan was never approved by the Commissioner and thus never actually executed. Since it was never executed, asserts MRCo, the loan proceeds never should have been disbursed to the Plan, and never became an asset of the Plan. In the meantime, the Commissioner filed motions on two separate occasions urging the dismissal of MRCo's claims against the Commissioner on the ground that the liquidation proceeding precluded MRCo's claims by operation of 26 P.R. Law Ann. § 4021, the same ground previously argued (unsuccessfully) by Banco Popular. The district court denied both motions.</p>\n<p>MRCo moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that no legally cognizable loan had materialized and that, as a result, the approximately $3.6 million disbursed to the Plan prior to liquidation never actually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> became an asset of the Plan and should be returned to MRCo. In its opinion and order on February 20, 2007, from which this appeal is taken, the district court denied MRCo's motion on the ground that disputed material facts precluded summary judgment, but also dismissed the underlying claims against the Commissioner on the ground that P.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021 precluded actions against the Commissioner during the pendency of the proceeding in the Liquidation Court. MRCo's timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p>This court's jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of the district court. 28 U.S.C. § 1291. A district court's order denying a motion for summary judgment is interlocutory and thus, in most cases, not appealable. <i>Fletcher v. Town of Clinton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198711\"><a href=\"/opinion/198711/fletcher-v-clinton/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.1999). The order is reviewable, however, if the district court simultaneously enters final judgment in the case. <i>See </i><i>Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117906\"><a href=\"/opinion/117906/swint-v-chambers-county-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 42-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117906\"><a href=\"/opinion/117906/swint-v-chambers-county-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span> (1995). \"[A]n order or judgment is usually considered `final' (hence, appealable) only when it resolves the contested matter, leaving nothing to be done except execution of the judgment.\" <i>Petralia v. AT &amp; T Global Info. Solutions Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197420\"><a href=\"/opinion/197420/petralia-v-att-global/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 354 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Director, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs, United States Dep't of Labor v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509520\"><a href=\"/opinion/509520/director-office-of-workers-compensation-programs-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.1988)). Since the district court's order dismissing all of the underlying claims fully disposed of all the parties' claims, we have appellate jurisdiction under § 1291.</p>\n<p>In a strict sense, the district court committed itself to three decisions: it (1) denied MRCo's motion for summary judgment; (2) interpreted substantive Puerto Rico law; and (3) dismissed the action based on its interpretation. Each of these are questions of law and thus subject to de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Reich v. Newspapers of New England, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686722\"><a href=\"/opinion/686722/robert-b-reich-secretary-of-labor-us-department-of-labor-v-newspapers/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span>, 1069 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Appeals involving pure questions of law are generally reviewed <i>de novo</i>\"). Because we believe the district court properly dismissed MRCo's claims, we need not reach the issue of whether the district court properly denied MRCo's motion for partial summary judgment inasmuch as the issue is moot.</p>\n<p>III. LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p>The district court dismissed MRCo's claims against the Commissioner, finding the claims barred by Article 40.210 of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code (\"Article 40.210\"). Article 40.210 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Upon issuance of an order appointing a liquidator of a domestic insurer or of an alien insurer domiciled in Puerto Rico, no action at law shall be brought against the insurer or the liquidator, whether in Puerto Rico or elsewhere, nor shall an action of that nature be, maintained or entered after issuance of such order.</blockquote>\n<p>P.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021(1). On its face, the statute provides that no \"action at law\" shall be brought or maintained against an insurer or liquidator upon issuance of the order appointing the liquidator. In arguing that its claims are not barred, MRCo urges us to adopt one of three alternative, though not mutually exclusive, interpretations of the statute.</p>\n<p>First, MRCo argues that its claims, being equitable in nature, are not barred by Article 40.210's proscription against \"action[s] at law.\" But while this construction appears initially to follow reasonably from the plain language of Article 40.210, it does not survive closer examination of the statute. In its original Spanish, Article 40.210 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> Al emitirse una orden nombrando un liquidador de un asegurador del país o de un asegurador foráneo domiciliado en Puerto Rico, no se radicará ninguna <i>actión judicial</i> contra el asegurador o contra el liquidador, ni en Puerto Rico ni en cualquier otro lugar, ni se mantendrá ni instará una acción de esa naturaleza luego de emitida la orden.</blockquote>\n<p>P.R. Law Ann. tit. 26, § 4021(1) (emphasis added). The widely disseminated English translation of this section contains what is arguably an important error. While translated as barring \"actions at law,\" Article 40.210 actually and more broadly provides that \"ninguna acción judicial\"  \"no judicial action\"  may be brought or maintained against an insurer or liquidator after issuance of a liquidation order. The original Spanish, in other words, makes no distinction between actions at law and at equity, as is possibly implied by the translation and argued by MRCo.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the bar on <i>all</i> judicial actions comports with our understanding of Puerto Rico legal tradition. While a concept of \"equity\" is not entirely absent from Puerto Rico law, Anglo-Saxon common law, with its traditional distinction between law and equity, has never been a force in Puerto Rico. <i>See, e.g., Dalmau v. Hernandez Saldana,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></span> (1975). It is true that the Puerto Rico Civil Code provides that \"[w]hen there is no statute applicable to the case at issue, the court shall decide in accordance with equity.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 7. However, the \"equity\" contemplated by the statute is not that developed through application of the common law, but rather that defined by the Civil Code. <i>Dalman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></span>. This latter conception of equity \"means that natural justice, as embodied in the general principles of jurisprudence and in accepted and established usages and customs, shall be taken into consideration.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 7. This manifestation is sufficiently amorphous that, even if we permitted MRCo its entreaty to equity, its chance of success on appeal would be uncertain. But in any event, there is no need for us to be sidetracked by this issue because it happens that there is a Puerto Rico statute applicable to this case  Article 40.210  and that statute quite plainly provides that no judicial action shall be brought or maintained against an insurer or liquidator after the issuance of an order appointing the liquidator. In short, MRCo's appeal to equity is a nonstarter.</p>\n<p>MRCo next argues that Article 40.210's apparent prohibition of actions against liquidators and insolvent insurers applies only to actions germane to the liquidation proceeding itself, i.e. actions involving creditor claims against the assets of the insurer. As it claims to be seeking recovery only of <i>its own</i> assets, rather than any assets of the Plan, MRCo's position is that the prohibition of Article 40.210 is inapplicable. <i>See, e.g., McDonough Caperton Shepherd Group, Inc. v. Acad, of Med., Cleveland,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1392</span></span> (6th Cir. 1989); <i>Bryant v. United Shoreline Inc. Assurance Servs., N.A,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441317/bryant-v-united-shortline-inc-assur-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span> (Tex.1998); <i>Nova Ins.

Ct.App.1992).</p>\n<p>MRCo's position regarding the application of Article 40.210 to claims involving nonassets may have merit; however, it is not for this or any other court, state or federal, to determine in the first instance what constitutes an \"asset\" of the Plan, for purposes of the liquidation proceedings. The Puerto Rico Insurance Code provides that, \"after a liquidation order . . . the <i>liquidator</i> shall prepare in duplicate a list of the insurer's assets. This list shall be amended or supplemented from time to time, as the <i>liquidator</i> may determine.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4022(1) (emphasis added). This provision was interpreted, <i>as it applies to this very case,</i> by the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals in <i>Comm'r v. Plan de Salud de la Federation de Maestros de Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> KLCE No. 2001-1111 (June 20, 2002), which arose from a writ of certiorari filed by the Commissioner to review certain resolutions of the Liquidation Court. The Court of Appeals explained that, while the Liquidation Court must approve any effort by the Commissioner to \"sell, transfer, abandon or in any other manner dispose of . . . any property of the insurer,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4018, \"it is the competence of the Commissioner to establish which are and, therefore, which are not the assets that constitute the capital of the insurer.\" The Plan's appeal was denied and the Commissioner ordered to act \"pursuant to the faculties delegated on him by the Insurance Code, one of which is to determine if the $8.8 million form part of the assets of the Plan de Salud de la Federación de Maestros.\" Thus, after the <i>Commissioner</i> had determined that the $8.8 million that had remained in escrow never became part of the Plan's assets, the Liquidation Court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the money and ordered the Commissioner to return the funds to MRCo.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, we think that MRCo's argument again is ably dispatched by the plain language of the statute, as described above. Even if we do not construe Article 40.210 to apply to every judicial action that conceivably may be brought, here the Commissioner has determined that the $3.6 million still in dispute is to be classified as an \"asset\" of the Plan, and therefore this case falls within the prohibition of Article 40.210.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Intaco Equip. Corp. v. Arelis Constr.,</i> 142 D.P.R. 648 (1997); <i>see also Calderon, Rosa-Silva &amp; Vargas v. Commonwealth Ins. Co.,</i> 111 D.P.R. 153 (1981).</p>\n<p>MRCo last argues that Puerto Rico cannot, either by statute or judicial fiat, divest the federal court of its jurisdiction. This argument similarly misses the mark because it is not correct to say, as MRCo suggests, that Puerto Rico has divested the federal court of its subject matter jurisdiction over matters such as this. \"The jurisdiction of the federal courts  their power to adjudicate  is a grant of authority to them by Congress.\" <i>Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103244\"><a href=\"/opinion/103244/neirbo-co-v-bethlehem-shipbuilding-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 167, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span> (1939). Once Congress has conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the federal courts, state law cannot expand or contract <span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> that grant of authority. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goetzke v. Ferro Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776559\"><a href=\"/opinion/776559/david-goetzke-v-ferro-corporation-and-crawford-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></a></span>, 779 (7th Cir.2002); <i>see also </i><i>Frink Co. v. Erikson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1476501\"><a href=\"/opinion/1476501/frink-co-v-erikson/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 711 (1st Cir.1927). In this case, the federal diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1332; conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the district court to adjudicate MRCo's claims. Article 40.210 does nothing to affect that grant of jurisdictional authority.</p>\n<p>Whether there remains a viable cause of action is another matter. When a federal court exercises diversity jurisdiction, it does so as a neutral forum in which to present state law claims. <i>See </i><i>Woods v. Interstate Realty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104694\"><a href=\"/opinion/104694/woods-v-interstate-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, 538, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104694\"><a href=\"/opinion/104694/woods-v-interstate-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span> (1949). As such, it must apply applicable substantive state laws to the case before it. <i>See </i><i>Umsted v. Umsted,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202161\"><a href=\"/opinion/202161/umsted-v-umsted/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2006) (applying Rhode Island substantive law in case premised on diversity jurisdiction); <i>Reyes-Cardona v.

Thus, a federal forum, \"when invoked on grounds of diversity of citizenship, cannot give that which [the state] has withheld.\" <i>Angel v. Bullington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104380\"><a href=\"/opinion/104380/angel-v-bullington/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 192, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104380\"><a href=\"/opinion/104380/angel-v-bullington/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span> (1947). If state substantive law has denied a plaintiff a cause of action, the district court must dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <i>See </i><i>Goetzke,</i> 280 F.3d at 779.</p>\n<p>In <i>Goetzke,</i> the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals considered whether a provision of Indiana law, which gave the state worker's compensation board exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether an employer's worker's compensation administrator or carrier \"has committed an independent tort in adjusting or settling a claim for compensation,\" denied the plaintiff the ability to assert a remediable tortious interference claim \"against his former employer's worker's compensation administrator. <i>Id.</i> at 779. The Court, after holding that the statute did not deprive the district court of its subject matter jurisdiction, held that the statute did not bar the plaintiffs claim because the defendant compensation administrator did not commit the alleged tort \"in the context of adjusting or settling a claim for benefits,\" i.e. the claim did not fall within the purview of the worker's compensation board's exclusive jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 779.</p>\n<p>Here, given that Article 40.210 precludes <i>any</i> judicial action from being brought against the Plan or Commissioner, once the Commissioner had been appointed as liquidator, the district court appropriately (if only impliedly) dismissed MRCo's claim for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), rather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goetzke,</i> 280 F.3d at 779 (\"If state substantive law has denied a plaintiff a remedy for his cause of action, the district court [sitting in diversity] must dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\").</p>\n<p>To hold that the district court may entertain MRCo's claims would, in effect, create a cause of action for MRCo that is denied to citizens of Puerto Rico who are unable to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts through diversity. That being said, our decision does not strand MRCo without a potential remedy for the wrong it alleges; it simply clarifies that the remedy, if any, lies with the liquidation proceedings rather than in the federal district court. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 4036(2) (providing that after the liquidator denies a claim, the claimant may resort to a review by the Court of First <span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> Instance).<sup>[7]</sup> We must therefore turn back MRCo's appeal and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The record reflects that MRCo's parent corporation, ULLICO Inc., undertook at least some of the actions that preceded this litigation. For simplicity, however, we refer to MRCo and ULLICO collectively as \"MRCo.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  At the time MRCo amended its Complaint, the Commissioner was Fermin Contreras Gómez. He was succeeded by Dorelisse Juarbe-Jimenez, who replaced him as co-defendant in March 2004.</p>\n<p>[3]  Translated, the name is \"Health Plan for the Teachers Federation of Puerto Rico.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  The record appears to contain slight inconsistencies as to how much money was disbursed from the escrow account. The precise amounts, whatever they may actually be, are immaterial to our decision. While the Liquidation Court has apparently reserved the precise amount of $3,612,577 until this federal case is concluded, it is enough for the present purposes to record that MRCo is seeking to recover the approximately $3.6 million that was disbursed to the Plan.</p>\n<p>[5]  We are unaware of any decision by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court involving whether the Commissioner, as statutory liquidator, has the authority to determine what constitutes an \"asset\" of an insurer in liquidation. Therefore, we follow the rule laid down in <i>CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582531\"><a href=\"/opinion/582531/cpc-international-inc-v-northbrook-excess-surplus-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 91 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting <i>West v. AT &amp; T Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103402\"><a href=\"/opinion/103402/west-v-american-telephone-telegraph-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 237, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span> (1940)), that \"[w]here an intermediate appellate court rests its considered judgment upon the rule of law which it announces, that is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  MRCo cites to <i>Foster v. Progress Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1043</span></span> (Pa.Commw.Ct. 1997) to show that a liquidation court may lack exclusive jurisdiction where, as alleged by MRCo here, funds may have been inadvertently mingled with undisputed assets of an insurer in liquidation. However, <i>Foster</i> is distinguishable because it involved a suit not against a liquidator, but rather by a liquidator against a bank alleged to have violated a suspension order which froze an insurer's accounts. <i>Id.</i> at 1044. More importantly, the suit apparently was not brought in the face of a statute precluding any \"judicial actions\" against the statutory liquidator.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Puerto Rico Insurance Code also provides generally for appeals from orders of the Commissioner. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 226.</p>\n\n</div>",
