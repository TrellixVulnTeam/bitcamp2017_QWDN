Petitioner-appellant Selim\n\nBetouche challenges various rulings by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) declining to reopen the proceedings relating to his\n\nasylum   application,   in   which       he    claimed    that   he   received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel and that conditions in his native\n\nAlgeria have deteriorated since the entry of the final deportation\n\norder.   We affirm.\n\n                                     I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n           Betouche, a citizen and native of Algeria, entered the\n\nUnited States in July 1996 on a three-month visa and remained\n\nbeyond   its   expiration.   In   due         course,   the   Immigration   and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS) lodged a removability charge, and\n\nBetouche retained Desmond Fitzgerald, Esquire, to litigate the\n\napplications for asylum and withholding of deportation.1              On August\n\n13, 1998, an immigration judge (IJ) denied the applications for\n\nasylum and withholding, and found Betouche removable.                 Two days\n\nafter the deadline, Attorney Fitzgerald filed a belated appeal to\n\nthe BIA, which was summarily denied as untimely.\n\n           In May 2002, Betouche submitted a motion to reopen his\n\ncase before the IJ, contending that political conditions in Algeria\n\n\n\n     1\n      As its lone ground, the asylum application contended that,\nsince at least 1992, members of Algeria’s Islamic fundamentalist\nparty had killed, assaulted or threatened members of the pro-\nWestern socialist party to which Betouche allegedly belonged.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fhad changed since August 1998.            The IJ denied the motion on the\n\nground that Betouche failed to adduce any evidence of \"materially\n\nchanged\" conditions.\n\n           Betouche retained new counsel, who appealed to the BIA\n\nand moved to reopen on the ground that Attorney Fitzgerald had\n\nrendered ineffective assistance of counsel in 1998 by filing the\n\nBetouche appeal two days late with the BIA, thereby resulting in\n\nits dismissal.        The     petition    to    reopen   further    alleged   that\n\nAttorney Fitzgerald deliberately concealed the BIA dismissal from\n\nBetouche for more than three years.\n\n           In rejecting the appeal, the BIA (i) upheld the IJ’s\n\nfinding   that      Betouche    had    adduced     no    evidence   of   “changed\n\nconditions” in Algeria, and (ii) turned down his “ineffective\n\nassistance”   claim     for    failure     to   adduce    either    an   affidavit\n\ndescribing    the    terms     under   which     Betouche    retained     Attorney\n\nFitzgerald, or any evidence that Betouche had notified Attorney\n\nFitzgerald either as to his \"ineffective assistance\" allegations or\n\nhis September 2002 complaint to the Massachusetts Board of Bar\n\nOverseers.    Betouche has petitioned to review both BIA rulings.\n\n                                         II\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim\n\n           Deportable aliens possess a Fifth Amendment due process\n\nright to be free from incompetent legal representation which\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\frenders   their   deportation     proceedings    “fundamentally    unfair.”\n\nHernandez v. Reno, 238 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2001); see also 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1362 (according aliens right to counsel at their expense).\n\nThe BIA denied the ineffective assistance claim due to Betouche's\n\nfailure to comply with the first two of the three following BIA\n\nprocedural requirements applicable to such claims: (1) an affidavit\n\ndescribing in detail the agreement between the alien and his\n\ncounsel regarding the litigation matters the attorney was retained\n\nto address; (2) evidence that the alien informed his counsel as to\n\nthe alien's ineffective assistance allegations and afforded counsel\n\nan opportunity to respond; and (3) evidence that the alien had\n\neither    filed   a   complaint   with    the   appropriate   disciplinary\n\nauthority regarding the attorney’s ethical or legal misfeasance, or\n\na valid excuse for failing to lodge such a complaint.             Matter of\n\nLozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (“Lozada”).2\n\n           On appeal, Betouche contends that he complied with the\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      In light of the unanimous adverse precedent, Betouche has not\nchallenged the BIA’s exercise of its discretion to insist, in a\nnon-arbitrary manner, upon the Lozada requirements as a\nprecondition to an alien’s submission of an ineffective assistance\nclaim.   See Hernandez, 238 F.3d at 55 (expressing approval of\nLozada requirements); see also Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465,\n468-69 (6th Cir. 2003) (endorsing Lozada); Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft,\n259 F.3d 127, 133 (3d Cir. 2001) (same); Lara v. E.M. Trominski,\n216 F.3d 487, 497-98 (5th Cir. 2000) (same); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d\n1241, 1245-46 (9th Cir. 2000) (same); Stewart v. INS, 181 F.3d 587,\n596 (4th Cir. 1999) (same).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fLozada criteria in full.3         The BIA ruling rejecting the motion to\n\nreopen is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.               See Zhang v.\n\nINS, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir. 2003).          We find none.\n\n              Betouche conveniently assumes that the September 10, 2002\n\nletter, which he submitted to the Board of Bar Overseers, met the\n\nLozada affidavit requirement.4        However, an unsworn letter plainly\n\ncannot qualify as an affidavit in a proceeding such as this.               See,\n\ne.g., Mason v. Clark, 920 F.2d 493, 495 (8th Cir. 1990) (“By\n\ndefinition an affidavit is a ‘sworn statement in writing made . .\n\n.   under    oath   or   on   affirmation   before   .   .   .   an   authorized\n\n\n\n      3\n      Betouche belatedly asserts that the BIA abused its\ndiscretion, given that he “substantially” complied with the Lozada\nrequirements. As this contention was first raised in his reply\nbrief on appeal, it has been forfeited. See Andresen v. Diorio,\n349 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2003).\n      4\n          The Betouche letter states:\n\n           I would like to file a complaint against Attorney\n      Desmond P. Fitzgerald. I had hired [his] law firm ... in\n      connection with all of my immigration matters. I had\n      applied for political asylum and my case was denied on\n      August 13, 1998. A Notice of Appeal must be filed with\n      the [BIA] within 30 days of the [IJ’s] decision.\n      However, Attorney Fitzgerald missed the deadline for\n      filing my appeal with the [BIA], as it was filed on\n      September 16, 1998. . . . Thereafter, my appeal was\n      denied because it was deemed to have been untimely filed.\n      I have been denied my due process rights to appeal my\n      case due to this error. My case was summarily dismissed\n      without considering its merits.\n           Attorney Fitzgerald never told me that my case for\n      asylum was dismissed because he had filed late. I was\n      under the impression that my appeal was still pending\n      until I was arrested by INS for having Final Order of\n      Deportation.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fofficer.’”) (citation omitted); Howland v. Cape Cod Bank and Trust\n\nCo., 526 N.E.2d 1073, 1074 (Mass. App. Ct. 1988) (same).5\n\n            Nor   can   such     a    deficiency   be   considered    a   mere\n\ntechnicality, given that Lozada advanced important policy reasons\n\nfor insisting upon the submission of a sworn statement.               Since a\n\ndelay in deportation may itself constitute a substantial boon to an\n\nalien already subject to a final deportation order, there exists a\n\nsignificant    prospect   that       entirely   meritless   and/or   collusive\n\nineffective assistance claims may be filed for purely dilatory\n\npurposes.     See Hernandez, 238 F.3d at 55         (expressing approval of\n\nLozada requirements as means to promote finality of deportation\n\norders).      The immigration courts, which reasonably cannot be\n\nexpected to conduct a full-fledged evidentiary hearing for all such\n\nclaims, must be able to impose fair and efficacious techniques for\n\nscreening out, ab initio, the numerous groundless and dilatory\n\nclaims routinely submitted in these cases.           See In re Rivera, 21 I.\n\n& N. Dec. 599, 604-05 (BIA 1996).         Thus, the requirement of a sworn\n\naffidavit, presaging and memorializing the testimony which the\n\nalien petitioner would present were he to be accorded a hearing,\n\nproduces the primary evidentiary basis upon which the IJ evaluates\n\nthe bona fides of the petitioner's claim in determining whether a\n\n\n\n     5\n      Moreover, the Betouche letter failed to comply with 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1746, which arguably may have permitted, in lieu of an affidavit,\nan “unsworn declaration . . . in writing of such person which is\nsubscribed by him, as true under penalty of perjury.”\n\n                                        -6-\n\fhearing is even warranted.         See id.     Moreover, by exposing an alien\n\nto the potential pains of perjury, the affidavit requirement\n\n“‘foster[s]      an   atmosphere    of    solemnity      commensurate   with   the\n\ngravity of the [ineffective assistance] claim[s],’”                     Reyes v.\n\nAshcroft, 348 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2003) (affirming BIA denial\n\ndue to alien’s failure to submit affidavit) (citation omitted), and\n\nserves    as    a   screening    device    whereby       deportable   aliens   are\n\ndiscouraged from filing dilatory ineffective assistance claims.\n\n               Finally,   even     assuming       that    the   Lozada-affidavit\n\nrequirement might be excused, in some circumstances – beyond the\n\nalien    petitioner’s     control    –    which    prevented    compliance,    see\n\nOntiveros-Lopez v. INS, 213 F.3d 1121, 1124-25 (9th Cir. 2000)\n\n(noting that Lozada requirements might be excused where alien\n\ndemonstrated diligent (albeit deficient) efforts to comply); In re\n\nRivera, 21 I. & N. Dec. at 602-03, Betouche proffers no explanation\n\nfor his failure even to describe an ineffective assistance claim in\n\naffidavit form.6\n\n\n\n     6\n      Although we have held that aliens found deportable in\nabsentia – who have 180 days within which to file any number of\nmotions to reopen – should be allowed to cure any initial defects\nin their Lozada materials within the 180-day period, see Saakian v.\nINS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 & n.3 (1st Cir. 2001), Betouche was allowed\nbut one motion to reopen within 90 days of the final deportation\norder. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i). Even though Betouche\nbelatedly attempted to submit a compliant affidavit for the first\ntime in conjunction with the present appeal, our review is\nnecessarily circumscribed by the administrative record established\nbefore the BIA. See Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.\n2003).\n\n                                         -7-\n\f            Furthermore, Betouche utterly failed to comply with the\n\nsecond Lozada requirement: that he demonstrate that he had advised\n\nAttorney Fitzgerald of his allegations and accorded Fitzgerald an\n\nopportunity to respond. Although Betouche cursorily represented in\n\nhis appellate brief before the BIA that his attorney              “ha[d] been\n\ngiven an opportunity to respond,” the BIA correctly noted that he\n\nadduced no evidence of that notification, such as a copy of a\n\nletter from Betouche to his attorney.        See Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec.\n\nat   639   (“Any   subsequent   response   from   counsel,   or    report   of\n\ncounsel's failure or refusal to respond, should be submitted with\n\nthe [alien’s] motion.”); see also Reyes, 348 F.3d at 1132 (“[T]he\n\n[Lozada] notice requirement serves both to notify a petitioner's\n\nformer counsel of the ineffective assistance allegations and to\n\ngive former counsel an opportunity to contest them before the IJ.\n\nThe participation of a petitioner's former counsel, in turn,\n\nprovides a mechanism by which the IJ may more accurately assess the\n\nmerits of a petitioner's ineffective assistance claims.”).\n\n            In addition, the September 2002 letter from Betouche to\n\nthe Board of Bar Overseers simply established that Betouche had\n\nnotified the Board of Bar Overseers of his complaint, not that\n\neither he or the Board had notified Attorney Fitzgerald.                    The\n\nNovember 12, 2002 letter, in which Attorney Fitzgerald implicitly\n\nacknowledged notice of the September 2002 Bar complaint, plainly\n\nwas not part of the administrative record when the BIA issued its\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fOctober 31, 2002 decision, and therefore is to be disregarded in\n\nthe instant appeal.          See Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st\n\nCir.       2003)   (citing   8     U.S.C.   §     1252(b)(4)(A)).      As    Betouche\n\ninexcusably        failed     to     comply       with   the   first   two     Lozada\n\nrequirements,7 the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the\n\nmotion to reopen.8\n\nB.     The \"Changed Circumstances\" Claim\n\n               Next, Betouche contends that the BIA erred in rejecting\n\nhis motion to reopen the deportation proceedings, given that\n\nconditions in Algeria had deteriorated significantly between August\n\n1998 and April 2002.9            By way of proof, Betouche points to a 2001\n\n\n       7\n      Since Betouche made no prima facie showing that Attorney\nFitzgerald failed to advise him that his BIA appeal had been\ndismissed as untimely, the motion to reopen – filed more than three\nyears after that dismissal – obviously was untimely. See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i) (requiring that motions to reopen be filed\nwithin 90 days of final deportation order).\n       8\n      Moreover, even if Betouche had met the Lozada criteria, he\nwould have had the burden to establish at least a reasonable\nprobability of prejudice resulting from his former attorney’s\nfailure to bring a timely appeal from the final deportation order.\nSee Saakian, 252 F.3d at 25. Counsel’s failure to prosecute an\nimmigration appeal – even if negligent – does not constitute\nprejudice, per se.     See Hernandez, 238 F.3d at 56 (“We have\nreviewed the [IJ’s] [unappealed] decision and cannot find any such\n‘reasonable probability’ that the result would have been different\nif counsel had carried through with an appeal to the [BIA] or to\nthis court.”) (citation omitted).     As of the present appeal,\nBetouche has yet to make any attempt whatsoever to demonstrate any\ngrounds for reversing the 1989 denial of his asylum application on\nits merits.\n       9\n      Betouche also argues that he was “deemed credible and\nexperienced past persecution,” and so the burden of proof shifted\nto the government to rebut a presumption that he has a well-founded\n\n                                            -9-\n\fState    Department    Human   Rights    Report,      as    well   as   “recent\n\n[newspaper] articles” and “affidavits,” to demonstrate that serious\n\npolitical unrest “persisted” in Algeria, thus allegedly exposing\n\nBetouche    to   an   increased   risk   of   being    targeted    by     Islamic\n\nfundamentalists in the event he were to return to Algeria.                  See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C)(ii) (allowing filing of motions to reopen\n\nbeyond 90 days from final judgment of deportation where alien\n\nadduces material evidence, unavailable to him at the time of his\n\nasylum, that conditions in native country have changed).                We find\n\nno abuse of discretion in the BIA denial.             See Zhang, 348 F.3d at\n\n292.\n\n            Betouche included none of the above-described reports,\n\narticles, and affidavits in the administrative record before the\n\nBIA.    Thus, even if Betouche were to have produced these materials\n\non the instant appeal (which he did not), they could not be\n\nconsidered.      See Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 18.              In their stead, we\n\nsimply    have   Betouche’s    uncorroborated      assertions      that    those\n\nmaterials would demonstrate that “the human rights situation in\n\nAlgeria remained poor . . . and serious problems persisted.”\n\n(Emphasis added.) Rather than demonstrating any alleged change-in-\n\n\nfear of persecution if he returns to Algeria.     See 8 C.F.R. §\n208.13(b)(1). On the contrary, the IJ denied his motion to reopen\nsolely on the lack of proof of changed circumstances in Algeria,\nand Betouche points to no record evidence that the IJ even\nconsidered whether or not his claim of past persecution was\ncredible, given that this issue already had been finally\nadjudicated in the government’s favor back in August 1998.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcountry circumstances, these bald assertions severely undermine\n\nBetouche's position, by suggesting exactly the opposite (viz., that\n\nthe same conditions have been continuing ever since 1998).             As\n\nsuch, these statements constitute a further attempt to relitigate\n\nthe merits of the asylum claim rejected in 1998.\n\n          Accordingly,   the   order   of   the   Board   of   Immigration\n\nAppeals is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

Since a delay in deportation may itself constitute a substantial boon to an alien already subject to a final deportation order, there exists a significant prospect that entirely meritless and/or collusive ineffective assistance claims may be filed for purely dilatory purposes. <i>See Hernandez,</i> 238 F.3d at 55 (expressing approval of <i>Lozada</i> requirements as means to promote finality of deportation orders). The immigration courts, which reasonably cannot be expected to conduct a full-fledged evidentiary hearing for all such claims, must be able to impose fair and efficacious techniques for screening out, <i>ab initio,</i> the numerous groundless and dilatory claims routinely submitted in these cases. <i>See In re Rivera-Claros,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 599, 604-05 (BIA 1996). Thus, the requirement of a sworn affidavit, presaging and memorializing the testimony which the alien petitioner would present were he to be accorded a hearing, produces the primary evidentiary basis upon which the IJ evaluates the bona fides of the petitioner's claim in determining whether a hearing is even warranted. <i>See id.</i> Moreover, by exposing an alien to the potential pains of perjury, the affidavit requirement \"`foster[s] an atmosphere of solemnity commensurate with the gravity of the [ineffective assistance] claim[s],'\" <i>Reyes v. Ashcroft,</i> 348 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming BIA denial due to alien's failure to submit affidavit) (citation omitted), and serves as a screening device whereby deportable aliens are discouraged from filing dilatory ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even assuming that the <i>Lozada</i>-affidavit requirement might be excused, in some circumstances &#8212; beyond the alien petitioner's control &#8212; which prevented compliance, <i>see Ontiveros-Lopez v.

Although Betouche cursorily represented in his appellate brief before the BIA that his attorney \"ha[d] been given an opportunity to respond,\" the BIA correctly noted that he adduced no evidence of that notification, such as a copy of a letter from Betouche to his attorney. <i>See Lozada,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 639 (\"Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel's failure or refusal to respond, should be submitted with the [alien's] motion.\"); <i>see also Reyes,</i> 348 F.3d at 1132 (\"[T]he [<i>Lozada</i>] notice requirement serves both to notify a petitioner's former counsel of the ineffective assistance allegations and to give former counsel an opportunity to contest them before the IJ.

The November 12, 2002 letter, in which Attorney Fitzgerald implicitly acknowledged notice of the September 2002 Bar complaint, plainly was not part of the administrative record when the BIA issued its October 31, 2002 decision, and therefore is to be disregarded in the instant appeal. <i>See Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> 333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2003) (citing 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(A)). As Betouche inexcusably failed to comply with the first two <i>Lozada</i> requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The \"Changed Circumstances\" Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Betouche contends that the BIA erred in rejecting his motion to reopen the deportation proceedings, given that conditions in Algeria had deteriorated significantly between August 1998 and April 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> By way of proof, Betouche points to a 2001 State Department Human Rights Report, as well as \"recent [newspaper] articles\" and \"affidavits,\" to demonstrate that serious political unrest \"persisted\" in Algeria, thus allegedly exposing Betouche to an increased risk of being targeted by Islamic fundamentalists in the event he were to return to Algeria. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(6)(C)(ii) (allowing filing of motions to reopen beyond 90 days from final judgment of deportation where alien adduces material evidence, unavailable to him at the time of his asylum, that conditions in native country have changed). We find no abuse of discretion in the BIA denial. <i>See Zhang,</i> 348 F.3d at 292.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Betouche included none of the above-described reports, articles, and affidavits in the administrative record before the BIA. Thus, even if Betouche were to have produced these materials on the instant appeal (which he did not), they could not be considered. <i>See Fesseha,</i> 333 F.3d at 18. In their stead, we simply have Betouche's uncorroborated assertions that those materials would demonstrate that \"the human rights situation in Algeria <i>remained</i> poor ... and serious problems <i>persisted.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) Rather than demonstrating any alleged change-in-country circumstances, these bald assertions severely undermine Betouche's position, by suggesting exactly the opposite (<i>viz.,</i> that the same conditions have been <i>continuing</i> ever since 1998). As such, these statements constitute a further attempt to relitigate the merits of the asylum claim rejected in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby <i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As its lone ground, the asylum application contended that, since at least 1992, members of Algeria's Islamic fundamentalist party had killed, assaulted or threatened members of the pro-Western socialist party to which Betouche allegedly belonged</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In light of the unanimous adverse precedent, Betouche has not challenged the BIA's exercise of its discretion to insist, in a non-arbitrary manner, upon the<i>Lozada</i> requirements as a precondition to an alien's submission of an ineffective assistance claim. <i>See Hernandez,</i> 238 F.3d at 55 (expressing approval of <i>Lozada</i> requirements); <i>see also Hamid v.

Thus, the requirement of a sworn affidavit, presaging and memorializing the testimony which the alien petitioner would present were he to be accorded a hearing, produces the primary evidentiary basis upon which the IJ evaluates the bona fides of the petitioner's claim in determining whether a hearing is even warranted. <i>See id.</i> Moreover, by exposing an alien to the potential pains of perjury, the affidavit requirement \"`foster[s] an atmosphere of solemnity commensurate with the gravity of the [ineffective assistance] claim[s],'\" <i>Reyes v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></span>, 1131 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming BIA denial due to alien's failure to submit affidavit) (citation omitted), and serves as a screening device whereby deportable aliens are discouraged from filing dilatory ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even assuming that the <i>Lozada</i>-affidavit requirement might be excused, in some circumstances &#8212; beyond the alien petitioner's control &#8212; which prevented compliance, <i>see Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768874\"><a href=\"/opinion/768874/bernardo-ontiveros-lopez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span>, 1124-25 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that <i>Lozada</i> requirements might be excused where alien demonstrated diligent (albeit deficient) efforts to comply); <i>In re Rivera-Claros,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 602-03, Betouche proffers no explanation for his failure even to describe an ineffective assistance claim in affidavit form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Betouche utterly failed to comply with the second <i>Lozada</i> requirement: that he demonstrate that he had advised Attorney Fitzgerald of his allegations and accorded Fitzgerald an opportunity to respond. Although Betouche cursorily represented in his appellate brief before the BIA that his attorney \"ha[d] been given an opportunity to respond,\" the BIA correctly noted that he adduced no evidence of that notification, such as a copy of a letter from Betouche to his attorney. <i>See Lozada,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 639 (\"Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel's failure or refusal to respond, should be submitted with the [alien's] motion.\"); <i>see also Reyes,</i> 348 F.3d at 1132 (\"[T]he [<i>Lozada</i>] notice requirement serves both to notify a petitioner's former counsel of the ineffective assistance allegations and to give former counsel an opportunity to contest them before the IJ. The participation of a petitioner's former counsel, in turn, provides a mechanism by which the IJ may more accurately assess the merits of a petitioner's ineffective assistance claims.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the September 2002 letter from Betouche to the Board of Bar Overseers simply established that Betouche had notified the Board of Bar Overseers of his complaint, <i>not</i> that <i>either</i> he <i>or</i> the Board had notified Attorney Fitzgerald. The November 12, 2002 letter, in which Attorney Fitzgerald implicitly acknowledged notice of the September 2002 Bar complaint, plainly was not part of the administrative record when the BIA issued its October 31, 2002 decision, and therefore is to be disregarded in the instant appeal. <i>See Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2003) (citing 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(A)). As Betouche inexcusably failed to comply with the first two <i>Lozada</i> requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The \"Changed Circumstances\" Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Betouche contends that the BIA erred in rejecting his motion to reopen the deportation proceedings, given that conditions in Algeria had deteriorated significantly between August 1998 and April 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> By way of proof, Betouche points to a 2001 State Department Human Rights Report, as well as \"recent [newspaper] articles\" and \"affidavits,\" to demonstrate that serious political unrest \"persisted\" in Algeria, thus allegedly exposing Betouche to an increased risk of being targeted by Islamic fundamentalists in the event he were to return to Algeria. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(6)(C)(ii) (allowing filing of motions to reopen beyond 90 days from final judgment of deportation where alien adduces material evidence, unavailable to him at the time of his asylum, that conditions in native country have changed). We find no abuse of discretion in the BIA denial. <i>See Zhang,</i> 348 F.3d at 292.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Betouche included none of the above-described reports, articles, and affidavits in the administrative record before the BIA. Thus, even if Betouche were to have produced these materials on the instant appeal (which he did not), they could not be considered. <i>See Fesseha,</i> 333 F.3d at 18. In their stead, we simply have Betouche's uncorroborated assertions that those materials would demonstrate that \"the human rights situation in Algeria <i>remained</i> poor ... and serious problems <i>persisted.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) Rather than demonstrating any alleged change-in-country circumstances, these bald assertions severely undermine Betouche's position, by suggesting exactly the opposite (<i>viz.,</i> that the same conditions have been <i>continuing</i> ever since 1998). As such, these statements constitute a further attempt to relitigate the merits of the asylum claim rejected in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby <i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As its lone ground, the asylum application contended that, since at least 1992, members of Algeria's Islamic fundamentalist party had killed, assaulted or threatened members of the pro-Western socialist party to which Betouche allegedly belonged</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In light of the unanimous adverse precedent, Betouche has not challenged the BIA's exercise of its discretion to insist, in a non-arbitrary manner, upon the<i>Lozada</i> requirements as a precondition to an alien's submission of an ineffective assistance claim. <i>See Hernandez,</i> 238 F.3d at 55 (expressing approval of <i>Lozada</i> requirements); <i>see also Hamid v.
