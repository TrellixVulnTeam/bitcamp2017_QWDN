Following a jury trial, defendant\n\nFernando Gómez-Rosario (\"Gómez\") was acquitted of conspiring to\n\nimport heroin, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 952(a), 963, but convicted of\n\nconspiring to possess heroin, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846. The\n\ndistrict court subsequently sentenced the defendant under the\n\nmandatory guidelines to 121 months in prison and three years of\n\nsupervised release. On appeal, Gómez asserts, inter alia, (1) that\n\nthe district court1 violated his Sixth Amendment rights by denying\n\nhis request to proceed pro se, (2) that the court's instructions to\n\nthe jury constructively amended the indictment in violation of the\n\nFifth Amendment, (3) that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport his conviction, (4) that the delay between his arrest and\n\nthe       filing   of   the   superseding      indictment   violated   his\n\nconstitutional rights, and (5) that he should be resentenced in\n\nlight of United States v. Booker.           Although the first claim poses\n\nimportant questions regarding the right of self-representation and\n\nthe appointment of standby counsel, we ultimately conclude that\n\n\n      1\n      We refer throughout this opinion to \"the district court,\" a\ngeneric term which might suggest that a single judge presided over\nall the proceedings that culminated in this appeal. That is not\nthe case. At least three different district court judges, and an\narray of magistrate judges, have been involved in different stages\nof this case. Judge Domínguez handled the October 2001 and March\n2003 motions to proceed pro se that are discussed in Section II.A.,\nwhile Judge McAuliffe presided over the first trial, which ended in\na judgment of acquittal on two counts and a mistrial on one count,\nand Judge Singal presided over the second trial, which resulted in\nGómez's conviction for conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to\ndistribute. Only rulings of Judge Domínguez and Judge Singal are\nat issue in this appeal.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fGómez’s right to conduct his own defense was not violated in this\n\ncase.    The second, third and fourth claims are also without merit.\n\nConcluding that Booker error was present here, however, we remand\n\nfor resentencing.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            We turn to the trial record for the following background,\n\npresenting the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n\nSee Baron v. Suffolk County Sheriff's Dep't, 402 F.3d 225, 229 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\nA.          The heroin transaction\n\n            On April 21, 2000, customs agents intercepted Eugene\n\nSarruco at the airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico following his\n\narrival on a flight from Curacao.      Suspecting that Sarruco was a\n\ndrug courier, the agents took him to the airport's medical facility\n\nwhere he was arrested after passing five pellets of heroin, each\n\ncontaining slightly less than eight grams of heroin.\n\n            Sarruco told agents that he had ingested eighty-five\n\nheroin pellets2 and carried them to Puerto Rico on behalf of a drug\n\ndealer in Curacao named Andrés Hueck.     Upon his arrival in Puerto\n\nRico, Sarruco was under instructions to go to the Hotel San Jorge\n\nor the Hotel Iberia.    The buyer -- whose identity Sarruco did not\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Sarruco expelled the remaining eighty pellets at the San Juan\nHealth Center under the supervision of two customs agents.       In\ntotal, he carried approximately 678 grams of heroin.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fknow -- would meet him at the hotel with a bottle of laxatives and\n\npick up the heroin in exchange for $7,000.\n\n            With   Sarruco's    cooperation,   the   agents   set   up   a\n\n\"controlled delivery\" of the heroin pellets. They had Sarruco call\n\nHueck with a message that he was in Room 209 at the Hotel Iberia.\n\nHueck told Sarruco that someone would be coming, presumably to pick\n\nup the heroin.      Agent Luis Carmona, who was enlisted to act\n\nundercover as Sarruco's stand-in, took the five pellets that\n\nSarruco had expelled to Room 209 of the Hotel Iberia.               Agent\n\nCarmona put one of the pellets in a drawer in the night stand and\n\nput the other four pellets, wrapped in toilet paper, in a dresser\n\ndrawer.    Other agents set up audio and video surveillance of Rooms\n\n209 and 210, as well as surveillance outside the hotel.\n\n            Sometime after 4 p.m. on April 21, 2000, Gómez drove up\n\nto the Hotel Iberia in a green Ford Windstar.        He parked the van,\n\nleaving two passengers inside, and went into the hotel.         A Datsun\n\nparked in front of the van, and its driver also went inside the\n\nhotel.    When the Datsun's driver returned, two agents detained him\n\nfor questioning until a third agent exited the hotel, yelling that\n\nthey had the wrong person and that the man in the room was the\n\ndriver of the green van.       One of the passengers in the van jumped\n\ninto the front seat and drove away.       The agents pursued the van to\n\na dead end street, where the van's passengers fled on foot.          Upon\n\nsearching the van, the agents found a loaded gun in plain view\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fbetween the front seats.       They also seized a rental agreement\n\nlisting Fernando Gómez as an \"additional renter.\"\n\n           In the meantime, Gómez arrived at Room 209 of the hotel,\n\nwhere Agent Carmona was waiting pursuant to the instructions that\n\nHueck had given Sarruco. Carmona, posing as Sarruco, invited Gómez\n\ninside and gave him the four pellets wrapped in toilet paper.   When\n\nGómez asked Carmona how many he had swallowed, he responded eighty-\n\nfive.   Carmona told Gómez that he was having trouble expelling the\n\nremaining pellets.   Gómez told him that he needed a laxative and\n\noffered to get him one.   Gómez then placed the pellets back in the\n\ndresser drawer. Carmona went into the bathroom, ostensibly because\n\nhe was having stomach cramps.    Another agent, who had been hiding\n\nin the closet, then came out and arrested Gómez.\n\nB.         Legal proceedings\n\n           1. First indictment\n\n           On May 3, 2000, a grand jury returned a three-count\n\nindictment against Gómez and Sarruco.   Count One charged them with\n\naiding and abetting the importation of approximately 975 grams of\n\nheroin into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 952(a)\n\nand 963. Count Two charged the defendants with aiding and abetting\n\nthe unlawful possession with intent to distribute approximately 975\n\ngrams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).   Count Three\n\ncharged Gómez with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fcrime       (specifically,    possession         of    heroin   with     intent   to\n\ndistribute) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).\n\n               Gómez   went   to    trial   on    February      19,    2003.3     The\n\ngovernment presented several witnesses, including Sarruco and Agent\n\nCarmona, and played the audio and video surveillance tapes of\n\nGómez's interaction with Agent Carmona.                    Gómez rested without\n\npresenting any evidence.           At the close of evidence, he moved for a\n\njudgment of acquittal on all counts.                  The district court granted\n\nthe motion as to Counts Two (possession of heroin with intent to\n\ndistribute) and Three (possession of a firearm).                  With respect to\n\nCount Two, the court reasoned that Gómez did not exercise dominion\n\nand control over the drugs when he briefly inspected them in the\n\nhotel room, nor had he aided and abetted Sarruco's possession of\n\ndrugs because the two did not have a prior relationship.                    Because\n\nCount Three alleged possession of a gun in furtherance of the crime\n\nof drug possession, it necessarily turned on Count Two.                   Count One\n\n(importation) went to the jury, which could not agree on a verdict.\n\nThe court declared a mistrial and ordered the case to be reset for\n\ntrial.\n\n               2. Superseding indictment\n\n               Instead of retrying Gómez on the importation count, the\n\ngovernment obtained a two-count superseding indictment on March 12,\n\n2003.       Count One charged Gómez with conspiring to import into the\n\n\n        3\n            Sarruco pled guilty before the trial.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fUnited States approximately 975 grams of heroin in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 952(a) and 963.    Count Two charged Gómez with conspiring\n\nto possess with intent to distribute approximately 975 grams of\n\nheroin   in    violation    of   21   U.S.C.   §§   841(a)     and   846.\n\n             The charges in the superseding indictment were tried\n\nbefore a jury in June 2003. The government presented substantially\n\nthe same evidence that it had offered during the first trial.         The\n\ndefense presented two witnesses, Gómez and his mother, neither of\n\nwhom had testified at the first trial.         Gómez testified to an\n\nalternative version of events on the afternoon of his arrest.\n\nAccording to his testimony, he went to the Hotel Iberia on April 21\n\nto visit a woman named Bonnie whom he met the previous night while\n\nout with friends.     He knocked on the door of Room 209 believing\n\nthat it was Bonnie's room, and was surprised when a male (Agent\n\nCarmona, posing as Sarruco) emerged from the room.            As soon as\n\nGómez entered the room, the man told him that he was not feeling\n\nwell and began to rub his stomach.      Gómez asked the man if he was\n\nall right.    The man responded that he needed something to help him\n\n\"evacuate,\" and Gómez asked if he meant a laxative.          The man then\n\nhanded Gómez a package (the four heroin pellets wrapped in toilet\n\npaper), which Gómez put down without looking at its contents.4\n\n\n     4\n      Gómez's testimony on this point is inconsistent with the\naccount offered by Agent Carmona, who testified that Gómez looked\nthrough an open end of the package before putting it down and then\nasked how many he had swallowed. Based on such inconsistencies,\nthe court found at sentencing that \"the defendant . . . perjure[d]\n\n                                  -7-\n\fAfter saying that he had been in pain for several hours, the man\n\nexcused   himself   to   use   the   restroom   and   Gómez   was   arrested.\n\nGómez's mother testified regarding her relationship with Gómez and\n\nher contact with him in the week leading up to his arrest.\n\n           After approximately seven hours of deliberations, the\n\njury found that Gómez was not guilty as to Count One (conspiracy to\n\nimport) but guilty as to Count Two (conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute).         In response to a question on the jury\n\nverdict form, the jury decided that the amount of heroin involved\n\nwas less than 100 grams.\n\n           On November 4, 2003, the district court sentenced Gómez\n\nto 121 months in prison, the bottom of the applicable guidelines\n\nrange, and three years of supervised release.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.         Request for Self-Representation\n\n           It is well-settled that the Sixth Amendment encompasses\n\na right to self-representation by criminal defendants. See Faretta\n\nv. California, 422 U.S. 806, 814-17 (1975).           A criminal defendant\n\nhas the right to \"conduct his own defense, provided only that he\n\nknowingly and intelligently forgoes his right to counsel and that\n\nhe is able and willing to abide by rules of procedure and courtroom\n\nprotocol.\"   McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 173 (1984).\n\n\nhimself during trial when he was claiming that he was at the hotel\nto find this unknown female in an unknown room. I find that in\nfact he went to the hotel to pick up the drugs.\"\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           1. History\n\n           To set Gómez's Sixth Amendment claims in context, we\n\nbegin by reviewing the history of his representation in this case.\n\n           By April 2002, some two years after he was arrested and\n\nnine months before his first trial, Gómez -- though represented by\n\ncounsel -- had already filed more than two dozen pro se motions,\n\nmany of them long, confusing, contradictory, and devoid of merit.\n\nDenied bail early on, he nonetheless continued to seek release on\n\nbail.   He sought mandamus against the government several times.    A\n\nnumber of motions repeatedly sought dismissal of the indictment on\n\nfanciful theories or claims of misconduct.   One, for example, was\n\ncaptioned \"Motion to dismiss the indictment based on some or all\n\nthe violation committed by the government against federal and state\n\nlaws and defendants constitutional rights or for appeal.\"     Other\n\nmotions asked the court to explain why it had denied earlier\n\nmotions or to reconsider the denials and rule in his favor.        He\n\nthus filed repetitive motions on subjects already ruled on.\n\n           Further, some of Gómez's filings were not motions in the\n\nproper sense, but instead rants directed at the district court and\n\nattorneys for both sides.    On July 31, 2001, for example, Gómez\n\nsubmitted a motion entitled \"Motion to set time and place for the\n\ntrial,\" in which he argued that his trial should be held in Florida\n\n\"due to all the complecety and friendship that there is between\n\nattornney and U.S. Attorneys\" and because \"it is the law that the\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fpersonal wishes or convenience of the judge are not factor to be\n\nconsidered in determining the proper place of trial.\"                   And on\n\nAugust 29, 2001, Gómez filed a motion entitled \"Pro-se motion\n\nclaiming duprocess violation by the court by dismissing defendant's\n\npro-se motion under not justifiable grond, after the defendant\n\nbeing wheting way over two month for this honorable court to rules\n\nup on those motion.\"\n\n           On April 12, 2002, Gómez asked the court to permit his\n\nthen-counsel Bruce McGiverin to withdraw so that he could proceed\n\npro se.   The court agreed, but in order to minimize pro se motions\n\nthat were so incomprehensible as to be a \"total waste of time\" for\n\nthe court, the court appointed McGiverin as standby counsel and\n\ntold him to read Gómez's pro se motions, \"advis[e] the court what\n\nmotions   you   as   a   professional   would   adopt,\"   and   offer    Gómez\n\ndrafting advice.     The court stated that regardless of McGiverin's\n\nopinions, Gómez would be free to file the motions, which would then\n\nbe filtered by a magistrate judge.\n\n           After the April 12, 2002 order, Gómez filed several dozen\n\nmore pro se motions, including many after he retained a new counsel\n\nof record, Linda George, and despite the fact that his various\n\ncounsel had filed all of the customary discovery and other motions.\n\nThese new pro se motions were confusing and many were meritless.\n\nOn May 14, 2003, for example, Gómez filed an eight-page, single-\n\nspaced motion, accompanied by a four-page affidavit, asking that\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthe case be dismissed for \"double jeopardy\" (of which there was\n\nnone).       The   motion     stated   that    \"even   knowing\"   that    Gómez's\n\naffidavit was based on government perjury, \"the District Court\n\n. . . has desregarded and/or ignored the matter by not holding a\n\nhearing as to the issue.\"\n\n             We quote such passages not to make light of Gómez's\n\nmotions, but to emphasize the difficulties they created for the\n\ndistrict court.        The court received dozens of such filings over a\n\nthree-year period, many of them quite long and packed with muddled,\n\ncontradictory, meritless legal argument.               Each needed a response\n\nfrom   the    court,    and    many    led    to   hearings,   not   to   mention\n\nappearances by counsel and replies from the government.                   Despite\n\nthe burden Gómez's pro se motions imposed, the district court did\n\nnot treat them lightly.         It ruled on many of them, denying the vast\n\nmajority but allowing some.            Most of those it found to have merit\n\nhad to do with Gómez's various requests for dismissal of his\n\nlawyers, for extensions of time, and for transcripts of previous\n\nhearings.\n\n             By May 2003, the defense had filed more than 95 motions,\n\nthe majority of which were pro se.             One such pro se motion, which\n\nGómez filed on March 28, 2003, sought the withdrawal of his then-\n\ncounsel George.      The court held a hearing on Gómez's motion on May\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f22, 2003.5    The court first informed Gómez that it would not allow\n\nGeorge to withdraw and to be replaced by a court-appointed attorney\n\nbecause   Gómez    had   not   offered   a   valid   reason   for   his\n\ndissatisfaction with George.\n\n             George suggested that Gómez proceed pro se while she\n\nacted as standby counsel.        The court initially rejected that\n\nproposal, noting that it had made a similar arrangement with\n\nMcGiverin but that \"there were a considerable [number] of motions\n\nthat were filed that were either thoroughly out of bounds or were\n\nsimply not indicated for this type of case.      So therefore, I have\n\nto stop him.      There is a moment when the court has to stop\n\nreceiving all those motions.\"     After several more exchanges, the\n\ncourt agreed to allow Gómez to proceed pro se with George acting as\n\nstandby counsel.     The court explained the duties it assigned to\n\nGeorge, now acting as standby counsel:\n\n     Court: [T]he first thing I have to ask you is to examine\n     all the motions that he's filed [pro se], and to see\n     which ones you're going to adopt. And then adopt them\n     . . . by doing a refiling. The court . . . will not\n\n\n     5\n      Gómez cites the two-month interval between the filing of his\nmotion and the hearing as evidence of the district court's\n\"indifference to the defendant's assertion of an absolute Sixth\nAmendment right.\" This claim is manifestly unfair to the district\ncourt, which expended a great deal of effort in attempting to\naccommodate Gómez. Moreover, there was good reason for the delay.\nShortly after Gómez filed his motion, the district court judge\ntemporarily recused himself from the case and reassigned all\npending motions to a magistrate judge. The magistrate promptly\nissued an order giving George an opportunity to respond to the\nmotion to withdraw, and scheduled the hearing a month later, by\nwhich point the district court judge had returned to the case.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f     authorize his participation pro se unless you do a\n     screening of the motions.\n     George: I will, Your Honor. I'll go over every one.\n     Court: That's the only way I'm going to permit it. Pro\n     se is out of the question.     It's out of the question\n     because you cannot handle what is appropriate. You don't\n     know enough law, what is appropriate for a case. And you\n     keep filing motions that are totally out of bounds with\n     the facts and with the law. . . . I'm not going to have\n     the U.S. Attorney answer some of these motions that I\n     understand are totally out of bounds.\n     George: I will review those and I'll refile them.\n     Court: Refile those that you understand, that you . . .\n     as a member of the court deem to be applicable to this\n     case.   And I urge that you use your discretion as a\n     lawyer and your reputation as a lawyer before this court.\n     That's all I have to say. I feel totally at ease if you\n     do that.\n     George: Okay.\n     Court: All right. And that's the only way I'm going to\n     allow you to represent yourself in this case. That's it.\n     Gómez: Your Honor, if that's what you want, I mean --\n     Court: It's not what I want. This is what the court must\n     do, considering the history of motions that have been\n     filed in this case.\n     Gómez: Your Honor, but the thing is most have been filed\n     because they need to be filed. Any of the motions --\n     Court: As long as they are reviewed by counsel, I have no\n     problems.\n\nThe court thus allowed Gómez to proceed pro se but imposed the\n\ncondition that George review motions written by Gómez and refuse to\n\nfile those that were, in the court's words, \"totally out of bounds\n\nwith the facts and with the law.\"\n\n          Following the May 22 hearing, Gómez participated fully in\n\njury selection. Trial then began before a different district court\n\njudge.   Before the jury was sworn in on the trial's first day,\n\nthere was some confusion as to Gómez's status. The judge indicated\n\nthat he thought Gómez was proceeding with counsel.   However, Gómez\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fand George quickly clarified that the May 22 order allowed Gómez to\n\nrepresent himself. Gómez told the court, and George verified, that\n\n\"I was supposed to be represented by myself, pro se.\"    He went on\n\nto explain that \"Mr. Domínguez, the judge . . . addressed the\n\nmatter and he decided for me to be represented by myself with Linda\n\nGeorge as helping counsel.   I was permitted to address the court.\"\n\nAfter hearing this, the judge questioned Gómez to confirm that he\n\nhad knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel.6      The\n\njudge then agreed that Gómez could represent himself, and noted\n\nthat George was standby counsel \"in the event that [Gómez] ha[s]\n\nquestions or any information [he] need[s] from her.\"    When it came\n\ntime for Gómez to deliver his opening statement, however, Gómez\n\ninformed the trial judge that he did not have a statement prepared.\n\nThe judge told Gómez that he could make (or waive) the statement\n\n\n\n     6\n      Before concluding that the waiver of the right to counsel was\nknowing and voluntary, the trial judge took great pains to ensure\nthat Gómez had \"a sense of the magnitude of the undertaking,\"\nMaynard v. Meachum, 545 F.2d 273, 279 (1st Cir. 1976).          For\nexample, the judge warned Gómez:\n\n     I think it is unwise of you to try to represent yourself.\n     You are not familiar with the law in spite of what you\n     think. You are not familiar with court procedure . . .\n     and you are not familiar with the Rules of Evidence in\n     spite of what you think. This is a very serious set of\n     charges. If you represent yourself, you're going to be\n     bound by the result and you can't come back to me later\n     and say, 'Gee, I made a horrible mistake and now, I think\n     I ought to do it all over again with an attorney. I urge\n     you strongly, in the strongest possible terms, because I\n     think you are making a big mistake, not to try to\n     represent yourself.\n\n                               -14-\n\fhimself, retaining his pro se status, or allow George to make the\n\nstatement, relinquishing his pro se status. Faced with waiving his\n\nopening   statement,    Gómez   allowed    George   to    take   over     his\n\nrepresentation.\n\n          Although     George   represented    Gómez     at   trial,    Gómez\n\ncontinued to file pro se motions after the trial pursuant to the\n\nguidelines set forth in the court's May 22 order, i.e., screening\n\nby George.     Gómez was also permitted to participate actively in a\n\npost-judgment motions hearing on August 27, 2003.7            As the court\n\nexplained at the hearing, \"[y]ou're authorized to speak to the\n\ncourt. . . .    One thing is to speak to the court and another is to\n\nbe filing motions.       Two totally different things.\"           With the\n\ncourt's permission, both Gómez and his counsel participated at his\n\nsentencing hearing on November 4, 2003.\n\n          2. October 2001 motion to proceed pro se\n\n          Gómez first argues that the district court erred in\n\nhandling his October 2, 2001 motion to remove his then-counsel\n\nMcGiverin8 and to proceed pro se.         Specifically, Gómez maintains\n\n\n     7\n      The August 27, 2003 hearing involved another change of\ncounsel. Gómez had filed a civil suit against George, creating a\nconflict of interest between the two. The court concluded that in\nlight of the conflict of interest, it had to allow George to\nwithdraw. The court again agreed to let Gómez \"proceed pro se with\nstandby counsel\" subject to a limitation that \"standby counsel is\nthe only person authorized to sign motions,\" and appointed attorney\nMiriam Ramos Grateroles as the standby counsel.\n     8\n      Gómez claimed that McGiverin would not file motions that\nGómez believed were necessary to his defense and to preserve his\n\n                                  -15-\n\fthat the court did not comply with its duty to determine whether\n\nthe motion constituted a valid waiver of his right to counsel and\n\nthat, instead, the court \"effectively ignored the motion, failing\n\nto conduct a hearing on it for more than six months\" and then\n\nrejected the motion \"out of hand.\"\n\n          Gómez's account of these proceedings does not square with\n\nthe record.     The court did not \"effectively ignore[]\" Gómez's\n\nmotion to proceed pro se.    To the contrary, the court scheduled a\n\nhearing on the motion for October 15, 2001, two weeks after it had\n\nbeen filed.   The hearing had to be rescheduled, however, after the\n\nUnited States marshals informed the court that Gómez was out of\n\ncontrol, exhibiting violent behavior and expressing ill will toward\n\nhis mother and his lawyer.   Faced with this information, together\n\nwith the fact that McGiverin was the fifth attorney that Gómez\n\nfired or sought to have removed, the court concluded that it had\n\n\"no other alternative but to order [Gómez's] psychiatric evaluation\n\nimmediately.\"   Such an evaluation was entirely appropriate under\n\nthe circumstances, see Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 400 (1993)\n\n(noting that a court must determine that a defendant seeking to\n\nwaive counsel is competent), and Gómez does not contend otherwise.\n\n          The sealed psychiatric examination was filed with the\n\ncourt on February 1, 2002.   On February 15, 2002, the court issued\n\na sealed order finding the defendant competent to stand trial. The\n\n\nappellate rights.\n\n                                -16-\n\fcourt subsequently granted a motion by Gómez to discuss his legal\n\nrepresentation, scheduling a hearing for April 12, 2002.                          At the\n\nApril 12 hearing, the court expressed concern about Gómez's ability\n\nto represent himself effectively, noting that he had \"fill[ed] this\n\nrecord with totally incoherent motions, which are contradictory and\n\ntaken totally out of context.\"                 Nevertheless, the court granted\n\nGómez's motion to proceed pro se, subject to a requirement that he\n\nhave standby counsel.9\n\n               A    court   may    appoint     standby    counsel    even    over    the\n\ndefendant's objections. See United States v. Kneeland, 148 F.3d 6,\n\n13 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that \"a trial court may appoint standby\n\ncounsel against a defendant's wishes\"). Thus, the requirement that\n\nMcGiverin act as standby counsel in this case was not inconsistent\n\nwith Gómez's pro se status.              Cf. United States v. Walsh, 742 F.2d\n\n1006, 1007 (6th Cir. 1984) (per curiam) (holding that standby\n\ncounsel       did    not    eviscerate      the      defendant's    right    to    self-\n\nrepresentation where the defendant \"was required to submit his\n\nmotions       to    advisory      counsel      for    review\").      Indeed,       Gómez\n\nrepresented himself at a bail hearing within days of the court\n\ngranting his motion for self-representation.                      Although McGiverin\n\nalso       participated     in    the   bail   hearing     by   delivering    a    final\n\n\n\n       9\n      Although there was some ambiguity during the hearing as to\nMcGiverin's exact role as standby counsel, the court ultimately\nexplained that it wanted McGiverin to examine Gómez's pro se\nmotions, but that Gómez retained control over their filing.\n\n                                            -17-\n\fargument, he did so only in response to an explicit request by\n\nGómez.10\n\n            In short, Gómez's claims that the court rejected his\n\nOctober 2, 2001 motion for self-representation \"out of hand\" and\n\nthat    \"[a]t   no   time   did   the   [district   court]   allow   [him]   to\n\nrepresent himself\" are flatly incorrect.            The court did not err in\n\nhandling the motion to proceed pro se.\n\n            2. May 22, 2003 screening order\n\n            Gómez next faults the court's handling of his motion to\n\nhave his counsel -- this time, his sixth attorney, Linda George --\n\nwithdraw and to proceed pro se.          Emphasizing that Gómez's previous\n\npro se motions had been incomprehensible, the court ruled on May\n\n22, 2003 that Gómez could represent himself only if George filtered\n\nand approved his motions before they were filed.             On appeal, Gómez\n\nasserts that this ruling violated his Sixth Amendment right to\n\nself-representation.        We disagree.\n\n            Gómez first contends that the court's May 22 order denied\n\nhis request to proceed pro se and therefore violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right of self-representation.             See Faretta, 422 U.S. at\n\n807.    The record does not support this claim.           The court did not\n\ndeny Gómez's request to proceed pro se.                 Rather, as we have\n\n\n\n       10\n      Gómez employed this hybrid representation arrangement again\nat a motions hearing on August 15, 2002, representing himself\nthroughout much of the hearing but asking McGiverin, his standby\ncounsel, to cross-examine a witness about an evidentiary issue.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fdescribed, it granted the request but imposed one limitation on\n\nGómez's self-representation -- namely, a requirement that George,\n\nas standby counsel, screen Gómez's motions. Gómez was permitted to\n\nrepresent himself in other areas, including at jury selection.            As\n\nthe court explained during a hearing on August 27, 2003, the May 22\n\norder left Gómez free to \"speak to the court,\" just not to \"file\n\nmotions on your own.\"       We therefore reject Gómez's claim that the\n\ncourt denied his request to represent himself \"out of hand.\"\n\n             Perhaps anticipating this result, Gómez also asserts that\n\nGeorge's unwelcome participation as standby counsel -- i.e., her\n\nscreening of the motions -- so interfered with his right of self-\n\nrepresentation as to \"effectively render[] his right to self-\n\nrepresentation meaningless.\"       Armant v. Marquez, 772 F.2d 552, 558\n\n(9th Cir. 1985).        We consider this claim under the standards set\n\nforth in McKaskle v. Wiggins, which dealt with the role that\n\nstandby counsel, present at trial over the defendant's objections,\n\nmay   play    without     eviscerating     the   Faretta   right   of   self-\n\nrepresentation.      The McKaskle Court identified two criteria as\n\nbeing central to its analysis:\n\n           First, the pro se defendant is entitled to preserve\n      actual control over the case he chooses to present to the\n      jury. . . . If standby counsel's participation over the\n      defendant's objection effectively allows counsel to make\n      or substantially interfere with any significant tactical\n      decisions . . . or to speak instead of the defendant on\n      any matter of importance, the Faretta right is eroded.\n\n           Second, participation by standby counsel without the\n      defendant's consent should not be allowed to destroy the\n\n                                    -19-\n\f     jury's perception that the defendant is representing\n     himself.\n\n465 U.S. at 178.\n\n            Gómez first asserts that as a result of the court's\n\nscreening order, he was \"unable to submit motions that counsel did\n\nnot approve of.\"         Because this contention pertains solely to\n\nGeorge's participation in Gómez's motions practice, which occurred\n\noutside the presence of the jury, only the first prong of the\n\nMcKaskle analysis is relevant to our inquiry.                 See id. at 179.\n\n(\"Participation by standby counsel outside the presence of the jury\n\nengages only the first of these two limitations.\").                Gómez has not\n\ndemonstrated that his Faretta right was \"eroded\" according to this\n\nstandard.\n\n            Although it is true that he could not submit a motion\n\nwithout George's approval, Gómez has not identified on appeal any\n\nmotions that George prevented him from filing.              Indeed, the record\n\nincludes a number of pro se motions that were drafted by Gómez and\n\nfiled by George after the court's May 22 order. Moreover, George's\n\nability to block Gómez from filing motions that were irrelevant or\n\n\"totally    out   of   bounds\"   cannot    be   said   to   constitute   either\n\ninterference with a \"significant tactical decision\" or a preemption\n\nof Gómez's ability to speak on a \"matter of importance.\" McKaskle,\n\n465 U.S. at 178.       Rather, the court designated George as standby\n\ncounsel,    and   defined    her   role,    to    \"ensure    the    defendant's\n\ncompliance with basic rules of courtroom protocol and procedure,\"\n\n                                    -20-\n\fa practice that does not infringe on a pro se defendant's Faretta\n\nrights.   Id. at 183.\n\n           Basic rules of courtroom protocol and procedure impose an\n\nobligation, both on counsel and on individuals acting as their own\n\ncounsel, to comply with court rules and not file frivolous motions.\n\nFederal   courts   \"possess   discretionary   powers   to   regulate   the\n\nconduct of abusive litigants.\"        Cok v. Family Court of Rhode\n\nIsland, 985 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 1993).       This power includes the\n\nability to enjoin a party -- even a pro se party -- from filing\n\nfrivolous and vexatious motions.     Sires v. Fair, No. 96-1454, 1997\n\nWL 51408 (1st Cir. Feb. 10, 1997) (unpublished); Castro v. United\n\nStates, 775 F.2d 399, 408 (1st Cir. 1995) (abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Stevens v. Dep't of the Treasury, 500 U.S. 1 (1991)).\n\nThis court reviews such orders for abuse of discretion.          Castro,\n\n775 F.2d at 408.     In fact, in a parallel situation, we upheld a\n\ndistrict court order which enjoined a pro se litigant \"from filing\n\nany motions, pleadings or papers . . . without prior leave of the\n\nCourt,\" Hart v. United States, No. 92-1801, 1994 WL 89442, at *1\n\n(1st Cir. Mar. 22, 1994), where the defendant had \"deluged the\n\ncourt with at least sixty-six different motions, most of them pro\n\nse.\"   Id. (quoting United States v. Hart, 933 F.2d 80, 81-82 (1st\n\nCir. 1991)).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f          Gómez nevertheless maintains that George's screening role\n\nwas inconsistent with his right of self-representation.              His\n\nargument relies on the Court's statement in McKaskle that\n\n     Faretta rights [to self-representation] are adequately\n     vindicated in proceedings outside the presence of the\n     jury if the pro se defendant is allowed to address the\n     court freely on his own behalf and if disagreements\n     between counsel and the pro se defendant are resolved in\n     the defendant's favor whenever the matter is one that\n     would normally be left to the discretion of counsel.\n\nMcKaskle, 465 U.S. at 179.      Gómez asserts that as long as George\n\nwas screening his motions, he was unable to \"address the court\n\nfreely\" and that by allowing George, rather than Gómez, to decide\n\nwhich motions to file, the court failed to resolve disagreements in\n\nfavor of the defendant, all in contravention of McKaskle.\n\n          The statement from McKaskle on which Gómez relies cannot\n\nbe read in isolation.       That statement was a reiteration of the\n\nfirst prong of the test set forth earlier in the opinion, namely\n\nthe requirement that standby counsel's unwelcome participation not\n\n\"substantially interfere with any significant tactical decisions\"\n\nor result in counsel \"speak[ing] instead of the defendant on any\n\nmatter of importance.\"       Id. at 178 (emphasis omitted).          This\n\nformulation informs the meaning of the reiteration relied upon by\n\nGómez. Moreover, that reiteration must also be read in conjunction\n\nwith the Court's subsequent statement that there is no \"significant\n\ninterference   with   the    defendant's   actual   control   over   the\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fpresentation of his defense, and thus no infringement of his\n\nFaretta      rights,       when    \"counsel       merely     helps    to   ensure      the\n\ndefendant's compliance with basic rules of courtroom protocol and\n\nprocedure.\"      McKaskle, 465 U.S. at 183.                The McKaskle Court also\n\nemphasized that \"[t]he trial judge may be required to make numerous\n\nrulings reconciling the participation of standby counsel with a pro\n\nse defendant's objection to that participation; nothing in the\n\nnature of the Faretta right suggests that the usual deference to\n\n'judgment calls' on these issues by the trial judge should not\n\nobtain here as elsewhere.\"                Id. at 177 n.8.\n\n             Taken        together,       these     explanations      of    permissible\n\nparticipation        by    standby        counsel    indicate       that   the   pro   se\n\ndefendant's right to \"address the court freely\" is not absolute.\n\nRather, the court may use standby counsel to facilitate the orderly\n\nfunctioning of the proceedings so long as the defendant retains\n\ncontrol over \"significant tactical decisions\" and \"on any matter of\n\nimportance.\"         George's screening role was consistent with that\n\nstandard.     In light of Gómez's long history in this case of filing\n\nirrelevant     and     frivolous      motions,       George's   responsibility         for\n\npreventing the filing of such motions did not deprive Gómez of\n\ncontrol over his defense.             Cf. United States v. Collins, 920 F.2d\n\n619,   627    (10th       Cir.    1990)    (noting    that    \"an    attorney    may    be\n\ndismissed for pursuing frivolous theories\"); United States v.\n\nMasat, 896 F.2d 88, 92 (5th Cir. 1990) (same); Model Rules of\n\n\n                                            -23-\n\fProf'l Conduct R. 3.1 (2003) (noting that \"[a] lawyer shall not .\n\n. . assert    . . . an issue . . . unless there is a basis in law and\n\nfact for doing so that is not frivolous\").\n\n             Gómez   also    asserts   that   George's    unwelcome   standby\n\nparticipation violated the limits set forth in McKaskle because it\n\nleft him unable to call witnesses who would have corroborated a\n\ncertain aspect of his testimony.         Gómez's argument appears to rely\n\non the following logic: the court's May 22 order regarding George's\n\nscreening role led him to believe that he would not be permitted to\n\nproceed   pro   se   at     trial;   Gómez    therefore   arrived   at   trial\n\nunprepared to represent himself; although the trial judge agreed to\n\nlet Gómez proceed pro se, Gómez's lack of preparation forced him to\n\nask George to take over his representation before his opening\n\nstatement;11 this relinquishment of his pro se status meant that\n\nGeorge, rather than Gómez, chose which witnesses to present.               In\n\nshort, Gómez contends that, but for George's screening role, he\n\nwould have represented himself at trial and called witnesses that\n\nGeorge chose not to call.\n\n             It is true that the judge presiding over Gómez's second\n\ntrial initially was confused as to whether the court's May 22 order\n\n\n     11\n      As already noted, when it became apparent that Gómez had not\nprepared an opening statement, the trial judge informed Gómez that\nhe could make (or waive) the statement himself, retaining his pro\nse status, or allow George to make the statement, relinquishing his\npro se status. Faced with waiving his opening statement, Gómez\nallowed George to take over his representation and to conduct his\ndefense.\n\n                                       -24-\n\frestricted Gómez's pro se status only with regard to motions, or\n\nwith regard to his self-representation more generally.                  Given\n\nGómez's claim on appeal that he was unprepared because he did not\n\nbelieve he would be allowed to represent himself, however, it is\n\nGómez's understanding of the pre-trial record, rather than the\n\ntrial judge's understanding, that is relevant.            As we have already\n\nobserved, Gómez told the trial judge that he was \"supposed to\"\n\nrepresent himself and that the previous district court judge had\n\n\"decided for me to be represented by myself with Linda George as\n\nhelping counsel.    I was permitted to address the court.\"              These\n\nstatements indicate that Gómez thought that he had been granted pro\n\nse status prior to the trial, undermining his claim that he\n\ninterpreted the court's May 22 screening order to preclude him from\n\nrepresenting himself at trial.         Gómez's lack of preparation at the\n\noutset of the second trial was his own fault.               His decision to\n\nrelinquish   his   pro   se   status    as   a   result   of   that   lack   of\n\npreparation was entirely voluntary.              The claim that George's\n\nscreening role prevented Gómez from representing himself at trial\n\nand calling particular witnesses is therefore without merit.12\n\n\n     12\n      Nor is there merit to Gómez's claim that the court should\nhave granted a continuance on the morning of trial, sua sponte, to\ngive him additional time to prepare, or alternatively, allowed a\nhybrid representation arrangement under which George could make the\nopening statement before allowing Gómez to resume his self-\nrepresentation.   See United States v. Betancourt-Arretuche, 933\nF.2d 89, 95 (1st Cir. 1991) (discussing both the court's discretion\nto permit hybrid representation and the relevance of timeliness of\nrequests for pro se representation and/or a continuance).\n\n                                   -25-\n\fB.        Constructive amendment of the indictment\n\n          Count Two of the superseding indictment charged Gómez\n\nwith conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute approximately\n\n975 grams of heroin.   At the close of the second trial, the jurors\n\nwere given a special verdict form that read, in part:\n\n     COUNT II.     CONSPIRACY TO POSSESS WITH INTENT TO\n     DISTRIBUTE HEROIN\n     3.   We, the jury, find the defendant Fernando Gómez-\n     Rosario         (guilty/not guilty).\n\n     4.

New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000), that a jury find, beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, any facts needed to impose a sentence in excess\n\nof the default statutory maximum. See United States v. Perez-Ruiz,\n\n353 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (applying Apprendi to drug type and\n\nquantity determinations), cert denied, 541 U.S. 1005 (2004).13\n\n\n     13\n      The default statutory maximum for conspiracy to possess with\nintent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a), the\ncrime specified in Count II of the superseding indictment, is\n\n                                -26-\n\f            After approximately three hours of deliberations, the\n\njury sent a note asking the court to explain \"the importance of 100\n\ngrams of heroin when the defendant is guilty or not guilty.\"                 The\n\ncourt asked counsel for a suggested response.              Gómez's counsel\n\nresponded that \"I think the court should just read what was on the\n\nverdict sheet again.        I don't think we should get into any\n\nexplanation.\"      The    court    substantially       complied    with     this\n\nsuggestion, instructing the jury that \"under the law, on a finding\n\nof guilty, the jury is required to answer the question regarding\n\nquantity.    On a finding of not guilty, the jury should not answer\n\nthe question regarding quantity.\" The jury subsequently determined\n\nthat Gómez was guilty on Count II but that the amount of heroin\n\ninvolved was less than 100 grams.\n\n            On appeal, Gómez argues that through the special verdict\n\nquestion    regarding    drug   quantity   and   the    corresponding       jury\n\ninstructions,    the    district   court   constructively         amended    the\n\nsuperseding indictment in contravention of the Fifth Amendment.                A\n\nconstructive amendment, which is prejudicial per se, \"occurs when\n\nthe charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally\n\n\ntwenty years.    See Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 15.      Because the\nsuperseding indictment alleged 975 grams of heroin, a conviction\nhad the potential to trigger a sentence above the default maximum.\nSee 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(i) (providing a 40-year maximum\nsentence for violations involving 100 grams or more of heroin).\nFor a conviction to actually trigger the higher statutory maximum,\nhowever, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the\nconspiracy was responsible for at least 100 grams of heroin. See\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 15.\n\n                                   -27-\n\for in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last\n\npassed upon them.\"    United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462-63\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nGómez contends that the district court changed the terms of the\n\nsuperseding indictment in this case when it allowed the jury to\n\ndetermine, via the special verdict form, whether Gómez was part of\n\na conspiracy to possess less than 100 grams of heroin.   In support\n\nof this contention, Gómez asserts that because the superseding\n\nindictment charged him with conspiring to possess approximately 975\n\ngrams of heroin, it must have referred to a conspiracy with Hueck\n\nand Sarruco to possess all eighty-five heroin pellets that Sarruco\n\nswallowed (which actually weighed 678 grams).   He reasons that if\n\nthe jury had found him guilty of this conspiracy, it would have\n\nindicated on the special verdict form that the amount of heroin was\n\nmore than 100 grams.      Because the jury found instead that the\n\namount of heroin was less than 100 grams, Gómez contends that it\n\nmust have convicted him of a conspiracy other than the one charged\n\n-- specifically, an ad hoc conspiracy with Agent Carmona (posing as\n\nSarruco) to possess the four heroin pellets present in the hotel\n\nroom, which weighed approximately 32 grams.   We disagree.\n\n          No specific drug quantity needs to be proven for a jury\n\nto convict a defendant of conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute.   See United States v. Restrepo-Contreras, 942 F.2d 96,\n\n99 n.1 (1st Cir. 1991).    It is therefore not erroneous per se to\n\n\n                                -28-\n\fallow a jury to find that a defendant is guilty of the crime\n\ncharged but responsible for a lesser quantity of drugs than that\n\nspecified in the indictment.     See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz\n\nSolorio, 337 F.3d 580, 589-91 (6th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540\n\nU.S. 1063 (2003).    Gómez does not contend otherwise.   He argues\n\ninstead that, in this particular case, the effect of the special\n\nverdict question regarding drug quantity was to allow the jury to\n\nconsider two different conspiracies, one charged and one uncharged.\n\n          While Gómez's argument is creative, it is ultimately\n\nunpersuasive.   The court asked the jury to determine the drug\n\nquantity not to present it with an uncharged conspiracy, but rather\n\nto ascertain a fact necessary for sentencing. The court instructed\n\nthe jury that it should convict Gómez on Count II only upon a\n\nfinding that \"the agreement specified in the indictment, and not\n\nsome other agreement or agreements, existed between at least two\n\npeople to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute\n\nit\" (emphasis added).     It further instructed the jury that it\n\nshould reach the question of drug quantity only upon a finding that\n\nGómez was guilty.   Nothing in these instructions suggests that the\n\njury was free to convict Gómez for a conspiracy other than the one\n\ncharged in the superseding indictment. See United States v. Owens,\n\n167 F.3d 739, 756 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that \"our system of trial\n\nby jury is premised on the assumption that jurors will scrupulously\n\nfollow the court's instructions\"). Rather, the instructions and\n\n\n                                -29-\n\fspecial verdict form left room for the jury to determine that Gómez\n\nhad   participated    in   the   charged   conspiracy   but   to   limit   his\n\nresponsibility to a lower amount. Neither the special verdict form\n\nnor the instructions accompanying it constituted a constructive\n\namendment of the superseding indictment.14\n\nC.         Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n           To establish that the defendant is guilty on a conspiracy\n\ncharge, the government must prove that \"an agreement existed to\n\ncommit the underlying substantive offense, and that the defendant\n\nelected to join the agreement, intending that the underlying\n\noffense be committed.\"      United States v. Medina-Martinez, 396 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 1955 (2005).            Gómez\n\nasserts that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of a\n\nconspiracy in this case because there was no one with whom he could\n\nhave conspired.      We review a sufficiency of the evidence claim de\n\nnovo, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\n\n\n      14\n      Gómez asserts that the district court could have avoided the\nalleged constructive amendment by explaining to the jury that its\nfinding on drug quantity was relevant only to sentencing. Gómez\nfailed to preserve an objection to the jury instructions, in which\nthe court properly told the jury that it should answer the drug\nquantity question only if it found that Gómez was guilty. Gómez\ndid not object to the instruction after it was given. Moreover,\nwhen the court asked for input on a response to the jury's note\nabout \"the importance of 100 grams of heroin,\" Gómez agreed that no\nadditional explanation regarding the significance of the drug\nquantity was necessary. Even if the instruction that he suggests\non appeal would have been useful in avoiding jury confusion, the\ncourt's failure to give it certainly was not reversible error.\n\n                                    -30-\n\fverdict.   See United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 266 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).   \"Our inquiry is only whether the guilty verdict finds\n\nsupport in a plausible rendition of the record.\"        Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).   The remedy for a successful sufficiency\n\nof the evidence challenge is an order directing a judgment of\n\nacquittal.    See Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 18 (1978)\n\n(\"Since we hold today that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a\n\nsecond trial once the reviewing court has found the evidence\n\nlegally insufficient, the only 'just' remedy available for that\n\ncourt is the direction of a judgment of acquittal.\").\n\n           1. Evidence of an ad hoc conspiracy with Carmona\n\n           Gómez's first sufficiency of the evidence claim rests on\n\nhis contention that the jury convicted him of an ad hoc conspiracy\n\nformed with Agent Carmona in the hotel room, rather than the\n\ncharged    conspiracy   involving   Hueck,   Sarruco,   and   others.\n\nEmphasizing that \"there can be no conspiracy as a matter of law\n\nsolely between a defendant and a government agent,\"     United States\n\nv. Castellini, 392 F.3d 35, 51 n.11 (1st Cir. 2004), Gómez asserts\n\nthat there was no evidence to support a conviction for the ad hoc\n\nconspiracy.   We have already rejected the premise underlying this\n\nsufficiency of the evidence claim.     Hence, we reject the related\n\nsufficiency of the evidence claim on the same basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                -31-\n\f            2. Evidence of a conspiracy with Hueck and Sarruco\n\n            Gómez next argues that he could not be convicted of the\n\ncharged conspiracy because there was insufficient evidence to\n\nconnect him to either Sarruco, the drug courier, or Hueck, the drug\n\nsupplier.      With   regard     to    Sarruco,    Gómez   contends    that   the\n\ngovernment    is    estopped    from    claiming    that   the   two   were   co-\n\nconspirators because, in granting a judgment of acquittal in the\n\nfirst trial, the district court found that \"the only evidence in\n\nthis case about the relationship between Gómez and Sarruco is that\n\nthere was no relationship.\"            With regard to Hueck, Gómez simply\n\nasserts that there was no evidence of a relationship between the\n\ntwo, and therefore no possible criminal agreement.                 We consider\n\nthese claims in turn.\n\n            a. Sarruco\n\n            Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, \"when an issue\n\nof ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final\n\njudgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same\n\nparties in any future lawsuit.\"          Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443\n\n(1970).     Gómez asserts that the district court determined during\n\nhis first trial that he had no relationship with Sarruco, and\n\ntherefore that the government could not attempt to show during the\n\nsecond    trial    that   he   and    Sarruco   were   co-conspirators.       The\n\ndistrict court, however, made no such finding during the first\n\ntrial.    It concluded only that there was no personal relationship\n\n                                        -32-\n\fbetween Gómez and Sarruco sufficient to support a charge that Gómez\n\naided and abetted Sarruco's drug possession.15    The court did not\n\ndetermine that the lack of a personal relationship would preclude\n\nthe two from being co-conspirators.      To the contrary, the court\n\nsuggested that the facts likely would support the existence of a\n\nconspiracy.16    The court's finding in the first trial that Sarruco\n\nand Gómez did not know each other therefore did not preclude the\n\ngovernment from arguing in the second trial that the two were co-\n\nconspirators.    See, e.g., United States v. Soto-Beníquez, 356 F.3d\n\n1, 19 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"The government need not show that each\n\nconspirator knew of or had contact with all other members.\"), cert.\n\ndenied, 124 S. Ct. 2432 (2004).\n\n          There is ample circumstantial evidence that Sarruco and\n\nGómez were part of a conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to\n\ndistribute it.    Sarruco told Hueck that he was waiting in Room 209\n\n\n\n     15\n      The court explained that \"[t]he only evidence in this case\nabout the relationship between Gómez and Sarruco is that there was\nno relationship. That Sarruco did not know Gómez, never had met\nGómez, wouldn't recognize Gómez, didn't know who Gómez was. Didn't\nhave any care who showed up at the door. And Sarruco is the one\nwho possessed [the heroin]. . . . And this is framed not as a\nconspiracy, but as he aided and abetted Sarruco. So this question\nis, what did he do to aid and abet Sarruco's possession.\" (Emphasis\nadded.)\n     16\n      Specifically, the court noted that Gómez was \"part of the\ndistributive chain\" but that \"it's a different matter to say he\npossessed [the heroin] with intent to distribute. He tried to, he\nwould have had he not been arrested quickly. It was an attempted\npossession, probably a conspiracy, but none of that has been\ncharged.\"\n\n                                 -33-\n\fof the Hotel Iberia.         Within hours, Gómez arrived at the hotel in\n\na van containing a gun and knocked on the door of Room 209.                   After\n\nbeing shown four heroin pellets, Gómez asked Agent Carmona, posing\n\nas Sarruco, how many he had swallowed and offered to get him a\n\nlaxative.    Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could have\n\nconcluded   that    Gómez's     presence    at   the   hotel    was   not   merely\n\ncoincidental,      as   he   claimed.      Rather,     the     jury   could   have\n\nconcluded, he visited Room 209 based on his participation in a\n\nconspiracy with Sarruco and others.              See United States v. Gomez-\n\nPabon, 911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[P]roof [of membership\n\nin a conspiracy] may consist of circumstantial evidence, including\n\ninferences from surrounding circumstances, such as acts committed\n\nby the defendant that furthered the conspiracy's purposes.\").\n\n            b. Hueck\n\n            Emphasizing that there is no direct evidence in the\n\nrecord linking him to Hueck, Gómez asserts that the two could not\n\nhave been co-conspirators.        As we have already discussed, however,\n\nGómez's appearance at Room 209 of the Hotel Iberia shortly after\n\nSarruco talked to Hueck, together with his interaction with Agent\n\nCarmona, were adequate to link Gómez to a conspiracy that included\n\nHueck.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fD.        Pre-indictment delay\n\n          Gómez was arrested in April 2000 on substantive drug\n\npossession and importation charges, and a related firearms charge.\n\nHis trial on those charges ended on February 26, 2003 with a\n\njudgment of acquittal on two counts (drug possession and possession\n\nof a firearm) and a mistrial on the third count (drug importation).\n\nInstead of retrying Gómez on the drug importation charge, the\n\ngovernment obtained a superseding indictment in March 2003 that\n\ncharged Gómez with conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to\n\ndistribute and conspiracy to import drugs.       Gómez went to trial on\n\nthe conspiracy charges in June 2003 and was ultimately convicted on\n\nthe conspiracy to possess charge.\n\n          On appeal, Gómez asserts that the delay between his\n\narrest in April 2000 and the filing of the superseding indictment\n\nin March 2003 violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.\n\nThe government points out, however, that Gómez's development of\n\nthis argument is more consistent with a Fifth Amendment due process\n\nclaim based on pre-indictment delay than with a Sixth Amendment\n\nspeedy trial claim.   We agree.\n\n          The purported Sixth Amendment claim in this case focuses\n\nentirely on pre-indictment delay.        While delay between arrest and\n\nindictment may be relevant to the Sixth Amendment inquiry, see\n\nUnited States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 7 (1982), we think it\n\npeculiar that Gómez's Speedy Trial Clause claim alleges only pre-\n\n                                  -35-\n\findictment delay and is entirely silent as to pre-trial delay.\n\nMoreover, Gómez has not identified the framework set forth in\n\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530-33 (1972), for analyzing a\n\nSpeedy Trial Clause claim, nor has he explained how the facts of\n\nthis case fit that framework.    Even after the government pointed\n\nout this omission in its brief on appeal, Gómez failed to develop\n\nthe Sixth Amendment argument in his reply brief, focusing instead\n\non the application of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause to his\n\nclaim. Under these circumstances, we do not consider Gómez's Sixth\n\nAmendment claim.17   See United States v. Berrio-Callejas, 219 F.3d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000) (treating a claim as waived where the\n\nappellant \"neither presents developed argumentation nor provides\n\npertinent case citations\").\n\n          The essence of Gómez's complaint of pre-indictment delay\n\nis not that he was denied a speedy trial, but rather that his due\n\nprocess rights were violated.     The Fifth Amendment Due Process\n\nClause requires the dismissal of an indictment where the defendant\n\ncan show that \"the pre-indictment delay . . . caused substantial\n\nprejudice to [his] right[] to a fair trial and that the delay was\n\nan intentional device to gain tactical advantage over the accused.\"\n\nUnited States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 324 (1971).\n\n\n\n     17\n      We note that, even if we were to reach the Sixth Amendment\nclaim, its fate would almost certainly mirror the fate of the Fifth\nAmendment due process claim, which requires us to consider some of\nthe same factors.\n\n                                -36-\n\f              1. Prejudice\n\n              Gómez identifies two forms of prejudice stemming from the\n\ngovernment's delay in obtaining the superseding indictment. First,\n\nhe asserts that because the substantive and conspiracy charges were\n\nbrought consecutively, instead of concurrently, he was forced to\n\ndefend himself twice. In light of the disposition of Gómez's first\n\ntrial (the court declared a mistrial on one count and ordered that\n\na retrial be scheduled), however, Gómez would have had to defend\n\nhimself twice even if the superseding indictment had never been\n\nfiled; the government just decided to bring different charges for\n\nthe second trial.         Moreover, there is no evidence that forcing\n\nGómez to defend himself twice caused any prejudice, let alone\n\nsubstantial prejudice, to his right to a fair trial.             See id.   He\n\ndoes not assert that any evidence or witnesses were compromised by\n\nthe delay, nor does he explain how the delay otherwise hampered his\n\nright to a fair trial.\n\n              Gómez also assigns prejudice to the three years he spent\n\nin   prison    before    the   superseding   indictment   was   filed.     The\n\nincarceration to which Gómez points, however, did not result from\n\nthe pre-indictment delay of which he now complains.                Gómez was\n\nimprisoned between April 2000 and February 2003 pending trial on\n\nthe substantive charges set forth in the original indictment.              He\n\nwould have spent that time in prison regardless of when the\n\nconspiracy     charges    were   filed.      The   government   obtained   the\n\n                                     -37-\n\fsuperseding indictment approximately two weeks after the trial on\n\nthe substantive charges ended in a mistrial.       The relevant period\n\nof pre-indictment incarceration with respect to Gómez's Fifth\n\nAmendment prejudice claim is therefore a matter of weeks, not of\n\nyears.\n\n          2. Tactical advantage\n\n          Even   if   Gómez   were   able   to   demonstrate   prejudice\n\nresulting from the pre-indictment delay, his Fifth Amendment claim\n\nwould falter on the second prong of the inquiry.       There is simply\n\nno evidence that the government intentionally delayed indicting\n\nGómez on the conspiracy charges to obtain a tactical advantage.18\n\nMoreover, although Gómez claims that the sequential indictment\n\nallowed the government to get \"a second bite at the apple,\" he has\n\nnot identified any specific advantage that the government gained.\n\nGómez did not present any evidence in the first trial.         He cannot\n\nargue, therefore, that the sequential prosecution allowed the\n\ngovernment to preview his case or to adapt its case to his defense.\n\nIn short, Gómez's due process claim must fail.\n\n\n\n\n     18\n      The government explained on appeal that it did not realize\nuntil the end of the first trial that the offenses were more\nproperly charged as conspiracies than as substantive drug crimes.\nWe have no reason to doubt the government's characterization of\nthis delayed realization as an innocent mistake.\n\n                                 -38-\n\f                                       III.\n\n               Finally, Gómez challenges the propriety of his sentence,\n\narguing that a remand for resentencing is appropriate in light of\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Booker.                We agree and reject the\n\ngovernment's contrary position.\n\n               This court deems Booker error preserved if the defendant\n\nargued    at    sentencing     that   the    sentence    violated     Apprendi   or\n\nBlakely,19      or   that    the   federal       Sentencing     Guidelines     were\n\nunconstitutional.           See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d\n\n68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).         Where the defendant has preserved a Booker\n\nclaim, we review for harmless error, remanding for resentencing\n\nunless the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that a\n\nlower sentence would not be imposed under the post-Booker regime.\n\nUnited States v. Vázquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d 476, 489 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n               In this case, the district court took account of several\n\nfacts not found by the jury -- including, inter alia, the amount of\n\nheroin    involved,    the     presence     of   a   firearm,   and   the   court's\n\nconclusion that Gómez perjured himself at trial -- in determining\n\na sentence, and Gómez timely objected to the judicial fact-finding.\n\nThus, Gómez preserved his claim of error.               The government has not\n\nmet its burden of proving that Gómez would not receive a lower\n\n\n\n     19\n      Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and Blakely v.\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004) were two of the cases that led to\nthe Booker holding.\n\n                                       -39-\n\fsentence under the advisory Guidelines.                             See Vazquez-Rivera, 407\n\nF.3d at 490 (even \"factual certainty\" as to basis for enhancements\n\nis not sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge\n\nwould have applied the same sentence under an advisory Guidelines\n\nsystem).       We remand for resentencing.\n\n               The     government             asserts        that     a     full     remand      is\n\ninappropriate.

The government maintains that Gómez\n\ncannot meet that standard and thus that we should issue a partial\n\nremand, instructing the district court only to recalculate the base\n\noffense level.

The district court subsequently sentenced the defendant under the mandatory guidelines to 121 months in prison and three years of supervised release. On appeal, G&#243;mez asserts, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) that the district court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> violated his Sixth Amendment rights by denying his request to proceed <i>pro se,</i> (2) that the court's instructions to the jury constructively amended the indictment in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (3) that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, (4) that the delay between his arrest and the filing of the superseding indictment violated his constitutional rights, and (5) that he should be resentenced in light of <i>United States v. Booker</i>. Although the first claim poses important questions regarding the right of self-representation and the appointment of standby counsel, we ultimately conclude that G&#243;mez's right to conduct his own defense was not violated in this case. The second, third and fourth claims are also without merit. Concluding that <i>Booker</i> error was present here, however, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the trial record for the following background, presenting the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See Baron v. Suffolk County Sheriff's Dep't,</i> 402 F.3d 225, 229 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The heroin transaction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 2000, customs agents intercepted Eugene Sarruco at the airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico following his arrival on a flight from Curacao. Suspecting that Sarruco was a drug courier, the agents took him to the airport's medical facility where he was arrested after passing five pellets of heroin, each containing slightly less than eight grams of heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sarruco told agents that he had ingested eighty-five heroin pellets<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and carried them to Puerto Rico on behalf of a drug dealer in Curacao named Andr&#233;s Hueck. Upon his arrival in Puerto Rico, Sarruco was under instructions to go to the Hotel San Jorge or the Hotel Iberia. The buyer &#8212; whose identity Sarruco did not know &#8212; would meet him at the hotel with a bottle of laxatives and pick up the heroin in exchange for $7,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With Sarruco's cooperation, the agents set up a \"controlled delivery\" of the heroin pellets. They had Sarruco call Hueck with a message that he was in Room 209 at the Hotel Iberia. Hueck told Sarruco that someone would be coming, presumably to pick up the heroin. Agent Luis Carmona, who was enlisted to act undercover as Sarruco's stand-in, took the five pellets that Sarruco had expelled to Room 209 of the Hotel Iberia. Agent Carmona put one of the pellets in a drawer in the night stand and put the other four pellets, wrapped in toilet paper, in a dresser drawer. Other agents set up audio and video surveillance of Rooms 209 and 210, as well as surveillance outside the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime after 4 p.m. on April 21, 2000, G&#243;mez drove up to the Hotel Iberia in a green Ford Windstar. He parked the van, leaving two passengers inside, and went into the hotel. A Datsun parked in front of the van, and its driver also went inside the hotel. When the Datsun's driver returned, two agents detained him for questioning until a third agent exited the hotel, yelling that they had the wrong person and that the man in the room was the driver of the green van. One of the passengers in the van jumped into the front seat and drove away. The agents pursued the van to a dead end street, where the van's passengers fled on foot. Upon searching the van, the agents found a loaded gun in plain view between the front seats. They also seized a rental agreement listing Fernando G&#243;mez as an \"additional renter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, G&#243;mez arrived at Room 209 of the hotel, where Agent Carmona was waiting pursuant to the instructions that Hueck had given Sarruco. Carmona, posing as Sarruco, invited G&#243;mez inside and gave him the four pellets wrapped in toilet paper. When G&#243;mez asked Carmona how many he had swallowed, he responded eighty-five. Carmona told G&#243;mez that he was having trouble expelling the remaining pellets. G&#243;mez told him that he needed a laxative and offered to get him one. G&#243;mez then placed the pellets back in the dresser drawer. Carmona went into the bathroom, ostensibly because he was having stomach cramps. Another agent, who had been hiding in the closet, then came out and arrested G&#243;mez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal proceedings</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>First indictment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 3, 2000, a grand jury returned a three-count indictment against G&#243;mez and Sarruco. Count One charged them with aiding and abetting the importation of approximately 975 grams of heroin into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 952(a) and 963. Count Two charged the defendants with aiding and abetting the unlawful possession with intent to distribute approximately 975 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Count Three charged G&#243;mez with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime (specifically, possession of heroin with intent to distribute) in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez went to trial on February 19, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The government presented several witnesses, including Sarruco and Agent Carmona, and played the audio and video surveillance tapes of G&#243;mez's interaction with Agent Carmona. G&#243;mez rested without presenting any evidence. At the close of evidence, he moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts. The district court granted the motion as to Counts Two (possession of heroin with intent to distribute) and Three (possession of a firearm). With respect to Count Two, the court reasoned that G&#243;mez did not exercise dominion and control over the drugs when he briefly inspected them in the hotel room, nor had he aided and abetted Sarruco's possession of drugs because the two did not have a prior relationship. Because Count Three alleged possession of a gun in furtherance of the crime of drug possession, it necessarily turned on Count Two. Count One (importation) went to the jury, which could not agree on a verdict. The court declared a mistrial and ordered the case to be reset for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Superseding indictment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of retrying G&#243;mez on the importation count, the government obtained a two-count superseding indictment on March 12, 2003. Count One charged G&#243;mez with conspiring to import into the United States approximately 975 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 952(a) and 963. Count Two charged G&#243;mez with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute approximately 975 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a) and 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charges in the superseding indictment were tried before a jury in June 2003. The government presented substantially the same evidence that it had offered during the first trial. The defense presented two witnesses, G&#243;mez and his mother, neither of whom had testified at the first trial. G&#243;mez testified to an alternative version of events on the afternoon of his arrest. According to his testimony, he went to the Hotel Iberia on April 21 to visit a woman named Bonnie whom he met the previous night while out with friends. He knocked on the door of Room 209 believing that it was Bonnie's room, and was surprised when a male (Agent Carmona, posing as Sarruco) emerged from the room. As soon as G&#243;mez entered the room, the man told him that he was not feeling well and began to rub his stomach. G&#243;mez asked the man if he was all right. The man responded that he needed something to help him \"evacuate,\" and G&#243;mez asked if he meant a laxative. The man then handed G&#243;mez a package (the four heroin pellets wrapped in toilet paper), which G&#243;mez put down without looking at its contents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> After saying that he had been in pain for several hours, the man excused himself to use the restroom and G&#243;mez was arrested. G&#243;mez's mother testified regarding her relationship with G&#243;mez and her contact with him in the week leading up to his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After approximately seven hours of deliberations, the jury found that G&#243;mez was not guilty as to Count One (conspiracy to import) but guilty as to Count Two (conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute). In response to a question on the jury verdict form, the jury decided that the amount of heroin involved was less than 100 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 4, 2003, the district court sentenced G&#243;mez to 121 months in prison, the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, and three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Request for Self-Representation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled that the Sixth Amendment encompasses a right to self-representation by criminal defendants. <i>See Faretta v. California,</i> 422 U.S. 806, 814-17, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). A criminal defendant has the right to \"conduct his own defense, provided only that he knowingly and intelligently forgoes his right to counsel and that he is able and willing to abide by rules of procedure and courtroom protocol.\" <i>McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> 465 U.S. 168, 173, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To set G&#243;mez's Sixth Amendment claims in context, we begin by reviewing the history of his representation in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By April 2002, some two years after he was arrested and nine months before his first trial, G&#243;mez &#8212; though represented by counsel &#8212; had already filed more than two dozen <i>pro se</i> motions, many of them long, confusing, contradictory, and devoid of merit. Denied bail early on, he nonetheless continued to seek release on bail. He sought mandamus against the government several times. A number of motions repeatedly sought dismissal of the indictment on fanciful theories or claims of misconduct. One, for example, was captioned \"Motion to dismiss the indictment based on some or all the violation committed by the government against federal and state laws and defendants constitutional rights or for appeal.\" Other motions asked the court to explain why it had denied earlier motions or to reconsider the denials and rule in his favor. He thus filed repetitive motions on subjects already ruled on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, some of G&#243;mez's filings were not motions in the proper sense, but instead rants directed at the district court and attorneys for both sides. On July 31, 2001, for example, G&#243;mez submitted a motion entitled \"Motion to set time and place for the trial,\" in which he argued that his trial should be held in Florida \"due to all the complecety and friendship that there is between attorney and U.S. Attorneys\" and because \"it is the law that the personal wishes or convenience of the judge are not factor to be considered in determining the proper place of trial.\" And on August 29, 2001, G&#243;mez filed a motion entitled \"<i>Pro-se</i> motion claiming duprocess violation by the court by dismissing defendant's <i>pro-se</i> motion under not justifiable grond, after the defendant being wheting way over two month for this honorable court to rules up on those motion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, 2002, G&#243;mez asked the court to permit his then-counsel Bruce McGiverin to withdraw so that he could proceed <i>pro se.</i> The court agreed, but in order to minimize <i>pro se</i> motions that were so incomprehensible as to be a \"total waste of time\" for the court, the court appointed McGiverin as standby counsel and told him to read G&#243;mez's <i>pro se</i> motions, \"advis[e] the court what motions you as a professional would adopt,\" and offer G&#243;mez drafting advice. The court stated that regardless of McGiverin's opinions, G&#243;mez would be free to file the motions, which would then be filtered by a magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the April 12, 2002 order, G&#243;mez filed several dozen more <i>pro se</i> motions, including many after he retained a new counsel of record, Linda George, and despite the fact that his various counsel had filed all of the customary discovery and other motions. These new <i>pro se</i> motions were confusing and many were meritless. On May 14, 2003, for example, G&#243;mez filed an eight-page, single-spaced motion, accompanied by a four-page affidavit, asking that the case be dismissed for \"double jeopardy\" (of which there was none). The motion stated that \"even knowing\" that G&#243;mez's affidavit was based on government perjury, \"the District Court . . . has desregarded and/or ignored the matter by not holding a hearing as to the issue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We quote such passages not to make light of G&#243;mez's motions, but to emphasize the difficulties they created for the district court. The court received dozens of such filings over a three-year period, many of them quite long and packed with muddled, contradictory, meritless legal argument. Each needed a response from the court, and many led to hearings, not to mention appearances by counsel and replies from the government. Despite the burden G&#243;mez's <i>pro se</i> motions imposed, the district court did not treat them lightly. It ruled on many of them, denying the vast majority but allowing some. Most of those it found to have merit had to do with G&#243;mez's various requests for dismissal of his lawyers, for extensions of time, and for transcripts of previous hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By May 2003, the defense had filed more than 95 motions, the majority of which were <i>pro se.</i> One such <i>pro se</i> motion, which G&#243;mez filed on March 28, 2003, sought the withdrawal of his then-counsel George. The court held a hearing on G&#243;mez's motion on May 22, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The court first informed G&#243;mez that it would not allow George to withdraw and to be replaced by a court-appointed attorney because G&#243;mez had not offered a valid reason for his dissatisfaction with George.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George suggested that G&#243;mez proceed <i>pro se</i> while she acted as standby counsel. The court initially rejected that proposal, noting that it had made a similar arrangement with McGiverin but that \"there were a considerable [number] of motions that were filed that were either thoroughly out of bounds or were simply not indicated for this type of case. So therefore, I have to stop him. There is a moment when the court has to stop receiving all those motions.\" After several more exchanges, the court agreed to allow G&#243;mez to proceed <i>pro se</i> with George acting as standby counsel. The court explained the duties it assigned to George, now acting as standby counsel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: [T]he first thing I have to ask you is to examine all the motions that he's filed [<i>pro se</i>], and to see which ones you're going to adopt. And then adopt them . . . by doing a refiling. The court . . . will not authorize his participation <i>pro se</i> unless you do a screening of the motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George: I will, Your Honor.

It's out of the question because you cannot handle what is appropriate. You don't know enough law, what is appropriate for a case. And you keep filing motions that are totally out of bounds with the facts and with the law. . . . I'm not going to have the U.S. Attorney answer some of these motions that I understand are totally out of bounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George: I will review those and I'll refile them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: Refile those that you understand, that you . . . as a member of the court deem to be applicable to this case. And I urge that you use your discretion as a lawyer and your reputation as a lawyer before this court. That's all I have to say. I feel totally at ease if you do that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George: Okay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: All right. And that's the only way I'm going to allow you to represent yourself in this case. That's it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez: Your Honor, if that's what you want, I mean &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: It's not what I want. This is what the court must do, considering the history of motions that have been filed in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez: Your Honor, but the thing is most have been filed because they need to be filed.

Trial then began before a different district court judge. Before the jury was sworn in on the trial's first day, there was some confusion as to G&#243;mez's status. The judge indicated that he thought G&#243;mez was proceeding with counsel. However, G&#243;mez and George quickly clarified that the May 22 order allowed G&#243;mez to represent himself. G&#243;mez told the court, and George verified, that \"I was supposed to be represented by myself, <i>pro se.</i>\" He went on to explain that \"Mr. Dom&#237;nguez, the judge . . . addressed the matter and he decided for me to be represented by myself with Linda George as helping counsel. I was permitted to address the court.\" After hearing this, the judge questioned G&#243;mez to confirm that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The judge then agreed that G&#243;mez could represent himself, and noted that George was standby counsel \"in the event that [G&#243;mez] ha[s] questions or any information [he] need[s] from her.\" When it came time for G&#243;mez to deliver his opening statement, however, G&#243;mez informed the trial judge that he did not have a statement prepared. The judge told G&#243;mez that he could make (or waive) the statement himself, retaining his <i>pro se</i> status, or allow George to make the statement, relinquishing his <i>pro se</i> status. Faced with waiving his opening statement, G&#243;mez allowed George to take over his representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although George represented G&#243;mez at trial, G&#243;mez continued to file <i>pro se</i> motions after the trial pursuant to the guidelines set forth in the court's May 22 order, <i>i.e.,</i> screening by George. G&#243;mez was also permitted to participate actively in a post-judgment motions hearing on August 27, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As the court explained at the hearing, \"[y]ou're authorized to speak to the court. . . . One thing is to speak to the court and another is to be filing motions. Two totally different things.\" With the court's permission, both G&#243;mez and his counsel participated at his sentencing hearing on November 4, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>October 2001 motion to proceed pro se</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez first argues that the district court erred in handling his October 2, 2001 motion to remove his then-counsel McGiverin<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and to proceed <i>pro se.</i> Specifically, G&#243;mez maintains that the court did not comply with its duty to determine whether the motion constituted a valid waiver of his right to counsel and that, instead, the court \"effectively ignored the motion, failing to conduct a hearing on it for more than six months\" and then rejected the motion \"out of hand.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez's account of these proceedings does not square with the record. The court did not \"effectively ignore[ ]\" G&#243;mez's motion to proceed <i>pro se.</i> To the contrary, the court scheduled a hearing on the motion for October 15, 2001, two weeks after it had been filed. The hearing had to be rescheduled, however, after the United States marshals informed the court that G&#243;mez was out of control, exhibiting violent behavior and expressing ill will toward his mother and his lawyer. Faced with this information, together with the fact that McGiverin was the fifth attorney that G&#243;mez fired or sought to have removed, the court concluded that it had \"no other alternative but to order [G&#243;mez's] psychiatric evaluation immediately.\" Such an evaluation was entirely appropriate under the circumstances, <i>see Godinez v. Moran,</i> 509 U.S. 389, 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993) (noting that a court must determine that a defendant seeking to waive counsel is competent), and G&#243;mez does not contend otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sealed psychiatric examination was filed with the court on February 1, 2002. On February 15, 2002, the court issued a sealed order finding the defendant competent to stand trial. The court subsequently granted a motion by G&#243;mez to discuss his legal representation, scheduling a hearing for April 12, 2002. At the April 12 hearing, the court expressed concern about G&#243;mez's ability to represent himself effectively, noting that he had \"fill[ed] this record with totally incoherent motions, which are contradictory and taken totally out of context.\" Nevertheless, the court granted G&#243;mez's motion to proceed <i>pro se,</i> subject to a requirement that he have standby counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court may appoint standby counsel even over the defendant's objections. <i>See United States v. Kneeland,</i> 148 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.1998) (noting that \"a trial court may appoint standby counsel against a defendant's wishes\"). Thus, the requirement that McGiverin act as standby counsel in this case was not inconsistent with G&#243;mez's <i>pro se</i> status. <i>Cf. United States v. Walsh,</i> 742 F.2d 1006, 1007 (6th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (holding that standby counsel did not eviscerate the defendant's right to self-representation where the defendant \"was required to submit his motions to advisory counsel for review\"). Indeed, G&#243;mez represented himself at a bail hearing within days of the court granting his motion for self-representation. Although McGiverin also participated in the bail hearing by delivering a final argument, he did so only in response to an explicit request by G&#243;mez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, G&#243;mez's claims that the court rejected his October 2, 2001 motion for self-representation \"out of hand\" and that \"[a]t no time did the [district court] allow [him] to represent himself\" are flatly incorrect. The court did not err in handling the motion to proceed <i>pro se.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>May 22, 2003 screening order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez next faults the court's handling of his motion to have his counsel &#8212; this time, his sixth attorney, Linda George &#8212; withdraw and to proceed <i>pro se.</i> Emphasizing that G&#243;mez's previous <i>pro se</i> motions had been incomprehensible, the court ruled on May 22, 2003 that G&#243;mez could represent himself only if George filtered and approved his motions before they were filed. On appeal, G&#243;mez asserts that this ruling violated his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez first contends that the court's May 22 order denied his request to proceed <i>pro se</i> and therefore violated his Sixth Amendment right of self&#8212;representation. <i>See Faretta,</i> 422 U.S. at 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525. The record does not support this claim. The court did not deny G&#243;mez's request to proceed <i>pro se.</i> Rather, as we have described, it granted the request but imposed one limitation on G&#243;mez's self-representation&#8212;namely, a requirement that George, as standby counsel, screen G&#243;mez's motions. G&#243;mez was permitted to represent himself in other areas, including at jury selection. As the court explained during a hearing on August 27, 2003, the May 22 order left G&#243;mez free to \"speak to the court,\" just not to \"file motions on your own.\" We therefore reject G&#243;mez's claim that the court denied his request to represent himself \"out of hand.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps anticipating this result, G&#243;mez also asserts that George's unwelcome participation as standby counsel &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> her screening of the motions &#8212; so interfered with his right of self-representation as to \"effectively render[ ] his right to self-representation meaningless.\" <i>Armant v. Marquez,</i> 772 F.2d 552, 558 (9th Cir.1985). We consider this claim under the standards set forth in <i>McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> which dealt with the role that standby counsel, present at trial over the defendant's objections, may play without eviscerating the <i>Faretta</i> right of self-representation. The <i>McKaskle</i> Court identified two criteria as being central to its analysis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the <i>pro se</i> defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury. . . . If standby counsel's participation over the defendant's objection effectively allows counsel to make or substantially interfere with any significant tactical decisions . . . or to speak <i>instead</i> of the defendant on any matter of importance, the <i>Faretta</i> right is eroded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, participation by standby counsel without the defendant's consent should not be allowed to destroy the jury's perception that the defendant is representing himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">465 U.S. at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez first asserts that as a result of the court's screening order, he was \"unable to submit motions that counsel did not approve of.\" Because this contention pertains solely to George's participation in G&#243;mez's motions practice, which occurred outside the presence of the jury, only the first prong of the <i>McKaskle</i> analysis is relevant to our inquiry. <i>See id.</i> at 179. (\"Participation by standby counsel outside the presence of the jury engages only the first of these two limitations.\"). G&#243;mez has not demonstrated that his <i>Faretta</i> right was \"eroded\" according to this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is true that he could not submit a motion without George's approval, G&#243;mez has not identified on appeal any motions that George prevented him from filing. Indeed, the record includes a number of <i>pro se</i> motions that were drafted by G&#243;mez and filed by George after the court's May 22 order. Moreover, George's ability to block G&#243;mez from filing motions that were irrelevant or \"totally out of bounds\" cannot be said to constitute either interference with a \"significant tactical decision\" or a preemption of G&#243;mez's ability to speak on a \"matter of importance.\" <i>McKaskle,</i> 465 U.S. at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944. Rather, the court designated George as standby counsel, and defined her role, to \"ensure the defendant's compliance with basic rules of courtroom protocol and procedure,\" a practice that does not infringe on a <i>pro se</i> defendant's <i>Faretta</i> rights. <i>Id.</i> at 183.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basic rules of courtroom protocol and procedure impose an obligation, both on counsel and on individuals acting as their own counsel, to comply with court rules and not file frivolous motions. Federal courts \"possess discretionary powers to regulate the conduct of abusive litigants.\" <i>Cok v. Family Court of Rhode Island,</i> 985 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir.1993). This power includes the ability to enjoin a party &#8212; even a <i>pro se</i> party &#8212; from filing frivolous and vexatious motions. <i>Sires v. Fair,</i> No. 96-1454, 1997 WL 51408 (1st Cir. Feb.10, 1997) (unpublished); <i>Castro v. United States,</i> 775 F.2d 399, 408 (1st Cir.1985) (abrogated on other grounds by <i>Stevens v.

In fact, in a parallel situation, we upheld a district court order which enjoined a <i>pro se</i> litigant \"from filing any motions, pleadings or papers . . . without prior leave of the Court,\" <i>Hart v. United States,</i> No. 92-1801, 1994 WL 89442, at *1 (1st Cir. Mar.22, 1994), where the defendant had \"deluged the court with at least sixty-six different motions, most of them <i>pro se.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Hart,</i> 933 F.2d 80, 81-82 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez nevertheless maintains that George's screening role was inconsistent with his right of self-representation. His argument relies on the Court's statement in <i>McKaskle</i> that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Faretta</i> rights [to self-representation] are adequately vindicated in proceedings outside the presence of the jury if the <i>pro se</i> defendant is allowed to address the court freely on his own behalf and if disagreements between counsel and the <i>pro se</i> defendant are resolved in the defendant's favor whenever the matter is one that would normally be left to the discretion of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>McKaskle,</i> 465 U.S. at 179, 104 S.Ct. 944. G&#243;mez asserts that as long as George was screening his motions, he was unable to \"address the court freely\" and that by allowing George, rather than G&#243;mez, to decide which motions to file, the court failed to resolve disagreements in favor of the defendant, all in contravention of <i>McKaskle.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement from <i>McKaskle</i> on which G&#243;mez relies cannot be read in isolation. That statement was a reiteration of the first prong of the test set forth earlier in the opinion, namely the requirement that standby counsel's unwelcome participation not \"substantially interfere with any significant tactical decisions\" or result in counsel \"speak[ing] instead of the defendant on any matter of importance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 178, 104 S.Ct. 944 (emphasis omitted). This formulation informs the meaning of the reiteration relied upon by G&#243;mez. Moreover, that reiteration must also be read in conjunction with the Court's subsequent statement that there is no \"significant interference with the defendant's actual control over the presentation of his defense, and thus no infringement of his <i>Faretta</i> rights, when `counsel merely helps to ensure the defendant's compliance with basic rules of courtroom protocol and procedure.'\" <i>McKaskle,</i> 465 U.S. at 183, 104 S.Ct. 944. The <i>McKaskle</i> Court also emphasized that \"[t]he trial judge may be required to make numerous rulings reconciling the participation of standby counsel with a <i>pro se</i> defendant's objection to that participation; nothing in the nature of the <i>Faretta</i> right suggests that the usual deference to `judgment calls' on these issues by the trial judge should not obtain here as elsewhere.\" <i>Id.</i> at 177 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 944.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken together, these explanations of permissible participation by standby counsel indicate that the <i>pro se</i> defendant's right to \"address the court freely\" is not absolute. Rather, the court may use standby counsel to facilitate the orderly functioning of the proceedings so long as the defendant retains control over \"significant tactical decisions\" and \"on any matter of importance.\" George's screening role was consistent with that standard. In light of G&#243;mez's long history in this case of filing irrelevant and frivolous motions, George's responsibility for preventing the filing of such motions did not deprive G&#243;mez of control over his defense. <i>Cf. United States v. Collins,</i> 920 F.2d 619, 627 (10th Cir.1990) (noting that \"an attorney may be dismissed for pursuing frivolous theories\"); <i>United States v. Masat,</i> 896 F.2d 88, 92 (5th Cir.1990) (same); <i>Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct</i> R. 3.1 (2003) (noting that \"[a] lawyer shall not . . . assert. . . an issue . . . unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez also asserts that George's unwelcome standby participation violated the limits set forth in <i>McKaskle</i> because it left him unable to call witnesses who would have corroborated a certain aspect of his testimony. G&#243;mez's argument appears to rely on the following logic: the court's May 22 order regarding George's screening role led him to believe that he would not be permitted to proceed <i>pro se</i> at trial; G&#243;mez therefore arrived at trial unprepared to represent himself; although the trial judge agreed to let G&#243;mez proceed <i>pro se,</i> G&#243;mez's lack of preparation forced him to ask George to take over his representation before his opening statement;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> this relinquishment of his <i>pro se</i> status meant that George, rather than G&#243;mez, chose which witnesses to present. In short, G&#243;mez contends that, but for George's screening role, he would have represented himself at trial and called witnesses that George chose not to call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the judge presiding over G&#243;mez's second trial initially was confused as to whether the court's May 22 order restricted G&#243;mez's <i>pro se</i> status only with regard to motions, or with regard to his self-representation more generally. Given G&#243;mez's claim on appeal that he was unprepared because he did not believe he would be allowed to represent himself, however, it is G&#243;mez's understanding of the pre-trial record, rather than the trial judge's understanding, that is relevant. As we have already observed, G&#243;mez told the trial judge that he was \"supposed to\" represent himself and that the previous district court judge had \"decided for me to be represented by myself with Linda George as helping counsel. I was permitted to address the court.\" These statements indicate that G&#243;mez thought that he had been granted <i>pro se</i> status prior to the trial, undermining his claim that he interpreted the court's May 22 screening order to preclude him from representing himself at trial. G&#243;mez's lack of preparation at the outset of the second trial was his own fault. His decision to relinquish his <i>pro se</i> status as a result of that lack of preparation was entirely voluntary. The claim that George's screening role prevented G&#243;mez from representing himself at trial and calling particular witnesses is therefore without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that a jury find, beyond a reasonable doubt, any facts needed to impose a sentence in excess of the default statutory maximum. <i>See United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir.2003) (applying <i>Apprendi</i> to drug type and quantity determinations), <i>cert denied,</i> 541 U.S. 1005, 124 S.Ct. 2058, 158 L.Ed.2d 522 (2004).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After approximately three hours of deliberations, the jury sent a note asking the court to explain \"the importance of 100 grams of heroin when the defendant is guilty or not guilty.\" The court asked counsel for a suggested response. G&#243;mez's counsel responded that \"I think the court should just read what was on the verdict sheet again. I don't think we should get into any explanation.\" The court substantially complied with this suggestion, instructing the jury that \"under the law, on a finding of guilty, the jury is required to answer the question regarding quantity. On a finding of not guilty, the jury should not answer the question regarding quantity.\" The jury subsequently determined that G&#243;mez was guilty on Count II but that the amount of heroin involved was less than 100 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, G&#243;mez argues that through the special verdict question regarding drug quantity and the corresponding jury instructions, the district court constructively amended the superseding indictment in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. A constructive amendment, which is prejudicial <i>per se,</i> \"occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.\" <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 3 F.3d 456, 462-63 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). G&#243;mez contends that the district court changed the terms of the superseding indictment in this case when it allowed the jury to determine, via the special verdict form, whether G&#243;mez was part of a conspiracy to possess less than 100 grams of heroin. In support of this contention, G&#243;mez asserts that because the superseding indictment charged him with conspiring to possess approximately 975 grams of heroin, it must have referred to a conspiracy with Hueck and Sarruco to possess all eighty-five heroin pellets that Sarruco swallowed (which actually weighed 678 grams). He reasons that if the jury had found him guilty of this conspiracy, it would have indicated on the special verdict form that the amount of heroin was more than 100 grams. Because the jury found instead that the amount of heroin was less than 100 grams, G&#243;mez contends that it must have convicted him of a conspiracy other than the one charged &#8212; specifically, an <i>ad hoc</i> conspiracy with Agent Carmona (posing as Sarruco) to possess the four heroin pellets present in the hotel room, which weighed approximately 32 grams. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No specific drug quantity needs to be proven for a jury to convict a defendant of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute. <i>See United States v. Restrepo-Contreras,</i> 942 F.2d 96, 99 n. 1 (1st Cir.1991). It is therefore not erroneous <i>per se</i> to allow a jury to find that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged but responsible for a lesser quantity of drugs than that specified in the indictment. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz Solorio,</i> 337 F.3d 580, 589-91 (6th Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1063, 124 S.Ct. 850, 157 L.Ed.2d 723 (2003). G&#243;mez does not contend otherwise. He argues instead that, in this particular case, the effect of the special verdict question regarding drug quantity was to allow the jury to consider two different conspiracies, one charged and one uncharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While G&#243;mez's argument is creative, it is ultimately unpersuasive. The court asked the jury to determine the drug quantity not to present it with an uncharged conspiracy, but rather to ascertain a fact necessary for sentencing. The court instructed the jury that it should convict G&#243;mez on Count II only upon a finding that \"<i>the agreement specified in the indictment,</i> and not some other agreement or agreements, existed between at least two people to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute it\" (emphasis added). It further instructed the jury that it should reach the question of drug quantity only upon a finding that G&#243;mez was guilty. Nothing in these instructions suggests that the jury was free to convict G&#243;mez for a conspiracy other than the one charged in the superseding indictment. <i>See United States v. Owens,</i> 167 F.3d 739, 756 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that \"our system of trial by jury is premised on the assumption that jurors will scrupulously follow the court's instructions\"). Rather, the instructions and special verdict form left room for the jury to determine that G&#243;mez had participated in the charged conspiracy but to limit his responsibility to a lower amount. Neither the special verdict form nor the instructions accompanying it constituted a constructive amendment of the superseding indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

G&#243;mez asserts that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of a conspiracy in this case because there was no one with whom he could have conspired. We review a sufficiency of the evidence claim <i>de novo,</i> considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See United States v.

Emphasizing that \"there can be no conspiracy as a matter of law solely between a defendant and a government agent,\" <i>United States v. Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d 35, 51 n. 11 (1st Cir.2004), G&#243;mez asserts that there was no evidence to support a conviction for the <i>ad hoc</i> conspiracy. We have already rejected the premise underlying this sufficiency of the evidence claim. Hence, we reject the related sufficiency of the evidence claim on the same basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Evidence of a conspiracy with Hueck and Sarruco</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez next argues that he could not be convicted of the charged conspiracy because there was insufficient evidence to connect him to either Sarruco, the drug courier, or Hueck, the drug supplier. With regard to Sarruco, G&#243;mez contends that the government is estopped from claiming that the two were co-conspirators because, in granting a judgment of acquittal in the first trial, the district court found that \"the only evidence in this case about the relationship between G&#243;mez and Sarruco is that there was no relationship.\" With regard to Hueck, G&#243;mez simply asserts that there was no evidence of a relationship between the two, and therefore no possible criminal agreement. We consider these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Sarruco</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, \"when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\" <i>Ashe v. Swenson,</i> 397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). G&#243;mez asserts that the district court determined during his first trial that he had no relationship with Sarruco, and therefore that the government could not attempt to show during the second trial that he and Sarruco were co-conspirators. The district court, however, made no such finding during the first trial. It concluded only that there was no personal relationship between G&#243;mez and Sarruco sufficient to support a charge that G&#243;mez <i>aided and abetted</i> Sarruco's drug possession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The court did not determine that the lack of a personal relationship would preclude the two from being <i>co-conspirators.</i> To the contrary, the court suggested that the facts likely <i>would</i> support the existence of a conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The court's finding in the first trial that Sarruco and G&#243;mez did not know each other therefore did not preclude the government from arguing in the second trial that the two were co-conspirators. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Soto-Ben&#237;quez,</i> 356 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2004) (\"The government need not show that each conspirator knew of or had contact with all other members.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 541 U.S. 1074, 124 S.Ct. 2432, 158 L.Ed.2d 985 (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is ample circumstantial evidence that Sarruco and G&#243;mez were part of a conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute it. Sarruco told Hueck that he was waiting in Room 209 of the Hotel Iberia. Within hours, G&#243;mez arrived at the hotel in a van containing a gun and knocked on the door of Room 209. After being shown four heroin pellets, G&#243;mez asked Agent Carmona, posing as Sarruco, how many he had swallowed and offered to get him a laxative. Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could have concluded that G&#243;mez's presence at the hotel was not merely coincidental, as he claimed. Rather, the jury could have concluded, he visited Room 209 based on his participation in a conspiracy with Sarruco and others. <i>See United States v. G&#243;mez-Pabon,</i> 911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[P]roof [of membership in a conspiracy] may consist of circumstantial evidence, including inferences from surrounding circumstances, such as acts committed by the defendant that furthered the conspiracy's purposes.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Hueck</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emphasizing that there is no direct evidence in the record linking him to Hueck, G&#243;mez asserts that the two could not have been co-conspirators. As we have already discussed, however, G&#243;mez's appearance at Room 209 of the Hotel Iberia shortly after Sarruco talked to Hueck, together with his interaction with Agent Carmona, were adequate to link G&#243;mez to a conspiracy that included Hueck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Pre-indictment delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez was arrested in April 2000 on substantive drug possession and importation charges, and a related firearms charge. His trial on those charges ended on February 26, 2003 with a judgment of acquittal on two counts (drug possession and possession of a firearm) and a mistrial on the third count (drug importation). Instead of retrying G&#243;mez on the drug importation charge, the government obtained a superseding indictment in March 2003 that charged G&#243;mez with conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute and conspiracy to import drugs. G&#243;mez went to trial on the conspiracy charges in June 2003 and was ultimately convicted on the conspiracy to possess charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, G&#243;mez asserts that the delay between his arrest in April 2000 and the filing of the superseding indictment in March 2003 violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The government points out, however, that G&#243;mez's development of this argument is more consistent with a Fifth Amendment due process claim based on pre-indictment delay than with a Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purported Sixth Amendment claim in this case focuses entirely on pre-indictment delay. While delay between arrest and indictment may be relevant to the Sixth Amendment inquiry, <i>see United States v. MacDonald,</i> 456 U.S. 1, 7, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.Ed.2d 696 (1982), we think it peculiar that G&#243;mez's Speedy Trial Clause claim alleges only pre-<i>indictment</i> delay and is entirely silent as to pre-<i>trial</i> delay. Moreover, G&#243;mez has not identified the framework set forth in <i>Barker v. Wingo,</i> 407 U.S. 514, 530-33, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), for analyzing a Speedy Trial Clause claim, nor has he explained how the facts of this case fit that framework. Even after the government pointed out this omission in its brief on appeal, G&#243;mez failed to develop the Sixth Amendment argument in his reply brief, focusing instead on the application of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause to his claim. Under these circumstances, we do not consider G&#243;mez's Sixth Amendment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> <i>See United States v. Berrio-Callejas,</i> 219 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2000) (treating a claim as waived where the appellant \"neither presents developed argumentation nor provides pertinent case citations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essence of G&#243;mez's complaint of pre-indictment delay is not that he was denied a speedy trial, but rather that his due process rights were violated. The Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause requires the dismissal of an indictment where the defendant can show that \"the pre-indictment delay. . . caused substantial prejudice to [his] right[ ] to a fair trial and that the delay was an intentional device to gain tactical advantage over the accused.\" <i>United States v. Marion,</i> 404 U.S. 307, 324, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Prejudice</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez identifies two forms of prejudice stemming from the government's delay in obtaining the superseding indictment. First, he asserts that because the substantive and conspiracy charges were brought consecutively, instead of concurrently, he was forced to defend himself twice. In light of the disposition of G&#243;mez's first trial (the court declared a mistrial on one count and ordered that a retrial be scheduled), however, G&#243;mez would have had to defend himself twice even if the superseding indictment had never been filed; the government just decided to bring different charges for the second trial. Moreover, there is no evidence that forcing G&#243;mez to defend himself twice caused any prejudice, let alone substantial prejudice, to his right to a fair trial. <i>See id.</i> He does not assert that any evidence or witnesses were compromised by the delay, nor does he explain how the delay otherwise hampered his right to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez also assigns prejudice to the three years he spent in prison before the superseding indictment was filed. The incarceration to which G&#243;mez points, however, did not result from the pre-indictment delay of which he now complains. G&#243;mez was imprisoned between April 2000 and February 2003 pending trial on the substantive charges set forth in the original indictment. He would have spent that time in prison regardless of when the conspiracy charges were filed. The government obtained the superseding indictment approximately two weeks after the trial on the substantive charges ended in a mistrial. The relevant period of pre-indictment incarceration with respect to G&#243;mez's Fifth Amendment prejudice claim is therefore a matter of weeks, not of years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Tactical advantage</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if G&#243;mez were able to demonstrate prejudice resulting from the pre-indictment delay, his Fifth Amendment claim would falter on the second prong of the inquiry. There is simply no evidence that the government intentionally delayed indicting G&#243;mez on the conspiracy charges to obtain a tactical advantage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Moreover, although G&#243;mez claims that the sequential indictment allowed the government to get \"a second bite at the apple,\" he has not identified any specific advantage that the government gained. G&#243;mez did not present any evidence in the first trial. He cannot argue, therefore, that the sequential prosecution allowed the government to preview his case or to adapt its case to his defense. In short, G&#243;mez's due process claim must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, G&#243;mez challenges the propriety of his sentence, arguing that a remand for resentencing is appropriate in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Booker.</i> We agree and reject the government's contrary position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court deems <i>Booker</i> error preserved if the defendant argued at sentencing that the sentence violated <i>Apprendi</i> or <i>Blakely,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> or that the federal Sentencing Guidelines were unconstitutional. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005). Where the defendant has preserved a <i>Booker</i> claim, we review for harmless error, remanding for resentencing unless the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that a lower sentence would not be imposed under the post-<i>Booker</i> regime. <i>United States v. V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> 407 F.3d 476, 489 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court took account of several facts not found by the jury &#8212; including, <i>inter alia,</i> the amount of heroin involved, the presence of a firearm, and the court's conclusion that G&#243;mez perjured himself at trial &#8212; in determining a sentence, and G&#243;mez timely objected to the judicial fact-finding. Thus, G&#243;mez preserved his claim of error. The government has not met its burden of proving that G&#243;mez would not receive a lower sentence under the advisory Guidelines. <i>See Vazquez-Rivera,</i> 407 F.3d at 490 (even \"factual certainty\" as to basis for enhancements is not sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge would have applied the same sentence under an advisory Guidelines system). We remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that a full remand is inappropriate. Contending that G&#243;mez preserved his <i>Booker</i> claim only with respect to the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy, and not with respect to the gun and perjury findings, it argues that we should therefore review the latter two issues under a plain error standard. The government maintains that G&#243;mez cannot meet that standard and thus that we should issue a partial remand, instructing the district court only to recalculate the base offense level. We reject this invitation to disaggregate <i>Booker</i> claims and consider them piecemeal. Such an approach is inconsistent with this court's <i>Booker</i> jurisprudence under <i>Antonakopoulos.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, our decision to remand should not be read as a \"suggestion or a prediction that [G&#243;mez's] sentence will necessarily be altered.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005). This is especially true \"where the remand arises out of a preserved error and where the harmless error test makes even a modest possibility of change enough to warrant remand.\" <i>United States v. Lata,</i> 415 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez's conviction is <i>affirmed;</i> his sentence on that conviction is <i>vacated.</i> We <i>remand</i> for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We refer throughout this opinion to \"the district court,\" a generic term which might suggest that a single judge presided over all the proceedings that culminated in this appeal. That is not the case. At least three different district court judges, and an array of magistrate judges, have been involved in different stages of this case. Judge Dom&#237;nguez handled the October 2001 and March 2003 motions to proceed<i>pro se</i> that are discussed in Section II.A., while Judge McAuliffe presided over the first trial, which ended in a judgment of acquittal on two counts and a mistrial on one count, and Judge Singal presided over the second trial, which resulted in G&#243;mez's conviction for conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute.

Based on such inconsistencies, the court found at sentencing that \"the defendant . . . perjure[d] himself during trial when he was claiming that he was at the hotel to find this unknown female in an unknown room.

Moreover, there was good reason for the delay. Shortly after G&#243;mez filed his motion, the district court judge temporarily recused himself from the case and reassigned all pending motions to a magistrate judge. The magistrate promptly issued an order giving George an opportunity to respond to the motion to withdraw, and scheduled the hearing a month later, by which point the district court judge had returned to the case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Before concluding that the waiver of the right to counsel was knowing and voluntary, the trial judge took great pains to ensure that G&#243;mez had \"a sense of the magnitude of the undertaking,\"<i>Maynard v.

The court again agreed to let G&#243;mez \"proceed<i>pro se</i> with standby counsel\" subject to a limitation that \"standby counsel is the only person authorized to sign motions,\" and appointed attorney Miriam Ramos Grateroles as the standby counsel.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> G&#243;mez claimed that McGiverin would not file motions that G&#243;mez believed were necessary to his defense and to preserve his appellate rights</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Although there was some ambiguity during the hearing as to McGiverin's exact role as standby counsel, the court ultimately explained that it wanted McGiverin to examine G&#243;mez's<i>pro se</i> motions, but that G&#243;mez retained control over their filing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> G&#243;mez employed this hybrid representation arrangement again at a motions hearing on August 15, 2002, representing himself throughout much of the hearing but asking McGiverin, his standby counsel, to cross-examine a witness about an evidentiary issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> As already noted, when it became apparent that G&#243;mez had not prepared an opening statement, the trial judge informed G&#243;mez that he could make (or waive) the statement himself, retaining his<i>pro se</i> status, or allow George to make the statement, relinquishing his <i>pro se</i> status.

G&#243;mez failed to preserve an objection to the jury instructions, in which the court properly told the jury that it should answer the drug quantity question only if it found that G&#243;mez was guilty. G&#243;mez did not object to the instruction after it was given. Moreover, when the court asked for input on a response to the jury's note about \"the importance of 100 grams of heroin,\" G&#243;mez agreed that no additional explanation regarding the significance of the drug quantity was necessary. Even if the instruction that he suggests on appeal would have been useful in avoiding jury confusion, the court's failure to give it certainly was not reversible error</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The court explained that \"[t]he only evidence in this case about the relationship between G&#243;mez and Sarruco is that there was no relationship.

The district court subsequently sentenced the defendant under the mandatory guidelines to 121 months in prison and three years of supervised release. On appeal, G&#243;mez asserts, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) that the district court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> violated his Sixth Amendment rights by denying his request to proceed <i>pro se,</i> (2) that the court's instructions to the jury constructively amended the indictment in violation of the Fifth Amendment, (3) that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, (4) that the delay between his arrest and the filing of the superseding indictment violated his constitutional rights, and (5) that he should be resentenced in light of <i>United States v.

Although the first claim poses important questions regarding the right of self-representation and the appointment of standby counsel, we ultimately conclude that G&#243;mez's right to conduct his own defense was not violated in this case.

The heroin transaction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 2000, customs agents intercepted Eugene Sarruco at the airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico following his arrival on a flight from Curacao. Suspecting that Sarruco was a drug courier, the agents took him to the airport's medical facility where he was arrested after passing five pellets of heroin, each containing slightly less than eight grams of heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sarruco told agents that he had ingested eighty-five heroin pellets<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and carried them to Puerto Rico on behalf of a drug dealer in Curacao named Andr&#233;s Hueck. Upon his arrival in Puerto Rico, Sarruco was under instructions to go to the Hotel San Jorge or the Hotel Iberia. The buyer &#8212; whose identity Sarruco did not know &#8212; would meet him at the hotel with a bottle of laxatives and pick up the heroin in exchange for $7,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With Sarruco's cooperation, the agents set up a \"controlled delivery\" of the heroin pellets. They had Sarruco call Hueck with a message that he was in Room 209 at the Hotel Iberia. Hueck told Sarruco that someone would be coming, presumably to pick up the heroin. Agent Luis Carmona, who was enlisted to act undercover as Sarruco's stand-in, took the five pellets that Sarruco had expelled to Room 209 of the Hotel Iberia. Agent Carmona put one of the pellets in a drawer in the night stand and put the other four pellets, wrapped in toilet paper, in a dresser drawer. Other agents set up audio and video surveillance of Rooms 209 and 210, as well as surveillance outside the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime after 4 p.m. on April 21, 2000, G&#243;mez drove up to the Hotel Iberia in a green Ford Windstar. He parked the van, leaving two passengers inside, and went into the hotel. A Datsun parked in front of the van, and its driver also went inside the hotel. When the Datsun's driver returned, two agents detained him for questioning until a third agent exited the hotel, yelling that they had the wrong person and that the man in the room was the driver of the green van. One of the passengers in the van jumped into the front seat and drove away. The agents pursued the van to a dead end street, where the van's passengers fled on foot. Upon searching the van, the agents found a loaded gun in plain view between the front seats. They also seized a rental agreement listing Fernando G&#243;mez as an \"additional renter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, G&#243;mez arrived at Room 209 of the hotel, where Agent Carmona was waiting pursuant to the instructions that Hueck had given Sarruco. Carmona, posing as Sarruco, invited G&#243;mez inside and gave him the four pellets wrapped in toilet paper. When G&#243;mez asked Carmona how many he had swallowed, he responded eighty-five. Carmona told G&#243;mez that he was having trouble expelling the remaining pellets. G&#243;mez told him that he needed a laxative and offered to get him one. G&#243;mez then placed the pellets back in the dresser drawer. Carmona went into the bathroom, ostensibly because he was having stomach cramps. Another agent, who had been hiding in the closet, then came out and arrested G&#243;mez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal proceedings</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>First indictment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 3, 2000, a grand jury returned a three-count indictment against G&#243;mez and Sarruco. Count One charged them with aiding and abetting the importation of approximately 975 grams of heroin into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 952(a) and 963. Count Two charged the defendants with aiding and abetting the unlawful possession with intent to distribute approximately 975 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Count Three charged G&#243;mez with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime (specifically, possession of heroin with intent to distribute) in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez went to trial on February 19, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The government presented several witnesses, including Sarruco and Agent Carmona, and played the audio and video surveillance tapes of G&#243;mez's interaction with Agent Carmona. G&#243;mez rested without presenting any evidence. At the close of evidence, he moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts. The district court granted the motion as to Counts Two (possession of heroin with intent to distribute) and Three (possession of a firearm). With respect to Count Two, the court reasoned that G&#243;mez did not exercise dominion and control over the drugs when he briefly inspected them in the hotel room, nor had he aided and abetted Sarruco's possession of drugs because the two did not have a prior relationship. Because Count Three alleged possession of a gun in furtherance of the crime of drug possession, it necessarily turned on Count Two. Count One (importation) went to the jury, which could not agree on a verdict. The court declared a mistrial and ordered the case to be reset for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Superseding indictment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of retrying G&#243;mez on the importation count, the government obtained a two-count superseding indictment on March 12, 2003. Count One charged G&#243;mez with conspiring to import into the United States approximately 975 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 952(a) and 963. Count Two charged G&#243;mez with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute approximately 975 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a) and 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charges in the superseding indictment were tried before a jury in June 2003. The government presented substantially the same evidence that it had offered during the first trial. The defense presented two witnesses, G&#243;mez and his mother, neither of whom had testified at the first trial. G&#243;mez testified to an alternative version of events on the afternoon of his arrest. According to his testimony, he went to the Hotel Iberia on April 21 to visit a woman named Bonnie whom he met the previous night while out with friends. He knocked on the door of Room 209 believing that it was Bonnie's room, and was surprised when a male (Agent Carmona, posing as Sarruco) emerged from the room. As soon as G&#243;mez entered the room, the man told him that he was not feeling well and began to rub his stomach. G&#243;mez asked the man if he was all right. The man responded that he needed something to help him \"evacuate,\" and G&#243;mez asked if he meant a laxative. The man then handed G&#243;mez a package (the four heroin pellets wrapped in toilet paper), which G&#243;mez put down without looking at its contents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> After saying that he had been in pain for several hours, the man excused himself to use the restroom and G&#243;mez was arrested. G&#243;mez's mother testified regarding her relationship with G&#243;mez and her contact with him in the week leading up to his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After approximately seven hours of deliberations, the jury found that G&#243;mez was not guilty as to Count One (conspiracy to import) but guilty as to Count Two (conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute). In response to a question on the jury verdict form, the jury decided that the amount of heroin involved was less than 100 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 4, 2003, the district court sentenced G&#243;mez to 121 months in prison, the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, and three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Denied bail early on, he nonetheless continued to seek release on bail. He sought mandamus against the government several times. A number of motions repeatedly sought dismissal of the indictment on fanciful theories or claims of misconduct. One, for example, was captioned \"Motion to dismiss the indictment based on some or all the violation committed by the government against federal and state laws and defendants constitutional rights or for appeal.\" Other motions asked the court to explain why it had denied earlier motions or to reconsider the denials and rule in his favor. He thus filed repetitive motions on subjects already ruled on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, some of G&#243;mez's filings were not motions in the proper sense, but instead rants directed at the district court and attorneys for both sides. On July 31, 2001, for example, G&#243;mez submitted a motion entitled \"Motion to set time and place for the trial,\" in which he argued that his trial should be held in Florida \"due to all the complecety and friendship that there is between attorney and U.S. Attorneys\" and because \"it is the law that the personal wishes or convenience of the judge are not factor to be considered in determining the proper place of trial.\" And on August 29, 2001, G&#243;mez filed a motion entitled \"<i>Pro-se</i> motion claiming duprocess violation by the court by dismissing defendant's <i>pro-se</i> motion under not justifiable grond, after the defendant being wheting way over two month for this honorable court to rules up on those motion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, 2002, G&#243;mez asked the court to permit his then-counsel Bruce McGiverin to withdraw so that he could proceed <i>pro se.</i> The court agreed, but in order to minimize <i>pro se</i> motions that were so incomprehensible as to be a \"total waste of time\" for the court, the court appointed McGiverin as standby counsel and told him to read G&#243;mez's <i>pro se</i> motions, \"advis[e] the court what motions you as a professional would adopt,\" and offer G&#243;mez drafting advice. The court stated that regardless of McGiverin's opinions, G&#243;mez would be free to file the motions, which would then be filtered by a magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the April 12, 2002 order, G&#243;mez filed several dozen more <i>pro se</i> motions, including many after he retained a new counsel of record, Linda George, and despite the fact that his various counsel had filed all of the customary discovery and other motions. These new <i>pro se</i> motions were confusing and many were meritless. On May 14, 2003, for example, G&#243;mez filed an eight-page, single-spaced motion, accompanied by a four-page affidavit, asking that the case be dismissed for \"double jeopardy\" (of which there was none). The motion stated that \"even knowing\" that G&#243;mez's affidavit was based on government perjury, \"the District Court . . . has desregarded and/or ignored the matter by not holding a hearing as to the issue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We quote such passages not to make light of G&#243;mez's motions, but to emphasize the difficulties they created for the district court. The court received dozens of such filings over a three-year period, many of them quite long and packed with muddled, contradictory, meritless legal argument. Each needed a response from the court, and many led to hearings, not to mention appearances by counsel and replies from the government. Despite the burden G&#243;mez's <i>pro se</i> motions imposed, the district court did not treat them lightly. It ruled on many of them, denying the vast majority but allowing some. Most of those it found to have merit had to do with G&#243;mez's various requests for dismissal of his lawyers, for extensions of time, and for transcripts of previous hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By May 2003, the defense had filed more than 95 motions, the majority of which were <i>pro se.</i> One such <i>pro se</i> motion, which G&#243;mez filed on March 28, 2003, sought the withdrawal of his then-counsel George. The court held a hearing on G&#243;mez's motion on May 22, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The court first informed G&#243;mez that it would not allow George to withdraw and to be replaced by a court-appointed attorney because G&#243;mez had not offered a valid reason for his dissatisfaction with George.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George suggested that G&#243;mez proceed <i>pro se</i> while she acted as standby counsel. The court initially rejected that proposal, noting that it had made a similar arrangement with McGiverin but that \"there were a considerable [number] of motions that were filed that were either thoroughly out of bounds or were simply not indicated for this type of case. So therefore, I have to stop him. There is a moment when the court has to stop receiving all those motions.\" After several more exchanges, the court agreed to allow G&#243;mez to proceed <i>pro se</i> with George acting as standby counsel. The court explained the duties it assigned to George, now acting as standby counsel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court: [T]he first thing I have to ask you is to examine all the motions that he's filed [<i>pro se</i>], and to see which ones you're going to adopt.

Trial then began before a different district court judge. Before the jury was sworn in on the trial's first day, there was some confusion as to G&#243;mez's status. The judge indicated that he thought G&#243;mez was proceeding with counsel. However, G&#243;mez and George quickly clarified that the May 22 order allowed G&#243;mez to represent himself. G&#243;mez told the court, and George verified, that \"I was supposed to be represented by myself, <i>pro se.</i>\" He went on to explain that \"Mr. Dom&#237;nguez, the judge . . . addressed the matter and he decided for me to be represented by myself with Linda George as helping counsel. I was permitted to address the court.\" After hearing this, the judge questioned G&#243;mez to confirm that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The judge then agreed that G&#243;mez could represent himself, and noted that George was standby counsel \"in the event that [G&#243;mez] ha[s] questions or any information [he] need[s] from her.\" When it came time for G&#243;mez to deliver his opening statement, however, G&#243;mez informed the trial judge that he did not have a statement prepared. The judge told G&#243;mez that he could make (or waive) the statement himself, retaining his <i>pro se</i> status, or allow George to make the statement, relinquishing his <i>pro se</i> status. Faced with waiving his opening statement, G&#243;mez allowed George to take over his representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although George represented G&#243;mez at trial, G&#243;mez continued to file <i>pro se</i> motions after the trial pursuant to the guidelines set forth in the court's May 22 order, <i>i.e.,</i> screening by George. G&#243;mez was also permitted to participate actively in a post-judgment motions hearing on August 27, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As the court explained at the hearing, \"[y]ou're authorized to speak to the court. . . . One thing is to speak to the court and another is to be filing motions.

The court did not \"effectively ignore[ ]\" G&#243;mez's motion to proceed <i>pro se.</i> To the contrary, the court scheduled a hearing on the motion for October 15, 2001, two weeks after it had been filed. The hearing had to be rescheduled, however, after the United States marshals informed the court that G&#243;mez was out of control, exhibiting violent behavior and expressing ill will toward his mother and his lawyer. Faced with this information, together with the fact that McGiverin was the fifth attorney that G&#243;mez fired or sought to have removed, the court concluded that it had \"no other alternative but to order [G&#243;mez's] psychiatric evaluation immediately.\" Such an evaluation was entirely appropriate under the circumstances, <i>see Godinez v.

On February 15, 2002, the court issued a sealed order finding the defendant competent to stand trial. The court subsequently granted a motion by G&#243;mez to discuss his legal representation, scheduling a hearing for April 12, 2002. At the April 12 hearing, the court expressed concern about G&#243;mez's ability to represent himself effectively, noting that he had \"fill[ed] this record with totally incoherent motions, which are contradictory and taken totally out of context.\" Nevertheless, the court granted G&#243;mez's motion to proceed <i>pro se,</i> subject to a requirement that he have standby counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court may appoint standby counsel even over the defendant's objections. <i>See United States v.

Thus, the requirement that McGiverin act as standby counsel in this case was not inconsistent with G&#243;mez's <i>pro se</i> status. <i>Cf. United States v. Walsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440484\"><a href=\"/opinion/440484/united-states-v-robert-h-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1007 (6th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (holding that standby counsel did not eviscerate the defendant's right to self-representation where the defendant \"was required to submit his motions to advisory counsel for review\"). Indeed, G&#243;mez represented himself at a bail hearing within days of the court granting his motion for self-representation. Although McGiverin also participated in the bail hearing by delivering a final argument, he did so only in response to an explicit request by G&#243;mez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, G&#243;mez's claims that the court rejected his October 2, 2001 motion for self-representation \"out of hand\" and that \"[a]t no time did the [district court] allow [him] to represent himself\" are flatly incorrect. The court did not err in handling the motion to proceed <i>pro se.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>May 22, 2003 screening order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez next faults the court's handling of his motion to have his counsel &#8212; this time, his sixth attorney, Linda George &#8212; withdraw and to proceed <i>pro se.</i> Emphasizing that G&#243;mez's previous <i>pro se</i> motions had been incomprehensible, the court ruled on May 22, 2003 that G&#243;mez could represent himself only if George filtered and approved his motions before they were filed. On appeal, G&#243;mez asserts that this ruling violated his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation.

The court did not deny G&#243;mez's request to proceed <i>pro se.</i> Rather, as we have described, it granted the request but imposed one limitation on G&#243;mez's self-representation&#8212;namely, a requirement that George, as standby counsel, screen G&#243;mez's motions. G&#243;mez was permitted to represent himself in other areas, including at jury selection. As the court explained during a hearing on August 27, 2003, the May 22 order left G&#243;mez free to \"speak to the court,\" just not to \"file motions on your own.\" We therefore reject G&#243;mez's claim that the court denied his request to represent himself \"out of hand.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps anticipating this result, G&#243;mez also asserts that George's unwelcome participation as standby counsel &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> her screening of the motions &#8212; so interfered with his right of self-representation as to \"effectively render[ ] his right to self-representation meaningless.\" <i>Armant v.

We consider this claim under the standards set forth in <i>McKaskle v. Wiggins,</i> which dealt with the role that standby counsel, present at trial over the defendant's objections, may play without eviscerating the <i>Faretta</i> right of self-representation. The <i>McKaskle</i> Court identified two criteria as being central to its analysis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the <i>pro se</i> defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury. . . . If standby counsel's participation over the defendant's objection effectively allows counsel to make or substantially interfere with any significant tactical decisions . . . or to speak <i>instead</i> of the defendant on any matter of importance, the <i>Faretta</i> right is eroded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, participation by standby counsel without the defendant's consent should not be allowed to destroy the jury's perception that the defendant is representing himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">465 U.S. at 178, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(\"Participation by standby counsel outside the presence of the jury engages only the first of these two limitations.\"). G&#243;mez has not demonstrated that his <i>Faretta</i> right was \"eroded\" according to this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is true that he could not submit a motion without George's approval, G&#243;mez has not identified on appeal any motions that George prevented him from filing. Indeed, the record includes a number of <i>pro se</i> motions that were drafted by G&#243;mez and filed by George after the court's May 22 order. Moreover, George's ability to block G&#243;mez from filing motions that were irrelevant or \"totally out of bounds\" cannot be said to constitute either interference with a \"significant tactical decision\" or a preemption of G&#243;mez's ability to speak on a \"matter of importance.\" <i>McKaskle,</i> 465 U.S. at 178, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

G&#243;mez asserts that as long as George was screening his motions, he was unable to \"address the court freely\" and that by allowing George, rather than G&#243;mez, to decide which motions to file, the court failed to resolve disagreements in favor of the defendant, all in contravention of <i>McKaskle.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement from <i>McKaskle</i> on which G&#243;mez relies cannot be read in isolation. That statement was a reiteration of the first prong of the test set forth earlier in the opinion, namely the requirement that standby counsel's unwelcome participation not \"substantially interfere with any significant tactical decisions\" or result in counsel \"speak[ing] instead of the defendant on any matter of importance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 178, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span> (emphasis omitted). This formulation informs the meaning of the reiteration relied upon by G&#243;mez. Moreover, that reiteration must also be read in conjunction with the Court's subsequent statement that there is no \"significant interference with the defendant's actual control over the presentation of his defense, and thus no infringement of his <i>Faretta</i> rights, when `counsel merely helps to ensure the defendant's compliance with basic rules of courtroom protocol and procedure.'\" <i>McKaskle,</i> 465 U.S. at 183, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The <i>McKaskle</i> Court also emphasized that \"[t]he trial judge may be required to make numerous rulings reconciling the participation of standby counsel with a <i>pro se</i> defendant's objection to that participation; nothing in the nature of the <i>Faretta</i> right suggests that the usual deference to `judgment calls' on these issues by the trial judge should not obtain here as elsewhere.\" <i>Id.</i> at 177 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111095\"><a href=\"/opinion/111095/mckaskle-v-wiggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rather, the court may use standby counsel to facilitate the orderly functioning of the proceedings so long as the defendant retains control over \"significant tactical decisions\" and \"on any matter of importance.\" George's screening role was consistent with that standard. In light of G&#243;mez's long history in this case of filing irrelevant and frivolous motions, George's responsibility for preventing the filing of such motions did not deprive G&#243;mez of control over his defense. <i>Cf. United States v.

G&#243;mez's argument appears to rely on the following logic: the court's May 22 order regarding George's screening role led him to believe that he would not be permitted to proceed <i>pro se</i> at trial; G&#243;mez therefore arrived at trial unprepared to represent himself; although the trial judge agreed to let G&#243;mez proceed <i>pro se,</i> G&#243;mez's lack of preparation forced him to ask George to take over his representation before his opening statement;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> this relinquishment of his <i>pro se</i> status meant that George, rather than G&#243;mez, chose which witnesses to present. In short, G&#243;mez contends that, but for George's screening role, he would have represented himself at trial and called witnesses that George chose not to call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the judge presiding over G&#243;mez's second trial initially was confused as to whether the court's May 22 order restricted G&#243;mez's <i>pro se</i> status only with regard to motions, or with regard to his self-representation more generally. Given G&#243;mez's claim on appeal that he was unprepared because he did not believe he would be allowed to represent himself, however, it is G&#243;mez's understanding of the pre-trial record, rather than the trial judge's understanding, that is relevant. As we have already observed, G&#243;mez told the trial judge that he was \"supposed to\" represent himself and that the previous district court judge had \"decided for me to be represented by myself with Linda George as helping counsel. I was permitted to address the court.\" These statements indicate that G&#243;mez thought that he had been granted <i>pro se</i> status prior to the trial, undermining his claim that he interpreted the court's May 22 screening order to preclude him from representing himself at trial. G&#243;mez's lack of preparation at the outset of the second trial was his own fault. His decision to relinquish his <i>pro se</i> status as a result of that lack of preparation was entirely voluntary. The claim that George's screening role prevented G&#243;mez from representing himself at trial and calling particular witnesses is therefore without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

G&#243;mez's counsel responded that \"I think the court should just read what was on the verdict sheet again. I don't think we should get into any explanation.\" The court substantially complied with this suggestion, instructing the jury that \"under the law, on a finding of guilty, the jury is required to answer the question regarding quantity. On a finding of not guilty, the jury should not answer the question regarding quantity.\" The jury subsequently determined that G&#243;mez was guilty on Count II but that the amount of heroin involved was less than 100 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, G&#243;mez argues that through the special verdict question regarding drug quantity and the corresponding jury instructions, the district court constructively amended the superseding indictment in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. A constructive amendment, which is prejudicial <i>per se,</i> \"occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.\" <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194868\"><a href=\"/opinion/194868/united-states-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 462-63 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). G&#243;mez contends that the district court changed the terms of the superseding indictment in this case when it allowed the jury to determine, via the special verdict form, whether G&#243;mez was part of a conspiracy to possess less than 100 grams of heroin. In support of this contention, G&#243;mez asserts that because the superseding indictment charged him with conspiring to possess approximately 975 grams of heroin, it must have referred to a conspiracy with Hueck and Sarruco to possess all eighty-five heroin pellets that Sarruco swallowed (which actually weighed 678 grams). He reasons that if the jury had found him guilty of this conspiracy, it would have indicated on the special verdict form that the amount of heroin was more than 100 grams. Because the jury found instead that the amount of heroin was less than 100 grams, G&#243;mez contends that it must have convicted him of a conspiracy other than the one charged &#8212; specifically, an <i>ad hoc</i> conspiracy with Agent Carmona (posing as Sarruco) to possess the four heroin pellets present in the hotel room, which weighed approximately 32 grams. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No specific drug quantity needs to be proven for a jury to convict a defendant of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute. <i>See United States v. Restrepo-Contreras,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566805\"><a href=\"/opinion/566805/united-states-v-reynaldo-de-jesus-restrepo-contreras/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 99 n. 1 (1st Cir.1991). It is therefore not erroneous <i>per se</i> to allow a jury to find that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged but responsible for a lesser quantity of drugs than that specified in the indictment. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz Solorio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782865\"><a href=\"/opinion/782865/united-states-v-jose-ruiz-solorio-01-5602-ricky-martin-luna-01-5603/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 589-91 (6th Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></span> (2003). G&#243;mez does not contend otherwise. He argues instead that, in this particular case, the effect of the special verdict question regarding drug quantity was to allow the jury to consider two different conspiracies, one charged and one uncharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While G&#243;mez's argument is creative, it is ultimately unpersuasive. The court asked the jury to determine the drug quantity not to present it with an uncharged conspiracy, but rather to ascertain a fact necessary for sentencing. The court instructed the jury that it should convict G&#243;mez on Count II only upon a finding that \"<i>the agreement specified in the indictment,</i> and not some other agreement or agreements, existed between at least two people to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute it\" (emphasis added). It further instructed the jury that it should reach the question of drug quantity only upon a finding that G&#243;mez was guilty. Nothing in these instructions suggests that the jury was free to convict G&#243;mez for a conspiracy other than the one charged in the superseding indictment. <i>See United States v. Owens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198347\"><a href=\"/opinion/198347/united-states-v-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 756 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that \"our system of trial by jury is premised on the assumption that jurors will scrupulously follow the court's instructions\"). Rather, the instructions and special verdict form left room for the jury to determine that G&#243;mez had participated in the charged conspiracy but to limit his responsibility to a lower amount. Neither the special verdict form nor the instructions accompanying it constituted a constructive amendment of the superseding indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

G&#243;mez asserts that the district court determined during his first trial that he had no relationship with Sarruco, and therefore that the government could not attempt to show during the second trial that he and Sarruco were co-conspirators. The district court, however, made no such finding during the first trial. It concluded only that there was no personal relationship between G&#243;mez and Sarruco sufficient to support a charge that G&#243;mez <i>aided and abetted</i> Sarruco's drug possession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The court did not determine that the lack of a personal relationship would preclude the two from being <i>co-conspirators.</i> To the contrary, the court suggested that the facts likely <i>would</i> support the existence of a conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The court's finding in the first trial that Sarruco and G&#243;mez did not know each other therefore did not preclude the government from arguing in the second trial that the two were co-conspirators. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Sarruco told Hueck that he was waiting in Room 209 of the Hotel Iberia. Within hours, G&#243;mez arrived at the hotel in a van containing a gun and knocked on the door of Room 209. After being shown four heroin pellets, G&#243;mez asked Agent Carmona, posing as Sarruco, how many he had swallowed and offered to get him a laxative. Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could have concluded that G&#243;mez's presence at the hotel was not merely coincidental, as he claimed. Rather, the jury could have concluded, he visited Room 209 based on his participation in a conspiracy with Sarruco and others. <i>See United States v.

As we have already discussed, however, G&#243;mez's appearance at Room 209 of the Hotel Iberia shortly after Sarruco talked to Hueck, together with his interaction with Agent Carmona, were adequate to link G&#243;mez to a conspiracy that included Hueck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

His trial on those charges ended on February 26, 2003 with a judgment of acquittal on two counts (drug possession and possession of a firearm) and a mistrial on the third count (drug importation). Instead of retrying G&#243;mez on the drug importation charge, the government obtained a superseding indictment in March 2003 that charged G&#243;mez with conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute and conspiracy to import drugs. G&#243;mez went to trial on the conspiracy charges in June 2003 and was ultimately convicted on the conspiracy to possess charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, G&#243;mez asserts that the delay between his arrest in April 2000 and the filing of the superseding indictment in March 2003 violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The government points out, however, that G&#243;mez's development of this argument is more consistent with a Fifth Amendment due process claim based on pre-indictment delay than with a Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim.

Even after the government pointed out this omission in its brief on appeal, G&#243;mez failed to develop the Sixth Amendment argument in his reply brief, focusing instead on the application of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause to his claim.

Marion,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108420\"><a href=\"/opinion/108420/united-states-v-marion/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 324, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108420\"><a href=\"/opinion/108420/united-states-v-marion/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span> (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Prejudice</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez identifies two forms of prejudice stemming from the government's delay in obtaining the superseding indictment. First, he asserts that because the substantive and conspiracy charges were brought consecutively, instead of concurrently, he was forced to defend himself twice. In light of the disposition of G&#243;mez's first trial (the court declared a mistrial on one count and ordered that a retrial be scheduled), however, G&#243;mez would have had to defend himself twice even if the superseding indictment had never been filed; the government just decided to bring different charges for the second trial. Moreover, there is no evidence that forcing G&#243;mez to defend himself twice caused any prejudice, let alone substantial prejudice, to his right to a fair trial. <i>See id.</i> He does not assert that any evidence or witnesses were compromised by the delay, nor does he explain how the delay otherwise hampered his right to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez also assigns prejudice to the three years he spent in prison before the superseding indictment was filed. The incarceration to which G&#243;mez points, however, did not result from the pre-indictment delay of which he now complains. G&#243;mez was imprisoned between April 2000 and February 2003 pending trial on the substantive charges set forth in the original indictment. He would have spent that time in prison regardless of when the conspiracy charges were filed. The government obtained the superseding indictment approximately two weeks after the trial on the substantive charges ended in a mistrial. The relevant period of pre-indictment incarceration with respect to G&#243;mez's Fifth Amendment prejudice claim is therefore a matter of weeks, not of years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Tactical advantage</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if G&#243;mez were able to demonstrate prejudice resulting from the pre-indictment delay, his Fifth Amendment claim would falter on the second prong of the inquiry. There is simply no evidence that the government intentionally delayed indicting G&#243;mez on the conspiracy charges to obtain a tactical advantage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Moreover, although G&#243;mez claims that the sequential indictment allowed the government to get \"a second bite at the apple,\" he has not identified any specific advantage that the government gained. G&#243;mez did not present any evidence in the first trial. He cannot argue, therefore, that the sequential prosecution allowed the government to preview his case or to adapt its case to his defense. In short, G&#243;mez's due process claim must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, G&#243;mez challenges the propriety of his sentence, arguing that a remand for resentencing is appropriate in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Booker.</i> We agree and reject the government's contrary position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court deems <i>Booker</i> error preserved if the defendant argued at sentencing that the sentence violated <i>Apprendi</i> or <i>Blakely,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> or that the federal Sentencing Guidelines were unconstitutional. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2005). Where the defendant has preserved a <i>Booker</i> claim, we review for harmless error, remanding for resentencing unless the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that a lower sentence would not be imposed under the post-<i>Booker</i> regime. <i>United States v. V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201585\"><a href=\"/opinion/201585/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 489 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court took account of several facts not found by the jury &#8212; including, <i>inter alia,</i> the amount of heroin involved, the presence of a firearm, and the court's conclusion that G&#243;mez perjured himself at trial &#8212; in determining a sentence, and G&#243;mez timely objected to the judicial fact-finding. Thus, G&#243;mez preserved his claim of error. The government has not met its burden of proving that G&#243;mez would not receive a lower sentence under the advisory Guidelines. <i>See Vazquez-Rivera,</i> 407 F.3d at 490 (even \"factual certainty\" as to basis for enhancements is not sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge would have applied the same sentence under an advisory Guidelines system). We remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that a full remand is inappropriate. Contending that G&#243;mez preserved his <i>Booker</i> claim only with respect to the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy, and not with respect to the gun and perjury findings, it argues that we should therefore review the latter two issues under a plain error standard. The government maintains that G&#243;mez cannot meet that standard and thus that we should issue a partial remand, instructing the district court only to recalculate the base offense level. We reject this invitation to disaggregate <i>Booker</i> claims and consider them piecemeal. Such an approach is inconsistent with this court's <i>Booker</i> jurisprudence under <i>Antonakopoulos.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, our decision to remand should not be read as a \"suggestion or a prediction that [G&#243;mez's] sentence will necessarily be altered.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.2005). This is especially true \"where the remand arises out of a preserved error and where the harmless error test makes even a modest possibility of change enough to warrant remand.\" <i>United States v. Lata,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201703\"><a href=\"/opinion/201703/united-states-v-lata/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">G&#243;mez's conviction is <i>affirmed;</i> his sentence on that conviction is <i>vacated.</i> We <i>remand</i> for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We refer throughout this opinion to \"the district court,\" a generic term which might suggest that a single judge presided over all the proceedings that culminated in this appeal. That is not the case. At least three different district court judges, and an array of magistrate judges, have been involved in different stages of this case. Judge Dom&#237;nguez handled the October 2001 and March 2003 motions to proceed<i>pro se</i> that are discussed in Section II.A., while Judge McAuliffe presided over the first trial, which ended in a judgment of acquittal on two counts and a mistrial on one count, and Judge Singal presided over the second trial, which resulted in G&#243;mez's conviction for conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute. Only rulings of Judge Dom&#237;nguez and Judge Singal are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sarruco expelled the remaining eighty pellets at the San Juan Health Center under the supervision of two customs agents.

Based on such inconsistencies, the court found at sentencing that \"the defendant . . . perjure[d] himself during trial when he was claiming that he was at the hotel to find this unknown female in an unknown room. I find that in fact he went to the hotel to pick up the drugs.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> G&#243;mez cites the two-month interval between the filing of his motion and the hearing as evidence of the district court's \"indifference to the defendant's assertion of an absolute Sixth Amendment right.\" This claim is manifestly unfair to the district court, which expended a great deal of effort in attempting to accommodate G&#243;mez. Moreover, there was good reason for the delay. Shortly after G&#243;mez filed his motion, the district court judge temporarily recused himself from the case and reassigned all pending motions to a magistrate judge. The magistrate promptly issued an order giving George an opportunity to respond to the motion to withdraw, and scheduled the hearing a month later, by which point the district court judge had returned to the case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Before concluding that the waiver of the right to counsel was knowing and voluntary, the trial judge took great pains to ensure that G&#243;mez had \"a sense of the magnitude of the undertaking,\"<i>Maynard v.

For example, the judge warned G&#243;mez:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">I think it is unwise of you to try to represent yourself. You are not familiar with the law in spite of what you think. You are not familiar with court procedure . . . and you are not familiar with the Rules of Evidence in spite of what you think. This is a very serious set of charges.

G&#243;mez had filed a civil suit against George, creating a conflict of interest between the two. The court concluded that in light of the conflict of interest, it had to allow George to withdraw. The court again agreed to let G&#243;mez \"proceed<i>pro se</i> with standby counsel\" subject to a limitation that \"standby counsel is the only person authorized to sign motions,\" and appointed attorney Miriam Ramos Grateroles as the standby counsel.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> G&#243;mez claimed that McGiverin would not file motions that G&#243;mez believed were necessary to his defense and to preserve his appellate rights</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Although there was some ambiguity during the hearing as to McGiverin's exact role as standby counsel, the court ultimately explained that it wanted McGiverin to examine G&#243;mez's<i>pro se</i> motions, but that G&#243;mez retained control over their filing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> G&#243;mez employed this hybrid representation arrangement again at a motions hearing on August 15, 2002, representing himself throughout much of the hearing but asking McGiverin, his standby counsel, to cross-examine a witness about an evidentiary issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> As already noted, when it became apparent that G&#243;mez had not prepared an opening statement, the trial judge informed G&#243;mez that he could make (or waive) the statement himself, retaining his<i>pro se</i> status, or allow George to make the statement, relinquishing his <i>pro se</i> status.

Moreover, when the court asked for input on a response to the jury's note about \"the importance of 100 grams of heroin,\" G&#243;mez agreed that no additional explanation regarding the significance of the drug quantity was necessary.
