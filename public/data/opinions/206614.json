The Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\n\nby the administrator of \"MassHealth,\" its state Medicaid program,\n\nappeals from a dismissal of its lawsuit against federal officials\n\nfor failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).                 The\n\nCommonwealth   claims    that    the    federal     Centers   for    Medicare   &\n\nMedicaid   Services   (CMS)     and    associated    entities    violated    the\n\nfederal    Medicaid   statute     when       they   refused     to   allow   the\n\nCommonwealth to recover reimbursement directly from CMS in four\n\ncases of \"retroactive dual eligibility.\"\n\n           In each of these four cases, an individual who received\n\nMassachusetts Medicaid funds to pay for medical services was later\n\ndeemed retroactively eligible for federal Medicare funds for the\n\nperiod in which the individual received those services.               The state\n\nis trying to secure reimbursement for its past Medicaid payments by\n\ndirectly   petitioning   the    federal      government   for    reimbursement\n\nrather than going back to the providers of services, whom the\n\nMedicare program clearly recognizes as appropriate claimants. This\n\ndispute is not over whether the Commonwealth should ultimately be\n\nreimbursed by Medicare, but whether it has chosen a permissible\n\nmechanism to recover reimbursement.            Cf. Massachusetts v. United\n\nStates, 522 F.3d 115, 129 n.8 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           The Commonwealth, for understandable reasons, argues that\n\nits obligations under the federal Medicaid statute, as stated in 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) and 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d), require that\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fit seek and recover reimbursement directly from CMS in these cases\n\nof   retroactive     dual   eligibility,     and   that   this    is    the\n\nCommonwealth's     exclusive   avenue.     Secretary   Sebelius   and   the\n\ndefendant administrators of CMS and associated entities deny this\n\nand reply that the Commonwealth must instead seek reimbursement\n\nfrom providers, who then in turn must obtain payment from Medicare.\n\n          The federal defendants argue this is so because 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395f(a) and 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 only allow \"providers\" to receive\n\npayments from Medicare, and the Commonwealth is, as it admits, not\n\na provider.      Defendants argue that to meet its obligations to\n\nrecover reimbursement under the Medicaid statute, the Commonwealth\n\nmust request reimbursement from individual providers, who then must\n\nobtain payment from the federal Medicare agency.            The federal\n\ndefendants say that this is the procedure used by other states to\n\nrecover reimbursement, that they have been consistent in their\n\ninterpretation, and that Massachusetts is simply wrong when it\n\nasserts this interpretation leaves it with no way to recover\n\nreimbursement in accordance with the Medicaid statute.\n\n          In this matter of statutory interpretation, the district\n\ncourt held that the Medicare statute unambiguously forbids the\n\nCommonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from CMS.           In\n\nthe alternative, it held that even if the Medicare statute were\n\nambiguous, CMS's interpretation must be sustained under Chevron,\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fU.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc., 467 U.S. 837\n\n(1984), and Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997).\n\n            We requested at oral argument, and subsequently received,\n\nadditional briefing on what mechanisms would be available for the\n\nCommonwealth to obtain reimbursement if its position were not\n\naccepted.     We affirm the district court's judgment, albeit on\n\ndifferent reasoning.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            The federal Medicare and Medicaid statutes, which compose\n\nTitle XVIII and Title XIX of the Social Security Act, interact.\n\nMedicare is a health insurance program for those who are over age\n\n65 or have certain disabilities.1      42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.   By\n\ncontrast, Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income\n\nindividuals; it is funded by both the federal government and state\n\ngovernments.2   42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.\n\n            Medicaid is generally supposed to be a \"payer of last\n\nresort.\"    Ark. Dep't of Health & Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547 U.S.\n\n\n     1\n          Medicare Part A provides hospital insurance coverage for\ninpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities\n(excluding custodial or long-term care). See 42 U.S.C. § 1395c et\nseq.   Medicare Part B provides supplementary medical insurance\ncoverage for doctors' services and outpatient care. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1395j et seq.\n     2\n          To be clear, payment is not coextensive under the\nMedicare and Medicaid statutes, which have different criteria for\ncoverage of services. Compare 42 U.S.C. § 1395d with 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396a. Medicaid coverage varies by state; the federal Medicaid\nstatute requires that states follow certain parameters to receive\nfederal funding. 42 U.S.C. § 1396.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f268, 291 (2006) (quoting S. Rep. No. 99-146, at 313 (1985)).   This\n\nmeans that \"when an individual is entitled to Medicare and eligible\n\nfor Medicaid, Medicare, like any other third party, is the primary\n\npayor,\" and Medicaid may only pay a claim \"to the extent that\n\npayment allowed under the applicable payment schedule . . . exceeds\n\nthe amount of Medicare's payment.\"     Medicaid Program: State Plan\n\nRequirements and Other Provisions Relating to State Third Party\n\nLiability Programs, 55 Fed. Reg. 1423, 1429 (1990). State Medicaid\n\nagencies must \"take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal\n\nliability of third parties . . . to pay for care and services\" that\n\nwould otherwise be paid by Medicaid.   42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(A).\n\nIt is not disputed that Medicare is a third party under this\n\nprovision.3\n\n          Under the federal Medicaid statute and its accompanying\n\nregulations, state Medicaid agencies must follow two sets of\n\nrequirements when addressing third-party liability.4     First, if\n\nprobable third-party liability is established at the time a claim\n\n\n\n     3\n          CMS regulations have made clear that Medicare is such a\nparty. See 42 C.F.R § 433.136 (\"Third party means any individual,\nentity or program that is or may be liable to pay all or part of\nthe expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a State\nplan.\"); N.Y. State Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Bowen, 846 F.2d 129,\n133-34 (2d Cir. 1988) (quoting CMS manuals that \"define Medicare as\na third party resource\").\n     4\n          We refer to the Commonwealth and its state Medicaid\nprogram interchangeably. The Commonwealth's Executive Office for\nHealth and Human Services (EOHHS) administers the Massachusetts\nMedicaid Program (MassHealth).\n\n                               -5-\n\fis filed with the state agency, the agency must reject the claim\n\nand return it to the service provider.   42 C.F.R. § 433.139(b)(1);\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(A).   Second, if a state Medicaid agency\n\nonly \"learns of the existence of a liable third party\" or \"benefits\n\nbecome available from a third party\" after Medicaid has paid the\n\nclaim, the Medicaid agency must \"seek recovery of reimbursement.\"\n\n42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d)(2); see also 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B).\n\nThe Commonwealth relies on the second statute and regulation,\n\narguing they require that it seek and obtain reimbursement directly\n\nfrom CMS when the liable third party is Medicare.5\n\n          The defendants argue that several provisions of the\n\nfederal Medicare statute, particularly 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a), forbid\n\nthe Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from CMS.\n\nWith some exceptions not relevant here, \"payment for services . . .\n\nmay be made only to providers of services\" if filed \"in such\n\nmanner, and by such person or persons as the Secretary may by\n\nregulation prescribe.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a)(1). By regulation, in\n\n42 C.F.R. § 424.33, the Secretary has prescribed that \"claims for\n\nservices of providers\" must be \"[f]iled by the provider.\"      The\n\n\n\n     5\n          Two examples illustrate how retroactive dual eligibility\nmay occur. First, an individual over the age of 65 who does not\nsign up for Medicare Part A coverage or social security benefits\nuntil sometime after she turns 65 years old can automatically\nreceive retroactive Part A coverage effective six months prior to\nsigning up. 42 C.F.R. § 406.6(d)(4). Second, an individual may\nappeal from a denial of Medicare Part A eligibility on the basis of\na disability, and may be awarded retroactive coverage.\n\n                               -6-\n\fCommonwealth argues, and the defendants agree, that it is not a\n\nprovider. The defendants argue that while the Commonwealth may not\n\nrecover    reimbursement    directly    from     CMS,     it    may   fulfill   its\n\nobligation under the Medicaid statute by asking providers to obtain\n\npayment from Medicare.\n\n            The defendants argue that providers must comply with such\n\nrequests by filing a \"demand bill\" with Medicare.                     The Medicare\n\nstatute requires that providers agree to \"make adequate provision\n\nfor return\" of money \"incorrectly collected\" from individuals.                   42\n\nU.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(C).       CMS regulations state that a \"payment\n\nproperly   made   to   a   provider    by   an   individual       not   considered\n\nentitled to Medicare benefits will be deemed to be an 'incorrect\n\ncollection' when the individual is found to be retroactively\n\nentitled to benefits.\"        42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b).             CMS argues that\n\nthis regulation, though it refers to payments made by individuals\n\nrather than state Medicaid agencies, requires that providers return\n\nstate Medicaid funds in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.                   It\n\nargues that providers that do not comply with this requirement face\n\nsanctions, including termination of participation in Medicare. See\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 489.53(a)(1).\n\n            One reason the Commonwealth takes the position that it\n\nmay   recover     reimbursement       directly     from        Medicare   is    its\n\ninterpretation of a decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt, Atlanticare Medical Center v. Commissioner of the Division\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fof Medical Assistance, 785 N.E.2d 346 (Mass. 2003).              In that case,\n\na group of private healthcare providers challenged a Massachusetts\n\nregulation that required healthcare providers to return state\n\nMedicaid payments when a liable third-party insurer was identified\n\nafter payment.       The providers argued that Massachusetts placed an\n\nundue burden on providers by making them responsible for recovering\n\npayment from third parties. Id. The Supreme Judicial Court struck\n\ndown the state regulation.        In the course of its ruling it reasoned\n\nthat   the   state    regulation   was   inconsistent     with    the   federal\n\nMedicaid statute, namely 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B), and that\n\nstate Medicaid agencies must seek reimbursement directly from\n\nliable third parties.       Id. at 350.\n\n             Some of the reimbursement claims at issue in Atlanticare\n\nbelonged to individuals who were retroactively deemed eligible for\n\nMedicare. We stress that neither the parties nor the issues before\n\nthis court are the parties or issues that were before the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court.       In Atlanticare, the issue was the validity of a\n\nstate regulation; further, the regulation governed reimbursement\n\nfrom all types of third parties, not merely instances involving\n\nMedicare.     As CMS has noted, the state regulation did not make\n\nallowances    for    the   fact   that   Medicare   and   Medicaid      are   not\n\ncoextensive in coverage; it required providers to return Medicaid\n\nfunds before Medicare made a determination that it was liable for\n\nthe particular services for which those funds had been paid.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fFederal Medicare and Medicaid officials were not parties to the\n\naction and the Supreme Judicial Court never heard their views on\n\nthe issue before us, as it noted in its decision.               Id. at 355.\n\nApparently, the Commonwealth did not ask CMS to submit a brief to\n\nthe court expressing its views.       Cf. Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy,\n\n131 S. Ct. 871, 877 (2011).\n\n           The parties in Atlanticare initially agreed that the\n\nCommonwealth could not recover costs directly from Medicare.            The\n\nCommonwealth argued that under 42 C.F.R. § 424.33, Medicare may\n\nonly pay directly to providers.        At oral argument, however, both\n\nparties conceded that it might be possible for the Commonwealth to\n\nrecover directly from Medicare.       Atlanticare, 785 N.E.2d at 353-54\n\n& n.14.    The court stated that the Commonwealth had cited no\n\nauthority demonstrating that it could not obtain reimbursement\n\ndirectly from Medicare and that there was nothing in the record to\n\nsuggest   that   the   Commonwealth    had   ever   attempted    to   obtain\n\nreimbursement in this fashion.        Id. at 354-55.    The decision did\n\nnot address either 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) or 42 C.F.R. § 424.33, or\n\nhow CMS administers these provisions.\n\n           Both before and after the Atlanticare decision, the\n\nfederal Medicare and Medicaid agency has taken the position that\n\nonly providers may petition Medicare for payment absent an express\n\nallowance to the contrary.     In a 1991 letter to the Commonwealth,\n\nCMS wrote that \"a State Medicaid agency . . . may not submit\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\finitial claims for Part A Medicare services, as these claims must\n\nbe filed by the provider.\"6              The letter distinguished \"initial\n\nclaims\" from appeals arising from denials of claims.                       It stated\n\nthat \"a dually eligible beneficiary may certainly appoint the State\n\nMedicaid agency to act as his or her representative to pursue\n\nappeal of an individual denied Medicare claim\" but \"without such\n\nappointment, the State Medicaid agency may not act on its own\n\nbehalf,\" with an exception not relevant here.\n\n               In April 2003, shortly after the decision in Atlanticare,\n\nCMS issued a State Medicaid Director Letter stating that when an\n\nindividual receives payment for health services from Medicaid and\n\nis later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare, the state\n\nMedicaid agency should ask the provider of services to file a claim\n\nwith       Medicare.      The   letter   was    sent   to    all   state    Medicaid\n\ndirectors, not just the Massachusetts Medicaid director.                      In May\n\n2003, the Commonwealth sought clarification of this letter in light\n\nof Atlanticare.          In September 2003, it also sought to establish\n\nitself as a \"qualified billing entity\" that could submit claims to\n\nMedicare on behalf of Medicaid recipients and the facilities that\n\nprovide services to those recipients.\n\n               CMS     denied   the   Commonwealth's        request   that    it   be\n\nestablished as a qualified billing entity and reiterated that only\n\n\n\n       6\n          At the time, CMS was known as the Health Care Financing\nAdministration.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fproviders may file claims with Medicare. In an October 2003 letter\n\ndenying     the   Commonwealth's     request,     CMS     wrote   that      its\n\n\"interpretation      of     the     regulations      prohibits        Medicare\n\nIntermediaries from paying benefits due to a provider to other than\n\nthe provider of services.\"        In a December 2003 letter clarifying\n\nthe April 2003 guidance letter, CMS wrote that \"there is no\n\nstatutory    authority    under   Medicare   to   allow   a   state   to   seek\n\nrecovery and be paid directly from Medicare\" because \"Medicare\n\nallows only providers to bill and be paid by Medicare.\"                      It\n\nrepeated that when Medicare's third-party liability is not known\n\nuntil after a state Medicaid agency has paid a claim, the state\n\nshould ask the provider to bill Medicare.\n\n            In light of CMS's statements, the Commonwealth sought a\n\nmodification of the declaratory judgment entered in Atlanticare on\n\nthe ground that new information demonstrated it could not recover\n\nreimbursement directly from Medicare.         In support of this motion,\n\nthe Commonwealth submitted copies of the April 2003 guidance letter\n\nand the ensuing correspondence between it and CMS. A Massachusetts\n\nSuperior Court denied this motion.            Atlanticare Med. Ctr. v.\n\nReynolds, No. 1451-H, slip op. at 2 (Mass. Super. Ct. July 28,\n\n2004).      The Superior Court stated that it found the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court's decision in Atlanticare more persuasive than the\n\nApril 2003 guidance letter, and that the letter had merely restated\n\narguments the Commonwealth advanced in Atlanticare.               Id. at 6.\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fAgain, no federal Medicare or Medicaid official was involved in the\n\nsuit or asked to submit the agency's views.                  The Commonwealth did\n\nnot, apparently, pursue the matter to the Supreme Judicial Court.\n\n               In   later   communications        with    the     Commonwealth,   CMS\n\ncontinued to reiterate its position that a state Medicaid agency\n\ncannot       recover     reimbursement     directly        from    Medicare.      The\n\nCommonwealth, correctly or not, believed itself between a rock and\n\na hard place.          In December 2006, the Commonwealth submitted four\n\ntest       claims   to   CMS,   seeking    reimbursement        from   Medicare   for\n\nMedicaid       funds     paid   on   behalf      of    individuals     later   deemed\n\nretroactively eligible for Medicare.                  CMS rejected these claims on\n\nthe ground that the Commonwealth is not a provider, consistent with\n\nthe agency's position stated earlier that non-providers may not\n\nreceive payments from Medicare.             The Commonwealth then filed this\n\nlawsuit.7      It is undisputed that the Commonwealth has exhausted its\n\nadministrative remedies.\n\n               The Commonwealth seeks (1) an injunction ordering CMS to\n\naccept, process, approve, and pay the four reimbursement claims it\n\nsubmitted in 2006, as well as (2) a declaration that the defendants\n\nmust accept and process reimbursement claims submitted by the\n\n\n       7\n          The four test claims at issue here concern $39,792.32 in\nMedicaid funds paid by the Commonwealth for services to individuals\nlater deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare.          At oral\nargument, the Commonwealth stated that it pays roughly $4 million\nin Medicaid funding each year for services rendered to individuals\nlater deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare effective at the\ntime those services were rendered.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fCommonwealth     in    cases   of   retroactive       dual   eligibility.        The\n\ndistrict court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and dismissed the Commonwealth's cross-motion\n\nfor summary judgment as moot.             It held that 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a)\n\nunambiguously         prohibits     the     Commonwealth       from     recovering\n\nreimbursement directly from CMS.                The district court held in the\n\nalternative that even assuming the statute was ambiguous, 42 C.F.R.\n\n§ 424.33 must receive deference because it was promulgated pursuant\n\nto    an   express    delegation    of    authority    and   is   not   arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\n\n                                          II.\n\n             We review de novo a district court's grant of a motion to\n\ndismiss, taking as true all well-pleaded facts and making all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.

This case does not\n\ninvolve any factual disputes, only a pure question of law: whether\n\nthe    federal   Medicaid      statute      requires    that      CMS   allow    the\n\nCommonwealth to recover reimbursement directly from CMS in cases of\n\nretroactive dual eligibility.              This does not involve review of\n\nwhether there is a valid claim for reimbursement in these four test\n\ncases; it involves review of the appropriate mechanism to obtain\n\nsuch reimbursement.       We agree with the defendants that as a matter\n\nof federal law, the Commonwealth may not recover reimbursement\n\ndirectly from CMS in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.                     This\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fdoes not mean, however, that the state has no mechanism to receive\n\nreimbursement.       It does.\n\nA.           Agency Deference Under Chevron\n\n             This question of statutory interpretation must be treated\n\nwithin the familiar framework set forth in Chevron, 467 U.S. 837.\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services administers the federal\n\nMedicare and Medicaid statutes, as well as a number of other\n\nstatutory provisions within the Social Security Act. The Secretary\n\nhas delegated administrative responsibilities for Medicare and\n\nMedicaid to CMS.        See 42 C.F.R. § 400.200.        In assessing the\n\nrequirements of this statutory scheme, we must be mindful of any\n\ndeference to which CMS may be entitled.\n\n             Under    Chevron,   when   a   court   reviews   an   agency's\n\nconstruction of the statute it administers, the court must first\n\nask whether \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question\n\nat issue.\"    Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842.      If the intent of Congress is\n\nunambiguous, the court must follow that intent.        Id. at 842-43.    If\n\nthe intent of Congress is ambiguous, the agency's interpretation is\n\nentitled to Chevron deference \"when it appears that Congress\n\ndelegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying\n\nthe force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming\n\ndeference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\"\n\nUnited States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001).             Under\n\nChevron, such agency interpretations must be upheld if they are\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f\"based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" Chevron, 467\n\nU.S. at 843.\n\n           Courts may not disturb regulations promulgated pursuant\n\nto   express   statutory   authority    unless   they   are   \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious or manifestly contrary to the statute\" and they may not\n\ndisturb regulations promulgated pursuant to implicit statutory\n\nauthority unless the agency's interpretation is unreasonable.         Id.\n\nat 844.   When an agency interprets its own ambiguous regulations,\n\nits interpretation is controlling unless it is \"plainly erroneous\n\nor inconsistent with the regulation.\"        McCoy, 131 S. Ct. at 880\n\n(quoting Auer, 519 U.S. at 461).       Deference is not given, however,\n\nto a \"post hoc rationalizatio[n] advanced by an agency seeking to\n\ndefend past agency action against attack\" or when there is reason\n\nto \"suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency's\n\nfair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\"          Id. at\n\n881 (alteration in original) (quoting Auer, 519 U.S. at 462)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).8\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          Both parties cite cases from beyond this circuit that\nthey argue support their constructions of the Medicare and Medicaid\nstatutes in this case. See Conn. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Leavitt,\n428 F.3d 138 (2d Cir. 2005); N.Y. State Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\nBowen, 846 F.2d 129 (2d Cir. 1988); Evanston Hosp. v.

Mich. 1994); Petition of Maxi\nDrug, Inc., 915 A.2d 480 (N.H. 2006). While we have reviewed these\ncases, we note that they do not bind this circuit nor, more\nimportantly, do they speak directly to the issue at hand.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fB.          Chevron Step One\n\n            Our first holding begins and ends with step one of the\n\nChevron     analysis:   the     statutory    scheme     forecloses   the\n\ninterpretation advanced by the Commonwealth. To determine \"whether\n\na statute exhibits Chevron-type ambiguity . . . courts look at both\n\nthe most natural reading of the language and the consistency of the\n\n'interpretive clues' Congress provided.\"        Succar v. Ashcroft, 394\n\nF.3d 8, 22 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc.\n\nv. Cline, 540 U.S. 581, 586 (2004)).        This analysis looks to the\n\ntext, structure, and, when permissible, legislative history of the\n\nstatute.    Id. at 22, 30.    We look first to text and structure; we\n\nnote that neither party introduces legislative history and we are\n\nunaware of any on point.9\n\n            Both parties contend that the plain language of the\n\nstatutory   scheme   unambiguously   supports   their   position.    The\n\nCommonwealth points to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B), which states\n\nthat when third party liability \"is found to exist after medical\n\nassistance has been made available,\" with an exception not relevant\n\nhere, the state Medicaid agency must \"seek reimbursement for such\n\nassistance to the extent of such legal liability.\"        The defendants\n\n\n     9\n          In Atlanticare, the Supreme Judicial Court considered\nlegislative history in construing from whom state Medicaid agencies\nmust seek reimbursement under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B).\nAtlanticare Med. Ctr. v. Comm'r of the Div. of Med. Assistance, 785\nN.E.2d 346, 351-352 (Mass. 2003). The parties here do not invoke\nthat legislative history, which did not concern reimbursement\ndirectly from Medicare.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fpoint to 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a), which states that, with exceptions\n\nagain    not    relevant     here,    \"payment    for    services     furnished    an\n\nindividual may be made only to providers of services\" as defined in\n\nthe Medicare statute.\n\n               Neither of these provisions, read in isolation, speak to\n\nwhether the Commonwealth, which is not a provider, may recover\n\nreimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual\n\neligibility. Although 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) plainly requires\n\nthat state Medicaid agencies seek reimbursement in such cases, it\n\ndoes not create a right to receive reimbursement directly from CMS.\n\nThis provision does not identify from whom the state agency should\n\nseek this reimbursement.             The federal Medicare agency could be a\n\ncandidate, but the providers that received the initial payment are\n\nmore plausible.        The fact that 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) refers to\n\n\"payment for services furnished an individual,\" moreover, permits\n\nthe     Commonwealth    to     argue    that     its    claim    is   instead     for\n\nreimbursement for past payments made for such services.\n\n               Although no statutory provision explicitly resolves the\n\nquestion presented here, the statutory scheme does not allow the\n\ninterpretation advanced by the Commonwealth.                 The Medicare statute\n\nequates reimbursement and payment and does not allow non-providers\n\nto    receive    payments    from     Medicare.        The   Commonwealth   is    not\n\nincluded among any of the express allowances in the Medicare\n\nstatute for non-providers to receive payments.                        The Medicare\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fstatute    thus   forecloses    the        Commonwealth   from     receiving\n\nreimbursement directly from Medicare.10         This result is consistent\n\nwith both the Medicaid statute's requirement that state Medicaid\n\nagencies seek recovery of reimbursement and Congress's intent that\n\nMedicaid generally be the payer of last resort.\n\n           We look first to the meaning of \"reimbursement\" in the\n\nstatutory scheme.    Neither the Medicare statute nor the Medicaid\n\nstatute supports a distinction between payment and reimbursement\n\nrelevant to the test claims in this case.              As to the Medicare\n\nstatute, 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) discusses claims for reimbursement\n\nwithin its provisions governing payment for services.             The statute\n\ndoes not define reimbursement, nor does it express parameters for\n\nreimbursement claims as if they were different from the parameters\n\nfor   payment   claims.   As   to   the     Medicaid   statute,    42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396a(a)(25)(B) neither defines reimbursement nor distinguishes\n\nbetween it and other forms of payment for our purposes.                 In this\n\nstatutory context, it is most natural to read reimbursement as a\n\nparticular type of payment.     See Succar, 394 F.3d at 22.\n\n           The Commonwealth challenges this reading on two grounds.\n\nFirst, it argues that the Medicare statute allows non-providers to\n\n\n\n      10\n          The Commonwealth does not contest that the payments at\nissue in this case were for \"services furnished an individual\"\nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a).          Although the\nCommonwealth did not provide the services in the four test cases,\nits reimbursement claims seek to recoup payments for such services\nas defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(e) and accompanying sections.\n\n                                    -18-\n\frecover reimbursement despite its limitations on who may recover\n\npayments for services.      Second, it argues that this interpretation\n\nof the statutory scheme contravenes congressional intent that\n\nMedicaid generally be the payer of last resort.\n\n             As to the first argument, the Commonwealth has not\n\nidentified any statutory language that would allow state Medicaid\n\nagencies     to   recover    reimbursement   from    CMS    under   these\n\ncircumstances.       The Commonwealth has identified only one instance\n\nin which the statute allows payment for reimbursement to non-\n\nproviders: an express exception to 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) involving\n\nemergency services.       See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395f(d)(2) & 1395n(b)(2).\n\nWe are aware of only one other instance in which the statute allows\n\na non-provider to receive reimbursement: when an individual has\n\nmade payments for certain hospital services furnished outside the\n\nUnited States.       See 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(f)(4).   These provisions do\n\nnot allow all non-providers to receive reimbursement, and they do\n\nnot   make     any    specific   allowance   for    the    Commonwealth's\n\nreimbursement claims.       Rather, they are express exceptions to the\n\ngeneral rule we have noted.\n\n             As to the second argument, our reading of the statute is\n\nnot in tension with Congress's intent that Medicaid generally be a\n\npayer of last resort. The statute does not preclude state Medicaid\n\nagencies from receiving reimbursement in cases of retroactive dual\n\neligibility through a mechanism other than direct application to\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fMedicare.    As the Commonwealth argues, \"[t]he choice between two\n\nfederal statutes requires an analysis of both, to see if they are\n\nindeed incompatible or if they can be harmonized.\"            Boston & Maine\n\nCorp. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 587 F.3d 89, 98 n.1 (1st Cir.\n\n2009) (quoting Coker v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 165 F.3d 579,\n\n583-84 (7th Cir. 1999)).     Here, the Medicare and Medicaid statutes\n\ncan be harmonized with one another in a manner that preserves the\n\npurpose of the statutory scheme recognized in Ahlborn: state\n\nMedicaid agencies may seek and recover reimbursement by asking\n\nproviders to return state Medicaid funds.\n\n            The Commonwealth advances a functional argument that,\n\nwhatever    the   Medicare   statute   says,    the    Commonwealth      cannot\n\nreasonably expect to receive reimbursement from providers and that\n\ntherefore the statute should be construed to allow it to recover\n\nreimbursement     directly   from   Medicare.         The   first   of   these\n\npropositions is doubtful, and the second does not follow from it.\n\nThe Commonwealth has never employed the demand bill procedure that\n\nthe Secretary describes as an available alternative, and so it\n\ncannot say that the procedure          will not work.         Nor does the\n\nCommonwealth cite any statutory language that prohibits state\n\nMedicaid agencies from recovering reimbursement from Medicare by\n\nasking providers to employ this demand bill procedure.11\n\n\n     11\n           The Commonwealth makes two tangential arguments.\n      First, it argues that 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) should not\nbe   read as merely ensuring that the rights of Medicaid\n\n                                    -20-\n\fC.           Chevron Step Two and Auer\n\n             Our alternative holding is under the second step of\n\nChevron, under which we look to the agency's regulations.          Even if\n\nthe statutory scheme did not speak unambiguously as to whether the\n\nCommonwealth may obtain reimbursement directly from Medicare in\n\ncases of retroactive dual eligibility, CMS's interpretation of its\n\nregulations resolves this question and is entitled to deference.\n\nThe Commonwealth does not dispute the validity of the regulation\n\nupon which CMS relies, 42 C.F.R. § 424.33.        Nor does it challenge\n\nCMS's regulation concerning the obligations of state Medicaid\n\nagencies seeking reimbursement as required by the Medicaid statute,\n\n42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d).        The Commonwealth only challenges the\n\nagency's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33.              This challenge\n\nfails under Auer.      See McCoy, 131 S. Ct. at 880.\n\n             On their face, the agency's regulations do not expressly\n\nspeak   to   whether   the   Commonwealth   may   recover    reimbursement\n\n\n\nbeneficiaries are subrogated to the states, as is already required\nin 42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)(1)(A). We do not read the statute in this\nway. Whereas 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) imposes an affirmative\nobligation on state Medicaid agencies to seek reimbursement, 42\nU.S.C. § 1396k(a)(1)(A) confers rights upon state Medicaid agencies\nto pursue certain claims as a subrogee.\n     Second, the Commonwealth argues that the Medicare statute only\nrequires that providers \"make adequate provision for return\" of\n\"incorrectly collected\" funds under 42 U.S.C. 1395cc(a)(1)(C) and\nthat state Medicaid funds in cases of retroactive dual eligibility\nwere not incorrectly collected when received. This language may\nnot expressly require providers to return funds in these cases, but\nit does not preclude them from returning such funds at the request\nof a state Medicaid agency.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fdirectly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.\n\nUnder the Medicare statute, the Secretary has provided that \"[a]ll\n\nclaims      for    services    of   providers\"    must   be   \"[f]iled   by   the\n\nprovider.\"        42 C.F.R. § 424.33(a).       Under the Medicaid statue, the\n\nSecretary has only provided that an agency that seeks reimbursement\n\n\"must seek recovery of reimbursement\" subject to certain time\n\nconstraints.        42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d).         These provisions do not\n\naddress whether reimbursement claims are \"claims for services of\n\nproviders.\"        Nor does the broader regulatory structure cast light\n\non   this    question.        These   regulations   do   resolve   whether    the\n\nCommonwealth may file claims for services of providers directly\n\nwith Medicare; it may not.\n\n              The Secretary has interpreted 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 such\n\nthat state Medicaid agencies may not recover reimbursement directly\n\nfrom Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.                  In its\n\nApril 2003 guidance letter to state Medicaid directors, CMS wrote\n\nthat \"Medicaid is usually the payer of last resort\" and that when\n\na \"Medicaid agency learns of the existence of a liable third party\n\nafter a claim is paid, or benefits become available from a third\n\nparty after the claim is paid, [the state Medicaid agency] must\n\nseek recovery from that third party.\"             In cases \"[w]hen that third\n\nparty is Medicare,\" CMS wrote, \"neither the Medicare nor Medicaid\n\nstatute, nor HHS's regulations or policies prohibit any state from\n\nrecouping its Medicaid payment from providers\" in two situations.\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\f            According to the guidance letter, a state may recoup its\n\nMedicaid payment from providers when (1) \"Medicare has determined\n\nthat it is liable for the service at issue\" or (2) \"a beneficiary,\n\nbeneficiary       representative,     or    state     (as     the   beneficiary's\n\nsubrogee)   timely       requests   the    provider   to    file    a   claim    with\n\nMedicare    and    the   provider   fails\"     to   do   so    in   a   timely    and\n\nappropriate manner.        In the letter, CMS also noted that, acting as\n\na beneficiary's subrogee, \"a state may request the provider to\n\nsubmit a claim for Medicare payment and the provider must honor\n\nthat request\" by submitting a \"demand bill.\"                The letter concluded\n\nthat \"if a provider fails to submit timely a demand bill, the\n\nprovider violates its provider agreement with Medicare if it\n\ncharges the beneficiary (or the beneficiary's subrogee), or retains\n\nany charge already collected from the beneficiary or subrogee, for\n\nsuch services.\"\n\n            Although the April 2003 letter did not expressly state\n\nthat the Commonwealth cannot receive reimbursement directly from\n\nMedicare, later letters from CMS made this point clear.                     In its\n\nDecember 2003 letter, CMS stated that \"there is no statutory\n\nauthority under Medicare to allow a state to seek recovery and be\n\npaid directly from Medicare.\" It stated that \"Medicare allows only\n\nproviders to bill and be paid by Medicare\" and that the state \"may\n\ntimely request [a] provider to submit a bill timely to Medicare.\"\n\nIn a June 2005 letter to the Commonwealth, CMS reiterated that\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f\"there is no statutory authority for reimbursing Medicaid directly\n\nfor services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.\"               There is no\n\ndispute that these statements apply directly to the situation at\n\nhand and preceded the present litigation.\n\n             The Commonwealth makes three arguments that the agency's\n\ninterpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 is plainly erroneous or\n\ninconsistent with the regulation.        First, it argues that 42 C.F.R.\n\n§   424.33   merely   parrots   the   statutory     language   of   42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395f(a).     Second, it argues that CMS's reliance on 42 C.F.R.\n\n§ 424.33 and 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) is a post hoc litigation position\n\nbecause CMS did not cite those provisions in its recent letters to\n\nthe Commonwealth. Third, it argues that CMS's interpretation of 42\n\nC.F.R.   §   424.33   is   inconsistent      with   the   statutory      scheme,\n\nincluding CMS's other regulations.           These arguments are without\n\nmerit.\n\n             As to the first argument, it is true that the Supreme\n\nCourt has held that an agency \"does not acquire special authority\n\nto interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and\n\nexperience to formulate a regulation, it has elected to merely\n\nparaphrase the statutory language.\"          Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S.\n\n243, 257 (2006).        That is not the case here, however.                 The\n\nregulation fills an express gap in 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) as to who\n\nmay file claims, as opposed to who may receive payments.              42 C.F.R.\n\n§ 424.33.      It also uses more general terms than the statute,\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\freferring    to   \"claims    for    services\"    rather   than    \"payment   for\n\nservices.\"   See id.     Even if the statutory language did not clearly\n\ninclude reimbursement as a type of payment, the regulation leaves\n\nopen the possibility that petitions for reimbursement as well as\n\npetitions for payment are both types of \"claims.\"                See id.\n\n            As to the Commonwealth's second argument, it is true that\n\nan agency's interpretation of its regulation may not be entitled to\n\ndeference if it is merely a post hoc rationalization for past\n\nagency action rather than the agency's fair and considered judgment\n\non the issue.     See McCoy, 131 S. Ct. at 881.           But that is not the\n\ncase here, either.       The agency's construction of the statute long\n\npredates this litigation.          In Atlanticare, the Commonwealth argued\n\nthat it could not recover reimbursement from Medicare for precisely\n\nthe reason CMS now advances: it is not a provider.                In that case,\n\nthe Commonwealth relied upon the federal agency's 1991 letter\n\nstating   that    only   providers     may    seek   payments    directly    from\n\nMedicare. The agency reiterated this position in 2003 with respect\n\nto claims for reimbursement.          The Commonwealth filed its four test\n\nclaims in this case precisely to challenge that construction.\n\n            The fact that CMS did not explicitly reference 42 C.F.R.\n\n§ 424.33 or 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) in its recent letters to the\n\nCommonwealth does not transform the agency's reliance on these\n\nprovisions into a post hoc rationalization or demonstrate a lack of\n\nconsidered judgment.        The basis for the federal agency's position\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fhas been clear since before this litigation began.       In the federal\n\nagency's 1991 letter to the Commonwealth, it invoked 42 C.F.R.\n\n§§ 424.30-424.45 to explain why, with exceptions not relevant here,\n\nproviders were required to file the \"initial claim\" with Medicare.\n\nIn its motion for reconsideration of the Atlanticare decision, the\n\nCommonwealth conveyed to the Superior Court that \"Medicare will\n\nonly pay directly to providers under 42 C.F.R. § 424.33\" and\n\nanother provision.    Atlanticare, No. 1451-H, slip op. at 3.\n\n          As to the third argument, the Commonwealth asserts that\n\nCMS's construction of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 contravenes congressional\n\nintent that Medicaid serve as payer of last resort.       Specifically,\n\nthe Commonwealth argues that the federal agency's interpretation\n\nnecessarily precludes it from receiving reimbursement when Medicare\n\nis retroactively liable for services previously paid by its state\n\nMedicaid agency. The Commonwealth makes two arguments for why this\n\nis the case.     First, it argues that the Atlanticare decision\n\nforbids the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement through\n\nproviders rather than directly from Medicare, though that was not\n\nthe issue before the Supreme Judicial Court.          Second, it argues\n\nthat the Secretary has not shown that CMS may compel providers to\n\ncomply with a state Medicaid agency's request that they file a\n\ndemand bill with Medicare to recover funds for reimbursement.\n\n          It   does   not   follow   from   these   arguments   that   the\n\nSecretary's interpretation precludes state Medicaid agencies from\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\freasonably       expecting       to    receive       reimbursement   in   cases        of\n\nretroactive dual eligibility.              With respect to the Commonwealth's\n\nfirst argument, it is not relevant to our inquiry that Atlanticare\n\ncan    be   read    to   limit    some    of    the    options   available      to    the\n\nCommonwealth.12          We must look to whether the federal agency's\n\ninterpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 is plainly inconsistent with\n\nthat    regulation,       not    whether       the    agency's   interpretation        is\n\ninconsistent with a judicial construction of the statute.                            With\n\nrespect     to     its   second       argument,      the   Commonwealth   has    never\n\nrequested that a provider file a demand bill in the manner the\n\nSecretary describes.            It has no basis to argue that such requests\n\nwill go unheeded or that there exists no lawful avenue by which\n\ncompliance with such requests could be enforced.13\n\n\n       12\n          As the Supreme Judicial Court noted, it rested its\nholding on the particular circumstances at issue in that case and\non the absence of evidence or argument as to whether state Medicaid\nagencies may obtain reimbursement directly from Medicare. It also\nnoted that it did not know the Secretary's position on that matter.\nAtlanticare, 785 N.E.2d at 354-55. This case has given rise to\nadditional evidence and argument, including by the Secretary.\n       13\n          We need not address the Commonwealth's belated effort to\nshift this litigation to a dispute about another regulation, 42\nC.F.R. § 489.40(b). It is CMS's position that a payment made by a\nstate Medicaid agency on behalf of an individual later deemed\nretroactively eligible for Medicare constitutes an \"incorrect\ncollection\" under 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b). From this, the agency\nargues that providers that do not make \"adequate provision for\nreturn\" of these \"incorrectly collected\" funds will be ineligible\nfor future payments under 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(C).\n     In its supplemental brief, the Commonwealth belatedly argues\nthis interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b) is plainly erroneous\nand inconsistent with the regulation.      We do not decide the\nquestion.   Regardless, the Commonwealth has not shown that it\n\n                                           -27-\n\f            We consider CMS bound by its representation as to the\n\nmechanisms available for the Commonwealth to seek and recover\n\nreimbursement.14       See Massachusetts, 522 F.3d at 129 n.8.                   The\n\nCommonwealth     has    raised    valid     practical      concerns    about     the\n\nconsequences of CMS's position for the states.                  From its point of\n\nview, it is less expeditious for state Medicaid agencies to ask\n\nproviders   to   file    demand     bills   in    cases    of   retroactive    dual\n\neligibility    than    it   would    be   for    state    Medicaid    agencies    to\n\npetition CMS directly.\n\n            The federal agency, however, has policies supporting its\n\ninterpretation within the context of this highly complex statutory\n\nscheme. For example, the defendants noted at oral argument that an\n\nentity that makes a false representation to CMS concerning a\n\nmedical service can be held liable under federal causes of action\n\nagainst fraud. This is a considerable incentive toward honesty and\n\nefficiency. The Commonwealth argues that there is an ample federal\n\nanti-fraud enforcement mechanism already but does not directly\n\n\n\ncannot require providers that receive state Medicaid funds to\nfollow the demand bill procedure.     Nor has it shown that other\nstates have been unable to secure reimbursement by asking providers\nto submit demand bills to Medicare. CMS represents that this is\nthe standard procedure across the country.\n     14\n          The Commonwealth argues that CMS's positions in this case\ncannot bind providers that are not parties to this litigation. See\nBeaudette v. Louisville Ladder, Inc., 462 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.\n2006). We do not assert that it does. However, CMS's positions do\nbind CMS with respect to how it will address future behavior by\nproviders relevant to its positions in this suit.\n\n                                      -28-\n\faddress this policy concern.           If state Medicaid agencies could\n\nsimply   relay   past   claims   to   Medicare,     it   is   not    clear    that\n\nproviders could be held liable for fraud in this manner.\n\n            We are not the forum to evaluate these competing policy\n\nconcerns.    The decision on policy issues belongs to the Congress,\n\nand where Congress has delegated, to the Secretary.            Our duty is to\n\ninterpret the law, and policy arguments should be made to the\n\nExecutive and to the Congress.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            We emphasize that we are only answering a very specific\n\nquestion    within   the   context    of   the   arguments    that    have    been\n\npresented to us.     This is a complex statutory area, and there have\n\nbeen strong arguments presented on both sides.            We find that CMS's\n\nposition that state Medicaid agencies may not recover reimbursement\n\ndirectly from Medicare is required by the statutory language and,\n\nin any event, is consistent with the agency's regulations.                   It is\n\nclear that other states have recovered reimbursement through other\n\nmeans, including the demand bill mechanism the agency claims\n\nproviders must follow in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\f",

The Commonwealth claims that the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and associated entities violated the federal Medicaid statute when they refused to allow the Commonwealth to recover reimbursement directly from CMS in four cases of \"retroactive dual eligibility.\"</p>\n<p>In each of these four cases, an individual who received Massachusetts <i>Medicaid</i> funds to pay for medical services was later deemed retroactively eligible for federal <i>Medicare</i> funds for the period in which the individual received those services. The state is trying to secure reimbursement for its past Medicaid payments by directly petitioning the federal government for reimbursement rather than going back to the providers of services, whom the Medicare program clearly recognizes as appropriate claimants. This dispute is not over whether the Commonwealth should ultimately be reimbursed by Medicare, but whether it has chosen a permissible mechanism to recover reimbursement. <i>Cf. </i><i>Massachusetts v. United States,</i> 522 F.3d 115, 129 n. 8 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth, for understandable reasons, argues that its obligations under the federal Medicaid statute, as stated in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) and 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d), require that it seek and recover reimbursement directly from CMS in these cases of retroactive dual eligibility, and that this is the Commonwealth's exclusive avenue. Secretary Sebelius and the defendant administrators of CMS and associated entities deny this and reply that the Commonwealth must instead seek reimbursement from providers, who then in turn must obtain payment from Medicare.</p>\n<p>The federal defendants argue this is so because 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) and 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 only allow \"providers\" to receive payments from Medicare, and the Commonwealth is, as it admits, not a provider. Defendants argue that to meet its obligations to recover reimbursement under the Medicaid statute, the Commonwealth must request reimbursement from individual providers, who then must obtain payment from the federal Medicare agency. The federal defendants say that this is the procedure used by other states to recover reimbursement, that they have been consistent in their interpretation, and that Massachusetts is simply wrong when it asserts this interpretation leaves it with no way to recover reimbursement in accordance with the Medicaid statute.</p>\n<p>In this matter of statutory interpretation, the district court held that the Medicare statute unambiguously forbids the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from CMS. In the alternative, it held that even if the Medicare statute were ambiguous, CMS's interpretation must be sustained under <i>Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and <i>Auer v. Robbins,</i> 519 U.S. 452, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997).</p>\n<p>We requested at oral argument, and subsequently received, additional briefing on what mechanisms would be available for the Commonwealth to obtain reimbursement if its position were not accepted. We affirm the district court's judgment, albeit on different reasoning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The federal Medicare and Medicaid statutes, which compose Title XVIII and Title XIX of the Social Security Act, interact. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> Medicare is a health insurance program for those who are over age 65 or have certain disabilities.<sup>[1]</sup> 42 U.S.C. § 1395 <i>et seq.</i> By contrast, Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income individuals; it is funded by both the federal government and state governments.<sup>[2]</sup> 42 U.S.C. § 1396 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>Medicaid is generally supposed to be a \"payer of last resort.\" <i>Ark. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. Ahlborn,</i> 547 U.S. 268, 291, 126 S.Ct. 1752, 164 L.Ed.2d 459 (2006) (quoting S.Rep. No. 99-146, at 313, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 42, 280 (1985)). This means that \"when an individual is entitled to Medicare and eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, like any other third party, is the primary payor,\" and Medicaid may only pay a claim \"to the extent that payment allowed under the applicable payment schedule ... exceeds the amount of Medicare's payment.\" <i>Medicaid Program: State Plan Requirements and Other Provisions Relating to State Third Party Liability Programs,</i> 55 Fed.Reg. 1423, 1429 (1990). State Medicaid agencies must \"take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties... to pay for care and services\" that would otherwise be paid by Medicaid. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(A). It is not disputed that Medicare is a third party under this provision.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the federal Medicaid statute and its accompanying regulations, state Medicaid agencies must follow two sets of requirements when addressing third-party liability.<sup>[4]</sup> First, if probable third-party liability is established at the time a claim is filed with the state agency, the agency must reject the claim and return it to the service provider. 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(b)(1); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(A). Second, if a state Medicaid agency only \"learns of the existence of a liable third party\" or \"benefits become available from a third party\" after Medicaid has paid the claim, the Medicaid agency must \"seek recovery of reimbursement.\" 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d)(2); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B). The Commonwealth relies on the second statute and regulation, arguing they require that it seek and obtain reimbursement directly from CMS when the liable third party is Medicare.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> The defendants argue that several provisions of the federal Medicare statute, particularly 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a), forbid the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from CMS. With some exceptions not relevant here, \"payment for services ... may be made only to providers of services\" if filed \"in such manner, and by such person or persons as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a)(1). By regulation, in 42 C.F.R. § 424.33, the Secretary has prescribed that \"claims for services of providers\" must be \"[f]iled by the provider.\" The Commonwealth argues, and the defendants agree, that it is not a provider. The defendants argue that while the Commonwealth may not recover reimbursement directly from CMS, it may fulfill its obligation under the Medicaid statute by asking providers to obtain payment from Medicare.</p>\n<p>The defendants argue that providers must comply with such requests by filing a \"demand bill\" with Medicare. The Medicare statute requires that providers agree to \"make adequate provision for return\" of money \"incorrectly collected\" from individuals. 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(C). CMS regulations state that a \"payment properly made to a provider by an individual not considered entitled to Medicare benefits will be deemed to be an `incorrect collection' when the individual is found to be retroactively entitled to benefits.\" 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b). CMS argues that this regulation, though it refers to payments made by individuals rather than state Medicaid agencies, requires that providers return state Medicaid funds in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. It argues that providers that do not comply with this requirement face sanctions, including termination of participation in Medicare. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 489.53(a)(1).</p>\n<p>One reason the Commonwealth takes the position that it may recover reimbursement directly from Medicare is its interpretation of a decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, <i>Atlanticare Medical Center v. Commissioner of the Division of Medical Assistance,</i> 439 Mass. 1, 785 N.E.2d 346 (2003). In that case, a group of private healthcare providers challenged a Massachusetts regulation that required healthcare providers to return state Medicaid payments when a liable third-party insurer was identified after payment. The providers argued that Massachusetts placed an undue burden on providers by making them responsible for recovering payment from third parties. <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Judicial Court struck down the state regulation. In the course of its ruling it reasoned that the state regulation was inconsistent with the federal Medicaid statute, namely 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B), and that state Medicaid agencies must seek reimbursement directly from liable third parties. <i>Id.</i> at 350.</p>\n<p>Some of the reimbursement claims at issue in <i>Atlanticare</i> belonged to individuals who were retroactively deemed eligible for Medicare. We stress that neither the parties nor the issues before this court are the parties or issues that were before the Supreme Judicial Court. In <i>Atlanticare,</i> the issue was the validity of a state regulation; further, the regulation governed reimbursement from all types of third parties, not merely instances involving Medicare. As CMS has noted, the state regulation did not make allowances for the fact that Medicare and Medicaid are not coextensive in coverage; it required providers to return Medicaid funds before Medicare made a determination that it was liable for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> the particular services for which those funds had been paid. Federal Medicare and Medicaid officials were not parties to the action and the Supreme Judicial Court never heard their views on the issue before us, as it noted in its decision. <i>Id.</i> at 355. Apparently, the Commonwealth did not ask CMS to submit a brief to the court expressing its views. <i>Cf. </i><i>Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 871, 877, 178 L.Ed.2d 716 (2011).</p>\n<p>The parties in <i>Atlanticare</i> initially agreed that the Commonwealth could not recover costs directly from Medicare. The Commonwealth argued that under 42 C.F.R. § 424.33, Medicare may only pay directly to providers. At oral argument, however, both parties conceded that it might be possible for the Commonwealth to recover directly from Medicare. <i>Atlanticare,</i> 785 N.E.2d at 353-54 &amp; n. 14. The court stated that the Commonwealth had cited no authority demonstrating that it could not obtain reimbursement directly from Medicare and that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the Commonwealth had ever attempted to obtain reimbursement in this fashion. <i>Id.</i> at 354-55. The decision did not address either 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) or 42 C.F.R. § 424.33, or how CMS administers these provisions.</p>\n<p>Both before and after the <i>Atlanticare</i> decision, the federal Medicare and Medicaid agency has taken the position that only providers may petition Medicare for payment absent an express allowance to the contrary. In a 1991 letter to the Commonwealth, CMS wrote that \"a State Medicaid agency ... may not submit initial claims for Part A Medicare services, as these claims must be filed by the provider.\"<sup>[6]</sup> The letter distinguished \"initial claims\" from appeals arising from denials of claims. It stated that \"a dually eligible beneficiary may certainly appoint the State Medicaid agency to act as his or her representative to pursue appeal of an individual denied Medicare claim\" but \"without such appointment, the State Medicaid agency may not act on its own behalf,\" with an exception not relevant here.</p>\n<p>In April 2003, shortly after the decision in <i>Atlanticare,</i> CMS issued a State Medicaid Director Letter stating that when an individual receives payment for health services from Medicaid and is later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare, the state Medicaid agency should ask the provider of services to file a claim with Medicare. The letter was sent to all state Medicaid directors, not just the Massachusetts Medicaid director. In May 2003, the Commonwealth sought clarification of this letter in light of <i>Atlanticare.</i> In September 2003, it also sought to establish itself as a \"qualified billing entity\" that could submit claims to Medicare on behalf of Medicaid recipients and the facilities that provide services to those recipients.</p>\n<p>CMS denied the Commonwealth's request that it be established as a qualified billing entity and reiterated that only providers may file claims with Medicare. In an October 2003 letter denying the Commonwealth's request, CMS wrote that its \"interpretation of the regulations prohibits Medicare Intermediaries from paying benefits due to a provider to other than the provider of services.\" In a December 2003 letter clarifying the April 2003 guidance letter, CMS wrote that \"there is no statutory authority under Medicare to allow a state to seek recovery and be paid directly from Medicare\" because \"Medicare allows only providers to bill and be paid by Medicare.\" It repeated that when Medicare's third-party liability is not known until after a state Medicaid agency has paid a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> claim, the state should ask the provider to bill Medicare.</p>\n<p>In light of CMS's statements, the Commonwealth sought a modification of the declaratory judgment entered in <i>Atlanticare</i> on the ground that new information demonstrated it could not recover reimbursement directly from Medicare. In support of this motion, the Commonwealth submitted copies of the April 2003 guidance letter and the ensuing correspondence between it and CMS. A Massachusetts Superior Court denied this motion. <i>Atlanticare Med. Ctr. v. Reynolds,</i> No. 1451-H, slip op. at 2 (Mass.Super.Ct. July 28, 2004). The Superior Court stated that it found the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in <i>Atlanticare</i> more persuasive than the April 2003 guidance letter, and that the letter had merely restated arguments the Commonwealth advanced in <i>Atlanticare. Id.</i> at 6. Again, no federal Medicare or Medicaid official was involved in the suit or asked to submit the agency's views. The Commonwealth did not, apparently, pursue the matter to the Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p>In later communications with the Commonwealth, CMS continued to reiterate its position that a state Medicaid agency cannot recover reimbursement directly from Medicare. The Commonwealth, correctly or not, believed itself between a rock and a hard place. In December 2006, the Commonwealth submitted four test claims to CMS, seeking reimbursement from Medicare for Medicaid funds paid on behalf of individuals later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare. CMS rejected these claims on the ground that the Commonwealth is not a provider, consistent with the agency's position stated earlier that non-providers may not receive payments from Medicare. The Commonwealth then filed this lawsuit.<sup>[7]</sup> It is undisputed that the Commonwealth has exhausted its administrative remedies.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth seeks (1) an injunction ordering CMS to accept, process, approve, and pay the four reimbursement claims it submitted in 2006, as well as (2) a declaration that the defendants must accept and process reimbursement claims submitted by the Commonwealth in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. The district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and dismissed the Commonwealth's cross-motion for summary judgment as moot. It held that 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) unambiguously prohibits the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from CMS. The district court held in the alternative that even assuming the statute was ambiguous, 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 must receive deference because it was promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of authority and is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss, taking as true all well-pleaded facts and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <i>Boroian v. Mueller,</i> 616 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir.2010). This case does not involve any factual disputes, only a pure question of law: whether the federal Medicaid statute requires that CMS allow the Commonwealth to recover reimbursement directly from CMS in cases of retroactive dual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> eligibility. This does not involve review of whether there is a valid claim for reimbursement in these four test cases; it involves review of the appropriate mechanism to obtain such reimbursement. We agree with the defendants that as a matter of federal law, the Commonwealth may not recover reimbursement directly from CMS in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. This does not mean, however, that the state has no mechanism to receive reimbursement. It does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Agency Deference Under Chevron</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This question of statutory interpretation must be treated within the familiar framework set forth in <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778. The Secretary of Health and Human Services administers the federal Medicare and Medicaid statutes, as well as a number of other statutory provisions within the Social Security Act. The Secretary has delegated administrative responsibilities for Medicare and Medicaid to CMS. <i>See</i> 42 C.F.R. § 400.200. In assessing the requirements of this statutory scheme, we must be mindful of any deference to which CMS may be entitled.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Chevron,</i> when a court reviews an agency's construction of the statute it administers, the court must first ask whether \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If the intent of Congress is unambiguous, the court must follow that intent. <i>Id.</i> at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If the intent of Congress is ambiguous, the agency's interpretation is entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference \"when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\" <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 226-27, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). Under <i>Chevron,</i> such agency interpretations must be upheld if they are \"based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p>Courts may not disturb regulations promulgated pursuant to express statutory authority unless they are \"arbitrary, capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute\" and they may not disturb regulations promulgated pursuant to implicit statutory authority unless the agency's interpretation is unreasonable. <i>Id.</i> at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778. When an agency interprets its own ambiguous regulations, its interpretation is controlling unless it is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" <i>McCoy,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 880 (quoting <i>Auer,</i> 519 U.S. at 461, 117 S.Ct. 905). Deference is not given, however, to a \"<i>post hoc</i> rationalizatio[n] advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack\" or when there is reason to \"suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\" <i>Id.</i> at 881 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Auer,</i> 519 U.S. at 462, 117 S.Ct. 905) (internal quotation marks omitted).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> B. <i>Chevron Step One</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our first holding begins and ends with step one of the <i>Chevron</i> analysis: the statutory scheme forecloses the interpretation advanced by the Commonwealth. To determine \"whether a statute exhibits <i>Chevron</i>-type ambiguity ... courts look at both the most natural reading of the language and the consistency of the `interpretive clues' Congress provided.\" <i>Succar v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 8, 22 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline,</i> 540 U.S. 581, 586, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004)). This analysis looks to the text, structure, and, when permissible, legislative history of the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 22, 30. We look first to text and structure; we note that neither party introduces legislative history and we are unaware of any on point.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Both parties contend that the plain language of the statutory scheme unambiguously supports their position. The Commonwealth points to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B), which states that when third party liability \"is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available,\" with an exception not relevant here, the state Medicaid agency must \"seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability.\" The defendants point to 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a), which states that, with exceptions again not relevant here, \"payment for services furnished an individual may be made only to providers of services\" as defined in the Medicare statute.</p>\n<p>Neither of these provisions, read in isolation, speak to whether the Commonwealth, which is not a provider, may recover reimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. Although 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) plainly requires that state Medicaid agencies seek reimbursement in such cases, it does not create a right to receive reimbursement directly from CMS. This provision does not identify from whom the state agency should seek this reimbursement. The federal Medicare agency could be a candidate, but the providers that received the initial payment are more plausible. The fact that 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) refers to \"payment for services furnished an individual,\" moreover, permits the Commonwealth to argue that its claim is instead for reimbursement for past payments made for such services.</p>\n<p>Although no statutory provision explicitly resolves the question presented here, the statutory scheme does not allow the interpretation advanced by the Commonwealth. The Medicare statute equates reimbursement and payment and does not allow non-providers to receive payments from Medicare. The Commonwealth is not included among any of the express allowances in the Medicare statute for non-providers to receive payments. The Medicare statute thus forecloses the Commonwealth from receiving reimbursement directly from Medicare.<sup>[10]</sup> This result is consistent with both the Medicaid statute's requirement that state Medicaid agencies seek recovery of reimbursement and Congress's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> intent that Medicaid generally be the payer of last resort.</p>\n<p>We look first to the meaning of \"reimbursement\" in the statutory scheme. Neither the Medicare statute nor the Medicaid statute supports a distinction between payment and reimbursement relevant to the test claims in this case. As to the Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) discusses claims for reimbursement within its provisions governing payment for services. The statute does not define reimbursement, nor does it express parameters for reimbursement claims as if they were different from the parameters for payment claims. As to the Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) neither defines reimbursement nor distinguishes between it and other forms of payment for our purposes. In this statutory context, it is most natural to read reimbursement as a particular type of payment. <i>See </i><i>Succar,</i> 394 F.3d at 22.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth challenges this reading on two grounds. First, it argues that the Medicare statute allows non-providers to recover reimbursement despite its limitations on who may recover payments for services. Second, it argues that this interpretation of the statutory scheme contravenes congressional intent that Medicaid generally be the payer of last resort.</p>\n<p>As to the first argument, the Commonwealth has not identified any statutory language that would allow state Medicaid agencies to recover reimbursement from CMS under these circumstances. The Commonwealth has identified only one instance in which the statute allows payment for reimbursement to non-providers: an express exception to 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) involving emergency services. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395f(d)(2) &amp; 1395n(b)(2). We are aware of only one other instance in which the statute allows a non-provider to receive reimbursement: when an individual has made payments for certain hospital services furnished outside the United States. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(f)(4). These provisions do not allow all non-providers to receive reimbursement, and they do not make any specific allowance for the Commonwealth's reimbursement claims. Rather, they are express exceptions to the general rule we have noted.</p>\n<p>As to the second argument, our reading of the statute is not in tension with Congress's intent that Medicaid generally be a payer of last resort. The statute does not preclude state Medicaid agencies from receiving reimbursement in cases of retroactive dual eligibility through a mechanism other than direct application to Medicare. As the Commonwealth argues, \"[t]he choice between two federal statutes requires an analysis of both, to see if they are indeed incompatible or if they can be harmonized.\" <i>Boston &amp; Maine Corp. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> 587 F.3d 89, 98 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>Coker v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 165 F.3d 579, 583-84 (7th Cir.1999)). Here, the Medicare and Medicaid statutes can be harmonized with one another in a manner that preserves the purpose of the statutory scheme recognized in <i>Ahlborn:</i> state Medicaid agencies may seek and recover reimbursement by asking providers to return state Medicaid funds.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth advances a functional argument that, whatever the Medicare statute says, the Commonwealth cannot reasonably expect to receive reimbursement from providers and that therefore the statute should be construed to allow it to recover reimbursement directly from Medicare. The first of these propositions is doubtful, and the second does not follow from it. The Commonwealth has never employed the demand bill procedure that the Secretary describes as an available alternative, and so it cannot say that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> procedure will not work. Nor does the Commonwealth cite any statutory language that prohibits state Medicaid agencies from recovering reimbursement from Medicare by asking providers to employ this demand bill procedure.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Chevron Step Two and Auer</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our alternative holding is under the second step of <i>Chevron,</i> under which we look to the agency's regulations. Even if the statutory scheme did not speak unambiguously as to whether the Commonwealth may obtain reimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility, CMS's interpretation of its regulations resolves this question and is entitled to deference. The Commonwealth does not dispute the validity of the regulation upon which CMS relies, 42 C.F.R. § 424.33. Nor does it challenge CMS's regulation concerning the obligations of state Medicaid agencies seeking reimbursement as required by the Medicaid statute, 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d). The Commonwealth only challenges the agency's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33. This challenge fails under <i>Auer. See </i><i>McCoy,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 880.</p>\n<p>On their face, the agency's regulations do not expressly speak to whether the Commonwealth may recover reimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. Under the Medicare statute, the Secretary has provided that \"[a]ll claims for services of providers\" must be \"[f]iled by the provider.\" 42 C.F.R. § 424.33(a). Under the Medicaid statute, the Secretary has only provided that an agency that seeks reimbursement \"must seek recovery of reimbursement\" subject to certain time constraints. 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d). These provisions do not address whether reimbursement claims are \"claims for services of providers.\" Nor does the broader regulatory structure cast light on this question. These regulations do resolve whether the Commonwealth may file claims for services of providers directly with Medicare; it may not.</p>\n<p>The Secretary has interpreted 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 such that state Medicaid agencies may not recover reimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. In its April 2003 guidance letter to state Medicaid directors, CMS wrote that \"Medicaid is usually the payer of last resort\" and that when a \"Medicaid agency learns of the existence of a liable third party after a claim is paid, or benefits become available from a third party after the claim is paid, [the state Medicaid agency] must seek recovery from that third party.\" In cases \"[w]hen that third party is Medicare,\" CMS wrote, \"neither the Medicare nor Medicaid statute, nor HHS's regulations or policies prohibit any state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> from recouping its Medicaid payment from providers\" in two situations.</p>\n<p>According to the guidance letter, a state may recoup its Medicaid payment from providers when (1) \"Medicare has determined that it is liable for the service at issue\" or (2) \"a beneficiary, beneficiary representative, or state (as the beneficiary's subrogee) timely requests the provider to file a claim with Medicare and the provider fails\" to do so in a timely and appropriate manner. In the letter, CMS also noted that, acting as a beneficiary's subrogee, \"a state may request the provider to submit a claim for Medicare payment and the provider must honor that request\" by submitting a \"demand bill.\" The letter concluded that \"if a provider fails to submit timely a demand bill, the provider violates its provider agreement with Medicare if it charges the beneficiary (or the beneficiary's subrogee), or retains any charge already collected from the beneficiary or subrogee, for such services.\"</p>\n<p>Although the April 2003 letter did not expressly state that the Commonwealth cannot receive reimbursement directly from Medicare, later letters from CMS made this point clear. In its December 2003 letter, CMS stated that \"there is no statutory authority under Medicare to allow a state to seek recovery and be paid directly from Medicare.\" It stated that \"Medicare allows only providers to bill and be paid by Medicare\" and that the state \"may timely request [a] provider to submit a bill timely to Medicare.\" In a June 2005 letter to the Commonwealth, CMS reiterated that \"there is no statutory authority for reimbursing Medicaid directly for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.\" There is no dispute that these statements apply directly to the situation at hand and preceded the present litigation.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth makes three arguments that the agency's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. First, it argues that 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 merely parrots the statutory language of 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a). Second, it argues that CMS's reliance on 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 and 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) is a post hoc litigation position because CMS did not cite those provisions in its recent letters to the Commonwealth. Third, it argues that CMS's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 is inconsistent with the statutory scheme, including CMS's other regulations. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p>As to the first argument, it is true that the Supreme Court has held that an agency \"does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation, it has elected to merely paraphrase the statutory language.\" <i>Gonzales v. Oregon,</i> 546 U.S. 243, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006). That is not the case here, however. The regulation fills an express gap in 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) as to who may file claims, as opposed to who may receive payments. 42 C.F.R. § 424.33. It also uses more general terms than the statute, referring to \"claims for services\" rather than \"payment for services.\" <i>See id.</i> Even if the statutory language did not clearly include reimbursement as a type of payment, the regulation leaves open the possibility that petitions for reimbursement as well as petitions for payment are both types of \"claims.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>As to the Commonwealth's second argument, it is true that an agency's interpretation of its regulation may not be entitled to deference if it is merely a post hoc rationalization for past agency action rather than the agency's fair and considered judgment on the issue. <i>See </i><i>McCoy,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 881. But that is not the case here, either. The agency's construction of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> statute long predates this litigation. In <i>Atlanticare,</i> the Commonwealth argued that it could not recover reimbursement from Medicare for precisely the reason CMS now advances: it is not a provider. In that case, the Commonwealth relied upon the federal agency's 1991 letter stating that only providers may seek payments directly from Medicare. The agency reiterated this position in 2003 with respect to claims for reimbursement. The Commonwealth filed its four test claims in this case precisely to challenge that construction.</p>\n<p>The fact that CMS did not explicitly reference 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 or 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) in its recent letters to the Commonwealth does not transform the agency's reliance on these provisions into a post hoc rationalization or demonstrate a lack of considered judgment. The basis for the federal agency's position has been clear since before this litigation began. In the federal agency's 1991 letter to the Commonwealth, it invoked 42 C.F.R. §§ 424.30-424.45 to explain why, with exceptions not relevant here, providers were required to file the \"initial claim\" with Medicare. In its motion for reconsideration of the <i>Atlanticare</i> decision, the Commonwealth conveyed to the Superior Court that \"Medicare will only pay directly to providers under 42 C.F.R. § 424.33\" and another provision. <i>Atlanticare,</i> No. 1451-H, slip op. at 3.</p>\n<p>As to the third argument, the Commonwealth asserts that CMS's construction of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 contravenes congressional intent that Medicaid serve as payer of last resort. Specifically, the Commonwealth argues that the federal agency's interpretation necessarily precludes it from receiving reimbursement when Medicare is retroactively liable for services previously paid by its state Medicaid agency. The Commonwealth makes two arguments for why this is the case. First, it argues that the <i>Atlanticare</i> decision forbids the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement through providers rather than directly from Medicare, though that was not the issue before the Supreme Judicial Court. Second, it argues that the Secretary has not shown that CMS may compel providers to comply with a state Medicaid agency's request that they file a demand bill with Medicare to recover funds for reimbursement.</p>\n<p>It does not follow from these arguments that the Secretary's interpretation precludes state Medicaid agencies from reasonably expecting to receive reimbursement in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. With respect to the Commonwealth's first argument, it is not relevant to our inquiry that <i>Atlanticare</i> can be read to limit some of the options available to the Commonwealth.<sup>[12]</sup> We must look to whether the federal agency's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 is plainly inconsistent with that regulation, not whether the agency's interpretation is inconsistent with a judicial construction of the statute. With respect to its second argument, the Commonwealth has never requested that a provider file a demand bill in the manner the Secretary describes. It has no basis to argue that such requests will go unheeded or that there exists no lawful <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> avenue by which compliance with such requests could be enforced.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>We consider CMS bound by its representation as to the mechanisms available for the Commonwealth to seek and recover reimbursement.<sup>[14]</sup><i>See </i><i>Massachusetts,</i> 522 F.3d at 129 n. 8. The Commonwealth has raised valid practical concerns about the consequences of CMS's position for the states. From its point of view, it is less expeditious for state Medicaid agencies to ask providers to file demand bills in cases of retroactive dual eligibility than it would be for state Medicaid agencies to petition CMS directly.</p>\n<p>The federal agency, however, has policies supporting its interpretation within the context of this highly complex statutory scheme. For example, the defendants noted at oral argument that an entity that makes a false representation to CMS concerning a medical service can be held liable under federal causes of action against fraud. This is a considerable incentive toward honesty and efficiency. The Commonwealth argues that there is an ample federal anti-fraud enforcement mechanism already but does not directly address this policy concern. If state Medicaid agencies could simply relay past claims to Medicare, it is not clear that providers could be held liable for fraud in this manner.</p>\n<p>We are not the forum to evaluate these competing policy concerns. The decision on policy issues belongs to the Congress, and where Congress has delegated, to the Secretary. Our duty is to interpret the law, and policy arguments should be made to the Executive and to the Congress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We emphasize that we are only answering a very specific question within the context of the arguments that have been presented to us. This is a complex statutory area, and there have been strong arguments presented on both sides. We find that CMS's position that state Medicaid agencies may not recover reimbursement directly from Medicare is required by the statutory language and, in any event, is consistent with the agency's regulations. It is clear that other states have recovered reimbursement through other means, including the demand bill mechanism the agency claims providers must follow in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Medicare Part A provides hospital insurance coverage for inpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities (excluding custodial or long-term care). <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395c <i>et seq.</i> Medicare Part B provides supplementary medical insurance coverage for doctors' services and outpatient care. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395j <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  To be clear, payment is not coextensive under the Medicare and Medicaid statutes, which have different criteria for coverage of services. <i>Compare</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395d <i>with</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1396a. Medicaid coverage varies by state; the federal Medicaid statute requires that states follow certain parameters to receive federal funding. 42 U.S.C. § 1396.</p>\n<p>[3]  CMS regulations have made clear that Medicare is such a party. <i>See</i> 42 C.F.R § 433.136 (\"Third party means any individual, entity or program that is or may be liable to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a State plan.\"); <i>N.Y. State Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Bowen,</i> 846 F.2d 129, 133-34 (2d Cir.1988) (quoting CMS manuals that \"define Medicare as a third party resource\").</p>\n<p>[4]  We refer to the Commonwealth and its state Medicaid program interchangeably. The Commonwealth's Executive Office for Health and Human Services (EOHHS) administers the Massachusetts Medicaid Program (MassHealth).</p>\n<p>[5]  Two examples illustrate how retroactive dual eligibility may occur. First, an individual over the age of 65 who does not sign up for Medicare Part A coverage or social security benefits until sometime after she turns 65 years old can automatically receive retroactive Part A coverage effective six months prior to signing up. 42 C.F.R. § 406.6(d)(4). Second, an individual may appeal from a denial of Medicare Part A eligibility on the basis of a disability, and may be awarded retroactive coverage.</p>\n<p>[6]  At the time, CMS was known as the Health Care Financing Administration.</p>\n<p>[7]  The four test claims at issue here concern $39,792.32 in Medicaid funds paid by the Commonwealth for services to individuals later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare. At oral argument, the Commonwealth stated that it pays roughly $4 million in Medicaid funding each year for services rendered to individuals later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare effective at the time those services were rendered.</p>\n<p>[8]  Both parties cite cases from beyond this circuit that they argue support their constructions of the Medicare and Medicaid statutes in this case. <i>See </i><i>Conn. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Leavitt,</i> 428 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.2005); <i>N.Y. State Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Bowen,</i> 846 F.2d 129 (2d Cir.1988); <i>Evanston Hosp. v. Hauck,</i> 1 F.3d 540 (7th Cir.1993); <i>New York v. Sebelius,</i> No. 107-CV-1003, 2009 WL 1834599 (N.D.N.Y. June 22, 2009); <i>Mich. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Shalala,</i> 859 F.Supp. 1113 (W.D.Mich. 1994); <i>Petition of Maxi Drug, Inc.,</i> 154 N.H. 651, 915 A.2d 480 (2006). While we have reviewed these cases, we note that they do not bind this circuit nor, more importantly, do they speak directly to the issue at hand.</p>\n<p>[9]  In <i>Atlanticare,</i> the Supreme Judicial Court considered legislative history in construing from whom state Medicaid agencies must seek reimbursement under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B). <i>Atlanticare Med. Ctr. v. Comm'r of the Div. of Med. Assistance,</i> 439 Mass. 1, 785 N.E.2d 346, 351-352 (2003). The parties here do not invoke that legislative history, which did not concern reimbursement directly from Medicare.</p>\n<p>[10]  The Commonwealth does not contest that the payments at issue in this case were for \"services furnished an individual\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a). Although the Commonwealth did not provide the services in the four test cases, its reimbursement claims seek to recoup payments for such services as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(e) and accompanying sections.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Commonwealth makes two tangential arguments.\n</p>\n<p>First, it argues that 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) should not be read as merely ensuring that the rights of Medicaid beneficiaries are subrogated to the states, as is already required in 42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)(1)(A). We do not read the statute in this way. Whereas 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) imposes an affirmative obligation on state Medicaid agencies to seek reimbursement, 42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)(1)(A) confers rights upon state Medicaid agencies to pursue certain claims as a subrogee.</p>\n<p>Second, the Commonwealth argues that the Medicare statute only requires that providers \"make adequate provision for return\" of \"incorrectly collected\" funds under 42 U.S.C. 1395cc(a)(1)(C) and that state Medicaid funds in cases of retroactive dual eligibility were not incorrectly collected when received. This language may not expressly require providers to return funds in these cases, but it does not preclude them from returning such funds at the request of a state Medicaid agency.</p>\n<p>[12]  As the Supreme Judicial Court noted, it rested its holding on the particular circumstances at issue in that case and on the absence of evidence or argument as to whether state Medicaid agencies may obtain reimbursement directly from Medicare. It also noted that it did not know the Secretary's position on that matter. <i>Atlanticare,</i> 785 N.E.2d at 354-55. This case has given rise to additional evidence and argument, including by the Secretary.</p>\n<p>[13]  We need not address the Commonwealth's belated effort to shift this litigation to a dispute about another regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b). It is CMS's position that a payment made by a state Medicaid agency on behalf of an individual later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare constitutes an \"incorrect collection\" under 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b). From this, the agency argues that providers that do not make \"adequate provision for return\" of these \"incorrectly collected\" funds will be ineligible for future payments under 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(C).\n</p>\n<p>In its supplemental brief, the Commonwealth belatedly argues this interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b) is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation. We do not decide the question. Regardless, the Commonwealth has not shown that it cannot require providers that receive state Medicaid funds to follow the demand bill procedure. Nor has it shown that other states have been unable to secure reimbursement by asking providers to submit demand bills to Medicare. CMS represents that this is the standard procedure across the country.</p>\n<p>[14]  The Commonwealth argues that CMS's positions in this case cannot bind providers that are not parties to this litigation. <i>See </i><i>Beaudette v. Louisville Ladder, Inc.,</i> 462 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.2006). We do not assert that it does. However, CMS's positions do bind CMS with respect to how it will address future behavior by providers relevant to its positions in this suit.</p>\n\n</div>",

The Commonwealth claims that the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and associated entities violated the federal Medicaid statute when they refused to allow the Commonwealth to recover reimbursement directly from CMS in four cases of \"retroactive dual eligibility.\"</p>\n<p>In each of these four cases, an individual who received Massachusetts <i>Medicaid</i> funds to pay for medical services was later deemed retroactively eligible for federal <i>Medicare</i> funds for the period in which the individual received those services. The state is trying to secure reimbursement for its past Medicaid payments by directly petitioning the federal government for reimbursement rather than going back to the providers of services, whom the Medicare program clearly recognizes as appropriate claimants. This dispute is not over whether the Commonwealth should ultimately be reimbursed by Medicare, but whether it has chosen a permissible mechanism to recover reimbursement. <i>Cf. </i><i>Massachusetts v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203230\"><a href=\"/opinion/203230/massachusetts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 129 n. 8 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth, for understandable reasons, argues that its obligations under the federal Medicaid statute, as stated in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) and 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d), require that it seek and recover reimbursement directly from CMS in these cases of retroactive dual eligibility, and that this is the Commonwealth's exclusive avenue. Secretary Sebelius and the defendant administrators of CMS and associated entities deny this and reply that the Commonwealth must instead seek reimbursement from providers, who then in turn must obtain payment from Medicare.</p>\n<p>The federal defendants argue this is so because 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) and 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 only allow \"providers\" to receive payments from Medicare, and the Commonwealth is, as it admits, not a provider. Defendants argue that to meet its obligations to recover reimbursement under the Medicaid statute, the Commonwealth must request reimbursement from individual providers, who then must obtain payment from the federal Medicare agency. The federal defendants say that this is the procedure used by other states to recover reimbursement, that they have been consistent in their interpretation, and that Massachusetts is simply wrong when it asserts this interpretation leaves it with no way to recover reimbursement in accordance with the Medicaid statute.</p>\n<p>In this matter of statutory interpretation, the district court held that the Medicare statute unambiguously forbids the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from CMS. In the alternative, it held that even if the Medicare statute were ambiguous, CMS's interpretation must be sustained under <i>Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v.

This means that \"when an individual is entitled to Medicare and eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, like any other third party, is the primary payor,\" and Medicaid may only pay a claim \"to the extent that payment allowed under the applicable payment schedule ... exceeds the amount of Medicare's payment.\" <i>Medicaid Program: State Plan Requirements and Other Provisions Relating to State Third Party Liability Programs,</i> 55 Fed.Reg. 1423, 1429 (1990). State Medicaid agencies must \"take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties... to pay for care and services\" that would otherwise be paid by Medicaid. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(A). It is not disputed that Medicare is a third party under this provision.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the federal Medicaid statute and its accompanying regulations, state Medicaid agencies must follow two sets of requirements when addressing third-party liability.<sup>[4]</sup> First, if probable third-party liability is established at the time a claim is filed with the state agency, the agency must reject the claim and return it to the service provider. 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(b)(1); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(A). Second, if a state Medicaid agency only \"learns of the existence of a liable third party\" or \"benefits become available from a third party\" after Medicaid has paid the claim, the Medicaid agency must \"seek recovery of reimbursement.\" 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d)(2); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B). The Commonwealth relies on the second statute and regulation, arguing they require that it seek and obtain reimbursement directly from CMS when the liable third party is Medicare.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> The defendants argue that several provisions of the federal Medicare statute, particularly 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a), forbid the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from CMS. With some exceptions not relevant here, \"payment for services ... may be made only to providers of services\" if filed \"in such manner, and by such person or persons as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a)(1). By regulation, in 42 C.F.R. § 424.33, the Secretary has prescribed that \"claims for services of providers\" must be \"[f]iled by the provider.\" The Commonwealth argues, and the defendants agree, that it is not a provider. The defendants argue that while the Commonwealth may not recover reimbursement directly from CMS, it may fulfill its obligation under the Medicaid statute by asking providers to obtain payment from Medicare.</p>\n<p>The defendants argue that providers must comply with such requests by filing a \"demand bill\" with Medicare. The Medicare statute requires that providers agree to \"make adequate provision for return\" of money \"incorrectly collected\" from individuals. 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(C). CMS regulations state that a \"payment properly made to a provider by an individual not considered entitled to Medicare benefits will be deemed to be an `incorrect collection' when the individual is found to be retroactively entitled to benefits.\" 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b). CMS argues that this regulation, though it refers to payments made by individuals rather than state Medicaid agencies, requires that providers return state Medicaid funds in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. It argues that providers that do not comply with this requirement face sanctions, including termination of participation in Medicare. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 489.53(a)(1).</p>\n<p>One reason the Commonwealth takes the position that it may recover reimbursement directly from Medicare is its interpretation of a decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, <i>Atlanticare Medical Center v. Commissioner of the Division of Medical Assistance,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span> (2003). In that case, a group of private healthcare providers challenged a Massachusetts regulation that required healthcare providers to return state Medicaid payments when a liable third-party insurer was identified after payment. The providers argued that Massachusetts placed an undue burden on providers by making them responsible for recovering payment from third parties. <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Judicial Court struck down the state regulation. In the course of its ruling it reasoned that the state regulation was inconsistent with the federal Medicaid statute, namely 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B), and that state Medicaid agencies must seek reimbursement directly from liable third parties. <i>Id.</i> at 350.</p>\n<p>Some of the reimbursement claims at issue in <i>Atlanticare</i> belonged to individuals who were retroactively deemed eligible for Medicare. We stress that neither the parties nor the issues before this court are the parties or issues that were before the Supreme Judicial Court. In <i>Atlanticare,</i> the issue was the validity of a state regulation; further, the regulation governed reimbursement from all types of third parties, not merely instances involving Medicare. As CMS has noted, the state regulation did not make allowances for the fact that Medicare and Medicaid are not coextensive in coverage; it required providers to return Medicaid funds before Medicare made a determination that it was liable for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> the particular services for which those funds had been paid. Federal Medicare and Medicaid officials were not parties to the action and the Supreme Judicial Court never heard their views on the issue before us, as it noted in its decision. <i>Id.</i> at 355. Apparently, the Commonwealth did not ask CMS to submit a brief to the court expressing its views. <i>Cf. </i><i>Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184314\"><a href=\"/opinion/184314/chase-bank-usa-n-a-v-mccoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span>, 877, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184314\"><a href=\"/opinion/184314/chase-bank-usa-n-a-v-mccoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span> (2011).</p>\n<p>The parties in <i>Atlanticare</i> initially agreed that the Commonwealth could not recover costs directly from Medicare. The Commonwealth argued that under 42 C.F.R. § 424.33, Medicare may only pay directly to providers. At oral argument, however, both parties conceded that it might be possible for the Commonwealth to recover directly from Medicare. <i>Atlanticare,</i> 785 N.E.2d at 353-54 &amp; n. 14. The court stated that the Commonwealth had cited no authority demonstrating that it could not obtain reimbursement directly from Medicare and that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the Commonwealth had ever attempted to obtain reimbursement in this fashion. <i>Id.</i> at 354-55. The decision did not address either 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) or 42 C.F.R. § 424.33, or how CMS administers these provisions.</p>\n<p>Both before and after the <i>Atlanticare</i> decision, the federal Medicare and Medicaid agency has taken the position that only providers may petition Medicare for payment absent an express allowance to the contrary. In a 1991 letter to the Commonwealth, CMS wrote that \"a State Medicaid agency ... may not submit initial claims for Part A Medicare services, as these claims must be filed by the provider.\"<sup>[6]</sup> The letter distinguished \"initial claims\" from appeals arising from denials of claims. It stated that \"a dually eligible beneficiary may certainly appoint the State Medicaid agency to act as his or her representative to pursue appeal of an individual denied Medicare claim\" but \"without such appointment, the State Medicaid agency may not act on its own behalf,\" with an exception not relevant here.</p>\n<p>In April 2003, shortly after the decision in <i>Atlanticare,</i> CMS issued a State Medicaid Director Letter stating that when an individual receives payment for health services from Medicaid and is later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare, the state Medicaid agency should ask the provider of services to file a claim with Medicare. The letter was sent to all state Medicaid directors, not just the Massachusetts Medicaid director. In May 2003, the Commonwealth sought clarification of this letter in light of <i>Atlanticare.</i> In September 2003, it also sought to establish itself as a \"qualified billing entity\" that could submit claims to Medicare on behalf of Medicaid recipients and the facilities that provide services to those recipients.</p>\n<p>CMS denied the Commonwealth's request that it be established as a qualified billing entity and reiterated that only providers may file claims with Medicare. In an October 2003 letter denying the Commonwealth's request, CMS wrote that its \"interpretation of the regulations prohibits Medicare Intermediaries from paying benefits due to a provider to other than the provider of services.\" In a December 2003 letter clarifying the April 2003 guidance letter, CMS wrote that \"there is no statutory authority under Medicare to allow a state to seek recovery and be paid directly from Medicare\" because \"Medicare allows only providers to bill and be paid by Medicare.\" It repeated that when Medicare's third-party liability is not known until after a state Medicaid agency has paid a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> claim, the state should ask the provider to bill Medicare.</p>\n<p>In light of CMS's statements, the Commonwealth sought a modification of the declaratory judgment entered in <i>Atlanticare</i> on the ground that new information demonstrated it could not recover reimbursement directly from Medicare. In support of this motion, the Commonwealth submitted copies of the April 2003 guidance letter and the ensuing correspondence between it and CMS. A Massachusetts Superior Court denied this motion. <i>Atlanticare Med. Ctr. v. Reynolds,</i> No. 1451-H, slip op. at 2 (Mass.Super.Ct. July 28, 2004). The Superior Court stated that it found the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in <i>Atlanticare</i> more persuasive than the April 2003 guidance letter, and that the letter had merely restated arguments the Commonwealth advanced in <i>Atlanticare. Id.</i> at 6. Again, no federal Medicare or Medicaid official was involved in the suit or asked to submit the agency's views. The Commonwealth did not, apparently, pursue the matter to the Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p>In later communications with the Commonwealth, CMS continued to reiterate its position that a state Medicaid agency cannot recover reimbursement directly from Medicare. The Commonwealth, correctly or not, believed itself between a rock and a hard place. In December 2006, the Commonwealth submitted four test claims to CMS, seeking reimbursement from Medicare for Medicaid funds paid on behalf of individuals later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare. CMS rejected these claims on the ground that the Commonwealth is not a provider, consistent with the agency's position stated earlier that non-providers may not receive payments from Medicare. The Commonwealth then filed this lawsuit.<sup>[7]</sup> It is undisputed that the Commonwealth has exhausted its administrative remedies.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth seeks (1) an injunction ordering CMS to accept, process, approve, and pay the four reimbursement claims it submitted in 2006, as well as (2) a declaration that the defendants must accept and process reimbursement claims submitted by the Commonwealth in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. The district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and dismissed the Commonwealth's cross-motion for summary judgment as moot. It held that 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) unambiguously prohibits the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from CMS. The district court held in the alternative that even assuming the statute was ambiguous, 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 must receive deference because it was promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of authority and is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss, taking as true all well-pleaded facts and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <i>Boroian v. Mueller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"152917\"><a href=\"/opinion/152917/boroian-v-mueller/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2010). This case does not involve any factual disputes, only a pure question of law: whether the federal Medicaid statute requires that CMS allow the Commonwealth to recover reimbursement directly from CMS in cases of retroactive dual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> eligibility. This does not involve review of whether there is a valid claim for reimbursement in these four test cases; it involves review of the appropriate mechanism to obtain such reimbursement. We agree with the defendants that as a matter of federal law, the Commonwealth may not recover reimbursement directly from CMS in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. This does not mean, however, that the state has no mechanism to receive reimbursement. It does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Agency Deference Under Chevron</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This question of statutory interpretation must be treated within the familiar framework set forth in <i>Chevron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span> (2004)). This analysis looks to the text, structure, and, when permissible, legislative history of the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 22, 30. We look first to text and structure; we note that neither party introduces legislative history and we are unaware of any on point.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Both parties contend that the plain language of the statutory scheme unambiguously supports their position. The Commonwealth points to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B), which states that when third party liability \"is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available,\" with an exception not relevant here, the state Medicaid agency must \"seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability.\" The defendants point to 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a), which states that, with exceptions again not relevant here, \"payment for services furnished an individual may be made only to providers of services\" as defined in the Medicare statute.</p>\n<p>Neither of these provisions, read in isolation, speak to whether the Commonwealth, which is not a provider, may recover reimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. Although 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) plainly requires that state Medicaid agencies seek reimbursement in such cases, it does not create a right to receive reimbursement directly from CMS. This provision does not identify from whom the state agency should seek this reimbursement. The federal Medicare agency could be a candidate, but the providers that received the initial payment are more plausible. The fact that 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) refers to \"payment for services furnished an individual,\" moreover, permits the Commonwealth to argue that its claim is instead for reimbursement for past payments made for such services.</p>\n<p>Although no statutory provision explicitly resolves the question presented here, the statutory scheme does not allow the interpretation advanced by the Commonwealth. The Medicare statute equates reimbursement and payment and does not allow non-providers to receive payments from Medicare. The Commonwealth is not included among any of the express allowances in the Medicare statute for non-providers to receive payments. The Medicare statute thus forecloses the Commonwealth from receiving reimbursement directly from Medicare.<sup>[10]</sup> This result is consistent with both the Medicaid statute's requirement that state Medicaid agencies seek recovery of reimbursement and Congress's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> intent that Medicaid generally be the payer of last resort.</p>\n<p>We look first to the meaning of \"reimbursement\" in the statutory scheme. Neither the Medicare statute nor the Medicaid statute supports a distinction between payment and reimbursement relevant to the test claims in this case. As to the Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) discusses claims for reimbursement within its provisions governing payment for services. The statute does not define reimbursement, nor does it express parameters for reimbursement claims as if they were different from the parameters for payment claims. As to the Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) neither defines reimbursement nor distinguishes between it and other forms of payment for our purposes. In this statutory context, it is most natural to read reimbursement as a particular type of payment. <i>See </i><i>Succar,</i> 394 F.3d at 22.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth challenges this reading on two grounds. First, it argues that the Medicare statute allows non-providers to recover reimbursement despite its limitations on who may recover payments for services. Second, it argues that this interpretation of the statutory scheme contravenes congressional intent that Medicaid generally be the payer of last resort.</p>\n<p>As to the first argument, the Commonwealth has not identified any statutory language that would allow state Medicaid agencies to recover reimbursement from CMS under these circumstances. The Commonwealth has identified only one instance in which the statute allows payment for reimbursement to non-providers: an express exception to 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) involving emergency services. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395f(d)(2) &amp; 1395n(b)(2). We are aware of only one other instance in which the statute allows a non-provider to receive reimbursement: when an individual has made payments for certain hospital services furnished outside the United States. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(f)(4). These provisions do not allow all non-providers to receive reimbursement, and they do not make any specific allowance for the Commonwealth's reimbursement claims. Rather, they are express exceptions to the general rule we have noted.</p>\n<p>As to the second argument, our reading of the statute is not in tension with Congress's intent that Medicaid generally be a payer of last resort. The statute does not preclude state Medicaid agencies from receiving reimbursement in cases of retroactive dual eligibility through a mechanism other than direct application to Medicare. As the Commonwealth argues, \"[t]he choice between two federal statutes requires an analysis of both, to see if they are indeed incompatible or if they can be harmonized.\" <i>Boston &amp; Maine Corp. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204082\"><a href=\"/opinion/204082/boston-and-maine-v-massachusetts-bay-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 98 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>Coker v.

Here, the Medicare and Medicaid statutes can be harmonized with one another in a manner that preserves the purpose of the statutory scheme recognized in <i>Ahlborn:</i> state Medicaid agencies may seek and recover reimbursement by asking providers to return state Medicaid funds.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth advances a functional argument that, whatever the Medicare statute says, the Commonwealth cannot reasonably expect to receive reimbursement from providers and that therefore the statute should be construed to allow it to recover reimbursement directly from Medicare. The first of these propositions is doubtful, and the second does not follow from it. The Commonwealth has never employed the demand bill procedure that the Secretary describes as an available alternative, and so it cannot say that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> procedure will not work. Nor does the Commonwealth cite any statutory language that prohibits state Medicaid agencies from recovering reimbursement from Medicare by asking providers to employ this demand bill procedure.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Chevron Step Two and Auer</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our alternative holding is under the second step of <i>Chevron,</i> under which we look to the agency's regulations. Even if the statutory scheme did not speak unambiguously as to whether the Commonwealth may obtain reimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility, CMS's interpretation of its regulations resolves this question and is entitled to deference. The Commonwealth does not dispute the validity of the regulation upon which CMS relies, 42 C.F.R. § 424.33. Nor does it challenge CMS's regulation concerning the obligations of state Medicaid agencies seeking reimbursement as required by the Medicaid statute, 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d). The Commonwealth only challenges the agency's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33. This challenge fails under <i>Auer. See </i><i>McCoy,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 880.</p>\n<p>On their face, the agency's regulations do not expressly speak to whether the Commonwealth may recover reimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. Under the Medicare statute, the Secretary has provided that \"[a]ll claims for services of providers\" must be \"[f]iled by the provider.\" 42 C.F.R. § 424.33(a). Under the Medicaid statute, the Secretary has only provided that an agency that seeks reimbursement \"must seek recovery of reimbursement\" subject to certain time constraints. 42 C.F.R. § 433.139(d). These provisions do not address whether reimbursement claims are \"claims for services of providers.\" Nor does the broader regulatory structure cast light on this question. These regulations do resolve whether the Commonwealth may file claims for services of providers directly with Medicare; it may not.</p>\n<p>The Secretary has interpreted 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 such that state Medicaid agencies may not recover reimbursement directly from Medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. In its April 2003 guidance letter to state Medicaid directors, CMS wrote that \"Medicaid is usually the payer of last resort\" and that when a \"Medicaid agency learns of the existence of a liable third party after a claim is paid, or benefits become available from a third party after the claim is paid, [the state Medicaid agency] must seek recovery from that third party.\" In cases \"[w]hen that third party is Medicare,\" CMS wrote, \"neither the Medicare nor Medicaid statute, nor HHS's regulations or policies prohibit any state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> from recouping its Medicaid payment from providers\" in two situations.</p>\n<p>According to the guidance letter, a state may recoup its Medicaid payment from providers when (1) \"Medicare has determined that it is liable for the service at issue\" or (2) \"a beneficiary, beneficiary representative, or state (as the beneficiary's subrogee) timely requests the provider to file a claim with Medicare and the provider fails\" to do so in a timely and appropriate manner. In the letter, CMS also noted that, acting as a beneficiary's subrogee, \"a state may request the provider to submit a claim for Medicare payment and the provider must honor that request\" by submitting a \"demand bill.\" The letter concluded that \"if a provider fails to submit timely a demand bill, the provider violates its provider agreement with Medicare if it charges the beneficiary (or the beneficiary's subrogee), or retains any charge already collected from the beneficiary or subrogee, for such services.\"</p>\n<p>Although the April 2003 letter did not expressly state that the Commonwealth cannot receive reimbursement directly from Medicare, later letters from CMS made this point clear. In its December 2003 letter, CMS stated that \"there is no statutory authority under Medicare to allow a state to seek recovery and be paid directly from Medicare.\" It stated that \"Medicare allows only providers to bill and be paid by Medicare\" and that the state \"may timely request [a] provider to submit a bill timely to Medicare.\" In a June 2005 letter to the Commonwealth, CMS reiterated that \"there is no statutory authority for reimbursing Medicaid directly for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.\" There is no dispute that these statements apply directly to the situation at hand and preceded the present litigation.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth makes three arguments that the agency's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. First, it argues that 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 merely parrots the statutory language of 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a). Second, it argues that CMS's reliance on 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 and 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) is a post hoc litigation position because CMS did not cite those provisions in its recent letters to the Commonwealth. Third, it argues that CMS's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 is inconsistent with the statutory scheme, including CMS's other regulations. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p>As to the first argument, it is true that the Supreme Court has held that an agency \"does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation, it has elected to merely paraphrase the statutory language.\" <i>Gonzales v. Oregon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145693\"><a href=\"/opinion/145693/gonzales-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, 257, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145693\"><a href=\"/opinion/145693/gonzales-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145693\"><a href=\"/opinion/145693/gonzales-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span> (2006). That is not the case here, however. The regulation fills an express gap in 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) as to who may file claims, as opposed to who may receive payments. 42 C.F.R. § 424.33. It also uses more general terms than the statute, referring to \"claims for services\" rather than \"payment for services.\" <i>See id.</i> Even if the statutory language did not clearly include reimbursement as a type of payment, the regulation leaves open the possibility that petitions for reimbursement as well as petitions for payment are both types of \"claims.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>As to the Commonwealth's second argument, it is true that an agency's interpretation of its regulation may not be entitled to deference if it is merely a post hoc rationalization for past agency action rather than the agency's fair and considered judgment on the issue. <i>See </i><i>McCoy,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 881. But that is not the case here, either. The agency's construction of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> statute long predates this litigation. In <i>Atlanticare,</i> the Commonwealth argued that it could not recover reimbursement from Medicare for precisely the reason CMS now advances: it is not a provider. In that case, the Commonwealth relied upon the federal agency's 1991 letter stating that only providers may seek payments directly from Medicare. The agency reiterated this position in 2003 with respect to claims for reimbursement. The Commonwealth filed its four test claims in this case precisely to challenge that construction.</p>\n<p>The fact that CMS did not explicitly reference 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 or 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a) in its recent letters to the Commonwealth does not transform the agency's reliance on these provisions into a post hoc rationalization or demonstrate a lack of considered judgment. The basis for the federal agency's position has been clear since before this litigation began. In the federal agency's 1991 letter to the Commonwealth, it invoked 42 C.F.R. §§ 424.30-424.45 to explain why, with exceptions not relevant here, providers were required to file the \"initial claim\" with Medicare. In its motion for reconsideration of the <i>Atlanticare</i> decision, the Commonwealth conveyed to the Superior Court that \"Medicare will only pay directly to providers under 42 C.F.R. § 424.33\" and another provision. <i>Atlanticare,</i> No. 1451-H, slip op. at 3.</p>\n<p>As to the third argument, the Commonwealth asserts that CMS's construction of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 contravenes congressional intent that Medicaid serve as payer of last resort. Specifically, the Commonwealth argues that the federal agency's interpretation necessarily precludes it from receiving reimbursement when Medicare is retroactively liable for services previously paid by its state Medicaid agency. The Commonwealth makes two arguments for why this is the case. First, it argues that the <i>Atlanticare</i> decision forbids the Commonwealth from recovering reimbursement through providers rather than directly from Medicare, though that was not the issue before the Supreme Judicial Court. Second, it argues that the Secretary has not shown that CMS may compel providers to comply with a state Medicaid agency's request that they file a demand bill with Medicare to recover funds for reimbursement.</p>\n<p>It does not follow from these arguments that the Secretary's interpretation precludes state Medicaid agencies from reasonably expecting to receive reimbursement in cases of retroactive dual eligibility. With respect to the Commonwealth's first argument, it is not relevant to our inquiry that <i>Atlanticare</i> can be read to limit some of the options available to the Commonwealth.<sup>[12]</sup> We must look to whether the federal agency's interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 424.33 is plainly inconsistent with that regulation, not whether the agency's interpretation is inconsistent with a judicial construction of the statute. With respect to its second argument, the Commonwealth has never requested that a provider file a demand bill in the manner the Secretary describes. It has no basis to argue that such requests will go unheeded or that there exists no lawful <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> avenue by which compliance with such requests could be enforced.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>We consider CMS bound by its representation as to the mechanisms available for the Commonwealth to seek and recover reimbursement.<sup>[14]</sup><i>See </i><i>Massachusetts,</i> 522 F.3d at 129 n. 8. The Commonwealth has raised valid practical concerns about the consequences of CMS's position for the states. From its point of view, it is less expeditious for state Medicaid agencies to ask providers to file demand bills in cases of retroactive dual eligibility than it would be for state Medicaid agencies to petition CMS directly.</p>\n<p>The federal agency, however, has policies supporting its interpretation within the context of this highly complex statutory scheme. For example, the defendants noted at oral argument that an entity that makes a false representation to CMS concerning a medical service can be held liable under federal causes of action against fraud. This is a considerable incentive toward honesty and efficiency. The Commonwealth argues that there is an ample federal anti-fraud enforcement mechanism already but does not directly address this policy concern. If state Medicaid agencies could simply relay past claims to Medicare, it is not clear that providers could be held liable for fraud in this manner.</p>\n<p>We are not the forum to evaluate these competing policy concerns. The decision on policy issues belongs to the Congress, and where Congress has delegated, to the Secretary. Our duty is to interpret the law, and policy arguments should be made to the Executive and to the Congress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We emphasize that we are only answering a very specific question within the context of the arguments that have been presented to us. This is a complex statutory area, and there have been strong arguments presented on both sides. We find that CMS's position that state Medicaid agencies may not recover reimbursement directly from Medicare is required by the statutory language and, in any event, is consistent with the agency's regulations. It is clear that other states have recovered reimbursement through other means, including the demand bill mechanism the agency claims providers must follow in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Medicare Part A provides hospital insurance coverage for inpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities (excluding custodial or long-term care). <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395c <i>et seq.</i> Medicare Part B provides supplementary medical insurance coverage for doctors' services and outpatient care. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395j <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  To be clear, payment is not coextensive under the Medicare and Medicaid statutes, which have different criteria for coverage of services. <i>Compare</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1395d <i>with</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1396a. Medicaid coverage varies by state; the federal Medicaid statute requires that states follow certain parameters to receive federal funding. 42 U.S.C. § 1396.</p>\n<p>[3]  CMS regulations have made clear that Medicare is such a party. <i>See</i> 42 C.F.R § 433.136 (\"Third party means any individual, entity or program that is or may be liable to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a State plan.\"); <i>N.Y.

Bowen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505835\"><a href=\"/opinion/505835/the-new-york-state-department-of-social-services-and-cesar-perales-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 133-34 (2d Cir.1988) (quoting CMS manuals that \"define Medicare as a third party resource\").</p>\n<p>[4]  We refer to the Commonwealth and its state Medicaid program interchangeably. The Commonwealth's Executive Office for Health and Human Services (EOHHS) administers the Massachusetts Medicaid Program (MassHealth).</p>\n<p>[5]  Two examples illustrate how retroactive dual eligibility may occur. First, an individual over the age of 65 who does not sign up for Medicare Part A coverage or social security benefits until sometime after she turns 65 years old can automatically receive retroactive Part A coverage effective six months prior to signing up. 42 C.F.R. § 406.6(d)(4). Second, an individual may appeal from a denial of Medicare Part A eligibility on the basis of a disability, and may be awarded retroactive coverage.</p>\n<p>[6]  At the time, CMS was known as the Health Care Financing Administration.</p>\n<p>[7]  The four test claims at issue here concern $39,792.32 in Medicaid funds paid by the Commonwealth for services to individuals later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare. At oral argument, the Commonwealth stated that it pays roughly $4 million in Medicaid funding each year for services rendered to individuals later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare effective at the time those services were rendered.</p>\n<p>[8]  Both parties cite cases from beyond this circuit that they argue support their constructions of the Medicare and Medicaid statutes in this case. <i>See </i><i>Conn.

While we have reviewed these cases, we note that they do not bind this circuit nor, more importantly, do they speak directly to the issue at hand.</p>\n<p>[9]  In <i>Atlanticare,</i> the Supreme Judicial Court considered legislative history in construing from whom state Medicaid agencies must seek reimbursement under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B). <i>Atlanticare Med. Ctr. v. Comm'r of the Div. of Med. Assistance,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span>, 351-352 (2003). The parties here do not invoke that legislative history, which did not concern reimbursement directly from Medicare.</p>\n<p>[10]  The Commonwealth does not contest that the payments at issue in this case were for \"services furnished an individual\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1395f(a). Although the Commonwealth did not provide the services in the four test cases, its reimbursement claims seek to recoup payments for such services as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(e) and accompanying sections.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Commonwealth makes two tangential arguments.\n</p>\n<p>First, it argues that 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) should not be read as merely ensuring that the rights of Medicaid beneficiaries are subrogated to the states, as is already required in 42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)(1)(A). We do not read the statute in this way. Whereas 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) imposes an affirmative obligation on state Medicaid agencies to seek reimbursement, 42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)(1)(A) confers rights upon state Medicaid agencies to pursue certain claims as a subrogee.</p>\n<p>Second, the Commonwealth argues that the Medicare statute only requires that providers \"make adequate provision for return\" of \"incorrectly collected\" funds under 42 U.S.C. 1395cc(a)(1)(C) and that state Medicaid funds in cases of retroactive dual eligibility were not incorrectly collected when received. This language may not expressly require providers to return funds in these cases, but it does not preclude them from returning such funds at the request of a state Medicaid agency.</p>\n<p>[12]  As the Supreme Judicial Court noted, it rested its holding on the particular circumstances at issue in that case and on the absence of evidence or argument as to whether state Medicaid agencies may obtain reimbursement directly from Medicare. It also noted that it did not know the Secretary's position on that matter. <i>Atlanticare,</i> 785 N.E.2d at 354-55. This case has given rise to additional evidence and argument, including by the Secretary.</p>\n<p>[13]  We need not address the Commonwealth's belated effort to shift this litigation to a dispute about another regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b). It is CMS's position that a payment made by a state Medicaid agency on behalf of an individual later deemed retroactively eligible for Medicare constitutes an \"incorrect collection\" under 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b). From this, the agency argues that providers that do not make \"adequate provision for return\" of these \"incorrectly collected\" funds will be ineligible for future payments under 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(C).\n</p>\n<p>In its supplemental brief, the Commonwealth belatedly argues this interpretation of 42 C.F.R. § 489.40(b) is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation. We do not decide the question. Regardless, the Commonwealth has not shown that it cannot require providers that receive state Medicaid funds to follow the demand bill procedure. Nor has it shown that other states have been unable to secure reimbursement by asking providers to submit demand bills to Medicare. CMS represents that this is the standard procedure across the country.</p>\n<p>[14]  The Commonwealth argues that CMS's positions in this case cannot bind providers that are not parties to this litigation. <i>See </i><i>Beaudette v. Louisville Ladder, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202396\"><a href=\"/opinion/202396/beaudette-v-louisville-ladder/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2006). We do not assert that it does. However, CMS's positions do bind CMS with respect to how it will address future behavior by providers relevant to its positions in this suit.</p>\n\n</div>",
