Gene A. Carter, District Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David M.

Appellant plaintiff\n\nArnold Hoffman appeals from the district court's granting of\n\nsummary judgment for appellee defendants Applicators Sales and\n\nService,    Inc.,   Paradigm   Window   Solutions,   Andrew   Sevier,   and\n\nRichard Robinov (collectively, \"defendants\" or \"the Company\"), and\n\nfrom the court's striking of the plaintiff's designation of an\n\nexpert witness.     We affirm.\n\n                        I.   Background and Facts\n\n            Hoffman filed in the Maine Superior Court a three-count\n\ncomplaint alleging age discrimination, defamation, and breach of\n\nemployment agreement. On July 21, 2004, the defendants removed the\n\naction from the state to the federal court.\n\n            The district court thereupon issued a scheduling order\n\nsetting dates for the parties to designate expert witnesses, to\n\ncomplete discovery, and to file dispositive motions.            Discovery\n\ntook place in the form of requests for documents, depositions, and\n\ninterrogatories, following which the defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment.    The court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor\n\nof the company on Count 1 for age discrimination and remanded the\n\nremaining claims to the state court.1\n\n\n     1\n      Sometime after the deadline set by the district court for\ndesignating expert witnesses, Hoffman designated an expert, and the\nCompany moved to strike the designation. The court granted the\nCompany's motion to strike, a ruling from which Hoffman now\nappeals. Because, however, we affirm the grant of summary judgment\nto defendants, we need not review the status of Hoffman's witness\ndesignation. Even if the court erred on the witness designation,\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          We view the record on summary judgment in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmovant.   See Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R.\n\nWireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Applicators Sales and Service, Inc. (\"Applicators\") is a\n\nwholesale distributor that sells building products to professional\n\ncontractors.   Part of Applicators' business included manufacturing\n\nwindows under a franchise agreement with a national company.      At\n\nsome point, Applicators decided to end its relationship with the\n\nfranchisor in order to start a new venture with its own products.\n\nThis new venture resulted in the creation of defendant Paradigm\n\nWindow Solutions (\"Paradigm\").      Defendant Sevier is Paradigm's\n\nGeneral Manager.   A semi-autonomous division, Paradigm makes and\n\ndistributes windows under its own name and for a private label.\n\n          Before joining the defendants' company, Arnold Hoffman\n\nwas employed for seven years by MBF Windows in Portland, Maine.   He\n\nserved as the head of MBF's Portland operation, performing a wide\n\nrange of duties, and supervised one or two employees at any given\n\ntime. Responding to an advertisement for an outside sales position\n\nat Applicators, Hoffman submitted his resume to the company in\n\nMarch or April of 2000.       He interviewed first with defendants\n\nRobinov and Sevier and two other employees.   They did not explain\n\nmuch about the position because Applicators had not yet announced\n\nplans to sever ties with its franchisor.   About three weeks after\n\n\nthe summary judgment would still stand.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe    first    interview,   Hoffman      was   called    in   for   a   follow-up\n\ninterview and offered the job, which would be with the new entity,\n\nParadigm.      He accepted and began work in May 2000.           He was 54 or 55\n\nyears old when he began with the company.\n\n               Sevier was Hoffman's supervisor throughout his employment\n\nat Paradigm.       Hoffman viewed Sevier as an irrationally demanding\n\nsupervisor, and the relationship between the two deteriorated over\n\ntime.    Hoffman testified in his deposition that Sevier \"was a very\n\npoor     manager    [who]    .   .   .    motivated      by    intimidation    and\n\nnegative . . . comments, not by positives and encouragement.\"                  He\n\nalso wrote in a letter to Jerry Robinov, one of the founders of\n\nApplicators, that \"Most of the salesmen hate dealing with [Mr.\n\nSevier] and will do everything they can to avoid him. . . .                   I am\n\nnot the first employee to have experienced [Mr. Sevier's] wrath or\n\nhis poor personnel management skills.              I'm sure I won't be the\n\nlast.\"     He testified that \"it was a general consensus behind\n\n[Sevier's] back that people did not like him.             They didn't like the\n\nway he treated them.\"\n\n               Hoffman was very successful in sales, achieving a 56\n\npercent sales increase in his last fiscal year of employment, an\n\nincrease which the Company's Sales Manager, Steve Zerbinopolous,\n\nacknowledged as unmatched.           His May, 2002 performance evaluation\n\nrated him as \"exceeds requirements\" (a score of 4 on a scale of 1-\n\n5) for problem solving, communication, initiative, and innovation\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fand rated him as \"meets job requirements\" (a 3 on a scale of 1-5)\n\nfor   quantity     of   work,     job    knowledge,      planning/organizing,\n\nadaptability, and cost consciousness.                He was given a rating of\n\n\"needs improvement\" (a 2 on a scale of 1-5) in the categories of\n\nmanaging people, judgment, safety awareness, and leadership.                      He\n\nreceived a merit pay increase after that evaluation.\n\n            On May 22-23, 2003, Hoffman underwent another annual\n\nperformance review.     In the written review, Sevier was critical of\n\nHoffman's    performance    and    declined     to    grant    him   a   merit   pay\n\nincrease.    Hoffman and Sevier agreed to meet on August 29, 2003 for\n\na follow-up, at which time Hoffman's performance would be re-\n\nevaluated and a determination would be made about whether to\n\nincrease Hoffman's salary.          In the performance review, Hoffman\n\nreceived a rating of \"meets job requirements\" in problem solving,\n\nadaptability, dependability, communication, innovation, appearance,\n\ncost consciousness, and safety.           He was given a rating of \"needs\n\nimprovement\" in the categories job knowledge, judgment, leadership,\n\nand training.      The overall rating stated:\n\n      There are concerns with the manner in which you manage\n      your territory and time. It appears as [though] you have\n      not systematically scheduled to visit your accounts and\n      you do not follow up with the requests made by your\n      customers. You need to improve your presentation skills.\n      You need to make dramatic improvement in these areas.\n\nHoffman     sent   Sevier   a     written     rebuttal    to    his      criticisms\n\nimmediately following the May review.           Sevier responded in writing\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fto the rebuttal and reiterated his plan for the August review.\n\nHoffman sent Sevier a second rebuttal on June 22, 2003.\n\n           On or about June 25, 2003, Hoffman and Sevier had a\n\ndispute about the status of a work-related project. Hoffman missed\n\na deadline for the production of sell sheets for window products,\n\nand Sevier became impatient with Hoffman's attempts to explain the\n\nreason he missed the deadline. Hoffman argued that the sell sheets\n\nwere substantially complete but for information that was to be\n\nsupplied by Sevier and the inclusion of a few photos which, Hoffman\n\nclaimed,   Hoffman   or   a   photographer   \"could   have    taken   in   an\n\nafternoon.\"   Sevier lost his temper with Hoffman, and, on June 27,\n\n2003, the Company terminated Hoffman's employment.           Scott Frazier,\n\na long-time Company employee, assumed Hoffman's position about\n\nthree months after Hoffman's termination.        Frazier was less than\n\nforty years old at the time he was promoted.\n\n           The district court, reviewing the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment, assumed arguendo that the plaintiff had made out\n\na prima facie case of employment discrimination.             The court also\n\nfound that the defendants had put forward a legitimate reason for\n\nhis termination (the flawed 2003 performance review and the June\n\n25, 2003 missing of a project deadline).        Addressing next whether\n\nHoffman had carried his burden to establish that the defendants'\n\nstated reason for termination was a pretext for age discrimination,\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe district court found that Hoffman had not introduced sufficient\n\nevidence to establish that it was such a pretext.\n\n              Hoffman relied on what he called \"Exhibit E,\" attached to\n\nhis Offer of Proof, a chart which purported to summarize the number\n\nof employees at Applicators and Paradigm and of those over the age\n\nof 50 at each division.             The district court struck Exhibit E from\n\nthe summary judgment record on the grounds that it was inadmissible\n\nbecause it was not properly authenticated and was based on data\n\nthat   had    not    been   authenticated       or   presented    in   the   summary\n\njudgment record.          Further, the district court noted, the accuracy\n\nof the information in Exhibit E had not been sworn to under oath.\n\n              The district court concluded that without Exhibit E,\n\nHoffman      had    not    placed    in   the   record   any     evidence    of   age\n\ndiscrimination or age-based animus and held that no rational fact-\n\nfinder could infer from the record as it existed an employment\n\naction based upon age discrimination.                The court entered summary\n\njudgment for the defendants on the age discrimination claim and\n\nremanded the remaining two state claims to the Maine state court.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                     II.    Discussion -- Summary Judgment\n\n              On appeal, Hoffman argues that the district court erred\n\nin striking Exhibit E and in ruling that Hoffman had introduced\n\ninsufficient evidence of pretext and age-based motivation.                         We\n\ndisagree.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fA.   Standard of Review\n\n           We review de novo the district court's decision to grant\n\nsummary judgment.    Roldan-Plumey, 115 F.3d at 61.        However, we\n\nreview the district court's decision to exclude an exhibit from\n\nevidence only for abuse of discretion.     \"[P]rior to turning to its\n\nde novo summary judgment examination,\" the Court should review the\n\ndistrict court's evidentiary rulings made as part of its decision\n\non summary judgment for abuse of discretion.          Alternative Sys.\n\nConcepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc., 374 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing Schubert v. Nissan Motor Corp., 148 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n1998)).   \"[A] trial court should have as much leeway in dealing\n\nwith those [evidentiary] matters at the summary judgment stage as\n\nat trial.\"   Id. at 31-32.\n\n           The phrase \"abuse of discretion\"\n\n      sounds worse than it really is. All it need mean is\n      that, when judicial action is taken in a discretionary\n      matter, such action cannot be set aside by a reviewing\n      court unless it has a definite and firm conviction that\n      the court below committed a clear error of judgment in\n      the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the\n      relevant factors.\n\nSchubert, 148 F.3d at 30 (quotation omitted).       A \"court of appeals\n\nordinarily   will   not   find   an    abuse   of   discretion   unless\n\nperscrutation of the record provides strong evidence that the trial\n\njudge indulged in a serious lapse in judgment.\"      Texaco P.R., Inc.\n\nv. Dep't of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 875 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fB.   Exclusion of Exhibit E\n\n             Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e), on summary\n\njudgment, the parties in their supporting affidavits \"shall set\n\nforth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show\n\naffirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the\n\nmatters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or\n\nparts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto\n\nor served therewith.\"     See Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 131\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (emphasis supplied).    The district court held that\n\nExhibit E was not admissible because it was not authenticated and\n\nwas based on data not authenticated or presented in the summary\n\njudgment record.    \"In reviewing a summary judgment, we are limited\n\nto the . . . evidence available to the court at the time the motion\n\nwas made.\"    Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n             According to Hoffman, Exhibit E should nonetheless have\n\nbeen admitted as it was a tabulation of \"documentary evidence\n\nprovided in discovery by Defendants.\"     Hoffman says the tabulated\n\ndata in the Exhibit demonstrates age discrimination because it\n\nshows that Paradigm employed only one person over the age of fifty,\n\nwhile twenty-two percent of Applicators' employees were over fifty.\n\nThe Exhibit consists of a chart with attached explanatory notes\n\npurporting to list the total number of employees at Paradigm and\n\nApplicators and breaking down the number of salaried employees and\n\nthe number of salaried employees over fifty years of age.          A\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\ffootnote      states   that   some   employees    have   been   excluded   from\n\nconsideration in the calculations.             Other footnotes to the chart\n\nindicate that the data therein is based on disclosures provided by\n\nthe defendants in document discovery at pages D492 through D509.\n\nExhibit E's preparer is not named, and the cited underlying pages\n\nof documentary discovery are neither attached to Exhibit E nor\n\nincluded elsewhere in exhibits or attachments filed by either party\n\nin connection with the summary judgment motion or opposition.\n\n              Hoffman does not deny in his appellate and reply briefs\n\nthe district court's assertion, echoed by defendant appellees in\n\ntheir brief, that the discovery documents allegedly underpinning\n\nExhibit E were not presented to the district court.                   Indeed,\n\nnothing in the docket below indicates the discovery documents\n\nreferenced in Exhibit E had in any manner been filed with the\n\ncourt.      Hence, to have located them, the court would have had to\n\ninitiate a search going beyond any of the documents filed with the\n\ncase.       Only on appeal has Hoffman, for the first time, submitted\n\nseveral      Bates-numbered    pages    from    the   defendants'   discovery\n\ndisclosures listing employees and their birthdates and dates of\n\nhire.2\n\n\n\n        2\n      Defendants have moved to strike the pages tendered on appeal\non the ground that they were not submitted to the district court.\nWe denied the motion without prejudice to reconsideration at the\ntime we resolved this appeal. We now allow the motion as the pages\nhave not been shown to have been a part of the record below. See\ninfra pp. 11-12.\n\n                                       -10-\n\f           Hoffman argues that, even though the supporting pages now\n\ntendered may not actually have been before the district court, they\n\nreflect   data    disclosed    by    the    defendants   themselves   during\n\ndiscovery.       Moreover,    he    asserts,   the   disclosures   would   be\n\nadmissible at trial as business records.          Therefore, Hoffman says,\n\ntheir authenticity cannot now be questioned and \"[t]his critical\n\npiece of evidence [i.e., Exhibit E] should have been considered by\n\nthe District Court when considering Defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment . . . regardless of what may appropriately be required for\n\nits admission into evidence at trial.\"3\n\n           But Hoffman overlooks the crucial point that documents do\n\nnot automatically become a part of the record simply because they\n\n\n     3\n      Hoffman points to language in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 324 (1986), in which the Supreme Court stated,\n\n     [w]e do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce\n     evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in\n     order to avoid summary judgment. Obviously, Rule 56 does\n     not require a nonmoving party to depose her own\n     witnesses. Rule 56(e) permits a proper summary judgment\n     motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary\n     materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings\n     themselves, and it is from this list that one would\n     normally expect the nonmoving party to make the showing\n     to which we have referred.\n\nIn context, however, the quotation addresses the specific point in\nCelotex that a nonmoving party who bore the burden of proof on a\ndispositive issue could rely on her own affidavits and the\n\"depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file\"\nwithout having to depose her own witnesses.     Id. (quoting Rule\n56(c))(emphasis supplied).    The reference is not availing for\nHoffman here when the issue is the court's refusal to accept a\nchalk supported only by discovery disclosures that were never \"on\nfile\" with the district court.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fare the products of discovery.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (\"[s]worn\n\nor certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in\n\nan affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith\"); In re\n\nCitric Acid Litig., 191 F.3d 1090, 1101-02 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"The\n\ndocument on which [the plaintiff] relies for its market share\n\nfigures was not submitted as part of the summary judgment record,\n\nand thus we do not consider it.\").       If a party wishes the court to\n\nconsider   matters    disclosed   during    discovery,     he   must    take\n\nappropriate steps to have them included in the record: merely\n\nciting to pages of discovery materials not of record does not\n\nsuffice.\n\n           Hence,    whatever   argument   Hoffman   may   have   had   for\n\nadmission of Exhibit E as a \"chalk\" grounded on data found in\n\ndefendant appellees' business records, required that the discovery\n\ndocuments containing such records be brought first before the\n\ncourt, by being placed in the summary judgment record.          Where that\n\nwas not done, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nnot seeking out the referenced documentation on its own and in\n\nrejecting the Exhibit.      See 11 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's\n\nFederal Practice § 56.10 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) (\"Courts generally\n\naccept use of documents produced in discovery as proper summary\n\njudgment material; but, if such documents are not on file with\n\ncourt, they must be provided to the court.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f             We thus reject Hoffman's argument that Exhibit E was\n\nadmissible as, in essence, a \"chalk\" accurately summarizing the\n\nCompany's    own    employment    information.     See    United    States   v.\n\nPatrick, 248 F.3d 11, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).                Without having the\n\ndiscovery disclosures before it, the district court was in no\n\nposition to determine if Exhibit E properly reflected admissible\n\ndata.    A chalk \"must be fully supported in all respects by\n\ncorroborating admissible evidence.\"          United States v. Morse, 491\n\nF.2d 149, 153 n.6 (1st Cir. 1974), cited with approval in Patrick,\n\n248   F.3d   at    25.   Even    supposing   arguendo    such   corroborating\n\nevidence existed in the discovery documents, those documents were\n\nnot before the judge, and the judge had no duty to search for them\n\noutside the record in order to see if they contained proper\n\nsupporting data.\n\n             Hoffman is also wrong to rely on Carmona, in which we\n\nheld that documents supporting a motion for summary judgment could\n\nnot be considered because they had not been properly authenticated.\n\n215 F.3d at 131.         Focusing only on Carmona's statement that an\n\nauthenticating affidavit complying with Rule 56(e) is required\n\nunder summary judgment, id., Hoffman argues that he submitted a\n\n\"fully conforming Offer of Proof and Affidavit.\"                   Rule 56(e),\n\nhowever, as already noted, requires that the affidavit be made on\n\npersonal knowledge, set forth facts that would be admissible in\n\nevidence, and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\ftestify     to   the    matters   stated   therein.   Moreover,   \"sworn   or\n\ncertified copies of all papers\" referred to in the affidavit must\n\nbe attached.      Id.\n\n             Hoffman's affidavit opens with a general statement that\n\nthe affidavit is based on his personal knowledge, but he makes no\n\nmention of how he came to have personal knowledge of the facts\n\ncontained in Exhibit E, nor does he affirm in the affidavit that he\n\nwould be able to testify to the facts contained in Exhibit E at\n\ntrial.4      The chart he attached to his offer of proof is not\n\nauthenticated in any way, nor, as already discussed at length\n\nabove, did he identify the source of the facts and figures listed\n\n\n\n     4\n         Paragraph 11 of the affidavit focuses on Exhibit E:\n\n     While Defendants contend that they did not fire me\n     because of my age, it is clear that their stated reasons\n     for firing me are not true and are pretextual. Moreover,\n     Exhibit E attached hereto is powerful affirmative\n     evidence of age discrimination by Sevier, Robinov and\n     Paradigm....Exhibit    E   shows   that  Paradigm's   age\n     employment profile is skewed to the point where a\n     conclusion of age discrimination can clearly and cogently\n     be found. Buttressing this conclusion is the fact that\n     the sole Paradigm employee, except for Sevier, over 50,\n     Stephen   Fisk,    is   classified    as  a   Maintenance\n     Administrator, and is the practically irreplaceable\n     technician/engineer who takes care of Paradigm's\n     production machinery.    He should be exempted from any\n     general salaried employee list, just as have been the\n     Applicators' shareholders, one half of whom are retired.\n     If Mr. Fisk were excluded along with Sevier and now\n     Hoffman, Paradigm, would show -0- employees over 50 out\n     of 263 total and 28 salaried; while the balance of the\n     Company would show 12 over 50 out of 159 total and 55\n     salaried. Such a discrepancy is clear evidence of age\n     discrimination.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fin   the   chart    beyond   reference   to   Bates-numbered   pages   from\n\ndiscovery documents not attached to the chart.              No independent\n\nbasis for admitting the chart--such as that it was a business\n\nrecord of the companies, see, e.g., United States v. O'Connell, 890\n\nF.2d   563,    566-67    (1st     Cir.   1989)--and    no   authenticating\n\nfoundational information was provided.         The chart in Exhibit E was\n\nclearly not itself a business record, nor was it admissible under\n\nsome other evidentiary rule.\n\n            We hold, therefore, that the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in refusing to consider Exhibit E.\n\nC.   Age Discrimination Claim\n\n            As we uphold the exclusion of Exhibit E, we also uphold\n\nthe entry of summary judgment for defendants.               Under the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621\n\net seq., \"it is unlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to\n\nhire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate\n\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n\nconditions,    or    privileges     of   employment,   because   of    such\n\nindividual's age.\"      Id., § 623(a)(1).      In order to prevail in a\n\nlawsuit under the ADEA, the plaintiff's age must actually have\n\nplayed a role in the employer's decision-making process and have\n\nhad a determinative or motivating influence on the outcome.            See\n\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 141\n\n(2000).\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination,\n\n\"an ADEA claimant must adduce evidence that: (1) [he] was at least\n\nforty years of age; (2) [his] job performance met the employer's\n\nlegitimate expectations; (3) the employer subjected [him] to an\n\nadverse    employment      action      (e.g.,    an   actual    or    constructive\n\ndischarge); and (4) the employer had a continuing need for the\n\nservices provided by the position from which the claimant was\n\ndischarged.\"      Gonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    The prima facie showing creates a rebuttable presumption\n\nthat the defendant-employer violated the ADEA.                       Id. at 69-70.\n\nAfter the creation of such a presumption, the burden of production\n\nshifts to the defendant-employer to articulate \"a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment action.\" Id. at\n\n70.\n\n            If the employer is able to articulate a legitimate, non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason, the presumption afforded to the plaintiff's\n\nprima    facie   case     disappears,     and   the   plaintiff       must   \"adduce\n\nsufficient creditable evidence that age was a motivating factor in\n\nthe challenged employment action.\"              Id. at 69.     The plaintiff may\n\nmeet his burden of going forward by showing that the employer's\n\narticulated      reason    for   the    challenged     employment      action   was\n\npretextual, Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424,\n\n430 n.5 (1st Cir. 2000); the ultimate burden on the plaintiff is to\n\nshow that discrimination is the or a motivating factor, a showing\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fwhich may, but need not be, inferred, depending on the facts, from\n\nthe showing of pretext.          Fite v. Digital Equip. Corp., 232 F.3d 3,\n\n7 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Reeves).\n\n             The district court presumed that Hoffman had made out a\n\nprima    facie    case   of     age   discrimination        and    found     that   the\n\ndefendants had put forward a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis\n\nfor Hoffman's termination: his performance review and the missed\n\nproject deadline.        Having excluded Exhibit E as inadmissible, the\n\ncourt found that Hoffman had \"placed in the summary judgment record\n\nno   other   evidence     of    age   discrimination        or    of   any   age-based\n\nanimus.\"     The only facts even suggesting age discrimination were\n\nthat    Hoffman   was    over    forty    when   he   was    terminated       and   his\n\nreplacement was slightly under the age of forty.                       Offset against\n\nthis, however, was the fact that Hoffman was over fifty years old\n\nwhen he was initially hired.\n\n             Hoffman makes much of the fact that the district court\n\ncited Reeves for the proposition that a pretextual reason for\n\ntermination without other evidence of a motivation based on age-\n\nbias can be enough to defeat summary judgment.                   Reeves, 530 U.S. at\n\n147.    The Reeves Court wrote:\n\n       a plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient\n       evidence   to   find  that   the   employer's   asserted\n       justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to\n       conclude      that     the     employer     unlawfully\n       discriminated. . . . This is not to say that such a\n       showing by the plaintiff will always be adequate to\n       sustain a jury's finding of liability. Certainly there\n       will be instances where, although the plaintiff has\n\n                                         -17-\n\f       established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient\n       evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no\n       rational factfinder could conclude that the action was\n       discriminatory.\n\nId.    The district court wrote that \"[t]his case, where there is an\n\nabsence of any persuasive evidence of a motivation based on age-\n\nbias, is precisely that case which the Reeves Court excluded from\n\nits rule.\"    Later in the opinion, the court also wrote that \"[o]n\n\nthis   summary   judgment     record,       there    is   simply   no    admissible\n\nevidence countering the employer's termination reason, let alone\n\nany admissible evidence to believe Plaintiff's claim that any\n\nconsideration of age motivated his discharge.\"\n\n            Hoffman argues the district court found the defendants'\n\nproffered    reason   for    terminating       him     was    pretextual.         This\n\ncharacterization      is   not    easily     squared      with   the    court's   own\n\nstatement (\"The record is devoid of any credible evidence that\n\nDefendants'      employment       actions      were       a   pretext      for     age\n\ndiscrimination.\").     But in any event, pretext or no, we do not find\n\non de novo review sufficient evidence to support a finding that age\n\ndiscrimination was a factor motivating the termination.                     Hoffman\n\nargues that the evidence shows defendants' complaints about his\n\nwork    performance   were       \"blatant    fabrications.\"            However,   his\n\nperformance evaluation indicated that he struggled in some areas.\n\nImmediately before he was fired, he had missed a deadline for the\n\ncompletion of a project, a mistake in character with one of the\n\ncriticisms outlined on his performance evaluation.                      He himself,\n\n                                      -18-\n\fmoreover,   described   Sevier   as   an    irrationally   demanding   and\n\ndifficult manager to work with.       Evidence of their deteriorating\n\nrelationship suggests that bad feeling may have been another\n\ningredient in Sevier's decision to discharge him.          What is lacking\n\nis evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that age\n\ndiscrimination was also a factor.          We believe that regardless of\n\nwhether the defendants' stated reasons for termination could be\n\nfound to be pretextual, no factfinder could rationally conclude\n\nfrom the record before the district court that the termination--\n\nwhatever its precise motivation--was motivated by discrimination\n\nbased upon Hoffman's age.    Reeves, 540 U.S. at 147.\n\n                          III.   Conclusion\n\n            The district court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f",

(\"Applicators\") is a wholesale distributor that sells building products to professional contractors. Part of Applicators' business included manufacturing windows under a franchise agreement with a national company. At some point, Applicators decided to end its relationship with the franchisor in order to start a new venture with its own products. This new venture resulted in the creation of defendant Paradigm Window Solutions (\"Paradigm\"). Defendant Sevier is Paradigm's General Manager. A semi-autonomous division, Paradigm makes and distributes windows under its own name and for a private label.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before joining the defendants' company, Arnold Hoffman was employed for seven years by MBF Windows in Portland, Maine. He served as the head of MBF's Portland operation, performing a wide range of duties, and supervised one or two employees at any given time. Responding to an advertisement for an outside sales position at Applicators, Hoffman submitted his resume to the company in March or April of 2000. He interviewed first with defendants Robinov and Sevier and two other employees. They did not explain much about the position because Applicators had not yet announced plans to sever ties with its franchisor. About three weeks after the first interview, Hoffman was called in for a follow-up interview and offered the job, which would be with the new entity, Paradigm. He accepted and began work in May 2000. He was 54 or 55 years old when he began with the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sevier was Hoffman's supervisor throughout his employment at Paradigm. Hoffman viewed Sevier as an irrationally demanding supervisor, and the relationship between the two deteriorated over time. Hoffman testified in his deposition that Sevier \"was a very poor manager [who] . . . motivated by intimidation and negative . . . comments, not by positives and encouragement.\" He also wrote in a letter to Jerry Robinov, one of the founders of Applicators, that \"Most of the salesmen hate dealing with [Mr. Sevier] and will do everything they can to avoid him. . . . I am not the first employee to have experienced [Mr. Sevier's] wrath or his poor personnel management skills. I'm sure I won't be the last.\" He testified that \"it was a general consensus behind [Sevier's] back that people did not like him. They didn't like the way he treated them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman was very successful in sales, achieving a 56 percent sales increase in his last fiscal year of employment, an increase which the Company's Sales Manager, Steve Zerbinopolous, acknowledged as unmatched. His May, 2002 performance evaluation rated him as \"exceeds requirements\" (a score of 4 on a scale of 1-5) for problem solving, communication, initiative, and innovation and rated him as \"meets job requirements\" (a 3 on a scale of 1-5) for quantity of work, job knowledge, planning/organizing, adaptability, and cost consciousness. He was given a rating of \"needs improvement\" (a 2 on a scale of 1-5) in the categories of managing people, judgment, safety awareness, and leadership. He received a merit pay increase after that evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22-23, 2003, Hoffman underwent another annual performance review. In the written review, Sevier was critical of Hoffman's performance and declined to grant him a merit pay increase. Hoffman and Sevier agreed to meet on August 29, 2003 for a follow-up, at which time Hoffman's performance would be re-evaluated and a determination would be made about whether to increase Hoffman's salary. In the performance review, Hoffman received a rating of \"meets job requirements\" in problem solving, adaptability, dependability, communication, innovation, appearance, cost consciousness, and safety. He was given a rating of \"needs improvement\" in the categories job knowledge, judgment, leadership, and training. The overall rating stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are concerns with the manner in which you manage your territory and time. It appears as [though] you have not systematically scheduled to visit your accounts and you do not follow up with the requests made by your customers. You need to improve your presentation skills. You need to make dramatic improvement in these areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman sent Sevier a written rebuttal to his criticisms immediately following the May review. Sevier responded in writing to the rebuttal and reiterated his plan for the August review. Hoffman sent Sevier a second rebuttal on June 22, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about June 25, 2003, Hoffman and Sevier had a dispute about the status of a work-related project. Hoffman missed a deadline for the production of sell sheets for window products, and Sevier became impatient with Hoffman's attempts to explain the reason he missed the deadline. Hoffman argued that the sell sheets were substantially complete but for information that was to be supplied by Sevier and the inclusion of a few photos which, Hoffman claimed, Hoffman or a photographer \"could have taken in an afternoon.\" Sevier lost his temper with Hoffman, and, on June 27, 2003, the Company terminated Hoffman's employment. Scott Frazier, a long-time Company employee, assumed Hoffman's position about three months after Hoffman's termination. Frazier was less than forty years old at the time he was promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, reviewing the defendants' motion for summary judgment, assumed arguendo that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of employment discrimination. The court also found that the defendants had put forward a legitimate reason for his termination (the flawed 2003 performance review and the June 25, 2003 missing of a project deadline). Addressing next whether Hoffman had carried his burden to establish that the defendants' stated reason for termination was a pretext for age discrimination, the district court found that Hoffman had not introduced sufficient evidence to establish that it was such a pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman relied on what he called \"Exhibit E,\" attached to his Offer of Proof, a chart which purported to summarize the number of employees at Applicators and Paradigm and of those over the age of 50 at each division. The district court struck Exhibit E from the summary judgment record on the grounds that it was inadmissible because it was not properly authenticated and was based on data that had not been authenticated or presented in the summary judgment record. Further, the district court noted, the accuracy of the information in Exhibit E had not been sworn to under oath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that without Exhibit E, Hoffman had not placed in the record any evidence of age discrimination or age-based animus and held that no rational fact-finder could infer from the record as it existed an employment action based upon age discrimination. The court entered summary judgment for the defendants on the age discrimination claim and remanded the remaining two state claims to the Maine state court. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion &#8212; Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hoffman argues that the district court erred in striking Exhibit E and in ruling that Hoffman had introduced insufficient evidence of pretext and age-based motivation. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's decision to grant summary judgment. <i>Roldan-Plumey,</i> 115 F.3d at 61. However, we review the district court's decision to exclude an exhibit from evidence only for abuse of discretion. \"[P]rior to turning to its de novo summary judgment examination,\" the Court should review the district court's evidentiary rulings made as part of its decision on summary judgment for abuse of discretion. <i>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Schubert v. Nissan Motor Corp.,</i> 148 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.1998)). \"[A] trial court should have as much leeway in dealing with those [evidentiary] matters at the summary judgment stage as at trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"abuse of discretion\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">sounds worse than it really is. All it need mean is that, when judicial action is taken in a discretionary matter, such action cannot be set aside by a reviewing court unless it has a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Schubert,</i> 148 F.3d at 30 (quotation omitted).

Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 60 F.3d 867, 875 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

The Exhibit consists of a chart with attached explanatory notes purporting to list the total number of employees at Paradigm and Applicators and breaking down the number of salaried employees and the number of salaried employees over fifty years of age. A footnote states that some employees have been excluded from consideration in the calculations. Other footnotes to the chart indicate that the data therein is based on disclosures provided by the defendants in document discovery at pages D492 through D509. Exhibit E's preparer is not named, and the cited underlying pages of documentary discovery are neither attached to Exhibit E nor included elsewhere in exhibits or attachments filed by either party in connection with the summary judgment motion or opposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman does not deny in his appellate and reply briefs the district court's assertion, echoed by defendant appellees in their brief, that the discovery documents allegedly underpinning Exhibit E were not presented to the district court. Indeed, nothing in the docket below indicates the discovery documents referenced in Exhibit E had in any manner been filed with the court. Hence, to have located them, the court would have had to initiate a search going beyond any of the documents filed with the case. Only on appeal has Hoffman, for the first time, submitted several Bates-numbered pages from the defendants' discovery disclosures listing employees and their birthdates and dates of hire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman argues that, even though the supporting pages now tendered may not actually have been before the district court, they reflect data disclosed by the defendants themselves during discovery. Moreover, he asserts, the disclosures would be admissible at trial as business records. Therefore, Hoffman says, their authenticity cannot now be questioned and \"[t]his critical piece of evidence [i.e., Exhibit E] should have been considered by the District Court when considering Defendants' motion for summary judgment. . . regardless of what may appropriately be required for its admission into evidence at trial.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Hoffman overlooks the crucial point that documents do not automatically become a part of the record simply because they are the products of discovery. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (\"[s]worn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith\"); <i>In re Citric Acid Litig.,</i> 191 F.3d 1090, 1101-02 (9th Cir.1999) (\"The document on which [the plaintiff] relies for its market share figures was not submitted as part of the summary judgment record, and thus we do not consider it.\"). If a party wishes the court to consider matters disclosed during discovery, he must take appropriate steps to have them included in the record: merely citing to pages of discovery materials not of record does not suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, whatever argument Hoffman may have had for admission of Exhibit E as a \"chalk\" grounded on data found in defendant appellees' business records, required that the discovery documents containing such records be brought first before the court, by being placed in the summary judgment record. Where that was not done, the district court did not abuse its discretion in not seeking out the referenced documentation on its own and in rejecting the Exhibit. <i>See</i> 11 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 56.10 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) (\"Courts generally accept use of documents produced in discovery as proper summary judgment material; but, if such documents are not on file with court, they must be provided to the court.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus reject Hoffman's argument that Exhibit E was admissible as, in essence, a \"chalk\" accurately summarizing the Company's own employment information. <i>See United States v. Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d 11, 25 (1st Cir.2001). Without having the discovery disclosures before it, the district court was in no position to determine if Exhibit E properly reflected admissible data. A chalk \"must be fully supported in all respects by corroborating admissible evidence.\" <i>United States v. Morse,</i> 491 F.2d 149, 153 n. 6 (1st Cir.1974), <i>cited with approval in Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d at 25. Even supposing arguendo such corroborating evidence existed in the discovery documents, those documents were not before the judge, and the judge had no duty to search for them outside the record in order to see if they contained proper supporting data.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman is also wrong to rely on <i>Carmona,</i> in which we held that documents supporting a motion for summary judgment could not be considered because they had not been properly authenticated. 215 F.3d at 131. Focusing only on <i>Carmona's</i> statement that an authenticating affidavit complying with Rule 56(e) is required under summary judgment, <i>id.,</i> Hoffman argues that he submitted a \"fully conforming Offer of Proof and Affidavit.\" Rule 56(e), however, as already noted, requires that the affidavit be made on personal knowledge, set forth facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Moreover, \"sworn or certified copies of all papers\" referred to in the affidavit must be attached. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman's affidavit opens with a general statement that the affidavit is based on his personal knowledge, but he makes no mention of how he came to have personal knowledge of the facts contained in Exhibit E, nor does he affirm in the affidavit that he would be able to testify to the facts contained in Exhibit E at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The chart he attached to his offer of proof is not authenticated in any way, nor, as already discussed at length above, did he identify the source of the facts and figures listed in the chart beyond reference to Bates-numbered pages from discovery documents not attached to the chart. No independent basis for admitting the chart&#8212;such as that it was a business record of the companies, <i>see, e.g., United States v. O'Connell,</i> 890 F.2d 563, 566-67 (1st Cir.1989)&#8212;and no authenticating foundational information was provided. The chart in Exhibit E was clearly not itself a business record, nor was it admissible under some other evidentiary rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider Exhibit E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Age Discrimination Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we uphold the exclusion of Exhibit E, we also uphold the entry of summary judgment for defendants. Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 621 <i>et seq.,</i> \"it is unlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age.\" <i>Id.,</i> &#167; 623(a)(1). In order to prevail in a lawsuit under the ADEA, the plaintiff's age must actually have played a role in the employer's decision-making process and have had a determinative or motivating influence on the outcome. <i>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 141, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, \"an ADEA claimant must adduce evidence that: (1)[he] was at least forty years of age; (2)[his] job performance met the employer's legitimate expectations; (3) the employer subjected [him] to an adverse employment action (e.g., an actual or constructive discharge); and (4) the employer had a continuing need for the services provided by the position from which the claimant was discharged.\" <i>Gonzalez v. El Dia, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir.2002). The prima facie showing creates a rebuttable presumption that the defendant-employer violated the ADEA. <i>Id.</i> at 69-70. After the creation of such a presumption, the burden of production shifts to the defendant-employer to articulate \"a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the employer is able to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, the presumption afforded to the plaintiff's prima facie case disappears, and the plaintiff must \"adduce sufficient creditable evidence that age was a motivating factor in the challenged employment action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 69. The plaintiff may meet his burden of going forward by showing that the employer's articulated reason for the challenged employment action was pretextual, <i>Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc.,</i> 202 F.3d 424, 430 n. 5 (1st Cir.2000); the ultimate burden on the plaintiff is to show that discrimination is the or a motivating factor, a showing which may, but need not be, inferred, depending on the facts, from the showing of pretext. <i>Fite v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>Reeves</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court presumed that Hoffman had made out a prima facie case of age discrimination and found that the defendants had put forward a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for Hoffman's termination: his performance review and the missed project deadline. Having excluded Exhibit E as inadmissible, the court found that Hoffman had \"placed in the summary judgment record no other evidence of age discrimination or of any age-based animus.\" The only facts even suggesting age discrimination were that Hoffman was over forty when he was terminated and his replacement was slightly under the age of forty. Offset against this, however, was the fact that Hoffman was over fifty years old when he was initially hired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman makes much of the fact that the district court cited <i>Reeves</i> for the proposition that a pretextual reason for termination without other evidence of a motivation based on age-bias can be enough to defeat summary judgment. <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097. The <i>Reeves</i> Court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a plaintiff's <i>prima facie</i> case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated. . . . This is not to say that such a showing by the plaintiff will always be adequate to sustain a jury's finding of liability. Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> The district court wrote that \"[t]his case, where there is an absence of <i>any</i> persuasive evidence of a motivation based on age-bias, is precisely that case which the <i>Reeves</i> Court excluded from its rule.\" Later in the opinion, the court also wrote that \"[o]n this summary judgment record, there is simply no admissible evidence countering the employer's termination reason, let alone any admissible evidence to believe Plaintiff's claim that any consideration of age motivated his discharge.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman argues the district court found the defendants' proffered reason for terminating him was pretextual. This characterization is not easily squared with the court's own statement (\"The record is devoid of any credible evidence that Defendants' employment actions were a pretext for age discrimination.\"). But in any event, pretext or no, we do not find on de novo review sufficient evidence to support a finding that age discrimination was a factor motivating the termination. Hoffman argues that the evidence shows defendants' complaints about his work performance were \"blatant fabrications.\" However, his performance evaluation indicated that he struggled in some areas. Immediately before he was fired, he had missed a deadline for the completion of a project, a mistake in character with one of the criticisms outlined on his performance evaluation. He himself, moreover, described Sevier as an irrationally demanding and difficult manager to work with. Evidence of their deteriorating relationship suggests that bad feeling may have been another ingredient in Sevier's decision to discharge him. What is lacking is evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that age discrimination was also a factor. We believe that regardless of whether the defendants' stated reasons for termination could be found to be pretextual, no factfinder could rationally conclude from the record before the district court that the termination&#8212; whatever its precise motivation&#8212;was motivated by discrimination based upon Hoffman's age. <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Sometime after the deadline set by the district court for designating expert witnesses, Hoffman designated an expert, and the Company moved to strike the designation. The court granted the Company's motion to strike, a ruling from which Hoffman now appeals. Because, however, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to defendants, we need not review the status of Hoffman's witness designation. Even if the court erred on the witness designation, the summary judgment would still stand</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendants have moved to strike the pages tendered on appeal on the ground that they were not submitted to the district court. We denied the motion without prejudice to reconsideration at the time we resolved this appeal. We now allow the motion as the pages have not been shown to have been a part of the record below<i>See infra</i> p. 15.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Hoffman points to language in<i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), in which the Supreme Court stated,</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[w]e do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment. Obviously, Rule 56 does not require a nonmoving party to depose her own witnesses. Rule 56(e) permits a proper summary judgment motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves, and it is from this list that one would normally expect the nonmoving party to make the showing to which we have referred.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In context, however, the quotation addresses the specific point in <i>Celotex</i> that a nonmoving party who bore the burden of proof on a dispositive issue could rely on her own affidavits and the \"depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions <i>on file</i>\" without having to depose her own witnesses. <i>Id.</i> (quoting Rule 56(c))(emphasis supplied). The reference is not availing for Hoffman here when the issue is the court's refusal to accept a chalk supported only by discovery disclosures that were never \"on file\" with the district court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Paragraph 11 of the affidavit focuses on Exhibit E:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">While Defendants contend that they did not fire me because of my age, it is clear that their stated reasons for firing me are not true and are pretextual. Moreover, Exhibit E attached hereto is powerful affirmative evidence of age discrimination by Sevier, Robinov and Paradigm. . . . Exhibit E shows that Paradigm's age employment profile is skewed to the point where a conclusion of age discrimination can clearly and cogently be found. Buttressing this conclusion is the fact that the sole Paradigm employee, except for Sevier, over 50, Stephen Fisk, is classified as a Maintenance Administrator, and is the practically irreplaceable technician/engineer who takes care of Paradigm's production machinery. He should be exempted from any general salaried employee list, just as have been the Applicators' shareholders, one half of whom are retired. If Mr. Fisk were excluded along with Sevier and now Hoffman, Paradigm, would show -0-employees over 50 out of 263 total and 28 salaried; while the balance of the Company would show 12 over 50 out of 159 total and 55 salaried. Such a discrepancy is clear evidence of age discrimination.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Discovery took place in the form of requests for documents, depositions, and interrogatories, following which the defendants moved for summary judgment. The court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the company on Count 1 for age discrimination and remanded the remaining claims to the state court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We view the record on summary judgment in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <i>See Santiago-Ramos v.

(\"Applicators\") is a wholesale distributor that sells building products to professional contractors. Part of Applicators' business included manufacturing windows under a franchise agreement with a national company. At some point, Applicators decided to end its relationship with the franchisor in order to start a new venture with its own products. This new venture resulted in the creation of defendant Paradigm Window Solutions (\"Paradigm\"). Defendant Sevier is Paradigm's General Manager. A semi-autonomous division, Paradigm makes and distributes windows under its own name and for a private label.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before joining the defendants' company, Arnold Hoffman was employed for seven years by MBF Windows in Portland, Maine. He served as the head of MBF's Portland operation, performing a wide range of duties, and supervised one or two employees at any given time. Responding to an advertisement for an outside sales position at Applicators, Hoffman submitted his resume to the company in March or April of 2000. He interviewed first with defendants Robinov and Sevier and two other employees. They did not explain much about the position because Applicators had not yet announced plans to sever ties with its franchisor. About three weeks after the first interview, Hoffman was called in for a follow-up interview and offered the job, which would be with the new entity, Paradigm. He accepted and began work in May 2000. He was 54 or 55 years old when he began with the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sevier was Hoffman's supervisor throughout his employment at Paradigm. Hoffman viewed Sevier as an irrationally demanding supervisor, and the relationship between the two deteriorated over time. Hoffman testified in his deposition that Sevier \"was a very poor manager [who] . . . motivated by intimidation and negative . . . comments, not by positives and encouragement.\" He also wrote in a letter to Jerry Robinov, one of the founders of Applicators, that \"Most of the salesmen hate dealing with [Mr. Sevier] and will do everything they can to avoid him. . . . I am not the first employee to have experienced [Mr. Sevier's] wrath or his poor personnel management skills. I'm sure I won't be the last.\" He testified that \"it was a general consensus behind [Sevier's] back that people did not like him. They didn't like the way he treated them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman was very successful in sales, achieving a 56 percent sales increase in his last fiscal year of employment, an increase which the Company's Sales Manager, Steve Zerbinopolous, acknowledged as unmatched. His May, 2002 performance evaluation rated him as \"exceeds requirements\" (a score of 4 on a scale of 1-5) for problem solving, communication, initiative, and innovation and rated him as \"meets job requirements\" (a 3 on a scale of 1-5) for quantity of work, job knowledge, planning/organizing, adaptability, and cost consciousness. He was given a rating of \"needs improvement\" (a 2 on a scale of 1-5) in the categories of managing people, judgment, safety awareness, and leadership. He received a merit pay increase after that evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22-23, 2003, Hoffman underwent another annual performance review. In the written review, Sevier was critical of Hoffman's performance and declined to grant him a merit pay increase. Hoffman and Sevier agreed to meet on August 29, 2003 for a follow-up, at which time Hoffman's performance would be re-evaluated and a determination would be made about whether to increase Hoffman's salary. In the performance review, Hoffman received a rating of \"meets job requirements\" in problem solving, adaptability, dependability, communication, innovation, appearance, cost consciousness, and safety. He was given a rating of \"needs improvement\" in the categories job knowledge, judgment, leadership, and training. The overall rating stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are concerns with the manner in which you manage your territory and time. It appears as [though] you have not systematically scheduled to visit your accounts and you do not follow up with the requests made by your customers. You need to improve your presentation skills. You need to make dramatic improvement in these areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman sent Sevier a written rebuttal to his criticisms immediately following the May review. Sevier responded in writing to the rebuttal and reiterated his plan for the August review. Hoffman sent Sevier a second rebuttal on June 22, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about June 25, 2003, Hoffman and Sevier had a dispute about the status of a work-related project. Hoffman missed a deadline for the production of sell sheets for window products, and Sevier became impatient with Hoffman's attempts to explain the reason he missed the deadline. Hoffman argued that the sell sheets were substantially complete but for information that was to be supplied by Sevier and the inclusion of a few photos which, Hoffman claimed, Hoffman or a photographer \"could have taken in an afternoon.\" Sevier lost his temper with Hoffman, and, on June 27, 2003, the Company terminated Hoffman's employment. Scott Frazier, a long-time Company employee, assumed Hoffman's position about three months after Hoffman's termination. Frazier was less than forty years old at the time he was promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, reviewing the defendants' motion for summary judgment, assumed arguendo that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of employment discrimination. The court also found that the defendants had put forward a legitimate reason for his termination (the flawed 2003 performance review and the June 25, 2003 missing of a project deadline). Addressing next whether Hoffman had carried his burden to establish that the defendants' stated reason for termination was a pretext for age discrimination, the district court found that Hoffman had not introduced sufficient evidence to establish that it was such a pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman relied on what he called \"Exhibit E,\" attached to his Offer of Proof, a chart which purported to summarize the number of employees at Applicators and Paradigm and of those over the age of 50 at each division. The district court struck Exhibit E from the summary judgment record on the grounds that it was inadmissible because it was not properly authenticated and was based on data that had not been authenticated or presented in the summary judgment record. Further, the district court noted, the accuracy of the information in Exhibit E had not been sworn to under oath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that without Exhibit E, Hoffman had not placed in the record any evidence of age discrimination or age-based animus and held that no rational fact-finder could infer from the record as it existed an employment action based upon age discrimination.

The Exhibit consists of a chart with attached explanatory notes purporting to list the total number of employees at Paradigm and Applicators and breaking down the number of salaried employees and the number of salaried employees over fifty years of age. A footnote states that some employees have been excluded from consideration in the calculations. Other footnotes to the chart indicate that the data therein is based on disclosures provided by the defendants in document discovery at pages D492 through D509. Exhibit E's preparer is not named, and the cited underlying pages of documentary discovery are neither attached to Exhibit E nor included elsewhere in exhibits or attachments filed by either party in connection with the summary judgment motion or opposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman does not deny in his appellate and reply briefs the district court's assertion, echoed by defendant appellees in their brief, that the discovery documents allegedly underpinning Exhibit E were not presented to the district court. Indeed, nothing in the docket below indicates the discovery documents referenced in Exhibit E had in any manner been filed with the court. Hence, to have located them, the court would have had to initiate a search going beyond any of the documents filed with the case. Only on appeal has Hoffman, for the first time, submitted several Bates-numbered pages from the defendants' discovery disclosures listing employees and their birthdates and dates of hire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman argues that, even though the supporting pages now tendered may not actually have been before the district court, they reflect data disclosed by the defendants themselves during discovery. Moreover, he asserts, the disclosures would be admissible at trial as business records. Therefore, Hoffman says, their authenticity cannot now be questioned and \"[t]his critical piece of evidence [i.e., Exhibit E] should have been considered by the District Court when considering Defendants' motion for summary judgment. . . regardless of what may appropriately be required for its admission into evidence at trial.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Hoffman overlooks the crucial point that documents do not automatically become a part of the record simply because they are the products of discovery. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (\"[s]worn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith\"); <i>In re Citric Acid Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766195\"><a href=\"/opinion/766195/in-re-citric-acid-litigation-7-up-bottling-coof-jasper-inc-and-varni/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span>, 1101-02 (9th Cir.1999) (\"The document on which [the plaintiff] relies for its market share figures was not submitted as part of the summary judgment record, and thus we do not consider it.\"). If a party wishes the court to consider matters disclosed during discovery, he must take appropriate steps to have them included in the record: merely citing to pages of discovery materials not of record does not suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, whatever argument Hoffman may have had for admission of Exhibit E as a \"chalk\" grounded on data found in defendant appellees' business records, required that the discovery documents containing such records be brought first before the court, by being placed in the summary judgment record. Where that was not done, the district court did not abuse its discretion in not seeking out the referenced documentation on its own and in rejecting the Exhibit. <i>See</i> 11 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 56.10 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) (\"Courts generally accept use of documents produced in discovery as proper summary judgment material; but, if such documents are not on file with court, they must be provided to the court.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus reject Hoffman's argument that Exhibit E was admissible as, in essence, a \"chalk\" accurately summarizing the Company's own employment information. <i>See United States v.

Focusing only on <i>Carmona's</i> statement that an authenticating affidavit complying with Rule 56(e) is required under summary judgment, <i>id.,</i> Hoffman argues that he submitted a \"fully conforming Offer of Proof and Affidavit.\" Rule 56(e), however, as already noted, requires that the affidavit be made on personal knowledge, set forth facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Moreover, \"sworn or certified copies of all papers\" referred to in the affidavit must be attached. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman's affidavit opens with a general statement that the affidavit is based on his personal knowledge, but he makes no mention of how he came to have personal knowledge of the facts contained in Exhibit E, nor does he affirm in the affidavit that he would be able to testify to the facts contained in Exhibit E at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The chart he attached to his offer of proof is not authenticated in any way, nor, as already discussed at length above, did he identify the source of the facts and figures listed in the chart beyond reference to Bates-numbered pages from discovery documents not attached to the chart. No independent basis for admitting the chart&#8212;such as that it was a business record of the companies, <i>see, e.g., United States v.

In order to prevail in a lawsuit under the ADEA, the plaintiff's age must actually have played a role in the employer's decision-making process and have had a determinative or motivating influence on the outcome. <i>See Reeves v.

Having excluded Exhibit E as inadmissible, the court found that Hoffman had \"placed in the summary judgment record no other evidence of age discrimination or of any age-based animus.\" The only facts even suggesting age discrimination were that Hoffman was over forty when he was terminated and his replacement was slightly under the age of forty. Offset against this, however, was the fact that Hoffman was over fifty years old when he was initially hired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman makes much of the fact that the district court cited <i>Reeves</i> for the proposition that a pretextual reason for termination without other evidence of a motivation based on age-bias can be enough to defeat summary judgment. <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is not to say that such a showing by the plaintiff will always be adequate to sustain a jury's finding of liability. Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> The district court wrote that \"[t]his case, where there is an absence of <i>any</i> persuasive evidence of a motivation based on age-bias, is precisely that case which the <i>Reeves</i> Court excluded from its rule.\" Later in the opinion, the court also wrote that \"[o]n this summary judgment record, there is simply no admissible evidence countering the employer's termination reason, let alone any admissible evidence to believe Plaintiff's claim that any consideration of age motivated his discharge.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoffman argues the district court found the defendants' proffered reason for terminating him was pretextual. This characterization is not easily squared with the court's own statement (\"The record is devoid of any credible evidence that Defendants' employment actions were a pretext for age discrimination.\"). But in any event, pretext or no, we do not find on de novo review sufficient evidence to support a finding that age discrimination was a factor motivating the termination. Hoffman argues that the evidence shows defendants' complaints about his work performance were \"blatant fabrications.\" However, his performance evaluation indicated that he struggled in some areas. Immediately before he was fired, he had missed a deadline for the completion of a project, a mistake in character with one of the criticisms outlined on his performance evaluation. He himself, moreover, described Sevier as an irrationally demanding and difficult manager to work with. Evidence of their deteriorating relationship suggests that bad feeling may have been another ingredient in Sevier's decision to discharge him. What is lacking is evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that age discrimination was also a factor. We believe that regardless of whether the defendants' stated reasons for termination could be found to be pretextual, no factfinder could rationally conclude from the record before the district court that the termination&#8212; whatever its precise motivation&#8212;was motivated by discrimination based upon Hoffman's age. <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rule 56(e) permits a proper summary judgment motion to be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves, and it is from this list that one would normally expect the nonmoving party to make the showing to which we have referred.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In context, however, the quotation addresses the specific point in <i>Celotex</i> that a nonmoving party who bore the burden of proof on a dispositive issue could rely on her own affidavits and the \"depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions <i>on file</i>\" without having to depose her own witnesses. <i>Id.</i> (quoting Rule 56(c))(emphasis supplied).

Moreover, Exhibit E attached hereto is powerful affirmative evidence of age discrimination by Sevier, Robinov and Paradigm. . . . Exhibit E shows that Paradigm's age employment profile is skewed to the point where a conclusion of age discrimination can clearly and cogently be found. Buttressing this conclusion is the fact that the sole Paradigm employee, except for Sevier, over 50, Stephen Fisk, is classified as a Maintenance Administrator, and is the practically irreplaceable technician/engineer who takes care of Paradigm's production machinery. He should be exempted from any general salaried employee list, just as have been the Applicators' shareholders, one half of whom are retired. If Mr. Fisk were excluded along with Sevier and now Hoffman, Paradigm, would show -0-employees over 50 out of 263 total and 28 salaried; while the balance of the Company would show 12 over 50 out of 159 total and 55 salaried.
