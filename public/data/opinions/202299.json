Garcia, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 3, 2006\n\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f          Per Curiam.   Pedro Sierra and Bruno Montenegro appeal\n\nfrom the sentences they received after their pleas of guilty to\n\nconspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute.     Their\n\nappeals have been consolidated for our review.\n\n          Sierra and Montenegro, along with four other men, were\n\naboard a fishing vessel that had sailed from the country of\n\nColombia in October 2003, heading for Puerto Rico.   The vessel was\n\napprehended by the United States Coast Guard off the southern shore\n\nof Puerto Rico.    The Coast Guard retrieved 654 kilograms of\n\nmarijuana that had been dumped into the sea from the vessel when\n\nthe crew realized it had been detected.     Sierra and Montenegro\n\nentered into identical plea agreements with the government.      The\n\nagreements specified a base offense level of 28 under the federal\n\nSentencing Guidelines and called for downward adjustments for\n\nacceptance of responsibility and compliance with the \"safety valve\"\n\nprovision.   The agreements went on to declare that no other\n\nadjustments would apply, but reserved to the defendants the right\n\nto argue at the sentencing hearing for a downward adjustment based\n\non USSG § 3B1.2, which allows a decrease in the offense level of a\n\ndefendant who played a minor or minimal role in the offense.    Both\n\ndefendants were sentenced on March 15, 2005, at separate hearings,\n\nto terms of 46 months in prison.\n\n          Each appeal raises a single issue: whether the district\n\ncourt violated Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B) by failing to rule\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fexplicitly on whether the defendant qualified for a downward\n\nadjustment based on his role in the offense.      The pertinent facts\n\nconcerning sentencing, however, are different for each of the\n\ndefendants.\n\n           Rule 32(i)(3)(B) requires that a court, at sentencing,\n\n\"must — for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other\n\ncontroverted matter — rule on the dispute or determine that a\n\nruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect\n\nsentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in\n\nsentencing.\"   Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B).\n\n           Appellant   Sierra   contends   that   the   district   court\n\nviolated this rule by not making an explicit ruling as to whether\n\nSierra was entitled to a downward adjustment for his role in the\n\noffense.   However, while Sierra reserved the right in his plea\n\nagreement to argue the role-in-the-offense question, he did not\n\ninvoke that right or even mention the issue at his sentencing\n\nhearing.   This means both that there was no \"controverted matter\"\n\nthat the judge would have been required by Rule 32(i)(3)(B) to\n\ndecide and that Sierra forfeited the argument below.        A district\n\ncourt has no obligation to raise a role-in-the-offense question of\n\nits own initiative, the more so since a defendant bears the burden\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fof proving his or her entitlement to a downward adjustment.                       See\n\nUnited States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir. 1990).1\n\n            Defendant Montenegro, in contrast, did argue at his\n\nsentencing   hearing     that    he   played    only   a   minor     role    in   the\n\nmarijuana    transport    and    that    he    was   entitled   to    a     downward\n\nadjustment accordingly.         In response, the government argued that\n\nMontenegro's role was not minor, but that he was in fact fully\n\nculpable and thus did not qualify for the downward adjustment. The\n\ndistrict court imposed sentence on Montenegro without explicitly\n\nruling on whether or not he was entitled to the adjustment, stating\n\nsimply, \"The Court has considered all the applicable adjustments\n\nunder the new advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\"                    The court\n\nsentenced Montenegro to 46 months in prison, which was the sentence\n\nspecified in the plea agreement under the parties' assumption that\n\nMontenegro     would   qualify    for    downward      adjustments        based   on\n\nacceptance of responsibility and \"safety valve\" but no other\n\nadjustments.     After the court pronounced the sentence, defense\n\ncounsel did not object to the court's failure to explicitly resolve\n\nthe role-in-the offense question.\n\n            Because no timely objection was made, we review the\n\ndistrict court's action for plain error.                See United States v.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The government argues that the waiver of appeal rights\ncontained in Sierra's plea agreement should act to bar the present\nappeal. Because the appeal lacks merit in any event, we need not\nreach the waiver question.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fMastera, 435 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2006).                  None exists here.\n\nMontenegro's reliance on Rule 32 is misplaced. The rule exists \"to\n\nassure reliability\" of the facts germane to sentencing, United\n\nStates v. Johnson, 445 F.3d 339, 344 (4th Cir. 2006), and applies\n\nif there is a relevant factual dispute or if the defendant has\n\nobjected to a portion of the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report\n\n(PSR).    See, e.g., United States v. McCants, 434 F.3d 557, 561-62\n\n(D.C.    Cir    2006)   (obligations    of   Rule    32   applied   where    \"key\n\nelements\"       of   the   PSR's   sentencing       calculations    relied     on\n\n\"contentious\" factual assumptions); United States v. Darwich, 337\n\nF.3d 645, 666-67 (6th Cir. 2003) (obligations of Rule 32 applied\n\nwhere PSR took a stance on defendant's leadership role in the\n\noffense and defendant disputed that stance in objections to the\n\nPSR).    Here, Montenegro raised no objections to the PSR and there\n\nwas no pertinent factual dispute.              In any event, the court's\n\nimposition of the 46-month sentence contemplated by the plea\n\nagreement suggests a rejection of Montenegro's request for a\n\ndownward adjustment not accounted for in the plea agreement's\n\ncalculation.\n\n               The sentences of appellants Sierra and Montenegro are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f",
