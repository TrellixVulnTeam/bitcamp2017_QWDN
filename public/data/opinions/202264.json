Justo Arenas, Chief Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n                  Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                 and Bowman,* Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Héctor M.

Freeman, with whom Alexandra Rivera-Saez and O'Neill\n& Borges were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                           June 14, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.        Esso Standard Oil Company brought\n\nsuit under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,\n\nand Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), and the Resource Conservation and\n\nRecovery Act (\"RCRA\") against Carlos Rodríguez-Pérez, his wife\n\nCarmen Ortiz-Lopez, and their conjugal partnership; and Carlos M.\n\nBelgodere-Pamies,     his   wife    Janet     Roe,     and   their   conjugal\n\npartnership (collectively, \"Defendants\").            The defendants filed\n\nstate law counterclaims.      The parties consented to proceed before\n\na U.S. magistrate judge. On summary judgment, the magistrate judge\n\ndismissed those counterclaims with prejudice.\n\n          Subsequently,      with   Esso's    claims     still pending, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court decided Cooper Industries, Inc. v.\n\nAviall Services, Inc., 543 U.S. 157 (2004).          There, the Court held\n\nthat a CERCLA contribution claim, similar to the one asserted in\n\nthis case by ESSO, was subject to certain statutory requirements.\n\nThere is no dispute that Esso did not meet these requirements and,\n\ntherefore,    could   not   maintain    its   CERCLA    claim   against   the\n\ndefendants.     The magistrate judge dismissed the CERCLA claim\n\naccordingly.\n\n          The   defendants    now   challenge    the    magistrate   judge's\n\ndismissal of their state law counterclaims, claiming that, in the\n\naftermath of Cooper Industries, there was never subject matter\n\njurisdiction over them.      We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                                  I.\n\nA.   Factual Background\n\n           Esso    primarily   sought   two   forms   of   relief:   (1)\n\ncontribution under § 113(f) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f); and (2)\n\ninjunctive relief under § 7002(a)(1)(B) of the Solid Waste Disposal\n\nAct, as amended by RCRA, 42 U.S.C. § 6972, for the response costs\n\nthat Esso incurred in remedying environmental contamination at a\n\ngasoline service station located in La Vega Ward, Barranquitas,\n\nPuerto Rico (the \"Station\").    Operated as a retail service station\n\nfrom the mid-1930's until August 1998 when it was closed, the\n\nStation sold gasoline, diesel fuel, automobile parts, and motor\n\noil.    The Station's operators performed oil changes, greasing\n\noperations, used battery recharging and replacement, mechanical\n\nwork, and the washing of vehicles on the premises.            In 1971,\n\nRodriguez took over control of the Station's day-to-day operations\n\nfrom his father.    In 1979, Rodriguez leased the station from José\n\nDomingo Pagán-Pagán.    Rodriguez managed and controlled the Station\n\nfrom 1979 until its closure in August 1998.\n\n           There was significant disposal of hazardous substances on\n\nthe premises during the Station's operation under Rodriguez's\n\nmanagement. Motor oil drained from automobiles was allowed to flow\n\ninto the Piñones River, a body of water located behind the station.\n\nSimilarly, used oil filters were found buried in large quantities\n\nin the northern part of the Station.      Gasoline and diesel used to\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fflush dirt and grease from vehicles were rinsed           onto the ground\n\nand into the river using a pressure hose.               As a result, the\n\npremises became contaminated with a number of hazardous substances\n\nincluding   lead,   chromium,   benzene,   ethylbenzene,    toluene,      and\n\nxylene.\n\n            Belgodere began his involvement at the station in 1993.\n\nIn 1994, he conducted reviews of soil conditions and inventory\n\nrecords   in   connection   with   a   prior   civil   action   brought   by\n\nRodriguez against Esso.     In 1995, Belgodere entered into a formal\n\nagreement with Rodriguez to act as the latter's environmental\n\nconsultant and expert witness.\n\n            Under CERCLA, Esso sought contribution from Defendants\n\nfor the cost of cleaning up the hazardous substances on the\n\npremises of the Station.        Under RCRA, Esso sought an injunction\n\nordering Defendants, among other things, \"to investigate, abate and\n\nremediate any endangerment posed by the environmental conditions\"\n\nat the Station.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n            The proceedings, as they are relevant to this appeal,\n\nunfolded as follows:\n\n-- After Esso filed its Second Amended Complaint, Defendants filed\n\ncounterclaims grounded in state law claiming: (1) lost income; (2)\n\nlost future income; (3) lost gasoline; (4) slander; (5) attorney's\n\nfees; (6) mental anguish; and (7) injunctive relief.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f -- Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of\n\nliability for contribution under CERCLA.               Esso also moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the state law counterclaims.\n\n-- The magistrate judge issued an opinion and order on the pending\n\nsummary judgment motions.         The magistrate judge granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Esso on Defendants' counterclaims, concluding\n\nthat the state law counterclaims were time-barred.             The magistrate\n\njudge also ruled in favor of Esso on the CERCLA liability claim.\n\n -- Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, requesting the\n\nmagistrate judge to reconsider his summary judgment decision.\n\n-- While the reconsideration motion was pending, Esso submitted an\n\ninformative motion advising the magistrate judge of the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Cooper Industries.               As a result of Cooper\n\nIndustries, Esso could not maintain its contribution claim pursuant\n\nto § 113(f)(1) of CERCLA.\n\n  --   The    magistrate       judge    denied     Defendants'   motion    for\n\nreconsideration.      The magistrate judge contemporaneously issued:\n\n(1) a partial final judgment dismissing Defendants' counterclaims\n\nwith prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (which permits a\n\ndistrict court to enter final judgments as to one or more but fewer\n\nthan   all   claims   in   a   case    involving    multiple   claims   and/or\n\nparties); and (2) an order requesting Esso to show cause as to the\n\neffect of Cooper Industries on its CERCLA claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f --     In response to the magistrate judge's request to show cause,\n\nEsso moved for voluntary dismissal without prejudice of both its\n\nCERCLA and RCRA claims.\n\n  -- The magistrate judge entered an opinion and order dismissing\n\nEsso's CERCLA claim with prejudice, based on the Cooper Industries\n\ndecision.      The court also dismissed Esso's RCRA claim without\n\nprejudice.\n\n  -- Defendants filed a motion to vacate judgment under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(4) and 41(a)(2).         Rule 60(b)(4) permits a district\n\ncourt    to   relieve   a   party   from    a   final   judgment,   order,   or\n\nproceeding if the judgement is void.            Rule 41(a)(2) establishes a\n\nframework for district courts to enter voluntary dismissals.\n\n  -- Esso filed a motion to amend or alter judgment pursuant to\n\nRule 59(e), requesting that the dismissal of its CERCLA claim be\n\nwithout prejudice.      Esso argued that because its CERCLA claim was\n\na contribution claim, the claim's dismissal should be without\n\nprejudice in order to avoid res judicata and allow Esso to renew\n\nthe contribution claim on grounds other than § 113(f)(1) of CERCLA.\n\n -- The magistrate judge issued a final order and opinion denying\n\nDefendants' motion to vacate judgment.                  The magistrate judge\n\nexplained that while there never was subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover Esso's CERCLA claim, there was jurisdiction over the case at\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fall times because of Esso's RCRA claim.1          Therefore, it had\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Defendants' state counterclaims when\n\nit ruled that those claims were time-barred.\n\n -- In its final amended judgment, the magistrate judge, persuaded\n\nby the reasoning in Esso's motion to alter or amend judgment,\n\ndismissed without prejudice both Esso's CERCLA and RCRA claims.\n\nPreviously, he had dismissed the CERCLA claim with prejudice.\n\nC.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review a district court's ultimate conclusion on the\n\nexistence vel non of subject matter jurisdiction de novo because it\n\nis a question of law.     Skwira v. United States, 344 F.3d 64, 72\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (citing Valentín v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d\n\n358, 365 (1st Cir. 2001)).     Review of a decision made pursuant to\n\nRule 60(b)(4) is also de novo.      M & K Welding, Inc. v. Leasing\n\nPartners, LLC, 386 F.3d 361, 365 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Although orders\n\non some Rule 60(b) motions, such as those asserting mistake or\n\nexcusable    neglect   under   subsection   (b)(1),   ordinarily   are\n\nreviewable only for abuse of discretion, a decision whether or not\n\na judgment is void under 60(b)(4) allows no room for discretion.\n\nThe review is de novo.\").\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       We are not called upon to decide whether the CERCLA claim\nshould have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), as the magistrate judge ruled, or\nfor failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                                 II.\n\nA.   Cooper Industries\n\n           There is no dispute that Esso's CERCLA claim was not\n\nproperly before the magistrate judge.     In Cooper Industries, the\n\nSupreme Court clarified the circumstances under which a private\n\nparty may seek contribution under § 113(f)(1) of CERCLA.    Section\n\n113(f)(1), pursuant to which Esso brought its contribution claim\n\nagainst Defendants, \"allows persons who have undertaken efforts to\n\nclean up properties contaminated by hazardous substances to seek\n\ncontribution from other parties liable under CERCLA.\"        Cooper\n\nIndus., 543 U.S. at 160.   Section 113(f)(1) further specifies that\n\na party may obtain contribution \"during or following any civil\n\naction\" under CERCLA § 106 or § 107(a).\n\n           The issue the Court decided was \"whether a private party\n\nwho has not been sued under § 106 or § 107(a) [of CERCLA] may\n\nnevertheless obtain contribution under § 113(f)(1) from other\n\nliable parties.\"   543 U.S. at 160-61.   The Court held that such a\n\nparty may not.   Id. at 161.   Because, like the plaintiff in Cooper\n\nIndustries, Esso had not been sued under § 106 or § 107(a) of\n\nCERCLA, it could not maintain its § 113(f)(1) CERCLA claim and the\n\nmagistrate judge properly dismissed it.\n\nB.   Esso's RCRA claim\n\n           Defendants argue that Esso's RCRA claim, like its CERCLA\n\nclaim, was not properly before the magistrate judge.    As a result,\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fbecause there was no pending question of federal law, there was no\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Defendants' state law counterclaims,\n\nand they could not have been dismissed with prejudice.               See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1367(a) (\"[I]n any civil action of which the district\n\ncourts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related\n\nto claims in the action . . . that they form part of the same case\n\nor controversy under Article III.\"); BIW Deceived v. Local S6,\n\nIndus. Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of Am., 132 F.3d\n\n824, 833 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"A federal court that exercises federal\n\nquestion   jurisdiction    over   a    single   claim   may   also   assert\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over all state-law claims that arise from\n\nthe same nucleus of operative facts.\").\n\n           Defendants     base    their     argument     on    42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 6972(b)(1)(B), which details one of the limitations on filing a\n\ncitizen suit2 pursuant to RCRA.        It states that a citizen suit may\n\nnot be commenced \"if the Administrator or State has commenced and\n\nis diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action in a court of\n\nthe United States or a State to require compliance with such\n\npermit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, prohibition,\n\n\n     2\n        A citizen suit is \"[a]n action under a statute giving\ncitizens the right to sue violators of the law . . . and to seek\ninjunctive relief and penalties.\" Black's Law Dictionary, 8th ed.\n(2004). Typically, citizen suits, where they exist, function as a\nform of statutory enforcement in addition to, or in conjunction\nwith, enforcement by an administrative agency or other governmental\nentity.\n\n                                      -9-\n\for order.\"      However, the plain language of the statute undermines\n\nDefendants' position.          While it is true that the Puerto Rico\n\nEnvironmental Quality Board is prosecuting an administrative case\n\ninvolving the Station, the statutory provision precludes a citizen\n\nsuit under RCRA only if the suit is \"a civil or criminal action in\n\na court of the United States or a State.\"                   An administrative\n\nproceeding does not take place in a \"court of the United States or\n\na State.\" The RCRA claim was properly before the magistrate judge,\n\nand    there    was   supplemental     jurisdiction   over     the   state   law\n\ncounterclaims.\n\nC.    Abstention\n\n               Defendants also assert that the magistrate judge should\n\nhave   abstained      from   hearing    and   determining    their   state   law\n\ncounterclaims.        Defendants raised this argument for the first time\n\non March 14, 2005 in a reply to an opposition to one of their\n\nmotions for reconsideration.           This demand for abstention came more\n\nthan three-and-a-half years after Esso's RCRA claim was first filed\n\nin district court, and, more importantly, after Defendants had\n\nlitigated the state law counterclaims on the merits, culminating in\n\nthe    magistrate       judge's   summary      judgment     ruling   on   those\n\ncounterclaims.        Defendants did not raise their abstention argument\n\nin a timely fashion, and we will not entertain it here.                      See\n\nMarshall v. Marshall, 126 S.Ct. 1735, 1746 n.3 (2006) (upholding a\n\nbankruptcy court's decision to reject a motion for mandatory\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fabstention as untimely because the motion was filed eight months\n\nafter adversary proceeding had begun).\n\nD.    The merits\n\n              In their appellate reply brief, Defendants invite us to\n\nreview the merits of the magistrate judge's summary judgment\n\ndecision on their state law counterclaims. Defendants contend that\n\nthe    magistrate    judge    was   in   error   because    their   state     law\n\ncounterclaims were not time-barred.              In the proceedings below,\n\nDefendants challenged the magistrate judge's dismissal of their\n\nstate law counterclaims solely on jurisdictional grounds; they did\n\nnot challenge the merits of the magistrate judge's decision. We do\n\nnot address any of these merits arguments because they were not\n\nproperly raised by Defendants before the magistrate judge.                    See\n\nBoston Beer Co. Ltd. P'ship v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., Inc., 9\n\nF.3d   175,    180   (1st    Cir.   1993)(\"The   law   in   this    circuit    is\n\ncrystalline: a litigant's failure to explicitly raise an issue\n\nbefore the district court forecloses that party from raising the\n\nissue for the first time on appeal.\").             Additionally, arguments\n\nmade on appeal normally cannot be made for the first time in a\n\nreply brief.       Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(\"[R]elief from an appellate court, requested for the first time in\n\na reply brief, is ordinarily denied as a matter of course.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fE.   Rule 41(a)(2)\n\n            Finally, Defendants contend that the magistrate judge\n\ncould not dismiss the state law counterclaims with prejudice, while\n\nat the same time dismissing Esso's CERCLA and RCRA claims without\n\nprejudice.     Defendants base this argument on Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n41(a)(2).    Rule 41(a)(2), which provides for voluntary dismissals,\n\nstates in relevant part that:\n\n     [i]f a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior\n     to the service upon the defendant of the plaintiff's\n     motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed\n     against the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim\n     can remain pending for independent adjudication by the\n     court.    Unless otherwise specified in the order, a\n     dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.\n\n            This language does not support Defendants' position.\n\nEsso did not move for voluntary dismissal of its CERCLA and RCRA\n\nclaims until after the magistrate judge had granted partial summary\n\njudgment on Defendants' counterclaims.       Because the state law\n\ncounterclaims were no longer pending at the time of the magistrate\n\njudge's voluntary dismissal of Esso's federal claims, Rule 41(a)(2)\n\ndoes not apply.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

On summary judgment, the magistrate judge\n\ndismissed those counterclaims with prejudice.\n\n          Subsequently,      with   Esso's    claims     still pending, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court decided Cooper Industries, Inc. v.\n\nAviall Services, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137734\"><a href=\"/opinion/137734/cooper-industries-inc-v-aviall-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).          There, the Court held\n\nthat a CERCLA contribution claim, similar to the one asserted in\n\nthis case by ESSO, was subject to certain statutory requirements.\n\nThere is no dispute that Esso did not meet these requirements and,\n\ntherefore,    could   not   maintain    its   CERCLA    claim   against   the\n\ndefendants.     The magistrate judge dismissed the CERCLA claim\n\naccordingly.\n\n          The   defendants    now   challenge    the    magistrate   judge's\n\ndismissal of their state law counterclaims, claiming that, in the\n\naftermath of Cooper Industries, there was never subject matter\n\njurisdiction over them.      We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                                  I.\n\nA.   Factual Background\n\n           Esso    primarily   sought   two   forms   of   relief:   (1)\n\ncontribution under § 113(f) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f); and (2)\n\ninjunctive relief under § 7002(a)(1)(B) of the Solid Waste Disposal\n\nAct, as amended by RCRA, 42 U.S.C. § 6972, for the response costs\n\nthat Esso incurred in remedying environmental contamination at a\n\ngasoline service station located in La Vega Ward, Barranquitas,\n\nPuerto Rico (the \"Station\").    Operated as a retail service station\n\nfrom the mid-1930's until August 1998 when it was closed, the\n\nStation sold gasoline, diesel fuel, automobile parts, and motor\n\noil.    The Station's operators performed oil changes, greasing\n\noperations, used battery recharging and replacement, mechanical\n\nwork, and the washing of vehicles on the premises.            In 1971,\n\nRodriguez took over control of the Station's day-to-day operations\n\nfrom his father.    In 1979, Rodriguez leased the station from José\n\nDomingo Pagán-Pagán.    Rodriguez managed and controlled the Station\n\nfrom 1979 until its closure in August 1998.\n\n           There was significant disposal of hazardous substances on\n\nthe premises during the Station's operation under Rodriguez's\n\nmanagement. Motor oil drained from automobiles was allowed to flow\n\ninto the Piñones River, a body of water located behind the station.\n\nSimilarly, used oil filters were found buried in large quantities\n\nin the northern part of the Station.      Gasoline and diesel used to\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fflush dirt and grease from vehicles were rinsed           onto the ground\n\nand into the river using a pressure hose.               As a result, the\n\npremises became contaminated with a number of hazardous substances\n\nincluding   lead,   chromium,   benzene,   ethylbenzene,    toluene,      and\n\nxylene.\n\n            Belgodere began his involvement at the station in 1993.\n\nIn 1994, he conducted reviews of soil conditions and inventory\n\nrecords   in   connection   with   a   prior   civil   action   brought   by\n\nRodriguez against Esso.     In 1995, Belgodere entered into a formal\n\nagreement with Rodriguez to act as the latter's environmental\n\nconsultant and expert witness.\n\n            Under CERCLA, Esso sought contribution from Defendants\n\nfor the cost of cleaning up the hazardous substances on the\n\npremises of the Station.        Under RCRA, Esso sought an injunction\n\nordering Defendants, among other things, \"to investigate, abate and\n\nremediate any endangerment posed by the environmental conditions\"\n\nat the Station.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n            The proceedings, as they are relevant to this appeal,\n\nunfolded as follows:\n\n-- After Esso filed its Second Amended Complaint, Defendants filed\n\ncounterclaims grounded in state law claiming: (1) lost income; (2)\n\nlost future income; (3) lost gasoline; (4) slander; (5) attorney's\n\nfees; (6) mental anguish; and (7) injunctive relief.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f -- Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of\n\nliability for contribution under CERCLA.               Esso also moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the state law counterclaims.\n\n-- The magistrate judge issued an opinion and order on the pending\n\nsummary judgment motions.         The magistrate judge granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Esso on Defendants' counterclaims, concluding\n\nthat the state law counterclaims were time-barred.             The magistrate\n\njudge also ruled in favor of Esso on the CERCLA liability claim.\n\n -- Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, requesting the\n\nmagistrate judge to reconsider his summary judgment decision.\n\n-- While the reconsideration motion was pending, Esso submitted an\n\ninformative motion advising the magistrate judge of the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Cooper Industries.               As a result of Cooper\n\nIndustries, Esso could not maintain its contribution claim pursuant\n\nto § 113(f)(1) of CERCLA.\n\n  --   The    magistrate       judge    denied     Defendants'   motion    for\n\nreconsideration.      The magistrate judge contemporaneously issued:\n\n(1) a partial final judgment dismissing Defendants' counterclaims\n\nwith prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (which permits a\n\ndistrict court to enter final judgments as to one or more but fewer\n\nthan   all   claims   in   a   case    involving    multiple   claims   and/or\n\nparties); and (2) an order requesting Esso to show cause as to the\n\neffect of Cooper Industries on its CERCLA claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f --     In response to the magistrate judge's request to show cause,\n\nEsso moved for voluntary dismissal without prejudice of both its\n\nCERCLA and RCRA claims.\n\n  -- The magistrate judge entered an opinion and order dismissing\n\nEsso's CERCLA claim with prejudice, based on the Cooper Industries\n\ndecision.      The court also dismissed Esso's RCRA claim without\n\nprejudice.\n\n  -- Defendants filed a motion to vacate judgment under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(4) and 41(a)(2).         Rule 60(b)(4) permits a district\n\ncourt    to   relieve   a   party   from    a   final   judgment,   order,   or\n\nproceeding if the judgement is void.            Rule 41(a)(2) establishes a\n\nframework for district courts to enter voluntary dismissals.\n\n  -- Esso filed a motion to amend or alter judgment pursuant to\n\nRule 59(e), requesting that the dismissal of its CERCLA claim be\n\nwithout prejudice.      Esso argued that because its CERCLA claim was\n\na contribution claim, the claim's dismissal should be without\n\nprejudice in order to avoid res judicata and allow Esso to renew\n\nthe contribution claim on grounds other than § 113(f)(1) of CERCLA.\n\n -- The magistrate judge issued a final order and opinion denying\n\nDefendants' motion to vacate judgment.                  The magistrate judge\n\nexplained that while there never was subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover Esso's CERCLA claim, there was jurisdiction over the case at\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fall times because of Esso's RCRA claim.1          Therefore, it had\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Defendants' state counterclaims when\n\nit ruled that those claims were time-barred.\n\n -- In its final amended judgment, the magistrate judge, persuaded\n\nby the reasoning in Esso's motion to alter or amend judgment,\n\ndismissed without prejudice both Esso's CERCLA and RCRA claims.\n\nPreviously, he had dismissed the CERCLA claim with prejudice.\n\nC.

Cooper Industries\n\n           There is no dispute that Esso's CERCLA claim was not\n\nproperly before the magistrate judge.     In Cooper Industries, the\n\nSupreme Court clarified the circumstances under which a private\n\nparty may seek contribution under § 113(f)(1) of CERCLA.    Section\n\n113(f)(1), pursuant to which Esso brought its contribution claim\n\nagainst Defendants, \"allows persons who have undertaken efforts to\n\nclean up properties contaminated by hazardous substances to seek\n\ncontribution from other parties liable under CERCLA.\"        Cooper\n\nIndus., 543 U.S. at 160.   Section 113(f)(1) further specifies that\n\na party may obtain contribution \"during or following any civil\n\naction\" under CERCLA § 106 or § 107(a).\n\n           The issue the Court decided was \"whether a private party\n\nwho has not been sued under § 106 or § 107(a) [of CERCLA] may\n\nnevertheless obtain contribution under § 113(f)(1) from other\n\nliable parties.\"   543 U.S. at 160-61.   The Court held that such a\n\nparty may not.   Id. at 161.   Because, like the plaintiff in Cooper\n\nIndustries, Esso had not been sued under § 106 or § 107(a) of\n\nCERCLA, it could not maintain its § 113(f)(1) CERCLA claim and the\n\nmagistrate judge properly dismissed it.\n\nB.   Esso's RCRA claim\n\n           Defendants argue that Esso's RCRA claim, like its CERCLA\n\nclaim, was not properly before the magistrate judge.    As a result,\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fbecause there was no pending question of federal law, there was no\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Defendants' state law counterclaims,\n\nand they could not have been dismissed with prejudice.               See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1367(a) (\"[I]n any civil action of which the district\n\ncourts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related\n\nto claims in the action . . . that they form part of the same case\n\nor controversy under Article III.\"); BIW Deceived v.

It states that a citizen suit may\n\nnot be commenced \"if the Administrator or State has commenced and\n\nis diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action in a court of\n\nthe United States or a State to require compliance with such\n\npermit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, prohibition,\n\n\n     2\n        A citizen suit is \"[a]n action under a statute giving\ncitizens the right to sue violators of the law . . . and to seek\ninjunctive relief and penalties.\" Black's Law Dictionary, 8th ed.\n(2004). Typically, citizen suits, where they exist, function as a\nform of statutory enforcement in addition to, or in conjunction\nwith, enforcement by an administrative agency or other governmental\nentity.\n\n                                      -9-\n\for order.\"      However, the plain language of the statute undermines\n\nDefendants' position.          While it is true that the Puerto Rico\n\nEnvironmental Quality Board is prosecuting an administrative case\n\ninvolving the Station, the statutory provision precludes a citizen\n\nsuit under RCRA only if the suit is \"a civil or criminal action in\n\na court of the United States or a State.\"                   An administrative\n\nproceeding does not take place in a \"court of the United States or\n\na State.\" The RCRA claim was properly before the magistrate judge,\n\nand    there    was   supplemental     jurisdiction   over     the   state   law\n\ncounterclaims.\n\nC.    Abstention\n\n               Defendants also assert that the magistrate judge should\n\nhave   abstained      from   hearing    and   determining    their   state   law\n\ncounterclaims.        Defendants raised this argument for the first time\n\non March 14, 2005 in a reply to an opposition to one of their\n\nmotions for reconsideration.           This demand for abstention came more\n\nthan three-and-a-half years after Esso's RCRA claim was first filed\n\nin district court, and, more importantly, after Defendants had\n\nlitigated the state law counterclaims on the merits, culminating in\n\nthe    magistrate       judge's   summary      judgment     ruling   on   those\n\ncounterclaims.        Defendants did not raise their abstention argument\n\nin a timely fashion, and we will not entertain it here.                      See\n\nMarshall v.

The merits\n\n              In their appellate reply brief, Defendants invite us to\n\nreview the merits of the magistrate judge's summary judgment\n\ndecision on their state law counterclaims. Defendants contend that\n\nthe    magistrate    judge    was   in   error   because    their   state     law\n\ncounterclaims were not time-barred.              In the proceedings below,\n\nDefendants challenged the magistrate judge's dismissal of their\n\nstate law counterclaims solely on jurisdictional grounds; they did\n\nnot challenge the merits of the magistrate judge's decision.
