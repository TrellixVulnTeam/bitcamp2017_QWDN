Nadel, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nPeter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, and Terri J. Scadron,\nAssistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nRespondent.\n\n\n\n                        September 29, 2006\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Petitioner Sothy Ouk, a native and\n\ncitizen of Cambodia, appeals from a final order of removal of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which denied her petition for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT).       An Immigration Judge (IJ) found that Ouk\n\nhad not previously been persecuted on the basis of a protected\n\nground, and that she had not met her burden of establishing a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.            He also found that she\n\nhad failed to establish that it was more likely than not that she\n\nwould be persecuted or tortured if she returned to Cambodia.            In a\n\nper curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling.              We\n\naffirm the BIA and deny the petition.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           On February 7, 2003, Ouk entered the United States as a\n\nnon-immigrant visitor.       She was permitted to remain in the United\n\nStates until August 6, 2003.      Ouk did not depart by that date, and\n\nthereafter her presence was unauthorized. On February 6, 2004, Ouk\n\nfiled an application requesting political asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval   based   on   her   political    opinion    and   membership   in   a\n\nparticular social group.      She also requested protection under the\n\nCAT.   On September 20, 2004, Ouk was served with a Notice to Appear\n\nin removal proceedings before an IJ. She conceded removability and\n\nrenewed her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT\n\nprotection.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           At   her     removal   hearing    on   November   19,   2004,    Ouk\n\ntestified that she had suffered persecution in Cambodia on account\n\nof her political opinion and membership in the Sam Rainsy party, an\n\nopposition political party.        Ouk testified that this persecution\n\nhad come at the hands of the Cambodian People's Party.1             In March\n\n1997, Ouk and her husband attended a political protest.              At that\n\nprotest, the police beat members of opposition parties and threw\n\nhand grenades into the crowd.       Ouk claimed that she was identified\n\nas a member of the Sam Rainsy party by her neighbor, a police\n\nofficer who saw her at the demonstration.           Ouk also testified that\n\nshe believed that her husband was killed in July 1997 because of\n\nhis   opposition   to    the   People's    Party.    Thereafter,    Ouk    \"hid\n\n[her]self around the city of Phnom Penh\" because she feared that\n\nthe People's Party would try to kill her, too.               Ouk stated that\n\nbetween 1997 and 2003 she attempted several times to come to the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           Ouk also testified that other members of her family had\n\nsuffered persecution because of their political affiliations.              She\n\ntestified that her father, who had been a member of the National\n\nUnited Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and Independent\n\nCambodia (FUNCINPEC), another opposition political party, had been\n\narrested by the People's Party, presumably because of his political\n\n      1\n          The Cambodian People's Party is the currently governing\nparty in Cambodia and is headed by Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former\nmember of the Khmer Rouge.\n\n                                     -3-\n\factivities.    He then escaped Cambodia and emigrated to the United\n\nStates, where he now lives as a legal permanent resident.                 In\n\naddition, Ouk reported that her older brother was killed by the\n\nKhmer Rouge, and she claimed that members of the People's Party had\n\nattempted to kill her younger brothers and sisters.            Five of her\n\nsiblings now live in the United States, while two of them still\n\nlive in Cambodia.\n\n            Ouk also offered documentary evidence, including two\n\nexpert reports diagnosing her with post-traumatic stress disorder\n\nand attesting to the reasonableness of her fear of returning to\n\nCambodia.\n\n            In an oral decision, the IJ denied Ouk's application for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection, but granted her\n\nthe privilege of voluntary departure until January 18, 2005.              In\n\nhis opinion, the IJ stated that although he found Ouk's oral\n\ntestimony   generally   to   be   credible,   he   was   skeptical   of   her\n\nstatements that she had been in hiding for the six years preceding\n\nher departure from Cambodia. The IJ also found that although Ouk's\n\nhusband had disappeared, her husband's political opinion could not\n\nbe imputed to her, and that Ouk \"ha[d] experienced no difficulties\n\nwhile she was in Cambodia.\"          Rather, she had applied for and\n\nreceived a passport in Cambodia, and had received an exit stamp\n\nupon leaving.    The IJ further emphasized that Ouk's brother and\n\nsister, who also are members of the Sam Rainsy party, live safely\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fin Cambodia, and that in the last election, the Sam Rainsy party\n\nwon twenty-four seats in the national assembly.                    Finally, he\n\nreferred to the Cambodian constitution's provision of the right to\n\nchange the government peacefully and to a State Department report\n\nindicating that \"citizens generally exercise this right in practice\n\nthrough periodic elections on the basis of universal suffrage.\"\n\n               On February 1, 2006, the BIA adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ's       ruling   and   extended   the   time   within   which    Ouk    could\n\nvoluntarily depart the United States until April 2, 2006.                 The BIA\n\nspecifically commented that \"[o]ther than . . . minor bruises\n\nsuffered as a result of crowd movement at a demonstration, the\n\nrecord [did] not indicate that [Ouk] was ever seriously harmed.\"\n\nThe BIA also noted that the reasonableness of Ouk's fear of future\n\npersecution was undermined by her family's continued presence --\n\nwithout incident -- in Cambodia.2\n\n                                       II.\n\n               Ouk argues in her petition for review that the IJ erred\n\nin (1) failing to find that she had established a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution in Cambodia, (2) failing to recognize her\n\nemotional harm in evaluating her asylum claim, and (3) failing to\n\n\n\n       2\n          The BIA did not consider evidence first submitted on\nappeal.   It found that Ouk had failed to explain why certain\nevidence was not presented at her hearing before the IJ, and it\nnoted that the evidence that became available after her hearing\ncould not independently establish that Ouk had a well-founded fear\nof persecution.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fconsider her mental illness in ruling on her withholding of removal\n\nclaim.   Ouk also argues that the time period within which she is\n\nrequired to post her voluntary departure bond should be tolled from\n\nthe date that she filed a petition for review in this court.\n\n          When the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some\n\nof the bases for the IJ's decision, we have authority to review\n\nboth the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.       Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing     Chen v. Ashcroft, 376 F.3d 215,\n\n222 (3d Cir. 2004) (“[W]hen the BIA both adopts the findings of the\n\nIJ and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision, we have\n\nauthority to review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.”)).\n\n          To be eligible for asylum, an alien must demonstrate that\n\nshe is a \"refugee.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A).   To do so, the alien\n\nmust show that she reasonably fears persecution \"on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"       Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also\n\nMukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).        The\n\nalien bears the burden of proof for establishing her eligibility\n\nfor asylum. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).     Whether or not an alien\n\nhas met her burden is a factual determination that we review under\n\nthe deferential substantial evidence standard. See Estrada-Canales\n\nv. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 208, 215 (1st Cir. 2006).        Thus, we will\n\nuphold   the   agency's   determination    \"unless   any   reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); see also Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398\n\nF.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Here,    substantial         evidence         supports   the       IJ's\n\ndetermination    that     Ouk   does    not   have    a    well-founded    fear   of\n\npersecution in Cambodia.          Apart from minor injuries from crowd\n\nmovement at the 1997 demonstration, Ouk was never physically harmed\n\nin   Cambodia   because    of   her     political     affiliation.        The   IJ's\n\ndecision also is supported by Ouk's testimony that she emerged from\n\nhiding on several occasions, including to apply for a passport and\n\nvisa to enter the United States.           In 2000, she received a passport\n\nfrom the Cambodian government, and in 2003, she received a visa to\n\ncome to the United States.             She was not detained at the airport\n\nupon her departure from Cambodia.\n\n             Moreover, according to the 2003 State Department Country\n\nReport on Cambodia, the Sam Rainsy party holds approximately 20% of\n\nthe seats in the Cambodian national assembly, as does the FUNCINPEC\n\nparty.     Two of Ouk's siblings -- both of whom also are members of\n\nthe Sam Rainsy party -- continue to live in Cambodia without\n\nincident.     See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (\"[T]he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully\n\nin   the    alien's   homeland     undercuts         the    alien's   claim     that\n\npersecution awaits his return.\"); see also Sou v. Gonzales, 450\n\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2006).        Ouk's brother voluntarily returned to\n\nCambodia after visiting the United States. Ouk's son also lives in\n\n                                        -7-\n\fCambodia and remains unharmed.                Indeed, the 2003 Country Report\n\nstates that \"[t]here were no reports of politically motivated\n\ndisappearances\" and \"no reports of political prisoners\" during the\n\nyear.\n\n              The IJ did not inappropriately discount Ouk's emotional\n\nharm.      \"[U]nder the right set of circumstances, a finding of past\n\npersecution     might     rest   on    a    showing   of   psychological    harm.\"\n\nMakhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004).                        Here,\n\nassuming Ouk suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, the IJ\n\nwas warranted in finding that she had not shown that it was related\n\nto any persecution directed at her, and therefore that she had not\n\nestablished past persecution based on her political opinion.                      To\n\nthe extent that Ouk relies on her post-traumatic stress disorder as\n\nevidence of her fear of future persecution, the IJ was warranted in\n\nfinding that she had failed to meet her burden, even taking her\n\nfear as genuine.          Genuine fear is not sufficient to establish\n\neligibility for asylum. For the reasons described above, we cannot\n\nsay that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find that\n\nOuk has a well-founded fear of persecution in Cambodia.\n\n              As to Ouk's withholding of removal claim, this court\n\nlacks jurisdiction to consider whether Ouk is more likely than not\n\nto be persecuted based on her mental illness.                Ouk failed to raise\n\n-- in her written applications or oral testimony before the IJ, or\n\nin   her    briefs   to   the    BIA   --    an   argument   that   she   would   be\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fpersecuted because she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAs a result, she has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies,\n\nand we may not consider the argument.      See id.   We add that even if\n\nOuk's   claim   were   properly   before   us,   there   is   no   evidence\n\nwhatsoever in the record that she \"is more likely than not to face\n\npersecution on account of . . . membership in a particular social\n\ngroup.\"   See Salazar v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(emphasis omitted).\n\n           Finally, as to the grant of voluntary departure, the\n\ngovernment has not opposed Ouk's argument for tolling the period\n\nduring which she must post her departure bond.           Accordingly, Ouk\n\nhas one business day from the issuance of this opinion to post her\n\n$500 voluntary departure bond.\n\n           The petition for review is otherwise denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

Thus, we will uphold the agency's determination \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>see also Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ's determination that Ouk does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Cambodia. Apart from minor injuries from crowd movement at the 1997 demonstration, Ouk was never physically harmed in Cambodia because of her political affiliation. The IJ's decision also is supported by Ouk's testimony that she emerged from hiding on several occasions, including to apply for a passport and visa to enter the United States. In 2000, she received a passport from the Cambodian government, and in 2003, she received a visa to come to the United States. She was not detained at the airport upon her departure from Cambodia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, according to the 2003 State Department Country Report on Cambodia, the Sam Rainsy party holds approximately 20% of the seats in the Cambodian national assembly, as does the FUNCINPEC party. Two of Ouk's siblings &#8212; both of whom also are members of the Sam Rainsy party &#8212; continue to live in Cambodia without incident. <i>See Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[T]he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\"); <i>see also Sou v. Gonzales,</i> 450 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2006). Ouk's brother voluntarily returned to Cambodia after visiting the United States. Ouk's son also lives in Cambodia and remains unharmed. Indeed, the 2003 Country Report states that \"[t]here were no reports of politically motivated disappearances\" and \"no reports of political prisoners\" during the year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ did not inappropriately discount Ouk's emotional harm. \"[U]nder the right set of circumstances, a finding of past persecution might rest on a showing of psychological harm.\" <i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.2004). Here, assuming Ouk suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, the IJ was warranted in finding that she had not shown that it was related to any persecution directed at <i>her,</i> and therefore that she had not established past persecution based on her political opinion. To the extent that Ouk relies on her post-traumatic stress disorder as evidence of her fear of future persecution, the IJ was warranted in finding that she had failed to meet her burden, even taking her fear as genuine. Genuine fear is not sufficient to establish eligibility for asylum. For the reasons described above, we cannot say that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find that Ouk has a <i>well-founded</i> fear of persecution in Cambodia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Ouk's withholding of removal claim, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider whether Ouk is more likely than not to be persecuted based on her mental illness. Ouk failed to raise &#8212; in her written applications or oral testimony before the IJ, or in her briefs to the BIA &#8212; an argument that she would be persecuted because she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result, she has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and we may not consider the argument. <i>See id.</i> We add that even if Ouk's claim were properly before us, there is no evidence whatsoever in the record that she \"is more likely than not to face persecution on account of . . . membership in a particular social group.\" <i>See Salazar v.

An Immigration Judge (IJ) found that Ouk had not previously been persecuted on the basis of a protected ground, and that she had not met her burden of establishing a well-founded fear of future persecution. He also found that she had failed to establish that it was more likely than not that she would be persecuted or tortured if she returned to Cambodia. In a per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling. We affirm the BIA and deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 2003, Ouk entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor. She was permitted to remain in the United States until August 6, 2003. Ouk did not depart by that date, and thereafter her presence was unauthorized. On February 6, 2004, Ouk filed an application requesting political asylum and withholding of removal based on her political opinion and membership in a particular social group. She also requested protection under the CAT. On September 20, 2004, Ouk was served with a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings before an IJ. She conceded removability and renewed her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At her removal hearing on November 19, 2004, Ouk testified that she had suffered persecution in Cambodia on account of her political opinion and membership in the Sam Rainsy party, an opposition political party. Ouk testified that this persecution had come at the hands of the Cambodian People's Party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In March 1997, Ouk and her husband attended a political protest. At that protest, the police beat members of opposition parties and threw hand grenades into the crowd. Ouk claimed that she was identified as a member of the Sam Rainsy party by her neighbor, a police officer who saw her at the demonstration. Ouk also testified that she believed that her husband was killed in July 1997 because of his opposition to the People's Party. Thereafter, Ouk \"hid [her]self around the city of Phnom Penh\" because she feared that the People's Party would try to kill her, too. Ouk stated that between 1997 and 2003 she attempted several times to come to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ouk also testified that other members of her family had suffered persecution because of their political affiliations. She testified that her father, who had been a member of the National United Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and Independent Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), another opposition political party, had been arrested by the People's Party, presumably because of his political activities. He then escaped Cambodia and emigrated to the United States, where he now lives as a legal permanent resident. In addition, Ouk reported that her older brother was killed by the Khmer Rouge, and she claimed that members of the People's Party had attempted to kill her younger brothers and sisters. Five of her siblings now live in the United States, while two of them still live in Cambodia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ouk also offered documentary evidence, including two expert reports diagnosing her with post-traumatic stress disorder and attesting to the reasonableness of her fear of returning to Cambodia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an oral decision, the IJ denied Ouk's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection, but granted her the privilege of voluntary departure until January 18, 2005. In his opinion, the IJ stated that although he found Ouk's oral testimony generally to be credible, he was skeptical of her statements that she had been in hiding for the six years preceding her departure from Cambodia. The IJ also found that although Ouk's husband had disappeared, her husband's political opinion could not be imputed to her, and that Ouk \"ha[d] experienced no difficulties while she was in Cambodia.\" Rather, she had applied for and received a passport in Cambodia, and had received an exit stamp upon leaving. The IJ further emphasized that Ouk's brother and sister, who also are members of the Sam Rainsy party, live safely in Cambodia, and that in the last election, the Sam Rainsy party won twenty-four seats in the national assembly. Finally, he referred to the Cambodian constitution's provision of the right to change the government peacefully and to a State Department report indicating that \"citizens generally exercise this right in practice through periodic elections on the basis of universal suffrage.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 2006, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling and extended the time within which Ouk could voluntarily depart the United States until April 2, 2006. The BIA specifically commented that \"[o]ther than . . . minor bruises suffered as a result of crowd movement at a demonstration, the record [did] not indicate that [Ouk] was ever seriously harmed.\" The BIA also noted that the reasonableness of Ouk's fear of future persecution was undermined by her family's continued presence &#8212; without incident &#8212; in Cambodia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ouk argues in her petition for review that the IJ erred in (1) failing to find that she had established a well-founded fear of future persecution in Cambodia, (2) failing to recognize her emotional harm in evaluating her asylum claim, and (3) failing to consider her mental illness in ruling on her withholding of removal claim. Ouk also argues that the time period within which she is required to post her voluntary departure bond should be tolled from the date that she filed a petition for review in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision, we have authority to review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions. <i>Romilus v.
