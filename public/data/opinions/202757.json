Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     B. Michael Cormier for petitioner.\n     N. William Delker, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nJustice Bureau, with whom Kelly A. Ayotte, Attorney General, was on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           May 25, 2007\n\f             BOUDIN, Chief Judge.     Vicki Bader--ex-wife of appellant\n\nSeth Bader--was murdered on August 24, 1996, seemingly in Stratham,\n\nNew Hampshire, and her body was found in a grave in Waterboro,\n\nMaine, on April 10, 1997.      Police were led to the body by 14-year-\n\nold Joseph Bader, who was Seth's adopted son and biological cousin.\n\nIn December 1997, Joseph agreed with the state to enter a plea of\n\n\"true\" to a juvenile delinquency petition, confessing that he\n\nassisted in helping Seth murder Vicki.\n\n             At Seth's trial in April and May 1998 in New Hampshire\n\nstate court, Joseph testified against Seth for four trial days.\n\nThe gist of the testimony was that Seth and his girlfriend Mary\n\nJean Martin had plotted to murder Vicki; that Seth had hired Sandro\n\nStuto to assist in the murder and to dispose of Vicki's car; that\n\nSeth had traveled to Maine with Joseph a few days before the\n\nmurder, located a spot in the woods and dug a grave; and that\n\nJoseph had kept Seth's younger son outside the house while the\n\nmurder was committed.\n\n             Joseph did not claim to have witnessed the murder, but,\n\naccording to his testimony, he had been called back into the house\n\nby   Stuto   after   the   murder   and   witnessed   his   adoptive   father\n\nemerging from the basement with a rifle barrel and a spent casing;\n\nJoseph had then helped clean up the blood.            Joseph also testified\n\nthat Seth had told him earlier that he (Seth) would shoot Vicki.\n\nJoseph further testified that he had then helped Seth transport and\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fbury Vicki's body in Maine and that on the way home he and Seth had\n\ngone shopping for new clothes.\n\n            The prosecution offered records of Seth's mobile phone to\n\nshow calls from Maine on the date of Vicki's death.             Credit card\n\nrecords showed Seth's card had been used that day to purchase pants\n\nin two different sizes, one pair of shoes and other items.                Seth\n\ndid not testify at his trial but the prosecution played a recording\n\nof a police interview for the jury in which Seth, while denying\n\nguilt, conceded that he might have driven with Joseph to Maine that\n\nday because of the good weather.\n\n              Stuto testified that on the day of the murder, he,\n\nMartin and Seth met together in the afternoon and agreed that Stuto\n\nwould dispose of Vicki's car after the murder, leaving it at a\n\nbookstore.      Seth   and   Stuto   drove   to   the   bookstore   and   then\n\nproceeded to Seth's house where, according to Stuto, Seth shot\n\nVicki.1    At trial the defense sought to call Martin, who refused to\n\ntestify.\n\n            Although the state primarily relied on the testimony of\n\nJoseph and Stuto, other evidence in addition to the mobile phone\n\nand credit card records was offered.         Vicki's lawyer testified as\n\nto Seth's aggressive efforts to reduce his financial obligations to\n\n\n     1\n      While in prison Stuto apparently recanted, saying that Joseph\nhad murdered Vicki in exchange for sexual favors from Martin and\nthat Seth had nothing to do with the murder. The district court\ndecided that Bader's habeas claim based on this recantation had no\nmerit, and this issue is not before us.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fVicki and to secure custody of their children.             In tape recordings\n\nof phone calls with Vicki, Seth expressed his obsession with\n\nholding onto and pleasing Martin and stated that Martin had said\n\nshe   would    leave   Seth   unless   he    won   the   alimony   and   custody\n\nlitigation.\n\n              A woman who regularly cleaned Seth's house testified to\n\nprior statements that Seth and his girlfriend wished Vicki were\n\ndead.       Vicki's doctor said that Vicki had told him that she\n\nremained overweight so that her body would be difficult to move if\n\nshe were killed.       The prosecution also sought to connect Seth with\n\na pipe bomb planted in Vicki's mailbox; one witness testified to\n\nSeth having a bomb-making book in his home.\n\n              The defense sought to discredit both Joseph and Stuto,\n\nemphasizing that Stuto had reached a deal for only five years in\n\nprison and that Joseph would do no time in prison.                  It offered\n\nevidence of Martin's deceptive character, her links to Joseph, and\n\nJoseph's hostility towards Vicki.               It also attempted to raise\n\ndoubts about the state's theory.2            In closing, the defense offered\n\nan alternative theory that, without Seth's involvement, Martin had\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      For example, the defense argued that Joseph's testimony about\nthe time of the murder could not be true because Joseph's testimony\nthat Seth and Stuto arrived at the Stratham, New Hampshire, house\naround 3 p.m. seemed to conflict with the fact that Seth had been\ncited for a traffic violation around 2:30 p.m. in Massachusetts.\nThe defense also noted that Joseph testified to several items that\nshould have been found buried with the body, but were not.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fconvinced Joseph to do the killing and that both Joseph and Martin\n\nstood to benefit from killing Vicki and framing Seth.\n\n            The    jury    convicted    Seth    of   first-degree     murder    and\n\nconspiracy to murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment on\n\nthe murder charge.         The New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed his\n\nconviction.    State v. Bader, 808 A.2d 12 (N.H. 2002).              After Seth's\n\ntrial,    juvenile    court    hearings       were   held   to   track    Joseph's\n\nprogress;    but   Joseph     never    spent   any   time   in   a   correctional\n\nfacility.\n\n            In October 2002, Seth filed the present habeas case in\n\nfederal district court.        He claimed, inter alia, that in violation\n\nof   Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the prosecution had made\n\nbut did not disclose to the defense a leniency-for-testimony deal\n\nfor Joseph's testimony, which could have been used to impeach\n\nJoseph at trial.          Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-55\n\n(1972).     Seth now conjectures that the agreement might have been\n\nkept secret from Joseph himself.\n\n            The    issue     whether    any    agreement    existed      had   been\n\nelaborately explored in the state proceedings.              In September 1997,\n\nprior to Seth's trial, the defense filed a motion for discovery of\n\n\"all details of all agreements and understandings with\" Joseph or\n\nother co-defendants.        When in December 1997 Joseph agreed to plead\n\nguilty in the juvenile proceedings, the state got court permission\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fand then disclosed to Seth's lawyers Joseph's juvenile court\n\nrecords.\n\n           On March 26, 1998, after Seth's trial had begun, he filed\n\na second motion for discovery, this time asking for all records\n\nrelating to communication between the Attorney General's office and\n\nJoseph's attorneys and documents relating to charging decisions\n\nmade by the Attorney General's office.     Defense counsel also made\n\noral motions at trial.     In response, the judge ordered that \"all\n\ndocuments in the file(s) relating to the juvenile filed in the\n\nFamily Court,\" including notes from therapists, be provided to the\n\ncourt.\n\n           The trial judge then reviewed in camera the documents\n\nthat the state had provided.    After this review, on April 9, 1998,\n\nthe state judge determined that the record did not contain any\n\nmaterial   \"which   is   exculpatory,   essential   to   the   defendant\n\nreceiving a fair trial, or which relate[s] to any understandings or\n\nagreements relative to plea decisions or other information which\n\ncan be construed as Giglio materials.\"\n\n           The prosecutor reaffirmed on April 10, 1998, that the\n\nstate had disclosed all agreements with Joseph and his attorneys.\n\nThe judge nevertheless ordered expedited access to the transcript\n\nof Joseph's plea hearing, which had occurred in December 1997.\n\nAlthough defense counsel inferred from tapes of that hearing that\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fa   leniency-for-testimony   agreement   existed,3   the   trial   judge\n\nlistened himself and ruled that there was no evidence of a deal\n\nrequiring Joseph to testify at Seth's trial.\n\n            At Seth's trial, the judge let Seth's trial counsel\n\ncross-examine Joseph about any such deal. Joseph admitted that his\n\nplea agreement meant that he would not be incarcerated even for\n\n\"one second,\" that the disposition hearing in his case would not\n\noccur until after Seth's trial, and that the juvenile court would\n\nknow of his testimony in Seth's trial.    But Joseph said that he had\n\nnot made any agreement to testify.4\n\n            Nevertheless, on his state appeal, Seth argued to the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court that Joseph's plea agreement was contingent\n\non his testifying against Seth and that the trial court had erred\n\nin finding to the contrary.     In rejecting the appeal, the court\n\nsaid:\n\n            There is no evidence in the extensive record\n            in this case to support a conclusion that the\n            trial court erred either in its finding\n            following the in camera review or in its\n\n\n        3\n      Defense counsel noted that at the juvenile plea hearing a\nstate attorney stated that \"Joseph will be testifying\" in Seth's\ntrial. But this was not listed as a term of the plea agreement,\nbut rather as part of a time line relating to Joseph. When the\njuvenile court judge explained the agreement to Joseph, he made no\nmention of testifying.\n        4\n      Shown a transcript of the plea agreement, he backtracked\nsomewhat; but in fact, the transcript confirms that the prosecutor\ntold the juvenile court only that Joseph was expected to testify\nagainst Seth--not that this was a term of the plea agreement or in\nexchange for leniency.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            finding of no evidence of a \"sine qua non\"\n            [sic] on the part of the State in return for\n            Joseph Bader's testimony. . . . Accordingly\n            the defendant cannot prevail in his effort to\n            secure a new trial on this issue as he has\n            failed to \"prove that the prosecution withheld\n            evidence that is favorable and material.\"\n\nBader, 808 A.2d at 22-23 (citations omitted).\n\n            In      federal   habeas   proceedings      directed   to    state\n\nprisoners, the federal statute provides that findings by the state\n\ncourt are conclusive unless overcome by clear and convincing\n\nevidence.     28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1) (2000).            The district court\n\ninitially dismissed Seth's Brady claim as one previously litigated\n\nand resolved, adding that Joseph could not have been influenced in\n\nhis testimony if a deal had existed but been kept secret from him.\n\n            Seth then discovered that a social worker had kept notes\n\nof   a   November    26,   1997,   meeting   attended   by   Joseph's   public\n\ndefenders, his social workers and a state prosecutor.                   Shortly\n\nafter the district court dismissed Seth's habeas petition, Seth\n\nsought reconsideration, accompanying the motion with affidavits\n\nfrom one of his own trial lawyers saying that he had not known of\n\nthe November 26, 1997, meeting.              The notes kept by one of the\n\nsocial workers attending the meeting said\n\n            Joe will be charged with conspiracy to commit\n            murder.    It would be appropriate to do\n            accomplice but that would mean being certified\n            as an adult and life in prison . . . Want a\n            plea of true [guilty] at the Dec. 8 arranmnet\n            [sic].   Do NOT want to do the dispositional\n            [sentencing]    before   the    [petitioner's]\n            criminal trial. . . . Attys. for Joe\n\n                                       -8-\n\f          advocating strongly for a change to a minor\n          charge . . . .\n\n          The district court reopened the habeas proceeding, and\n\nSeth filed a proposed discovery plan seeking to depose the three\n\nsocial workers who had attended the meeting and also various\n\nlawyers, including the prosecutors.   The district court found the\n\nplan overbroad because it covered unrelated issues but approved a\n\nsecond plan by Seth's counsel to depose the social workers.5\n\n          The depositions occurred, and the social workers recalled\n\nthat the prosecutor had said that he wanted Joseph to plead guilty\n\nbefore Seth's trial and be sentenced afterwards and that they\n\nunderstood that Joseph was expected to testify at Seth's trial.\n\nHowever, they also recalled no agreements--either for leniency in\n\nexchange for testimony or for anything else--being made at the\n\nNovember 26, 1997, meeting.\n\n          Seth's counsel then sought to depose the lawyers who had\n\nattended the meeting, including the prosecutor, but the district\n\ncourt refused, saying that there was no good cause for further\n\ndiscovery.   The judge repeated that if there had been a deal\n\nbetween prosecutor and defense counsel but this was unknown to\n\nJoseph--as Seth now suggested--it could not have affected his\n\n\n\n     5\n      In Bader's revised discovery motion, he stated that \"the\nthree social workers can claim no privilege of any sort, are not\ncommitted to any prior statements, and presumably are unfamiliar\nwith any legal theories of this case. They are the most likely of\nthe meeting's participants to offer unvarnished recollections.\"\n\n                               -9-\n\ftestimony and so could not undermine the court's confidence in the\n\nverdict.\n\n               The district court granted a certificate of appealability\n\nlimited to the supposed agreement.                    Seth argues to us (under\n\nseveral headings) the same central claim: that the district court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment against him because there\n\nremained      a    genuine    issue   of    fact   requiring   resolution    in   an\n\nevidentiary hearing, namely, whether the prosecutors concealed a\n\nleniency-for-testimony deal with Joseph or at least with his\n\nlawyers.       Seth relies in particular on Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S.\n\n293 (1963).\n\n               Townsend, 372 U.S. at 313, laid out a broad right of de\n\nnovo       federal   fact-finding      for    state   prisoners.     But    it    was\n\nsignificantly qualified by later case law and congressional action\n\nleaving the circuit courts in some uncertainty.6                   In all events,\n\njust this month the Supreme Court, glossing Townsend itself, has\n\nmade clear that the \"decision to grant an evidentiary hearing [is]\n\ngenerally         left   to   the   sound    discretion   of   district    courts.\"\n\nSchriro v. Landrigan, No. 05-1575, 2007 WL 1387923, at *5-*6 (U.S.\n\nMay 14, 2007).\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      See Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1 (1992); Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, §\n104(4)(e), 110 Stat. 1214. Compare Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d\n280, 287 (3d Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1084 (2001), with\nConaway v. Polk, 453 F.3d 567, 582 (4th Cir. 2006).\n\n                                            -10-\n\f             In all events, Seth has no clear and convincing evidence\n\nof an actual agreement, made between the prosecutors and defense\n\ncounsel, by which Joseph would testify in exchange for leniency.\n\nAbsent evidence that, if accepted, could overcome the powerful\n\npresumption in favor of the state-court finding, there is nothing\n\nto be tried in an evidentiary hearing.             Thus, the real issue is not\n\nthe right to an evidentiary hearing but whether Seth is entitled to\n\nmore discovery than he got.             See Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S.\n\n63, 81 (1977).\n\n             In    civil     matters      including     habeas,      evidentiary\n\nproceedings are appropriate only where the party bearing the burden\n\nof proof on an element starts with enough evidence to create a\n\ngenuine issue of fact; otherwise summary judgment is proper.\n\nAnderson v. Attorney Gen. of Kan., 425 F.3d 853, 860 (10th Cir.\n\n2005).      Seth recognizes the distinction, arguing in his brief that\n\nthe question is not whether he now has enough evidence but whether\n\nhe should be entitled to depose more witnesses in order to get it.\n\n             Rule 6 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases provides\n\nthat   in    habeas   proceedings       \"[a]   judge   may,    for   good   cause,\n\nauthorize a party to conduct discovery under the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure and may limit the extent of discovery.\"                 Bracy v.\n\nGramley,     520   U.S.    899,   904    (1997),   stated     that   \"[a]   habeas\n\npetitioner, unlike the usual civil litigant in federal court, is\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fnot entitled to discovery as a matter of ordinary course.\" Quoting\n\nHarris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 300 (1969), the Court explained:\n\n          [W]here specific allegations before the court\n          show reason to believe that the petitioner\n          may, if the facts are fully developed, be able\n          to demonstrate that he is . . . entitled to\n          relief, it is the duty of the court to provide\n          the necessary facilities and procedures for an\n          adequate inquiry.\n\nBracy, 520 U.S. at 908-09.\n\n          However, Bracy also said that \"the scope and extent of\n\nsuch discovery is a matter confided to the discretion of the\n\nDistrict Court.\"      Id. at 909.    Since the 1996 statutory changes,\n\ncircuit courts have continued to apply Bracy.              E.g., Newton v.\n\nKemna, 354 F.3d 776, 783 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 979\n\n(2004) (denial of discovery reviewed \"for an abuse of discretion\");\n\nPham v. Terhune, 400 F.3d 740, 741 (9th Cir. 2005) (same).\n\n          In   this    case   the   context   for   the   district   judge's\n\ndecision on discovery is that the state court had found there was\n\nno evidence of an agreement.        What Seth's habeas counsel recently\n\nfound was evidence of a specific meeting between Joseph's lawyers\n\nand the prosecutors.     But all this shows is an occasion on which a\n\nleniency-for-testimony agreement might have been made or disclosed.\n\nAnd, when the three social workers were deposed, they said there\n\nwas no agreement made or disclosed at the meeting.          This was hardly\n\nclear and convincing evidence that the state finding had been\n\nwrong.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            Just as the district judge had latitude to allow initial\n\ndiscovery   as   to    the   previously   unknown   meeting,   he   also   had\n\nlatitude to call a halt when three disinterested witnesses said\n\nthat no such agreement had been made.               As Seth stated in his\n\ndiscovery plan:       \"The prosecutor is unlikely to change his story\n\nunless confronted with detailed accounts of the meeting by other\n\nparticipants.\"        The detailed accounts turned out to support the\n\nprosecutors' prior consistent denials.\n\n            Seth also attacks the district judge's alternative ground\n\nfor bringing matters to a close, namely, that Joseph could not have\n\nbeen influenced in his testimony by a deal of which he was unaware.\n\nThis inference may go too far: a promise to Joseph of leniency in\n\nexchange for testimony would be the best basis for discrediting\n\nJoseph.   But, even if Joseph were unaware of a commitment only to\n\nhis lawyers, they might have encouraged him to help the government.\n\n            Yet this qualification is dwarfed by the reality that\n\nregardless of any \"agreement,\" secret or otherwise, Joseph already\n\nhad ample reason to tailor his testimony to please the prosecutor:\n\nhis plea was before Seth's trial, disposition came afterwards, and\n\nJoseph had reason to please prosecutors who might have a persuasive\n\nvoice as to his sentence.        But all this was known at the time of\n\nSeth's trial and Joseph was subject to full cross-examination as to\n\nthe details of his testimony and his own motives in helping the\n\nprosecution.

Vicki Bader--ex-wife of appellant\n\nSeth Bader--was murdered on August 24, 1996, seemingly in Stratham,\n\nNew Hampshire, and her body was found in a grave in Waterboro,\n\nMaine, on April 10, 1997.      Police were led to the body by 14-year-\n\nold Joseph Bader, who was Seth's adopted son and biological cousin.\n\nIn December 1997, Joseph agreed with the state to enter a plea of\n\n\"true\" to a juvenile delinquency petition, confessing that he\n\nassisted in helping Seth murder Vicki.\n\n             At Seth's trial in April and May 1998 in New Hampshire\n\nstate court, Joseph testified against Seth for four trial days.\n\nThe gist of the testimony was that Seth and his girlfriend Mary\n\nJean Martin had plotted to murder Vicki; that Seth had hired Sandro\n\nStuto to assist in the murder and to dispose of Vicki's car; that\n\nSeth had traveled to Maine with Joseph a few days before the\n\nmurder, located a spot in the woods and dug a grave; and that\n\nJoseph had kept Seth's younger son outside the house while the\n\nmurder was committed.\n\n             Joseph did not claim to have witnessed the murder, but,\n\naccording to his testimony, he had been called back into the house\n\nby   Stuto   after   the   murder   and   witnessed   his   adoptive   father\n\nemerging from the basement with a rifle barrel and a spent casing;\n\nJoseph had then helped clean up the blood.            Joseph also testified\n\nthat Seth had told him earlier that he (Seth) would shoot Vicki.\n\nJoseph further testified that he had then helped Seth transport and\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fbury Vicki's body in Maine and that on the way home he and Seth had\n\ngone shopping for new clothes.\n\n            The prosecution offered records of Seth's mobile phone to\n\nshow calls from Maine on the date of Vicki's death.             Credit card\n\nrecords showed Seth's card had been used that day to purchase pants\n\nin two different sizes, one pair of shoes and other items.                Seth\n\ndid not testify at his trial but the prosecution played a recording\n\nof a police interview for the jury in which Seth, while denying\n\nguilt, conceded that he might have driven with Joseph to Maine that\n\nday because of the good weather.\n\n              Stuto testified that on the day of the murder, he,\n\nMartin and Seth met together in the afternoon and agreed that Stuto\n\nwould dispose of Vicki's car after the murder, leaving it at a\n\nbookstore.      Seth   and   Stuto   drove   to   the   bookstore   and   then\n\nproceeded to Seth's house where, according to Stuto, Seth shot\n\nVicki.1    At trial the defense sought to call Martin, who refused to\n\ntestify.\n\n            Although the state primarily relied on the testimony of\n\nJoseph and Stuto, other evidence in addition to the mobile phone\n\nand credit card records was offered.         Vicki's lawyer testified as\n\nto Seth's aggressive efforts to reduce his financial obligations to\n\n\n     1\n      While in prison Stuto apparently recanted, saying that Joseph\nhad murdered Vicki in exchange for sexual favors from Martin and\nthat Seth had nothing to do with the murder. The district court\ndecided that Bader's habeas claim based on this recantation had no\nmerit, and this issue is not before us.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fVicki and to secure custody of their children.             In tape recordings\n\nof phone calls with Vicki, Seth expressed his obsession with\n\nholding onto and pleasing Martin and stated that Martin had said\n\nshe   would    leave   Seth   unless   he    won   the   alimony   and   custody\n\nlitigation.\n\n              A woman who regularly cleaned Seth's house testified to\n\nprior statements that Seth and his girlfriend wished Vicki were\n\ndead.       Vicki's doctor said that Vicki had told him that she\n\nremained overweight so that her body would be difficult to move if\n\nshe were killed.       The prosecution also sought to connect Seth with\n\na pipe bomb planted in Vicki's mailbox; one witness testified to\n\nSeth having a bomb-making book in his home.\n\n              The defense sought to discredit both Joseph and Stuto,\n\nemphasizing that Stuto had reached a deal for only five years in\n\nprison and that Joseph would do no time in prison.                  It offered\n\nevidence of Martin's deceptive character, her links to Joseph, and\n\nJoseph's hostility towards Vicki.               It also attempted to raise\n\ndoubts about the state's theory.2            In closing, the defense offered\n\nan alternative theory that, without Seth's involvement, Martin had\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      For example, the defense argued that Joseph's testimony about\nthe time of the murder could not be true because Joseph's testimony\nthat Seth and Stuto arrived at the Stratham, New Hampshire, house\naround 3 p.m. seemed to conflict with the fact that Seth had been\ncited for a traffic violation around 2:30 p.m. in Massachusetts.\nThe defense also noted that Joseph testified to several items that\nshould have been found buried with the body, but were not.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fconvinced Joseph to do the killing and that both Joseph and Martin\n\nstood to benefit from killing Vicki and framing Seth.\n\n            The    jury    convicted    Seth    of   first-degree     murder    and\n\nconspiracy to murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment on\n\nthe murder charge.         The New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed his\n\nconviction.    State v.

After Seth's\n\ntrial,    juvenile    court    hearings       were   held   to   track    Joseph's\n\nprogress;    but   Joseph     never    spent   any   time   in   a   correctional\n\nfacility.\n\n            In October 2002, Seth filed the present habeas case in\n\nfederal district court.

Giglio v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108471\"><a href=\"/opinion/108471/giglio-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154-55\n\n(1972).     Seth now conjectures that the agreement might have been\n\nkept secret from Joseph himself.\n\n            The    issue     whether    any    agreement    existed      had   been\n\nelaborately explored in the state proceedings.              In September 1997,\n\nprior to Seth's trial, the defense filed a motion for discovery of\n\n\"all details of all agreements and understandings with\" Joseph or\n\nother co-defendants.        When in December 1997 Joseph agreed to plead\n\nguilty in the juvenile proceedings, the state got court permission\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fand then disclosed to Seth's lawyers Joseph's juvenile court\n\nrecords.\n\n           On March 26, 1998, after Seth's trial had begun, he filed\n\na second motion for discovery, this time asking for all records\n\nrelating to communication between the Attorney General's office and\n\nJoseph's attorneys and documents relating to charging decisions\n\nmade by the Attorney General's office.     Defense counsel also made\n\noral motions at trial.     In response, the judge ordered that \"all\n\ndocuments in the file(s) relating to the juvenile filed in the\n\nFamily Court,\" including notes from therapists, be provided to the\n\ncourt.\n\n           The trial judge then reviewed in camera the documents\n\nthat the state had provided.    After this review, on April 9, 1998,\n\nthe state judge determined that the record did not contain any\n\nmaterial   \"which   is   exculpatory,   essential   to   the   defendant\n\nreceiving a fair trial, or which relate[s] to any understandings or\n\nagreements relative to plea decisions or other information which\n\ncan be construed as Giglio materials.\"\n\n           The prosecutor reaffirmed on April 10, 1998, that the\n\nstate had disclosed all agreements with Joseph and his attorneys.\n\nThe judge nevertheless ordered expedited access to the transcript\n\nof Joseph's plea hearing, which had occurred in December 1997.\n\nAlthough defense counsel inferred from tapes of that hearing that\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fa   leniency-for-testimony   agreement   existed,3   the   trial   judge\n\nlistened himself and ruled that there was no evidence of a deal\n\nrequiring Joseph to testify at Seth's trial.\n\n            At Seth's trial, the judge let Seth's trial counsel\n\ncross-examine Joseph about any such deal. Joseph admitted that his\n\nplea agreement meant that he would not be incarcerated even for\n\n\"one second,\" that the disposition hearing in his case would not\n\noccur until after Seth's trial, and that the juvenile court would\n\nknow of his testimony in Seth's trial.    But Joseph said that he had\n\nnot made any agreement to testify.4\n\n            Nevertheless, on his state appeal, Seth argued to the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court that Joseph's plea agreement was contingent\n\non his testifying against Seth and that the trial court had erred\n\nin finding to the contrary.     In rejecting the appeal, the court\n\nsaid:\n\n            There is no evidence in the extensive record\n            in this case to support a conclusion that the\n            trial court erred either in its finding\n            following the in camera review or in its\n\n\n        3\n      Defense counsel noted that at the juvenile plea hearing a\nstate attorney stated that \"Joseph will be testifying\" in Seth's\ntrial. But this was not listed as a term of the plea agreement,\nbut rather as part of a time line relating to Joseph. When the\njuvenile court judge explained the agreement to Joseph, he made no\nmention of testifying.\n        4\n      Shown a transcript of the plea agreement, he backtracked\nsomewhat; but in fact, the transcript confirms that the prosecutor\ntold the juvenile court only that Joseph was expected to testify\nagainst Seth--not that this was a term of the plea agreement or in\nexchange for leniency.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            finding of no evidence of a \"sine qua non\"\n            [sic] on the part of the State in return for\n            Joseph Bader's testimony. . . . Accordingly\n            the defendant cannot prevail in his effort to\n            secure a new trial on this issue as he has\n            failed to \"prove that the prosecution withheld\n            evidence that is favorable and material.\"\n\nBader, 808 A.2d at 22-23 (citations omitted).\n\n            In      federal   habeas   proceedings      directed   to    state\n\nprisoners, the federal statute provides that findings by the state\n\ncourt are conclusive unless overcome by clear and convincing\n\nevidence.     28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1) (2000).            The district court\n\ninitially dismissed Seth's Brady claim as one previously litigated\n\nand resolved, adding that Joseph could not have been influenced in\n\nhis testimony if a deal had existed but been kept secret from him.\n\n            Seth then discovered that a social worker had kept notes\n\nof   a   November    26,   1997,   meeting   attended   by   Joseph's   public\n\ndefenders, his social workers and a state prosecutor.                   Shortly\n\nafter the district court dismissed Seth's habeas petition, Seth\n\nsought reconsideration, accompanying the motion with affidavits\n\nfrom one of his own trial lawyers saying that he had not known of\n\nthe November 26, 1997, meeting.              The notes kept by one of the\n\nsocial workers attending the meeting said\n\n            Joe will be charged with conspiracy to commit\n            murder.    It would be appropriate to do\n            accomplice but that would mean being certified\n            as an adult and life in prison . . .

The district court found the\n\nplan overbroad because it covered unrelated issues but approved a\n\nsecond plan by Seth's counsel to depose the social workers.5\n\n          The depositions occurred, and the social workers recalled\n\nthat the prosecutor had said that he wanted Joseph to plead guilty\n\nbefore Seth's trial and be sentenced afterwards and that they\n\nunderstood that Joseph was expected to testify at Seth's trial.\n\nHowever, they also recalled no agreements--either for leniency in\n\nexchange for testimony or for anything else--being made at the\n\nNovember 26, 1997, meeting.\n\n          Seth's counsel then sought to depose the lawyers who had\n\nattended the meeting, including the prosecutor, but the district\n\ncourt refused, saying that there was no good cause for further\n\ndiscovery.   The judge repeated that if there had been a deal\n\nbetween prosecutor and defense counsel but this was unknown to\n\nJoseph--as Seth now suggested--it could not have affected his\n\n\n\n     5\n      In Bader's revised discovery motion, he stated that \"the\nthree social workers can claim no privilege of any sort, are not\ncommitted to any prior statements, and presumably are unfamiliar\nwith any legal theories of this case. They are the most likely of\nthe meeting's participants to offer unvarnished recollections.\"\n\n                               -9-\n\ftestimony and so could not undermine the court's confidence in the\n\nverdict.\n\n               The district court granted a certificate of appealability\n\nlimited to the supposed agreement.                    Seth argues to us (under\n\nseveral headings) the same central claim: that the district court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment against him because there\n\nremained      a    genuine    issue   of    fact   requiring   resolution    in   an\n\nevidentiary hearing, namely, whether the prosecutors concealed a\n\nleniency-for-testimony deal with Joseph or at least with his\n\nlawyers.

What Seth's habeas counsel recently\n\nfound was evidence of a specific meeting between Joseph's lawyers\n\nand the prosecutors.     But all this shows is an occasion on which a\n\nleniency-for-testimony agreement might have been made or disclosed.\n\nAnd, when the three social workers were deposed, they said there\n\nwas no agreement made or disclosed at the meeting.          This was hardly\n\nclear and convincing evidence that the state finding had been\n\nwrong.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            Just as the district judge had latitude to allow initial\n\ndiscovery   as   to    the   previously   unknown   meeting,   he   also   had\n\nlatitude to call a halt when three disinterested witnesses said\n\nthat no such agreement had been made.               As Seth stated in his\n\ndiscovery plan:       \"The prosecutor is unlikely to change his story\n\nunless confronted with detailed accounts of the meeting by other\n\nparticipants.\"        The detailed accounts turned out to support the\n\nprosecutors' prior consistent denials.\n\n            Seth also attacks the district judge's alternative ground\n\nfor bringing matters to a close, namely, that Joseph could not have\n\nbeen influenced in his testimony by a deal of which he was unaware.\n\nThis inference may go too far: a promise to Joseph of leniency in\n\nexchange for testimony would be the best basis for discrediting\n\nJoseph.   But, even if Joseph were unaware of a commitment only to\n\nhis lawyers, they might have encouraged him to help the government.\n\n            Yet this qualification is dwarfed by the reality that\n\nregardless of any \"agreement,\" secret or otherwise, Joseph already\n\nhad ample reason to tailor his testimony to please the prosecutor:\n\nhis plea was before Seth's trial, disposition came afterwards, and\n\nJoseph had reason to please prosecutors who might have a persuasive\n\nvoice as to his sentence.        But all this was known at the time of\n\nSeth's trial and Joseph was subject to full cross-examination as to\n\nthe details of his testimony and his own motives in helping the\n\nprosecution.     See Kyles v. Whitley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435 (1995)\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f(noting that the government's non-disclosure of evidence must have\n\nhad a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining\n\nthe jury's verdict\").\n\n           Faced with conflicting stories, the jury chose to believe\n\nJoseph.   Whether a secret leniency agreement, unknown to Joseph,\n\nwould have added much to available impeachment, may be open to\n\ndoubt.    But in any event, the district judge did not abuse his\n\ndiscretion in limiting discovery.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f</pre>",
