Cohen, Attorney, Tax Division, U.S. Department of\nJustice, with whom Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney General,\nand Regina S. Moriarty, Attorney, Tax Division, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                            May 4, 2007\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.   On May 14, 2004, Timothy J.\n\nBurke received a notice of deficiency from the Internal Revenue\n\nService (\"IRS\") stating that Burke owed taxes on his distributive\n\nshare of his partnership's income for 1998.    Burke petitioned the\n\ntax court for a redetermination of his tax liability, arguing that\n\nhe was not liable for tax on his 1998 distributive share because\n\nthe partnership's receipts were placed in escrow.     The tax court\n\nrejected Burke's argument and granted the IRS's motion for summary\n\njudgment.    Burke appeals the tax court's ruling.    After careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm.\n\n                            I. Background\n\n            On October 13, 1993, Burke formed a partnership with\n\nJeffrey Cohen named \"Cohen & Burke,\" agreeing to split the proceeds\n\nof the enterprise evenly after allocating a ten percent origination\n\nfee to the partner who generated new business.   In 1998, a dispute\n\narose between the two partners when Cohen allegedly refused to\n\ncomply with a superseding partnership agreement that linked the\n\ndistribution of the partnership's proceeds more tightly to each\n\npartner's individual efforts1 and stole money received by the\n\n\n1\n   Burke alleges that on January 1, 1996, Burke and Cohen entered\ninto an oral partnership agreement (the \"partnership agreement\"),\npursuant to which the partnership's income was to be allocated as\nfollows: (1) A guaranteed payment of 10 percent of the gross\nprofits from the tax return preparation business would be paid to\nthe originating partner; (2) 100 percent of the gross profits from\nlegal services attributable to each originating partner was\nallocated to that partner; (3) the remaining net profits were\nallocated equally to each partner; and (4) with respect to work\n\n                                 -2-\n\fpartnership.     As a result of the dispute, Burke filed suit against\n\nCohen in Massachusetts state court on October 4, 1999, alleging\n\nbreach   of     fiduciary     duty,   breach   of    contract,   deceit,     and\n\nconversion, and requesting an accounting.            Cohen and Burke agreed\n\nto keep the partnership receipts in an escrow account pending the\n\noutcome of the litigation.\n\n            Meanwhile, Cohen filed the partnership tax return for\n\n1998 reporting $242,000 in ordinary income, with $121,000 as each\n\npartner's      distributive    share.2       Burke   reported    zero   as   his\n\ndistributive share of partnership income and filed a notice of\n\ninconsistent determination stating that Cohen's partnership tax\n\nfiling was factually and legally inaccurate.\n\n            The Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued Burke a\n\nnotice of deficiency alleging that Burke had improperly failed to\n\nreport   his    distributive     share   of    partnership   income     on   his\n\nindividual return.          Burke timely petitioned the tax court for\n\nredetermination of the deficiency, claiming that his distribution\n\n\nreferred from one partner to the other,               a referral fee of 33\npercent of gross profits from the referred             work would be paid to\nthe referring partner. Burke prepared and              filed the partnership\nreturns for 1996 and 1997 in accordance                with the partnership\nagreement.\n2\n   Cohen's position in the state court litigation was that the\npartnership agreement was not valid and that each partner was\nentitled to fifty percent of the partnership's profits.      On\nOctober 16, 2002, the jury found for Burke \"with regard to the\npartnership between January 1, 1996 through December 31, 1998\";\ni.e., that the income of the partnership should be allocated\naccording to the partnership agreement.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fof partnership income from 1998 should not have been taxed that\n\nyear because the money was being held in escrow and he therefore\n\ndid not have access to it.     The IRS filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment arguing that, as a matter of law, a partner's distribution\n\nof partnership income was taxable in the year the partnership\n\nreceived the income, regardless of whether the partner actually\n\nreceived the distribution.   Burke filed an opposition to the IRS's\n\nmotion for summary judgment claiming that there were material facts\n\nin dispute precluding summary judgment in favor of the IRS and\n\nmoved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether he was\n\nrequired to report his distributive share of the 1998 partnership\n\nincome.   The tax court granted summary judgment in favor of the\n\nIRS, holding that Burke was required to include his distributive\n\nshare of partnership income for the 1998 taxable year even though\n\nhe had not yet received that distribution.\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\n          We review the award of summary judgment de novo.   State\n\nPolice Ass'n v. Comm'r, 125 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nA. Burke's 1998 Taxable Income\n\n          Section 701 of the Internal Revenue code provides that\n\n\"[a] partnership as such shall not be subject to the income tax\n\nimposed by this chapter.   Persons carrying on business as partners\n\nshall be liable for income tax only in their separate or individual\n\ncapacities.\" 26 U.S.C. § 701. Section 703(a) provides that \"[t]he\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\ftaxable income of a partnership shall be computed in the same\n\nmanner as in the case of an individual.\"              Id. § 703(a).\n\n           Burke argues that his distribution of partnership income\n\nfor 1998 should not have been taxed that year because that income\n\nwas (and remains) \"frozen\" in an escrow account, such that neither\n\nhe, nor his partner, has access to the income.                In support of his\n\nargument, Burke cites several cases (none of which deal with\n\npartnership or partner taxation) that hold that an individual\n\ntaxpayer must only include income to which he has a claim of right.\n\nSee, e.g., N. Am. Oil Consol. v. Burnet, 286 U.S. 417, 422 (1932)\n\n(holding that profits earned by taxpayer in a given year are not\n\ntaxable income until taxpayer \"first became entitled to them and\n\nwhen [taxpayer] actually received them\").\n\n           Citing § 703's language that \"[t]he taxable income of a\n\npartnership shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of\n\nan   individual,\"     Burke      contends     that   under    these    cases,   the\n\npartnership did not earn taxable income in 1998 because \"the\n\nrestriction of funds . . . defers the recognition of income at the\n\npartnership      level,     as   it   does     for   individuals,      until    the\n\nrestriction is removed.\"\n\n           But    §   703     does    not    help    Burke.     A     self-imposed\n\nrestriction on the availability of income cannot legally defer\n\nrecognition of that income.           See Reed v. Comm'r, 723 F.2d 138, 143\n\n(1st Cir. 1983) (\"[A] 'self-imposed limitation' created by the\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f[taxpayer] is legally ineffective to shift taxability on escrowed\n\nfunds from one year to the next.\").               The partnership received the\n\nmoney free and clear in 1998.                It was the individual partners,\n\nBurke and Cohen, who chose to place the funds in escrow –- not the\n\npartnership's clients or other persons owing the partnership money.\n\nCompare with id. at 142 (\"As long as the deferred payment agreement\n\nis binding between the parties and is made prior to the time when\n\nthe [taxpayer] has acquired an absolute and unconditional right to\n\nreceive payment, then the . . . taxpayer is not required to report\n\nthe . . . income until he actually receives [it].\").               Thus, Burke's\n\ncontentions have only to do with the individual partners' access to\n\nthe    funds    after     they    were      placed   in   escrow   and    not   the\n\npartnership's access to them.\n\n              It is well settled that partners' distributions are taxed\n\nin the year the partnership receives its earnings, regardless of\n\nwhether the partners actually receive their share of partnership\n\nearnings: \"Few principles of partnership taxation are more firmly\n\nestablished than that no matter the reason for nondistribution each\n\npartner must pay taxes on his distributive share.\"                 United States\n\nv. Bayse, 410 U.S. 441, 454 (1973); see also Heiner v. Mellon, 304\n\nU.S. 271, 281 (1938) (\"The tax is . . . imposed upon the partner's\n\nproportionate share of the net income of the partnership, and the\n\nfact   that    it   may   not    be   currently      distributable,   whether    by\n\nagreement      of   the   parties      or    by   operation   of   law,    is   not\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fmaterial.\"); 26 C.F.R. § 1.702-1 (providing that a partner must\n\nseparately account for his distributive share of partnership income\n\n\"whether or not distributed\").        Consistent with this long-standing\n\nprinciple, courts have uniformly held that partners must currently\n\nrecognize in their individual incomes their proportionate shares of\n\npartnership income, even if the partnership income was not actually\n\ndistributed to them for any reason, including disputes, consensual\n\narrangements, ignorance, concealment, or force of law.              See, e.g.,\n\nHeiner, 304 U.S. at 280-81 (holding partners liable for tax on\n\ntheir distributive share of liquidating partnership's net profits\n\nin   the   year   earned,    even   though   proceeds      from   the   sale   of\n\npartnership assets were not distributed until a year later); Comm'r\n\nv. Goldberger's Estate, 213 F.2d 78, 81-82 (3d Cir. 1954) (holding\n\ntaxpayer liable for distributive share of profits earned by joint\n\nventure, even though he was ignorant of the full extent of the\n\nprofits and did not receive his distributive share until years\n\nlater);3 Earle v. Comm'r, 38 F.2d 965, 967-68 (1st Cir. 1930)\n\n(requiring    members   of   partnership     which   was    dissolved    during\n\ntaxable period by death of one of the partners to report their\n\nrespective proportions of partnership income on their individual\n\n\n\n3\n  Under 26 U.S.C. § 7701(a)(2), the term \"partnership\" includes a\n\"joint venture . . ., through or by means of which any business,\nfinancial operation, or venture is carried on, and which is not,\nwithin the meaning of this title, a trust or estate or a\ncorporation; and the term 'partner' includes a member in such a\n. . . joint venture.\"\n\n                                      -7-\n\fincome tax return, whether distributed or not).     Thus, Burke was\n\nrequired to report his distributive share of the partnership's\n\nincome in 1998, even if he had not yet received it.\n\nB. Facts in Dispute\n\n           Burke also argues that the tax court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the IRS because there were facts in\n\ndispute which may affect the outcome of the lawsuit.      He claims\n\nthat the court incorrectly assumed Burke's taxable income for 1998\n\nwas \"approximately $151,000,\" when, in fact, that number was\n\ndisputed on the ground that it included money that Cohen had stolen\n\nfrom the partnership.\n\n           The IRS states (and the tax court found) that the IRS\n\nused Burke's own calculation of the partnership's gross receipts\n\nfor 1998, subtracting from that number Burke's calculations of the\n\nallegedly stolen funds, in arriving at Burke's taxable income for\n\n1998.   This assertion is supported by the record and Burke does not\n\ndirectly contest it.    Instead, he asserts -- without citing to the\n\nIRS's calculations -- that Cohen's tax filings were inaccurate\n\nbecause he had included the allegedly stolen partnership income in\n\nthe calculation of the partnership's gross receipts. Perhaps there\n\nwould have been a genuine issue of material fact if, in fact, the\n\nIRS had used Cohen's tax filings to arrive at the $151,000 figure\n\nfor 1998 taxable income to Burke, but the IRS did not.      The IRS\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fused Burke's calculations of partnership income.   Accordingly, the\n\nfacts to which Burke refers are not actually in dispute.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the tax court's\n\norder and opinion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

Comm'r,</i> 38 F.2d 965, 967-68 (1st Cir.1930) (requiring members of partnership which was dissolved during taxable period by death of one of the partners to report their respective proportions of partnership income on their individual income tax return, whether distributed or not). Thus, Burke was required to report his distributive share of the partnership's income in 1998, even if he had not yet received it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

He claims that the court incorrectly assumed Burke's taxable income for 1998 was \"approximately $151,000,\" when, in fact, that number was disputed on the ground that it included money that Cohen had stolen from the partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS states (and the tax court found) that the IRS used Burke's own calculation of the partnership's gross receipts for 1998, <i>subtracting from that number Burke's calculations of the allegedly stolen funds,</i> in arriving at Burke's taxable income for 1998. This assertion is supported by the record and Burke does not directly contest it. Instead, he asserts &#8212; without citing to the IRS's calculations &#8212; that <i>Cohen's tax filings</i> were inaccurate because he had included the allegedly stolen partnership income in the calculation of the partnership's gross receipts. Perhaps there would have been a genuine issue of material fact if, in fact, the IRS had used Cohen's tax filings to arrive at the $151,000 figure for 1998 taxable income to Burke, but the IRS did not. The IRS used Burke's calculations of partnership income.

Burke received a notice of deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") stating that Burke owed taxes on his distributive share of his partnership's income for 1998. Burke petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of his tax liability, arguing that he was not liable for tax on his 1998 distributive share because the partnership's receipts were placed in escrow. The tax court rejected Burke's argument and granted the IRS's motion for summary judgment. Burke appeals the tax court's ruling. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 13, 1993, Burke formed a partnership with Jeffrey Cohen named \"Cohen &amp; Burke,\" agreeing to split the proceeds of the enterprise evenly after allocating a ten percent origination fee to the partner who generated new business. In 1998, a dispute arose between the two partners when Cohen allegedly refused to comply with a superseding partnership agreement that linked the distribution of the partnership's proceeds more tightly to each partner's individual efforts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and stole money received by the partnership. As a result of the dispute, Burke filed suit against Cohen in Massachusetts state court on October 4, 1999, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, deceit, and conversion, and requesting an accounting. Cohen and Burke agreed to keep the partnership receipts in an escrow account pending the outcome of the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Cohen filed the partnership tax return for 1998 reporting $242,000 in ordinary income, with $121,000 as each partner's distributive share.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Burke reported zero as his distributive share of partnership income and filed a notice of inconsistent determination stating that Cohen's partnership tax filing was factually and legally inaccurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued Burke a notice of deficiency alleging that Burke had improperly failed to report his distributive share of partnership income on his individual return. Burke timely petitioned the tax court for redetermination of the deficiency, claiming that his distribution of partnership income from 1998 should not have been taxed that year because the money was being held in escrow and he therefore did not have access to it. The IRS filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that, as a matter of law, a partner's distribution of partnership income was taxable in the year the partnership received the income, regardless of whether the partner actually received the distribution. Burke filed an opposition to the IRS's motion for summary judgment claiming that there were material facts in dispute precluding summary judgment in favor of the IRS and moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether he was required to report his distributive share of the 1998 partnership income. The tax court granted summary judgment in favor of the IRS, holding that Burke was required to include his distributive share of partnership income for the 1998 taxable year even though he had not yet received that distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the award of summary judgment <i>de novo.

Burke's 1998 Taxable Income</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 701 of the Internal Revenue code provides that \"[a] partnership as such shall not be subject to the income tax imposed by this chapter. Persons carrying on business as partners shall be liable for income tax only in their separate or individual capacities.\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 701. Section 703(a) provides that \"[t]he taxable income of a partnership shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 703(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke argues that his distribution of partnership income for 1998 should not have been taxed that year because that income was (and remains) \"frozen\" in an escrow account, such that neither he, nor his partner, has access to the income. In support of his argument, Burke cites several cases (none of which deal with partnership or partner taxation) that hold that an individual taxpayer must only include income to which he has a claim of right. <i>See, e.g., N. Am. Oil Consol. v. Burnet,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101937\"><a href=\"/opinion/101937/north-american-oil-consol-v-burnet/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 422, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A self-imposed restriction on the availability of income cannot legally defer recognition of that income. <i>See Reed v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428531\"><a href=\"/opinion/428531/john-e-reed-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 143 (1st Cir.1983) (\"[A] `self-imposed limitation' created by the [taxpayer] is legally ineffective to shift taxability on escrowed funds from one year to the next.\"). The partnership received the money free and clear in 1998. It was the individual partners, Burke and Cohen, who chose to place the funds in escrow &#8212; not the partnership's clients or other persons owing the partnership money. <i>Compare with id.</i> at 142 (\"As long as the deferred payment agreement is binding between the parties and is made prior to the time when the [taxpayer] has acquired an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment, then the . . . taxpayer is not required to report the . . . income until he actually receives [it].\"). Thus, Burke's contentions have only to do with the individual partners' access to the funds after they were placed in escrow and not the partnership's access to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that partners' distributions are taxed in the year the partnership receives its earnings, regardless of whether the partners actually receive their share of partnership earnings: \"Few principles of partnership taxation are more firmly established than that no matter the reason for nondistribution each partner must pay taxes on his distributive share.\" <i>United States v.
