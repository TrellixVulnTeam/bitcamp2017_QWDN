Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Israel Roldán González for appellant.\n     Vanesa Vicéns Sánchez, with whom Juan Rafael González Muñoz\nand González Muñoz & Vicéns Sánchez were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                           March 1, 2006\n\f            LYNCH,      Circuit   Judge.       Israel     Forestier   Fradera,      a\n\nmunicipal assemblyman, filed this lawsuit against the Municipality\n\nof   Mayagüez     and     certain   municipal       officials.          He    sought\n\ncompensatory damages, among other relief, for emotional pain and\n\nsuffering    allegedly     caused    by    the    defendants'    discrimination\n\nagainst him because of his physical disability. The district court\n\ndismissed the claims on summary judgment.\n\n            On appeal, Forestier attempts to raise an issue regarding\n\nthe availability of damages for emotional distress under Title II\n\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),               42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-\n\n12134 -- a question that this court has twice considered but not\n\nfully resolved.      See Nieves-Márquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108,\n\n127 (1st Cir. 2003); Schultz v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n, 139\n\nF.3d 286, 290-91 (1st Cir. 1999).                We do not reach the damages\n\nissue here, because we hold that there is no evidence from which a\n\nreasonable      factfinder    could       infer    that     Forestier        suffered\n\ndiscrimination on account of his disability.\n\n                                          I.\n\n            As a result of a car accident in 1970, Forestier suffers\n\nfrom a gait-related impairment.            He wears an orthopedic device and\n\nrequires the assistance of a cane when walking both short and long\n\ndistances.    In the 1996 general elections in Puerto Rico, he was\n\nelected as an assemblyman to the Municipal Assembly of Mayagüez\n\n(\"Assembly\").     He won reelection in 2000, and, as a member of the\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fNew Progressive Party (NPP), was one of only three Assembly members\n\nwho were not part of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n          Meetings of the Assembly and its committees are held in\n\nthe Assembly Room, which is on the second floor of City Hall and,\n\nuntil March 2003, accessible only via a stairway.    Forestier has\n\nattended those meetings in the second-floor Assembly Room on a\n\nregular basis -- over four hundred times in all -- since the\n\nbeginning of his tenure. Climbing the stairs to reach the Assembly\n\nRoom caused him physical pain.\n\n          On March 17, 1997, Forestier requested from the Assembly\n\nPresident, Roberto Pérez Colón, permission to move to a seat at the\n\nrear of the Assembly Room, where he would have space to lean back,\n\nstand up, or move about when sitting became too uncomfortable.\n\nThat request for a reasonable accommodation was readily granted.\n\n          At some point later in 1997, Forestier requested a second\n\naccommodation from Pérez, in the form of the installation of an\n\nelevator at City Hall.1   No progress was made.   In a petition to\n\nthe Office of the Solicitor for Persons with Disabilities (OPPI) on\n\nMarch 17, 1998, Forestier alleged that the Municipality took no\n\naction on this request.\n\n\n\n     1\n          It is unclear from the record specifically when Forestier\nmade this request. His complaint alleges that he asked for the\nelevator on March 17, 1997, but his deposition testimony indicates\nthat he made the request later, after he had asked for, and was\ngranted, permission to move to a seat at the rear of the Assembly\nRoom.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f               At an administrative hearing before the OPPI on November\n\n14, 2000, the Municipality announced its intention to build an\n\nelevator as part of a large-scale project to remodel City Hall and\n\nagreed to present a report within thirty days on the status of the\n\nproject.       The Municipality also agreed to start that very week on\n\naccommodating a third request by Forestier: the installation of\n\nhandrails that would allow him to support himself as he walked up\n\nthe stairs to the second-floor Assembly Room.\n\n               When, as of January 11, 2001, the handrails had not been\n\ninstalled, the OPPI submitted a motion to the examiner who had\n\npresided over the November hearing, requesting that he order the\n\nMunicipality to comply with its earlier agreement to take immediate\n\nsteps    to     install    the    handrails.       The       examiner    issued    an\n\ninterlocutory order on January 18, 2001, requiring the Municipality\n\nto    report    within    ten    days   the    status   of    both   the   handrail\n\ninstallation and the remodeling project. Responding on January 30,\n\nthe Municipality stated that \"all steps were taken to install the\n\nhandrails,\" and that, \"after receiving various quotations,\" the\n\nMunicipality had contracted with a company.                  It explained \"[t]hat\n\nfor reasons beyond our control and the ordinary procedure of these\n\nprojects, the handrails have not been able to be installed [yet]\";\n\nhowever, it assured the OPPI that the contractor had \"informed us\n\nthat he expects to have [the handrails] installed by next week,\"\n\nand    asked    for   a   minimum   of   twenty    days      to   come   into     full\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fcompliance. The handrails were finally installed in February 2001.\n\n          According to the defendants, sometime in 2001 or 2002,\n\nthe Municipality became concerned that the remodeling of City Hall\n\nwould take longer than expected. It installed a temporary elevator\n\nfor Forestier, which would be removed when the permanent elevator\n\nis installed in the remodeled City Hall.             The temporary elevator\n\nwas installed in March 2003.\n\n          In the interim, on February 27, 2002, Forestier filed\n\nthis suit, seeking injunctive relief and punitive and compensatory\n\ndamages pursuant to Title II of the ADA, see 42 U.S.C. § 12133, and\n\ncertain provisions of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, see P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 1, §§ 501-511; id. tit. 31, § 5141.                  He named as\n\ndefendants   the   Municipality,   as    well   as    Pérez,   the   Assembly\n\nPresident, and José Guillermo Rodríguez, the Mayor of Mayagüez, in\n\ntheir official capacities.2 The defendants, his complaint alleged,\n\n\"act[ed] with malice and reckless indifference\" to his rights by\n\nfailing to make the City Hall building -- and specifically the\n\nAssembly Room -- accessible to him, thereby causing him to suffer\n\nphysical and emotional pain.\n\n          At the time Forestier filed his ADA complaint in court,\n\nthe temporary elevator had not yet been installed.             At an initial\n\n\n     2\n          The complaint also named Pérez and Rodríguez in their\npersonal capacities. Those defendants moved on September 3, 2002\nfor dismissal of the claims against them in their personal\ncapacities. Forestier acquiesced to the motion, which the district\ncourt granted on October 25, 2002.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fscheduling conference on December 18, 2002, the district court\n\ninstructed the defendants to notify the court before January 15,\n\n2003 whether the installation was complete.                 After requesting a\n\ncontinuance because \"the installation of the elevator ha[d] not\n\nbeen concluded due to the supplier's two week recess during the\n\nholidays,\" the defendants informed the court on January 29, 2003\n\nthat the installation of the elevator was scheduled to begin on\n\nFebruary 1; Forestier confirmed that the elevator was installed as\n\nof March 13.\n\n          This mooted Forestier's request for injunctive relief.\n\nConsequently,     at    a    January    8,   2004    pretrial   conference,      the\n\ndistrict court ordered the defendants to file a memorandum of law\n\naddressing the only legal issue that, in the court's view, remained\n\nunresolved   in   the       case   --   whether     Forestier   was   entitled   to\n\ncompensatory damages for his alleged emotional pain and suffering.3\n\n          In compliance with the order, on February 2, 2004, the\n\ndefendants submitted a memorandum, which was accompanied by two\n\nexhibits, requesting that the court dismiss Forestier's complaint\n\non two grounds: first, that Forestier had failed to show that Title\n\nII of the ADA provided for compensatory damages for emotional harm\n\nin a case such as this one; and second, that Forestier had no\n\n\n\n     3\n          According to the defendants, Forestier conceded at the\npretrial conference that he was not entitled to punitive damages.\nForestier does not dispute this; on appeal, he claims only\nentitlement to compensatory damages.\n\n                                         -6-\n\fviable Title II claim because he testified in his deposition that\n\npolitical discrimination, not disability discrimination, motivated\n\ndefendants' alleged delay in installing the elevator.               Forestier\n\nfiled a reply brief, which referred to defendants' exhibits, as\n\nwell as to five evidentiary proffers he made with his own filing.\n\n             The district court, treating the defendants' initial\n\nfiling as a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, denied the motion on April 25,\n\n2005, concluding that plaintiff's pleadings were sufficient to\n\nsurvive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge.         The defendants filed a motion\n\nfor reconsideration.\n\n             On June 30, 2005, the court reconsidered its April 25\n\norder.   It agreed with defendants that \"[o]nce extrinsic materials\n\nwere attached to their request [for dismissal], and referred to by\n\nplaintiff[] in [his] opposition, the motion understood to be under\n\nRule 12(b)(6) was converted into one under Rule 56.\"              Upon review\n\nof the record in its entirety, the court granted defendants' motion\n\nfor reconsideration and for summary judgment and dismissed with\n\nprejudice Forestier's federal claim.        It also declined to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over his claims under Puerto Rico law,\n\ndismissing them without prejudice.\n\n                                    II.\n\n             Forestier makes two arguments on appeal. He first argues\n\nthat   the   district   court   abused    its   discretion   in    converting\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdefendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a summary judgment motion.\n\nHe then attacks, on the merits, the court's summary judgment\n\ndecision.\n\n            The first challenge is mentioned but not developed in his\n\nbrief.   It thus amounts to waiver, and we do not address it.4   See\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort\n\nat developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n            Turning to the merits of the summary judgment dispute, we\n\nreview a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\nColburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div., 429 F.3d 325,\n\n329-30 (1st Cir. 2005), drawing all reasonable inferences in favor\n\nof Forestier, the non-movant, Nadherny v. Roseland Prop. Co., 390\n\nF.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2004). \"'Even in [disability] discrimination\n\ncases where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at\n\nissue,' summary judgment is appropriate if the non-moving party\n\nrests 'merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences,\n\n\n     4\n          In any event, the rule is clear that \"[i]f, on a [Rule\n12(b)(6)] motion . . . , matters outside the pleading are presented\nto and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as\none for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56,\nand all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present\nall material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\" Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b).    Forestier invited the conversion by submitting\nevidentiary proffers with his reply to defendants' memorandum. He\ncannot now claim to have been caught unawares by the conversion.\nSee Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc., 368 F.3d 1, 3 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2004).   He also had the opportunity to and did, in fact,\nsubmit   an   opposition     to   the   defendants'    motion   for\nreconsideration/summary judgment.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fand unsupported speculation.'\" Benoit v. Technical Mfg. Corp., 331\n\nF.3d 166, 173 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Feliciano de la Cruz v. El\n\nConquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n\"Thus, to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment,\n\nthe   nonmoving         party    must      establish      a    trial-worthy   issue     by\n\npresenting 'enough competent evidence to enable a finding favorable\n\nto the nonmoving party.'\"               LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d\n\n836, 842 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank of\n\nBoston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n             Title       II     of   the    ADA    provides      that   \"no   qualified\n\nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,\n\nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\n\nservices,    programs,          or   activities      of    a   public   entity,    or   be\n\nsubjected    to    discrimination           by    any   such    entity.\"      42   U.S.C.\n\n§   12132.        The    statute      requires      that       public   entities   \"take\n\nreasonable measures to remove architectural and other barriers to\n\n\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\faccessibility.\"5   Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531-32 (2004)\n\n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2)).\n\n          To survive summary judgment, a plaintiff claiming a\n\nviolation of Title II must produce evidence, sufficient to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact, from which a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould conclude:\n\n          (1) that he is a qualified individual with a\n          disability; (2) that he was either excluded\n          from participation in or denied the benefits\n          of some public entity's services, programs, or\n          activities or was otherwise discriminated\n          against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial\n          of benefits, or discrimination was by reason\n          of the plaintiff's disability.\n\n\n     5\n          The Supreme Court recently noted that the \"reasonable\naccommodation requirement can be satisfied in a number of ways\":\n\n          In the case of facilities built or altered\n          after 1992, the regulations require compliance\n          with specific architectural accessibility\n          standards.   But   in   the  case   of   older\n          facilities, for which structural change is\n          likely to be more difficult, a public entity\n          may comply with Title II by adopting a variety\n          of less costly measures, including relocating\n          services to alternative, accessible sites and\n          assigning aides to assist persons with\n          disabilities in accessing services. Only if\n          these measures are ineffective in achieving\n          accessibility is the public entity required to\n          make reasonable structural changes. And in no\n          event is the entity required to undertake\n          measures that would impose an undue financial\n          or administrative burden, threaten historic\n          preservation    interests,    or   effect    a\n          fundamental alteration in the nature of the\n          service.\n\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 532 (2004) (citations omitted)\n(citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(1); id. § 35.151).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fParker v. Universidad de P.R., 225 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            Here, the district court granted summary judgment in\n\npart6 because it found that on this record, Forestier could not\n\n\"prevail under the requirements set forth for [a Title II] claim.\"\n\nThe court determined that \"even if [it] were to assume that\n\n[Forestier] had a claim for compensatory damages,\" he had failed to\n\nadduce evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable factfinder to\n\ninfer that he \"was either excluded from participation in or denied\n\nthe    benefits   of   some   public    entity's   services,   programs,   or\n\nactivities[,] or was otherwise discriminated against.\"           We affirm,\n\nalbeit on a slightly different ground.             See Colburn, 429 F.3d at\n\n330.\n\n            There is no dispute here that Forestier is a \"qualified\n\nindividual with a disability\" within the meaning of the ADA, 42\n\n\n       6\n          The court also held that Forestier had no claim for\nemotional distress damages. It noted that although this circuit\nhas not definitively resolved the question whether compensatory\ndamages for emotional harm are available under Title II of the ADA,\nwe have held that, at a minimum, \"such damages [are] not available\nwhen there [is] no evidence of economic harm or animus toward the\ndisabled.\" Nieves-Márquez, 353 F.3d at 126-27 (citing Schultz, 139\nF.3d at 290-91).    Forestier, the court found, neither alleged\neconomic harm nor proffered evidence sufficient to show that\ndefendants discriminated against him on account of his disability.\nOn appeal, Forestier does not dispute that he failed to allege\neconomic harm, but he does argue that he is entitled to\ncompensatory damages for emotional pain and suffering because\ndefendants' delay in handling his requests for reasonable\naccommodations was motivated by disability-based animus and\nconstituted intentional discrimination.    Again, we do not reach\nthis issue of damages.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fU.S.C. § 12131(2).      However, he has failed to make a sufficient\n\nshowing as to the third element of a Title II claim -- the\n\nrequirement that the defendants discriminated against him \"by\n\nreason of [his] disability.\"         Id.\n\n            Forestier argues that the \"time table of the facts of\n\nthis case establishes. . . intentional discrimination by Appellees\n\ntoward Appellant's disability.\"            He emphasizes that despite the\n\nMunicipality's      agreement   at   the    November   2000    administrative\n\nhearing to install the bannister and elevator, the handrail was not\n\ninstalled until February 2001 and the temporary elevator was not\n\ninstalled   until    March   2003,   almost    six   years    after   he   first\n\nrequested the accommodation from Pérez.          Moreover, he argues that\n\nthe Municipality only took action when prompted by administrative\n\nintervention or the threat of a federal lawsuit.                  From this,\n\nForestier suggests, a reasonable factfinder could infer that the\n\ndefendants acted with malice or reckless indifference amounting to\n\ndiscrimination toward him on account of his disability.\n\n            The defendants admit that there was some delay in the\n\ninstallation of the temporary elevator. They attribute that delay,\n\nhowever, to \"bureaucratic inertia,\" the inevitable complications\n\narising from a major, publicly funded construction project on a\n\nhistoric building.      They point out that when it became clear that\n\nthe installation of the permanent elevator was delayed along with\n\nthe renovation of City Hall, they offered to, and did, install a\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\ftemporary elevator.   That effort, too, was hampered by red tape.\n\nThey argue that no discriminatory action was ever taken against the\n\nplaintiff.\n\n          Although a chronology of events may be helpful to show an\n\ninference of discrimination, no such inference would be reasonable\n\non the record here.   The record simply lacks any reasonable basis\n\nfor an inference that the delay in accomplishing the accommodation\n\n-- that is, the installation of the elevator -- was because of\n\nForestier's disability.     Not even Forestier's complaint alleges,\n\nexcept in the most conclusory fashion, a connection between the\n\nMunicipality's delay in installing the elevator and any disability-\n\nbased animus on defendants' part.\n\n          There is a second reason Forestier's claim fails. He did\n\nnot merely fail to offer specific evidence of disability-based\n\ndiscrimination.   The record shows that he actually explicitly\n\ndisavowed the allegation.    In his deposition testimony, Forestier\n\nattributed defendants' delay in installing the elevator solely to\n\npolitical discrimination on account of his membership in the\n\nminority party, the NPP.7       When asked his opinion as to why\n\ndefendants' actions were discriminatory, Forestier replied:\n\n          A:     Why was it discriminatory? Because it\n          so happens that the only Legislator that\n          arrived at this municipality to oversee the\n\n\n     7\n          Pérez is a member of the PDP, as presumably is Rodríguez,\nalthough the latter's political affiliation is not documented in\nthe record.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            Municipality of Mayagüez and the Mayor, was\n            yours truly.\n\n            Q:     That is, that you understood that since\n            the beginning . . . when [the installation of\n            the elevator and handrail] started to be\n            delayed it was because you are an NPP?\n\n            A:          Eh, of course!\n\n            Q:     And you knew this at the time this\n            complaint was filed?\n\n            A:          Well, of course.\n\nHe   made   no    mention    of     animus   toward    him   on    account   of   his\n\ndisability.\n\n            The        inherently     weak   and      improbable     inference    of\n\ndisability-based animus is further weakened when put into context\n\nagainst the rest of the record.                  The record shows that every\n\naccommodation plaintiff asked for was granted: the defendants\n\ntimely relocated him to the rear of the Assembly Hall so that he\n\nwould be more comfortable; provided him, within a few months of\n\nbeing asked to do so at the hearing, with the handrail on the\n\nstairs to assist him while the elevator was in the process of being\n\ninstalled;       and    installed     a   temporary    elevator     --   solely    to\n\naccommodate Forestier -- when it became clear that the installation\n\nof the permanent elevator as part of the remodeling of City Hall\n\nwould take longer than expected.                 The district court accurately\n\nnoted that the \"Municipality has shown a true good faith effort to\n\ncomply with the law by acceding to plaintiff's [every] request.\"\n\nPlaintiff's \"mere conclusory suspicion\" to the contrary \"is no\n\n                                          -14-\n\fsubstitute for specific evidence that discrimination [on account of\n\na prohibited category] was involved.\"   Quinones v.

He sought compensatory damages, among other relief, for emotional pain and suffering allegedly caused by the defendants' discrimination against him because of his physical disability. The district court dismissed the claims on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Forestier attempts to raise an issue regarding the availability of damages for emotional distress under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12131-12134&#8212;a question that this court has twice considered but not fully resolved. <i>See Nieves-M&#225;rquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 127 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Schultz v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n,</i> 139 F.3d 286, 290-91 (1st Cir. 1998). We do not reach the damages issue here, because we hold that there is no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that Forestier suffered discrimination on account of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of a car accident in 1970, Forestier suffers from a gait-related impairment. He wears an orthopedic device and requires the assistance of a cane when walking both short and long distances. In the 1996 general elections in Puerto Rico, he was elected as an assemblyman to the Municipal Assembly of Mayag&#252;ez (\"Assembly\"). He won reelection in 2000, and, as a member of the New Progressive Party (NPP), was one of only three Assembly members who were not part of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meetings of the Assembly and its committees are held in the Assembly Room, which is on the second floor of City Hall and, until March 2003, accessible only via a stairway. Forestier has attended those meetings in the second-floor Assembly Room on a regular basis&#8212;over four hundred times in all&#8212;since the beginning of his tenure. Climbing the stairs to reach the Assembly Room caused him physical pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 17, 1997, Forestier requested from the Assembly President, Roberto P&#233;rez Col&#243;n, permission to move to a seat at the rear of the Assembly Room, where he would have space to lean back, stand up, or move about when sitting became too uncomfortable. That request for a reasonable accommodation was readily granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point later in 1997, Forestier requested a second accommodation from P&#233;rez, in the form of the installation of an elevator at City Hall.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> No progress was made. In a petition to the Office of the Solicitor for Persons with Disabilities (OPPI) on March 17, 1998, Forestier alleged that the Municipality took no action on this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At an administrative hearing before the OPPI on November 14, 2000, the Municipality announced its intention to build an elevator as part of a large-scale project to remodel City Hall and agreed to present a report within thirty days on the status of the project. The Municipality also agreed to start that very week on accommodating a third request by Forestier: the installation of handrails that would allow him to support himself as he walked up the stairs to the second-floor Assembly Room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as of January 11, 2001, the handrails had not been installed, the OPPI submitted a motion to the examiner who had presided over the November hearing, requesting that he order the Municipality to comply with its earlier agreement to take immediate steps to install the handrails. The examiner issued an interlocutory order on January 18, 2001, requiring the Municipality to report within ten days the status of both the handrail installation and the remodeling project. Responding on January 30, the Municipality stated that \"all steps were taken to install the handrails,\" and that, \"after receiving various quotations,\" the Municipality had contracted with a company. It explained \"[t]hat for reasons beyond our control and the ordinary procedure of these projects, the handrails have not been able to be installed [yet]\"; however, it assured the OPPI that the contractor had \"informed us that he expects to have [the handrails] installed by next week,\" and asked for a minimum of twenty days to come into full compliance. The handrails were finally installed in February 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the defendants, sometime in 2001 or 2002, the Municipality became concerned that the remodeling of City Hall would take longer than expected. It installed a temporary elevator for Forestier, which would be removed when the permanent elevator is installed in the remodeled City Hall. The temporary elevator was installed in March 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interim, on February 27, 2002, Forestier filed this suit, seeking injunctive relief and punitive and compensatory damages pursuant to Title II of the ADA, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12133, and certain provisions of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167;&#167; 501-511; <i>id.</i> tit. 31, &#167; 5141. He named as defendants the Municipality, as well as P&#233;rez, the Assembly President, and Jos&#233; Guillermo Rodr&#237;guez, the Mayor of Mayag&#252;ez, in their official capacities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The defendants, his complaint alleged, \"act[ed] with malice and reckless indifference\" to his rights by failing to make the City Hall building&#8212;and specifically the Assembly Room&#8212;accessible to him, thereby causing him to suffer physical and emotional pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time Forestier filed his ADA complaint in court, the temporary elevator had not yet been installed. At an initial scheduling conference on December 18, 2002, the district court instructed the defendants to notify the court before January 15, 2003 whether the installation was complete. After requesting a continuance because \"the installation of the elevator ha[d] not been concluded due to the supplier's two week recess during the holidays,\" the defendants informed the court on January 29, 2003 that the installation of the elevator was scheduled to begin on February 1; Forestier confirmed that the elevator was installed as of March 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This mooted Forestier's request for injunctive relief. Consequently, at a January 8, 2004 pretrial conference, the district court ordered the defendants to file a memorandum of law addressing the only legal issue that, in the court's view, remained unresolved in the case&#8212;whether Forestier was entitled to compensatory damages for his alleged emotional pain and suffering.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In compliance with the order, on February 2, 2004, the defendants submitted a memorandum, which was accompanied by two exhibits, requesting that the court dismiss Forestier's complaint on two grounds: first, that Forestier had failed to show that Title II of the ADA provided for compensatory damages for emotional harm in a case such as this one; and second, that Forestier had no viable Title II claim because he testified in his deposition that political discrimination, not disability discrimination, motivated defendants' alleged delay in installing the elevator. Forestier filed a reply brief, which referred to defendants' exhibits, as well as to five evidentiary proffers he made with his own filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, treating the defendants' initial filing as a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, denied the motion on April 25, 2005, concluding that plaintiff's pleadings were sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge. The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 2005, the court reconsidered its April 25 order. It agreed with defendants that \"[o]nce extrinsic materials were attached to their request [for dismissal], and referred to by plaintiff[] in [his] opposition, the motion understood to be under Rule 12(b)(6) was converted into one under Rule 56.\" Upon review of the record in its entirety, the court granted defendants' motion for reconsideration and for summary judgment and dismissed with prejudice Forestier's federal claim. It also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his claims under Puerto Rico law, dismissing them without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forestier makes two arguments on appeal. He first argues that the district court abused its discretion in converting defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a summary judgment motion. He then attacks, on the merits, the court's summary judgment decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first challenge is mentioned but not developed in his brief. It thus amounts to waiver, and we do not address it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits of the summary judgment dispute, we review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, <i>Colburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div.,</i> 429 F.3d 325, 329-30 (1st Cir.2005), drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Forestier, the non-movant, <i>Nadherny v. Roseland Prop. Co.,</i> 390 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir.2004). \"`Even in [disability] discrimination cases where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue,' summary judgment is appropriate if the non-moving party rests `merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.'\" <i>Benoit v.

However, he has failed to make a sufficient showing as to the third element of a Title II claim&#8212;the requirement that the defendants discriminated against him \"by reason of [his] disability.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forestier argues that the \"time table of the facts of this case establishes . . . intentional discrimination by Appellees toward Appellant's disability.\" He emphasizes that despite the Municipality's agreement at the November 2000 administrative hearing to install the bannister and elevator, the handrail was not installed until February 2001 and the temporary elevator was not installed until March 2003, almost six years after he first requested the accommodation from P&#233;rez. Moreover, he argues that the Municipality only took action when prompted by administrative intervention or the threat of a federal lawsuit. From this, Forestier suggests, a reasonable factfinder could infer that the defendants acted with malice or reckless indifference amounting to discrimination toward him on account of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants admit that there was some delay in the installation of the temporary elevator. They attribute that delay, however, to \"bureaucratic inertia,\" the inevitable complications arising from a major, publicly funded construction project on a historic building. They point out that when it became clear that the installation of the permanent elevator was delayed along with the renovation of City Hall, they offered to, and did, install a temporary elevator. That effort, too, was hampered by red tape. They argue that no discriminatory action was ever taken against the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a chronology of events may be helpful to show an inference of discrimination, no such inference would be reasonable on the record here. The record simply lacks any reasonable basis for an inference that the delay in accomplishing the accommodation&#8212;that is, the installation of the elevator&#8212;was because of Forestier's disability. Not even Forestier's complaint alleges, except in the most conclusory fashion, a connection between the Municipality's delay in installing the elevator and any disability-based animus on defendants' part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a second reason Forestier's claim fails. He did not merely fail to offer specific evidence of disability-based discrimination. The record shows that he actually <i>explicitly disavowed</i> the allegation. In his deposition testimony, Forestier attributed defendants' delay in installing the elevator solely to <i>political</i> discrimination on account of his membership in the minority party, the NPP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> When asked his opinion as to why defendants' actions were discriminatory, Forestier replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Why was it discriminatory? Because it so happens that the only Legislator that arrived at this municipality to oversee the Municipality of Mayag&#252;ez and the Mayor, was yours truly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: That is, that you understood that since the beginning ... when [the installation of the elevator and handrail] started to be delayed it was because you are an NPP?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Eh, of course!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And you knew this at the time this complaint was filed?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Well, of course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He made no mention of animus toward him on account of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inherently weak and improbable inference of disability-based animus is further weakened when put into context against the rest of the record. The record shows that every accommodation plaintiff asked for was granted: the defendants timely relocated him to the rear of the Assembly Hall so that he would be more comfortable; provided him, within a few months of being asked to do so at the hearing, with the handrail on the stairs to assist him while the elevator was in the process of being installed; and installed a temporary elevator&#8212;solely to accommodate Forestier&#8212;when it became clear that the installation of the permanent elevator as part of the remodeling of City Hall would take longer than expected. The district court accurately noted that the \"Municipality has shown a true good faith effort to comply with the law by acceding to plaintiff's [every] request.\" Plaintiff's \"mere conclusory suspicion\" to the contrary \"is no substitute for specific evidence that discrimination [on account of a prohibited category] was involved.\" <i>Quinones v.

Only if these measures are ineffective in achieving accessibility is the public entity required to make reasonable structural changes.

He wears an orthopedic device and requires the assistance of a cane when walking both short and long distances. In the 1996 general elections in Puerto Rico, he was elected as an assemblyman to the Municipal Assembly of Mayag&#252;ez (\"Assembly\"). He won reelection in 2000, and, as a member of the New Progressive Party (NPP), was one of only three Assembly members who were not part of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meetings of the Assembly and its committees are held in the Assembly Room, which is on the second floor of City Hall and, until March 2003, accessible only via a stairway. Forestier has attended those meetings in the second-floor Assembly Room on a regular basis&#8212;over four hundred times in all&#8212;since the beginning of his tenure. Climbing the stairs to reach the Assembly Room caused him physical pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 17, 1997, Forestier requested from the Assembly President, Roberto P&#233;rez Col&#243;n, permission to move to a seat at the rear of the Assembly Room, where he would have space to lean back, stand up, or move about when sitting became too uncomfortable. That request for a reasonable accommodation was readily granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point later in 1997, Forestier requested a second accommodation from P&#233;rez, in the form of the installation of an elevator at City Hall.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> No progress was made. In a petition to the Office of the Solicitor for Persons with Disabilities (OPPI) on March 17, 1998, Forestier alleged that the Municipality took no action on this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At an administrative hearing before the OPPI on November 14, 2000, the Municipality announced its intention to build an elevator as part of a large-scale project to remodel City Hall and agreed to present a report within thirty days on the status of the project. The Municipality also agreed to start that very week on accommodating a third request by Forestier: the installation of handrails that would allow him to support himself as he walked up the stairs to the second-floor Assembly Room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as of January 11, 2001, the handrails had not been installed, the OPPI submitted a motion to the examiner who had presided over the November hearing, requesting that he order the Municipality to comply with its earlier agreement to take immediate steps to install the handrails. The examiner issued an interlocutory order on January 18, 2001, requiring the Municipality to report within ten days the status of both the handrail installation and the remodeling project. Responding on January 30, the Municipality stated that \"all steps were taken to install the handrails,\" and that, \"after receiving various quotations,\" the Municipality had contracted with a company. It explained \"[t]hat for reasons beyond our control and the ordinary procedure of these projects, the handrails have not been able to be installed [yet]\"; however, it assured the OPPI that the contractor had \"informed us that he expects to have [the handrails] installed by next week,\" and asked for a minimum of twenty days to come into full compliance. The handrails were finally installed in February 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the defendants, sometime in 2001 or 2002, the Municipality became concerned that the remodeling of City Hall would take longer than expected. It installed a temporary elevator for Forestier, which would be removed when the permanent elevator is installed in the remodeled City Hall. The temporary elevator was installed in March 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interim, on February 27, 2002, Forestier filed this suit, seeking injunctive relief and punitive and compensatory damages pursuant to Title II of the ADA, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12133, and certain provisions of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167;&#167; 501-511; <i>id.</i> tit. 31, &#167; 5141. He named as defendants the Municipality, as well as P&#233;rez, the Assembly President, and Jos&#233; Guillermo Rodr&#237;guez, the Mayor of Mayag&#252;ez, in their official capacities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The defendants, his complaint alleged, \"act[ed] with malice and reckless indifference\" to his rights by failing to make the City Hall building&#8212;and specifically the Assembly Room&#8212;accessible to him, thereby causing him to suffer physical and emotional pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time Forestier filed his ADA complaint in court, the temporary elevator had not yet been installed. At an initial scheduling conference on December 18, 2002, the district court instructed the defendants to notify the court before January 15, 2003 whether the installation was complete. After requesting a continuance because \"the installation of the elevator ha[d] not been concluded due to the supplier's two week recess during the holidays,\" the defendants informed the court on January 29, 2003 that the installation of the elevator was scheduled to begin on February 1; Forestier confirmed that the elevator was installed as of March 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This mooted Forestier's request for injunctive relief. Consequently, at a January 8, 2004 pretrial conference, the district court ordered the defendants to file a memorandum of law addressing the only legal issue that, in the court's view, remained unresolved in the case&#8212;whether Forestier was entitled to compensatory damages for his alleged emotional pain and suffering.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In compliance with the order, on February 2, 2004, the defendants submitted a memorandum, which was accompanied by two exhibits, requesting that the court dismiss Forestier's complaint on two grounds: first, that Forestier had failed to show that Title II of the ADA provided for compensatory damages for emotional harm in a case such as this one; and second, that Forestier had no viable Title II claim because he testified in his deposition that political discrimination, not disability discrimination, motivated defendants' alleged delay in installing the elevator. Forestier filed a reply brief, which referred to defendants' exhibits, as well as to five evidentiary proffers he made with his own filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, treating the defendants' initial filing as a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, denied the motion on April 25, 2005, concluding that plaintiff's pleadings were sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge. The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 2005, the court reconsidered its April 25 order. It agreed with defendants that \"[o]nce extrinsic materials were attached to their request [for dismissal], and referred to by plaintiff[] in [his] opposition, the motion understood to be under Rule 12(b)(6) was converted into one under Rule 56.\" Upon review of the record in its entirety, the court granted defendants' motion for reconsideration and for summary judgment and dismissed with prejudice Forestier's federal claim. It also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his claims under Puerto Rico law, dismissing them without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forestier makes two arguments on appeal. He first argues that the district court abused its discretion in converting defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a summary judgment motion. He then attacks, on the merits, the court's summary judgment decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first challenge is mentioned but not developed in his brief.

However, he has failed to make a sufficient showing as to the third element of a Title II claim&#8212;the requirement that the defendants discriminated against him \"by reason of [his] disability.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forestier argues that the \"time table of the facts of this case establishes . . . intentional discrimination by Appellees toward Appellant's disability.\" He emphasizes that despite the Municipality's agreement at the November 2000 administrative hearing to install the bannister and elevator, the handrail was not installed until February 2001 and the temporary elevator was not installed until March 2003, almost six years after he first requested the accommodation from P&#233;rez. Moreover, he argues that the Municipality only took action when prompted by administrative intervention or the threat of a federal lawsuit. From this, Forestier suggests, a reasonable factfinder could infer that the defendants acted with malice or reckless indifference amounting to discrimination toward him on account of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants admit that there was some delay in the installation of the temporary elevator. They attribute that delay, however, to \"bureaucratic inertia,\" the inevitable complications arising from a major, publicly funded construction project on a historic building. They point out that when it became clear that the installation of the permanent elevator was delayed along with the renovation of City Hall, they offered to, and did, install a temporary elevator. That effort, too, was hampered by red tape. They argue that no discriminatory action was ever taken against the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a chronology of events may be helpful to show an inference of discrimination, no such inference would be reasonable on the record here. The record simply lacks any reasonable basis for an inference that the delay in accomplishing the accommodation&#8212;that is, the installation of the elevator&#8212;was because of Forestier's disability. Not even Forestier's complaint alleges, except in the most conclusory fashion, a connection between the Municipality's delay in installing the elevator and any disability-based animus on defendants' part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a second reason Forestier's claim fails. He did not merely fail to offer specific evidence of disability-based discrimination. The record shows that he actually <i>explicitly disavowed</i> the allegation. In his deposition testimony, Forestier attributed defendants' delay in installing the elevator solely to <i>political</i> discrimination on account of his membership in the minority party, the NPP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> When asked his opinion as to why defendants' actions were discriminatory, Forestier replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Why was it discriminatory?

The record shows that every accommodation plaintiff asked for was granted: the defendants timely relocated him to the rear of the Assembly Hall so that he would be more comfortable; provided him, within a few months of being asked to do so at the hearing, with the handrail on the stairs to assist him while the elevator was in the process of being installed; and installed a temporary elevator&#8212;solely to accommodate Forestier&#8212;when it became clear that the installation of the permanent elevator as part of the remodeling of City Hall would take longer than expected. The district court accurately noted that the \"Municipality has shown a true good faith effort to comply with the law by acceding to plaintiff's [every] request.\" Plaintiff's \"mere conclusory suspicion\" to the contrary \"is no substitute for specific evidence that discrimination [on account of a prohibited category] was involved.\" <i>Quinones v.

But in the case of older facilities, for which structural change is likely to be more difficult, a public entity may comply with Title II by adopting a variety of less costly measures, including relocating services to alternative, accessible sites and assigning aides to assist persons with disabilities in accessing services. Only if these measures are ineffective in achieving accessibility is the public entity required to make reasonable structural changes. And in no event is the entity required to undertake measures that would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, threaten historic preservation interests, or effect a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tennessee v.

It noted that although this circuit has not definitively resolved the question whether compensatory damages for emotional harm are available under Title II of the ADA, we have held that, at a minimum, \"such damages [are] not available when there [is] no evidence of economic harm or animus toward the disabled.\"<i>Nieves-M&#225;rquez,</i> 353 F.3d at 126-27 (citing <i>Schultz,</i> 139 F.3d at 290-91). Forestier, the court found, neither alleged economic harm nor proffered evidence sufficient to show that defendants discriminated against him on account of his disability. On appeal, Forestier does not dispute that he failed to allege economic harm, but he does argue that he is entitled to compensatory damages for emotional pain and suffering because defendants' delay in handling his requests for reasonable accommodations was motivated by disability-based animus and constituted intentional discrimination. Again, we do not reach this issue of damages.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> P&#233;rez is a member of the PDP, as presumably is Rodr&#237;guez, although the latter's political affiliation is not documented in the record</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
