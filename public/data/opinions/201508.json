Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                      Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     James H.

Pro se plaintiff-appellant James H. Hart\n\n(\"Hart\") appeals from a judgment entered after a jury verdict\n\ndenying him relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a), for his sexual harassment claim, alleging\n\nvarious trial errors.      Hart also appeals from the prior dismissal\n\nof his other claims.      We affirm.1\n\n            Hart, who was represented by counsel at trial, did not\n\nobject to the alleged trial errors.          Accordingly, our review is\n\nonly for plain error.       Microfinancial, Inc. v. Premier Holidays\n\nInt'l, Inc., 385 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir. 2004).           Hart first argues\n\nthat the court erred by allowing defendant Verizon Communications,\n\nInc. (\"Verizon\") to introduce evidence of Hart's conviction for\n\noperating a motor vehicle under the influence (\"OUI\"). In response\n\nto Hart's pre-trial motion to preclude use of this conviction, the\n\ncourt had initially limited Verizon's cross-examination to the\n\nfacts of his OUI arrest and prohibited Verizon from eliciting the\n\nfact of his conviction. In response to questions about his arrest,\n\nhowever, Hart volunteered that a juror had told him \"You have\n\ngrounds for a mistrial.\"        Hart later said that the arrest was\n\nupsetting   but   the   trial   \"was    vindication   for   me   after   what\n\n\n     1\n       We do not address defendants' separate contention that\nHart's appeal fails because of his brief's flagrant failure to\ncomply with the procedural requirements of the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure.     A pro se party is not insulated from\ncomplying with those rules. Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 890\n(1st Cir. 1997). Because Hart's appeal lacks substantive merit, we\nelect to proceed on that basis.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fhappened.\"     The court then permitted Verizon to inquire into the\n\nresult of that trial, without objection from Hart's counsel.\n\nBecause Hart opened the door to the actual result of his OUI trial,\n\nthe court did not err in allowing the inquiry into his conviction.\n\nSee, e.g., Beck v. Haik, 377 F.3d 624, 642 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding\n\nthat testimony of drowning victim's mother that victim \"wasn't\n\nconvicted\" when asked on cross-examination in civil rights action\n\nwhether he had ever gotten into trouble opened door to question\n\nregarding whether victim had ever gone to prison).                Hart also\n\nargues that the court erred by allowing evidence of a prior\n\nconviction for contempt.      Verizon, however, never offered evidence\n\nof that conviction.\n\n             Hart next argues that the court erred by excluding the\n\ntestimony and/or affidavits of certain present and former Verizon\n\nemployees.    Hart never called any of them as witnesses or sought to\n\nintroduce any of their affidavits.           Accordingly, there was no\n\nerror.   See, e.g., Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corp., 780 F.2d 124,\n\n140   (1st   Cir.   1985)   (noting   that   claim   of   error   cannot   be\n\npredicated upon evidence which is never actually offered to court).\n\n             Hart further argues that the court erred in allowing an\n\nimproper comment by the court's clerk.        There is no record of this\n\ncomment in the trial transcript.        Nor did Hart ever bring it to the\n\ndistrict court's attention.      Thus, the court could not have erred\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fin failing to address an allegation articulated for the first time\n\non appeal.\n\n          Hart also argues that the court violated his due process\n\nrights by dismissing his other claims prior to trial without\n\nholding a hearing, despite his request for oral argument.                       Hart\n\ncontends that he should have been afforded a hearing because he was\n\nproceeding   pro se      at   the   time.    A    pro     se   plaintiff   is    not\n\nautomatically entitled to a hearing.               Here, Hart presented his\n\nposition in writing in his opposition to defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss, and, more importantly, has not pointed to any relevant\n\nfactual question     or    legal    theory   that   he     was   precluded      from\n\nbringing to the court's attention by lack of a hearing.               Thus, this\n\nclaim has no merit.\n\n          We   add   a    few   comments.        Hart's    brief   makes   vague,\n\nfragmentary and passing references to some other claims.                   We need\n\nnot consider them.        See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (noting that issues raised in perfunctory manner\n\nare deemed waived).       Also, Hart attaches to his brief a court order\n\ndismissing a second action against Verizon.               This action was filed\n\nwhile the present case against Verizon was pending and dismissed on\n\nres judicata grounds after final judgment had entered in this case.\n\nHart appealed from the dismissal of the second action, but the\n\nappeal was dismissed after he failed to file an opening brief.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fWhile Hart appears to be seeking a second bite at the apple, that\n\nsecond action is not properly before us.\n\n          Hart's motion for oral argument is denied.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is summarily affirmed.\n\nSee Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
