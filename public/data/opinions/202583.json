Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Irene M.

This case presents an issue\n\nof the proper allocation of the burden of proof in cases of alleged\n\ndiscriminatory treatment under the Uniformed Services Employment\n\nand Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (“USERRA”), 38 U.S.C. § 4301 et\n\nseq.    This is the first time that we have been called upon to\n\naddress this issue.        Plaintiff-appellant Carlos Velázquez-García\n\n(“Velázquez”) sued his former employer, defendant-appellee Horizon\n\nLines of Puerto Rico (“Horizon”), alleging that he had been fired\n\nfrom his job due to his military service, in violation of USERRA.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of Horizon.\n\nBecause   we   find   that    the   district     court     incorrectly     applied\n\nUSERRA’s burden-shifting analysis, we reverse.\n\n                                  I. Background\n\n            Because this is an appeal from summary judgment, we\n\nreview the facts in the light most favorable to Velázquez, drawing\n\nall inferences in his favor.             See Coyne v. Tabor Partners I, 53\n\nF.3d 454, 457 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            Horizon   is     in   the    business    of    ocean    shipping   and\n\ntransportation, and operates a marine terminal in San Juan, Puerto\n\nRico.     Velázquez    began      work    at   the   terminal      for   Horizon's\n\npredecessor, CSX Lines, in September 1999.                He was first employed\n\nas a yard supervisor and later became a marine supervisor.                     Both\n\npositions   are   essentially       middle     management,    giving     Velázquez\n\nsupervisory authority over Horizon’s stevedores.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f          In December 2002, Velázquez enlisted as a reservist in\n\nthe U.S. Marine Corps.   He immediately reported for six months of\n\nbasic training.   He returned to his job after basic training, but\n\ncontinued to report for monthly weekend training sessions, as well\n\nas annual two-week more intensive training sessions. Velázquez was\n\na shift employee at Horizon and often had to work weekends, so\n\nHorizon needed to adjust his work hours to accommodate his military\n\nschedule. In Velázquez’s pre-trial deposition,1 he stated that his\n\nsuperiors complained and pressured him about the difficulty of\n\nrescheduling his shifts. He also stated that he was frequently the\n\nbutt of jokes at work, being referred to as “G.I. Joe,” “little\n\nlead soldier,” and “Girl Scout.”\n\n          During Velázquez’s periods of military service, Horizon\n\ncontinued to pay his full salary.     As a result, when Velázquez\n\nreturned to work, Horizon would deduct from his paycheck amounts\n\nnecessary to offset Velázquez’s military income for those days in\n\nwhich he received both a military and a civilian paycheck.2\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The deposition entered the record as an attachment to\nVelázquez's Opposing Statement of Material Facts.         It and\ndepositions from other employees are the primary evidence pointed\nto by Velázquez in opposing summary judgment.\n     2\n      We assume that this was done in accordance with the then-\napplicable regulation at 29 C.F.R. 541.118 (2003), now codified at\n29 C.F.R 541.602, allowing for recoupment of military pay from\nsalaried employees. See also 38 U.S.C. §§ 4303(2), 4311 (adjusting\nwages and salary of uniformed employee allowed under USERRA).\nNeither party discusses this, and it is not contested.\n\n                                -3-\n\f           During this same time period, Velázquez began operating\n\na side business cashing the checks of Horizon employees.                Before\n\n2001, Horizon had paid its stevedores' daily wages in cash.                  In\n\n2001, Horizon began paying daily wages by check instead.              Seeing a\n\nbusiness opportunity, around February 2004, Velázquez began cashing\n\nthese employee checks for a fee.              He did this almost exclusively\n\nduring off-duty hours, though he testified to cashing \"one or two\"\n\nchecks while on duty.       He performed the service primarily outside\n\nHorizon's gate or in its parking lot.3\n\n           Around September 2004, Horizon finished recouping the\n\nsalary   that   it   was   owed   for    the    periods   when   Velázquez   was\n\nperforming his military duties.               On September 21, 2004, seven\n\nmonths after he began his side business, Velázquez was observed\n\ncashing checks by Horizon's operations manager, Roberto Batista,\n\none of Velázquez’s supervisors and one of the people Velázquez\n\ndescribed as having trouble with his military schedule.                Batista\n\nreported this to several other Horizon managers, and on September\n\n23, 2004, Batista fired Velázquez.             The termination letter did not\n\nstate a reason, but Velázquez was told that his check-cashing side\n\nbusiness was in violation of Horizon’s Code of Business Conduct\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      It's not clear from the record whether or the extent to which\nVelázquez cashed checks on company property. However, whether he\ncashed checks on duty or on company property has no effect on our\nanalysis.\n\n                                        -4-\n\f(“Code”).4    He was given no warnings or other prior discipline, and\n\nhad an otherwise clean record as a good employee.\n\n             Velázquez brought suit under USERRA, alleging that his\n\nfiring constituted illegal discrimination due to his military\n\nservice.5    Horizon moved for summary judgment, which the district\n\ncourt granted.     The district court held that Velázquez had not\n\nshown sufficient discriminatory animus, nor had he shown that the\n\nstated reason for his firing, the Code violation, was mere pretext.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\n             We review a district court's summary judgment de novo.\n\nVelez v. Janssen Ortho, LLC, 467 F.3d 802, 806 (1st Cir. 2006).   In\n\ndoing so, we recognize that “[w]hen a motion for summary judgment\n\n\n\n     4\n      The Code states, in relevant part:\n          No Associate should gain financially or otherwise\n     from a firm or individual with whom the Company does\n     business. Situations can arise in which an individual\n     unintentionally or unknowingly becomes involved in a\n     conflict of interest. Each Associate is responsible for\n     ensuring that he or she does not have conflicts of\n     interest. The following examples illustrate situations\n     or relationships that Associates should avoid:\n          (1) involvement in a situation in which an\n          Associate uses his/her position for any form of\n          private gain, or could lose complete independence,\n          objectivity or impartiality with regard to Company\n          business;\n          (2) solicitation or acceptance by an Associate or\n          immediate relative (including immediate relative by\n          marriage) of any benefit from any person.\n     5\n      He also brought supplemental claims under Puerto Rico law,\nwhich are not on appeal here.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fis made . . . an adverse party may not rest upon the mere\n\nallegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the\n\nadverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in\n\nthis rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.”      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).     “The mere\n\nexistence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will\n\nnot defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary\n\njudgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact.”     Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n\n247-48 (1986) (emphasis in original).    An issue is genuine “if the\n\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for\n\nthe nonmoving party,” id. at 248, and a fact is material if it has\n\nthe “potential to affect the outcome of the suit,” Santiago-Ramos\n\nv. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Sánchez v. Alvarado,\n\n101 F.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir. 1996)).    “Neither wishful thinking . .\n\n. nor conclusory responses unsupported by evidence will serve to\n\ndefeat a properly focused Rule 56 motion.”    Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,\n\n904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990) (citation omitted).\n\nA. USERRA Actions\n\n          We have not previously addressed the mechanism of proving\n\ndiscrimination claims under USERRA.     Thus, we first turn to the\n\nstatute and its history.   USERRA provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n          (a) A person who is a member of, applies to be a\n     member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform,\n\n                                 -6-\n\f     or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed\n     service shall not be denied initial employment,\n     reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any\n     benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that\n     membership, application for membership, performance of\n     service, application for service, or obligation.\n          . . .\n          (c) An employer shall be considered to have engaged\n     in actions prohibited--(1) under subsection (a), if the\n     person's membership, application for membership, service,\n     application for service, or obligation for service in the\n     uniformed services is a motivating factor in the\n     employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the\n     action would have been taken in the absence of such\n     membership,   application    for  membership,    service,\n     application for service, or obligation for service.\n\n38 U.S.C. § 4311.\n\n          The statute was passed in response to the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Monroe v. Standard Oil Co., 452 U.S. 549 (1981), in\n\nwhich the Court held under the predecessor of USERRA, the Veterans’\n\nReemployment Rights Act (“VRRA”),6 that claims for anti-military\n\nemployment discrimination would lie only if the employee could show\n\nthat the discrimination was “motived solely by reserve status.”\n\nId. at 559 (emphasis added).   This, in effect, kept the burden on\n\nthe employee to show that any offered reason by the company was\n\nactually a pretext.   In the House report accompanying passage of\n\nUSERRA, Congress said that Monroe “misinterpreted the original\n\n\n\n     6\n      VRRA was enacted as § 404 of the Vietnam Era Veterans’\nReadjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-508, 88 Stat.\n1578.   It was originally codified at 38 U.S.C. § 2021 et seq.,\nbefore being moved to 38 U.S.C. § 4301 et seq. See Pub. L. No.\n102-568, § 506(a), 106 Stat. 4320, 4340 (1992). Those sections\nwere then replaced by USERRA. See Pub. L. No. 103-353, 108 Stat.\n3149 (1994).\n\n                                -7-\n\flegislative intent,” which was to place “the burden of proof . . .\n\non the employer, once a prima facie case is established.”                           H.R.\n\nRep. No. 103-65, at 24 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449,\n\n2457.      The House report called instead for application of the\n\nburden shifting framework of NLRB v. Transportation Management\n\nCorp., 462 U.S. 393 (1983).            Id.\n\n             Under Transportation Management, which addresses claims\n\nof unfair labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act,\n\n“the employee first has the burden of showing, by a preponderance\n\nof   the   evidence,      that   his    or     her    protected     status     was   ‘a\n\nsubstantial      or   motivating     factor     in    the   adverse       [employment]\n\naction’; the employer may then avoid liability only by showing, as\n\nan affirmative defense, that the employer would have taken the same\n\naction without regard to the employee's protected status.”                        Leisek\n\nv.   Brightwood       Corp.,   278   F.3d      895,    898-99      (9th    Cir.   2002)\n\n(alterations in original) (quoting Transp. Mgmt., 462 U.S. at 401).\n\nThe circuit courts that have addressed the issue of burden-shifting\n\nunder   USERRA    are    unanimous      in   adopting       this    “substantial     or\n\nmotivating factor” test, rather than the “sole motivating factor”\n\ntest of Monroe, and in putting the burden on the employer to show\n\nlack of pretext.        See Coffman v. Chugach Support Servs., Inc., 411\n\nF.3d 1231, 1238-39 (11th Cir. 2005); Gagnon v. Sprint Corp., 284\n\nF.3d 839, 853-54 (8th Cir. 2002); Leisek, 278 F.3d at 899; Hill v.\n\nMichelin N. Am., Inc., 252 F.3d 307, 312 (4th Cir. 2001); Sheehan\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fv. Dep’t of Navy, 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gummo v.\n\nVill. of Depew, N.Y., 75 F.3d 98, 106 (2d Cir. 1996).\n\n             We    agree.         The    language       of   the    statute      and     the\n\nlegislative history make clear that the employee need only show\n\nthat military service was \"a motivating factor\" in order to prove\n\nliability,    unless       \"the    employer       can    prove     that   the    [adverse\n\nemployment]       action    would       have   been     taken\"     regardless      of    the\n\nemployee's military service. 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c) (emphasis added).\n\nTherefore, we hold that “in USERRA actions there must be an initial\n\nshowing by the employee that military status was at least a\n\nmotivating or substantial factor in the [employer] action, upon\n\nwhich the [employer] must prove, by a preponderance of evidence,\n\nthat   the   action    would      have     been    taken     despite      the   protected\n\nstatus.”     Sheehan, 240 F.3d at 1014.\n\n             This two-pronged burden-shifting analysis is markedly\n\ndifferent from the three-pronged burden-shifting analysis in Title\n\nVII actions.      Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the burden of\n\npersuasion in Title VII actions always remains with the employee.\n\nTherefore, after the employee establishes a prima facie case of\n\ndiscriminatory       animus,      the     employer      only     has   the      burden    of\n\nproducing    “some    legitimate,          nondiscriminatory           reason     for    the\n\nemployee's [termination].”              McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792, 802 (1973).         Then the burden shifts back to the employee\n\nto show that “the employer's stated reason for terminating him was\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fin fact a pretext.”      Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151,\n\n161 (1st Cir. 1998).     By contrast, under USERRA, the employee does\n\nnot have the burden of demonstrating that the employer’s stated\n\nreason is a pretext.         Instead, the employer must show, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that the stated reason was not a\n\npretext; that is, that “the action would have been taken in the\n\nabsence of [the employee’s military] service.\" 38 U.S.C. § 4311(c)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\nB. Analysis\n\n          1. Discriminatory Motivation\n\n          The district judge held that Velázquez failed to produce\n\nsufficient    evidence    for   a   reasonable    jury   to   believe   that\n\nVelázquez's military service was at least \"a motivating factor\" in\n\nHorizon's decision to fire him.            That is, the judge ruled that\n\nVelázquez was unable to show that Horizon at least partially based\n\nits decision to fire him on his military service.             The district\n\njudge gave three principal reasons for this ruling.              First, he\n\ndiscounted Velázquez’s testimony of anti-military remarks made by\n\nhis co-workers, in part because he had not reported any harassment\n\nto Horizon.   Second, he said that the evidence of the timing of his\n\nfiring close to a return from training was of no probative value\n\nbecause he had returned from several other training sessions\n\nwithout being fired.      Third, he noted that other Horizon employees\n\nin the military had not been demoted or fired.                Although the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fdistrict judge correctly cited the \"motivating factor\" test of\n\nSheehan, we believe, after carefully reviewing the record, that the\n\njudge committed error on each of these three points.\n\n            First, the court discounted Velázquez’s testimony of\n\nanti-military remarks because it was his own self-serving testimony\n\nand because he had not previously reported it or made a formal\n\ncomplaint.     Here, the distinction in Rule 56 between “specific\n\nfacts” and “mere allegations” is important. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\nHad    Velázquez    merely      rested       on     allegations     of     military\n\ndiscrimination, this would be a different case.                      Instead, he\n\nprovided deposition testimony presenting specific instances of\n\nanti-military remarks, as well as complaints and pressure from his\n\nsuperiors, and it is for the jury, not the judge, to determine his\n\ncredibility.       See   Anderson,     477    U.S.    at   255    (\"[c]redibility\n\ndeterminations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of\n\nlegitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those\n\nof a judge\").\n\n            Moreover, whether a nonmovant's deposition testimony or\n\naffidavits might be self-serving is not dispositive.                     It is true\n\nthat testimony and affidavits that \"merely reiterate allegations\n\nmade   in    the   complaint,       without       providing     specific    factual\n\ninformation     made     on   the    basis    of     personal     knowledge\"    are\n\ninsufficient.      Santiago-Ramos, 217 F.3d at 53 (citing Roslindale\n\nCoop. Bank v. Greenwald, 638 F.2d 258, 261 (1st Cir. 1981)).\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fHowever, a \"party's own affidavit, containing relevant information\n\nof which he has first-hand knowledge, may be self-serving, but it\n\nis nonetheless competent to support or defeat summary judgment.\"\n\nSantiago-Ramos, 217 F.3d at 53 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting Cradle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957, 961 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).           Therefore,     provided    that    the      nonmovant's    deposition\n\ntestimony sets forth specific facts, within his personal knowledge,\n\nthat, if proven, would affect the outcome of the trial, the\n\ntestimony         must   be    accepted   as    true    for     purposes     of   summary\n\njudgment.          See Napier v. F/V Deesie, Inc., 454 F.3d 61, 66 (1st\n\nCir. 2006); Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d\n\n37, 50-51 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                  On appeal, Horizon argues that the anti-military comments\n\nwere       just    \"stray     remarks,\"   and   as     such    cannot   be   sufficient\n\nevidence of discriminatory animus.                  If true, that would undermine\n\nVelázquez's argument that the issues raised are \"genuine.\"                           See\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248.            But Horizon's argument oversimplifies\n\nthe analysis.7           First, it is only true that \"'stray workplace\n\nremarks' . . . normally are insufficient, standing alone, to\n\n\n\n       7\n      In the following analysis we assume, without deciding, that\nstandards for showing discriminatory animus under other anti-\ndiscrimination statutes, such as Title VII, apply equally to\nshowings of discriminatory animus under USERRA.       See Tarin v.\nCounty of Los Angeles, 123 F.3d 1259, 1266 n.7 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(noting, in case under predecessor to USERRA, that \"Title VII\nanalysis has been extended to cases involving discrimination on the\nbasis of other protected characteristics\").\n\n                                            -12-\n\festablish . . . the requisite discriminatory animus.\"                      González v.\n\nEl Día, Inc. 304 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2002) (emphasis added); see\n\nStraughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nHere, Velázquez points not only to the remarks by co-workers, but\n\nalso to complaints by Batista and others about the difficulty of\n\nadjusting Velázquez's work schedule, and to the timing of his\n\nfiring (which we address below).              See McMillan v. Mass. Soc'y for\n\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals, 140 F.3d 288, 300-01 (1st Cir.\n\n1998)    (\"stray    remarks          may   properly    constitute      evidence        of\n\ndiscriminatory intent for the jury to consider in combination with\n\nother       evidence\");        cf.     Santiago-Ramos,        217     F.3d     at      55\n\n(decisionmaker's comments and timing of firing are material facts\n\nfor a jury to consider).\n\n              Here, the remarks that Velázquez testified to were not\n\nmade by those who participated in the decision to fire him, and\n\nthis does limit their probativeness.                  See McMillan, 140 F.3d at\n\n301.    But at least one such speaker, Juan Carrero, was shift marine\n\nmanager and appears to be superior to Velázquez.                    Carrero was also\n\nin   part    responsible       for    scheduling,     which   was    the     source    of\n\nHorizon's problems with Velázquez.                Thus, his remarks could carry\n\nsome    weight     with    a    jury.        Furthermore,      stray       remarks     by\n\nnondecisionmakers,        while       insufficient     standing      alone    to     show\n\ndiscriminatory animus, may still be considered \"evidence of a\n\ncompany's general atmosphere of discrimination,\" and thus can be\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\frelevant.

Bd. of\n\nTrustees of Keene State Coll., 604 F.2d 106, 113 (1st Cir. 1979)).\n\n\"[S]uch evidence . . . does tend to add 'color' to the employer's\n\ndecisionmaking processes and to the influences behind the actions\n\ntaken with respect to the individual plaintiff.\"       Cummings v.\n\nStandard Register Co., 265 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Conway v. Electro Switch Corp.,\n\n825 F.2d 593, 591 (1st Cir. 1987)).8\n\n          Finally, the fact that Velázquez failed to report the\n\nremarks earlier is not dispositive.    Cf. Faragher v. City of Boca\n\nRaton, 524 U.S. 775, 808 (1998) (holding that plaintiff's failure\n\nto report sexual harassment is not an affirmative defense to a\n\nTitle VII claim where plaintiff was discharged).   In an atmosphere\n\nsuch as a working seaport, it is reasonable for a person to avoid\n\nmaking a scene over such behavior, or even to believe that the\n\n\n     8\n      We note also that the comments at issue in González and the\nother \"stray remark\" cases cited by Horizon were ambiguous even as\nto their meaning, much less whether they could be taken as evidence\nof discrimination. See González, 304 F.3d at 70 (\"it is far from\nclear that the alleged remarks bespeak any age-based animus at\nall\"); Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(remarks about changing company culture of \"old, white men\" not\nliteral, given hiring practices); Shorette v. Rite Aid of Me.,\nInc., 155 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1998) (asking employee how old he\nwas and when he planned to retire \"demonstrates nothing\"). Here,\nthe remarks that Velázquez describes in his testimony are clearly\nanti-military.    Of course, this is not to say that they are\nnecessarily proof of anti-military discriminatory animus at\nHorizon. A jury could find, for example, that the remarks were not\nmalicious. But this is distinct from the question of the actual\nmeaning of the words being uttered, for which there is no\nambiguity.\n\n                               -14-\n\fbehavior is only in jest, only to discover too late that it was a\n\nharbinger of worse discrimination to come.      Velázquez’s failure to\n\nreport the behavior may be considered by a jury in judging his\n\ncredibility, but it is evident to us that a jury could reasonably\n\ndecide to place no weight on his prior silence.     Thus, it is a jury\n\nthat should ultimately decide.\n\n          The   district   judge    next   discounted   the   timing   of\n\nVelázquez’s firing, saying that the fact that he was fired after\n\nreturning from his military service is of no probative value, given\n\nthat he had returned from other periods of service without being\n\nfired. But the emphasis of Velázquez's argument is elsewhere. The\n\nimportant factor, he argues, is not the time of his return from\n\nservice, but rather the time of his final recoupment of the salary\n\ndifferential that he owed to Horizon.          Horizon, according to\n\nVelázquez, waited until Velázquez had paid back the money he owed\n\nHorizon for the periods when his civilian salary was supplemented\n\nby his military salary.    Once he had repaid the overage, he claims,\n\nHorizon then found the pretext to fire him.\n\n          Such facts, if true, could be considered evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory animus.     The other USERRA cases that address the\n\ntiming of firing look at \"proximity in time between the employee's\n\nmilitary activity and the adverse employment action.\" Sheehan, 240\n\nF.3d at 1014; see Maxfield v. Cintas Corp. No. 2, 427 F.3d 544, 552\n\n(8th Cir. 2005).   But that is not an exclusive test, and there is\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fno reason to limit ourselves to looking only at the proximity of\n\nthe adverse employment action to military activity.         The proximity\n\nto other military-related events may also be probative.           If what\n\nVelázquez alleges is true, Horizon should not escape liability for\n\nmaking the tactical decision to wait until it recouped the salary\n\nit was owed before using a pretext to fire Velázquez.\n\n           Finally, the district judge held that the fact that the\n\ncompany had not fired other employees who served in the military\n\ndemonstrated that they did not fire Velázquez for discriminatory\n\nreasons.   As an initial matter, the failure to treat all members of\n\na class with similar discriminatory animus does not preclude a\n\nclaim by a member of that class who is so treated.          Cf. Conn. v.\n\nTeal, 457 U.S. 440, 455 (1982) (\"Title VII does not permit the\n\nvictim of a facially discriminatory policy to be told that he has\n\nnot been wronged because other persons of his or her race or sex\n\nwere hired\"); Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 579\n\n(1978) (\"A racially balanced work force cannot immunize an employer\n\nfrom liability for specific acts of discrimination.\").\n\n           Furthermore,   the   district   court   failed    to   address\n\nVelázquez’s argument that the other employees were not shift\n\nemployees, and that therefore their military service did not cause\n\nas much scheduling conflict as his did.      A reasonable jury could\n\nconclude that the different situations of these employees could\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fresult in Horizon firing Velázquez for his military service, while\n\ntolerating the other employees serving in the military.\n\n               For these reasons, we find that Velázquez has presented\n\nsufficient facts to withstand summary judgment on the question of\n\nwhether his military status was at least a motivating factor in his\n\ndismissal.       The issue is one for a jury.\n\n               2. Pretext\n\n               After holding that Velázquez had not provided sufficient\n\nevidence to show that his military status was a motivating factor\n\nin his dismissal, the district judge held further that, even if he\n\nhad,    Horizon    had     adequately     demonstrated       that   it   had   a   non-\n\npretextual reason for firing Velázquez.\n\n               The district judge stated the rule of law correctly,\n\nadopting, as we have today, the Federal Circuit’s holding in\n\nSheehan.       However, he proceeded to implicitly follow the McDonnell\n\nDouglas framework, keeping the burden on Velázquez.                      For example,\n\nhe held that Horizon “was entitled to take the action it did,”\n\nDist.    Ct.    Op.   at   12,    that   it     was   “justified    in    dismissing”\n\nVelázquez,      id.   at    13,   and    that    Velázquez    “failed     to   produce\n\nevidence to counter this determination and has produced no evidence\n\nthat would lead the Court to believe that [Horizon’s] stated reason\n\nfor his termination was pretextual in nature,” id.                       The district\n\ncourt thus kept the burden of persuasion on Velázquez, and this was\n\nerror.\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f            The issue under USERRA is not whether an employer is\n\n“entitled” to dismiss an employee for a particular reason, but\n\nwhether it would have done so if the employee were not in the\n\nmilitary.    Here, Velázquez’s violation of the Code may well be a\n\nfireable offense under Horizon’s policies, but that is only the\n\nbeginning    of   the   analysis.     Horizon   must   go   further   and\n\ndemonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would\n\nindeed have fired Velázquez, regardless of his military status.\n\n            There is sufficient doubt on this issue to make it a jury\n\nquestion.    Velázquez points out that he never received a copy of\n\nthe Code,9 nor any warnings to stop his check-cashing business,\n\nboth of which one might have expected to occur before a firing,\n\nparticularly in a case where the Code is arguably ambiguous as to\n\nwhether something like check-cashing is in fact a violation.10\n\n\n     9\n      Our concern here is not strictly the lack of notice that the\ncheck-cashing was in violation of the Code. That issue does not\narise in the USERRA analysis--USERRA’s concern is discrimination,\nnot due process. However, the failure to distribute the Code could\nbe considered some evidence of how seriously Horizon took the Code\nand its violations. One would have expected a company to inform\nits employees about offenses that would result in immediate firing\nwithout warning, particular when the seriousness of such offenses\nis not intuitively obvious.\n     10\n      At oral argument, Horizon’s principal explanation for the\nseriousness of the offense was that it contradicted a company\npolicy of paying employees by check, rather than cash.       Thus,\ncounsel for Horizon argued, a middle manager of the company was\nfacilitating something directly contrary to the company’s desires.\nWhile we can think of reasons why having a manager run a check-\ncashing business for his supervisees is inappropriate, this\nproffered reason is not convincing. At some point, the stevedores\nmust turn their checks into cash, and it’s not clear to us why\n\n                                    -18-\n\fFurthermore, some other employees who had similar Code violations\n\nwere not summarily fired, as Velázquez was.               Also questionable is\n\nthe   fact   that   Velázquez      had   been   cashing   checks    for   Horizon\n\nemployees adjacent to Horizon property for seven months before\n\nHorizon claimed to discover these acts.             A reasonable jury could\n\nquestion the truth of that claim, given that the alleged discovery\n\noccurred so close to the final recoupment of salary.11               Given this,\n\nHorizon has not met its burden at summary judgment of showing that\n\nno    reasonable    jury   could    find   that   Velázquez's      check-cashing\n\nbusiness was a mere pretext for his dismissal. Horizon points only\n\nto the Code violation and, under USERRA, that is not enough.\n\n                                III. Conclusion\n\n             For the forgoing reasons we reverse the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\nHorizon should desire otherwise. As far as we can tell, the switch\nto checks was merely for the convenience of the company, not\nbecause of any desire for their employees’ funds to be slightly\nless liquid.\n       11\n      Batista did testify that he had \"heard rumors\" about the\ncheck-cashing prior to September 21, 2004.\n\n                                         -19-\n\f",

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is an appeal from summary judgment, we review the facts in the light most favorable to Vel&#225;zquez, drawing all inferences in his favor. <i>See Coyne v. Taber Partners I,</i> 53 F.3d 454, 457 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horizon is in the business of ocean shipping and transportation, and operates a marine terminal in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Vel&#225;zquez began work at the terminal for Horizon's predecessor, CSX Lines, in September 1999. He was first employed as a yard supervisor and later became a marine supervisor. Both positions are essentially middle management, giving Vel&#225;zquez supervisory authority over Horizon's stevedores.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2002, Vel&#225;zquez enlisted as a reservist in the U.S. Marine Corps. He immediately reported for six months of basic training. He returned to his job after basic training, but continued to report for monthly weekend training sessions, as well as annual two-week more intensive training sessions. Vel&#225;zquez was a shift employee at Horizon and often had to work weekends, so Horizon needed to adjust his work hours to accommodate his military schedule. In Vel&#225;zquez's pre-trial deposition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> he stated that his superiors complained and pressured him about the difficulty of rescheduling his shifts. He also stated that he was frequently the butt of jokes at work, being referred to as \"G.I. Joe,\" \"little lead soldier,\" and \"Girl Scout.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Vel&#225;zquez's periods of military service, Horizon continued to pay his full salary. As a result, when Vel&#225;zquez returned to work, Horizon would deduct from his paycheck amounts necessary to offset Vel&#225;zquez's military income for those days in which he received both a military and a civilian paycheck.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this same time period, Vel&#225;zquez began operating a side business cashing the checks of Horizon employees. Before 2001, Horizon had paid its stevedores' daily wages in cash. In 2001, Horizon began paying daily wages by check instead. Seeing a business opportunity, around February 2004, Vel&#225;zquez began cashing these employee checks for a fee. He did this almost exclusively during off-duty hours, though he testified to cashing \"one or two\" checks while on duty. He performed the service primarily outside Horizon's gate or in its parking lot.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around September 2004, Horizon finished recouping the salary that it was owed for the periods when Vel&#225;zquez was performing his military duties. On September 21, 2004, seven months after he began his side business, Vel&#225;zquez was observed cashing checks by Horizon's operations manager, Roberto Batista, one of Vel&#225;zquez's supervisors and one of the people Vel&#225;zquez described as having trouble with his military schedule. Batista reported this to several other Horizon managers, and on September 23, 2004, Batista fired Vel&#225;zquez. The termination letter did not state a reason, but Vel&#225;zquez was told that his check-cashing side business was in violation of Horizon's Code of Business Conduct (\"Code\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> He was given no warnings or other prior discipline, and had an otherwise clean record as a good employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vel&#225;zquez brought suit under USERRA, alleging that his firing constituted illegal discrimination due to his military service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Horizon moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The district court held that Vel&#225;zquez had not shown sufficient discriminatory animus, nor had he shown that the stated reason for his firing, the Code violation, was mere pretext.

This, in effect, kept the burden on the employee to show that any offered reason by the company was actually a pretext. In the House report accompanying passage of USERRA, Congress said that <i>Monroe</i> \"misinterpreted the original legislative intent,\" which was to place \"the burden of proof ... on the employer, once a prima facie case is established.\" H.R.Rep. No. 103-65, at 24 (1994), <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2457. The House report called instead for application of the burden shifting framework of <i>NLRB v.

Brightwood Corp.,</i> 278 F.3d 895, 898-99 (9th Cir.2002) (alterations in original) (quoting <i>Transp. Mgmt.,</i> 462 U.S. at 401, 103 S.Ct. 2469). The circuit courts that have addressed the issue of burden-shifting under USERRA are unanimous in adopting this \"substantial or motivating factor\" test, rather than the \"sole motivating factor\" test of <i>Monroe,</i> and in putting the burden on the employer to show lack of pretext. <i>See Coffman v. Chugach Support Servs., Inc.,</i> 411 F.3d 1231, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2005); <i>Gagnon v. Sprint Corp.,</i> 284 F.3d 839, 853-54 (8th Cir.2002); <i>Leisek,</i> 278 F.3d at 899; <i>Hill v. Michelin N.

The language of the statute and the legislative history make clear that the employee need only show that military service was \"<i>a</i> motivating factor\" in order to prove liability, unless \"the employer can prove that the [adverse employment] action <i>would</i> have been taken\" regardless of the employee's military service. 38 U.S.C. &#167; 4311(c) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold that \"in USERRA actions there must be an initial showing by the employee that military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the [employer] action, upon which the [employer] must prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status.\" <i>Sheehan,</i> 240 F.3d at 1014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This two-pronged burden-shifting analysis is markedly different from the three-pronged burden-shifting analysis in Title VII actions. Under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework, the burden of persuasion in Title VII actions always remains with the employee. Therefore, after the employee establishes a prima facie case of discriminatory animus, the employer only has the burden of producing \"some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's [termination].\" <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Then the burden shifts back to the employee to show that \"the employer's stated reason for terminating him was in fact a pretext.\" <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 161 (1st Cir.1998). By contrast, under USERRA, the employee does not have the burden of demonstrating that the employer's stated reason is a pretext. Instead, the employer must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the stated reason was <i>not</i> a pretext; that is, that \"the action <i>would</i> have been taken in the absence of [the employee's military] service.\" 38 U.S.C. &#167; 4311(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Discriminatory Motivation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge held that Vel&#225;zquez failed to produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to believe that Vel&#225;zquez's military service was at least \"a motivating factor\" in Horizon's decision to fire him. That is, the judge ruled that Vel&#225;zquez was unable to show that Horizon at least partially based its decision to fire him on his military service. The district judge gave three principal reasons for this ruling. First, he discounted Vel&#225;zquez's testimony of anti-military remarks made by his co-workers, in part because he had not reported any harassment to Horizon. Second, he said that the evidence of the timing of his firing close to a return from training was of no probative value because he had returned from several other training sessions without being fired. Third, he noted that other Horizon employees in the military had not been demoted or fired. Although the district judge correctly cited the \"motivating factor\" test of <i>Sheehan,</i> we believe, after carefully reviewing the record, that the judge committed error on each of these three points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the court discounted Vel&#225;zquez's testimony of anti-military remarks because it was his own self-serving testimony and because he had not previously reported it or made a formal complaint. Here, the distinction in Rule 56 between \"specific facts\" and \"mere allegations\" is important. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Had Vel&#225;zquez merely rested on allegations of military discrimination, this would be a different case. Instead, he provided deposition testimony presenting specific instances of anti-military remarks, as well as complaints and pressure from his superiors, and it is for the jury, not the judge, to determine his credibility. <i>See Anderson,</i> 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (\"[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, whether a nonmovant's deposition testimony or affidavits might be self-serving is not dispositive. It is true that testimony and affidavits that \"merely reiterate allegations made in the complaint, without providing specific factual information made on the basis of personal knowledge\" are insufficient. <i>Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 53 (citing <i>Roslindale Coop. Bank v. Greenwald,</i> 638 F.2d 258, 261 (1st Cir.1981)). However, a \"party's own affidavit, containing relevant information of which he has first-hand knowledge, may be self-serving, but it is nonetheless competent to support or defeat summary judgment.\" <i>Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 53 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Cadle Co. v. Hayes,</i> 116 F.3d 957, 961 n. 5 (1st Cir. 1997)). Therefore, provided that the nonmovant's deposition testimony sets forth specific facts, within his personal knowledge, that, if proven, would affect the outcome of the trial, the testimony must be accepted as true for purposes of summary judgment. <i>See Napier v. F/V Deesie, Inc.,</i> 454 F.3d 61, 66 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit Union,</i> 170 F.3d 37, 50-51 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Horizon argues that the anti-military comments were just \"stray remarks,\" and as such cannot be sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus. If true, that would undermine Vel&#225;zquez's argument that the issues raised are \"genuine.\" <i>See Anderson,</i> 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. But Horizon's argument oversimplifies the analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> First, it is only true that \"`stray workplace remarks' ... normally are insufficient, <i>standing alone,</i> to establish ... the requisite discriminatory animus.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez v. El D&#237;a, Inc.</i> 304 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir.2002) (emphasis added); <i>see Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 250 F.3d 23, 36 (1st Cir.2001). Here, Vel&#225;zquez points not only to the remarks by co-workers, but also to complaints by Batista and others about the difficulty of adjusting Vel&#225;zquez's work schedule, and to the timing of his firing (which we address below). <i>See McMillan v. Mass. Soc'y for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,</i> 140 F.3d 288, 300-01 (1st Cir.1998) (\"stray remarks may properly constitute evidence of discriminatory intent for the jury to consider in combination with other evidence\"); <i>cf. Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 55 (decisionmaker's comments and timing of firing are material facts for a jury to consider).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the remarks that Vel&#225;zquez testified to were not made by those who participated in the decision to fire him, and this does limit their probativeness. <i>See McMillan,</i> 140 F.3d at 301. But at least one such speaker, Juan Carrero, was shift marine manager and appears to be superior to Vel&#225;zquez. Carrero was also in part responsible for scheduling, which was the source of Horizon's problems with Vel&#225;zquez. Thus, his remarks could carry some weight with a jury. Furthermore, stray remarks by nondecisionmakers, while insufficient standing alone to show discriminatory animus, may still be considered \"evidence of a company's general atmosphere of discrimination,\" and thus can be relevant. <i>Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 55 (citing <i>Sweeney v. Bd. of Trustees of Keene State Coll.,</i> 604 F.2d 106, 113 (1st Cir.1979)). \"[S]uch evidence ... does tend to add `color' to the employer's decisionmaking processes and to the influences behind the actions taken with respect to the individual plaintiff.\" <i>Cummings v. Standard Register Co.,</i> 265 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Conway v. Electro Switch Corp.,</i> 825 F.2d 593, 597 (1st Cir.1987)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the fact that Vel&#225;zquez failed to report the remarks earlier is not dispositive. <i>Cf. Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 808, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (holding that plaintiff's failure to report sexual harassment is not an affirmative defense to a Title VII claim where plaintiff was discharged). In an atmosphere such as a working seaport, it is reasonable for a person to avoid making a scene over such behavior, or even to believe that the behavior is only in jest, only to discover too late that it was a harbinger of worse discrimination to come. Vel&#225;zquez's failure to report the behavior may be considered by a jury in judging his credibility, but it is evident to us that a jury could reasonably decide to place no weight on his prior silence. Thus, it is a jury that should ultimately decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge next discounted the timing of Vel&#225;zquez's firing, saying that the fact that he was fired after returning from his military service is of no probative value, given that he had returned from other periods of service without being fired. But the emphasis of Vel&#225;zquez's argument is elsewhere. The important factor, he argues, is not the time of his return from service, but rather the time of his final recoupment of the salary differential that he owed to Horizon. Horizon, according to Vel&#225;zquez, waited until Vel&#225;zquez had paid back the money he owed Horizon for the periods when his civilian salary was supplemented by his military salary. Once he had repaid the overage, he claims, Horizon then found the pretext to fire him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such facts, if true, could be considered evidence of discriminatory animus. The other USERRA cases that address the timing of firing look at \"proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action.\" <i>Sheehan,</i> 240 F.3d at 1014; <i>see Maxfield v. Cintas Corp. No. 2,</i> 427 F.3d 544, 552 (8th Cir.2005). But that is not an exclusive test, and there is no reason to limit ourselves to looking only at the proximity of the adverse employment action to military activity. The proximity to other military-related events may also be probative. If what Vel&#225;zquez alleges is true, Horizon should not escape liability for making the tactical decision to wait until it recouped the salary it was owed before using a pretext to fire Vel&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district judge held that the fact that the company had not fired other employees who served in the military demonstrated that they did not fire Vel&#225;zquez for discriminatory reasons. As an initial matter, the failure to treat all members of a class with similar discriminatory animus does not preclude a claim by a member of that class who is so treated. <i>Cf. Conn. v. Teal,</i> 457 U.S. 440, 455, 102 S.Ct. 2525, 73 L.Ed.2d 130 (1982) (\"Title VII does not permit the victim of a facially discriminatory policy to be told that he has not been wronged because other persons of his or her race or sex were hired\"); <i>Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters,</i> 438 U.S. 567, 579, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978) (\"A racially balanced work force cannot immunize an employer from liability for specific acts of discrimination.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court failed to address Vel&#225;zquez's argument that the other employees were not shift employees, and that therefore their military service did not cause as much scheduling conflict as his did. A reasonable jury could conclude that the different situations of these employees could result in Horizon firing Vel&#225;zquez for his military service, while tolerating the other employees serving in the military.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find that Vel&#225;zquez has presented sufficient facts to withstand summary judgment on the question of whether his military status was at least a motivating factor in his dismissal. The issue is one for a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Pretext</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding that Vel&#225;zquez had not provided sufficient evidence to show that his military status was a motivating factor in his dismissal, the district judge held further that, even if he had, Horizon had adequately demonstrated that it had a non-pretextual reason for firing Vel&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge stated the rule of law correctly, adopting, as we have today, the Federal Circuit's holding in <i>Sheehan.</i> However, he proceeded to implicitly follow the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework, keeping the burden on Vel&#225;zquez. For example, he held that Horizon \"was entitled to take the action it did,\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 12, that it was \"justified in dismissing\" Vel&#225;zquez, <i>id.</i> at 13, and that Vel&#225;zquez \"failed to produce evidence to counter this determination and has produced no evidence that would lead the Court to believe that [Horizon's] stated reason for his termination was pretextual in nature,\" <i>id.</i> The district court thus kept the burden of persuasion on Vel&#225;zquez, and this was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue under USERRA is not whether an employer is \"entitled\" to dismiss an employee for a particular reason, but whether it would have done so if the employee were not in the military. Here, Vel&#225;zquez's violation of the Code may well be a fireable offense under Horizon's policies, but that is only the beginning of the analysis. Horizon must go further and demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it <i>would</i> indeed have fired Vel&#225;zquez, regardless of his military status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is sufficient doubt on this issue to make it a jury question. Vel&#225;zquez points out that he never received a copy of the Code,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> nor any warnings to stop his check-cashing business, both of which one might have expected to occur before a firing, particularly in a case where the Code is arguably ambiguous as to whether something like check-cashing is in fact a violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Furthermore, some other employees who had similar Code violations were not summarily fired, as Vel&#225;zquez was. Also questionable is the fact that Vel&#225;zquez had been cashing checks for Horizon employees adjacent to Horizon property for seven months before Horizon claimed to discover these acts. A reasonable jury could question the truth of that claim, given that the alleged discovery occurred so close to the final recoupment of salary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Given this, Horizon has not met its burden at summary judgment of showing that no reasonable jury could find that Vel&#225;zquez's check-cashing business was a mere pretext for his dismissal. Horizon points only to the Code violation and, under USERRA, that is not enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Here, the remarks that Vel&#225;zquez describes in his testimony are clearly anti-military. Of course, this is not to say that they are necessarily proof of anti-military discriminatory animus at Horizon. A jury could find, for example, that the remarks were not malicious.

However, the failure to distribute the Code could be considered some evidence of how seriously Horizon took the Code and its violations.

Thus, counsel for Horizon argued, a middle manager of the company was facilitating something directly contrary to the company's desires. While we can think of reasons why having a manager run a check-cashing business for his supervisees is inappropriate, this proffered reason is not convincing. At some point, the stevedores must turn their checks into cash, and it's not clear to us why Horizon should desire otherwise. As far as we can tell, the switch to checks was merely for the convenience of the company, not because of any desire for their employees' funds to be slightly less liquid</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Batista did testify that he had \"heard rumors\" about the check-cashing prior to September 21, 2004</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Vel&#225;zquez began work at the terminal for Horizon's predecessor, CSX Lines, in September 1999. He was first employed as a yard supervisor and later became a marine supervisor. Both positions are essentially middle management, giving Vel&#225;zquez supervisory authority over Horizon's stevedores.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2002, Vel&#225;zquez enlisted as a reservist in the U.S. Marine Corps. He immediately reported for six months of basic training. He returned to his job after basic training, but continued to report for monthly weekend training sessions, as well as annual two-week more intensive training sessions. Vel&#225;zquez was a shift employee at Horizon and often had to work weekends, so Horizon needed to adjust his work hours to accommodate his military schedule. In Vel&#225;zquez's pre-trial deposition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> he stated that his superiors complained and pressured him about the difficulty of rescheduling his shifts. He also stated that he was frequently the butt of jokes at work, being referred to as \"G.I. Joe,\" \"little lead soldier,\" and \"Girl Scout.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Vel&#225;zquez's periods of military service, Horizon continued to pay his full salary. As a result, when Vel&#225;zquez returned to work, Horizon would deduct from his paycheck amounts necessary to offset Vel&#225;zquez's military income for those days in which he received both a military and a civilian paycheck.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this same time period, Vel&#225;zquez began operating a side business cashing the checks of Horizon employees. Before 2001, Horizon had paid its stevedores' daily wages in cash. In 2001, Horizon began paying daily wages by check instead. Seeing a business opportunity, around February 2004, Vel&#225;zquez began cashing these employee checks for a fee. He did this almost exclusively during off-duty hours, though he testified to cashing \"one or two\" checks while on duty. He performed the service primarily outside Horizon's gate or in its parking lot.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around September 2004, Horizon finished recouping the salary that it was owed for the periods when Vel&#225;zquez was performing his military duties. On September 21, 2004, seven months after he began his side business, Vel&#225;zquez was observed cashing checks by Horizon's operations manager, Roberto Batista, one of Vel&#225;zquez's supervisors and one of the people Vel&#225;zquez described as having trouble with his military schedule. Batista reported this to several other Horizon managers, and on September 23, 2004, Batista fired Vel&#225;zquez. The termination letter did not state a reason, but Vel&#225;zquez was told that his check-cashing side business was in violation of Horizon's Code of Business Conduct (\"Code\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> He was given no warnings or other prior discipline, and had an otherwise clean record as a good employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vel&#225;zquez brought suit under USERRA, alleging that his firing constituted illegal discrimination due to his military service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Horizon moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The district court held that Vel&#225;zquez had not shown sufficient discriminatory animus, nor had he shown that the stated reason for his firing, the Code violation, was mere pretext.

Therefore, we hold that \"in USERRA actions there must be an initial showing by the employee that military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the [employer] action, upon which the [employer] must prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status.\" <i>Sheehan,</i> 240 F.3d at 1014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This two-pronged burden-shifting analysis is markedly different from the three-pronged burden-shifting analysis in Title VII actions.

By contrast, under USERRA, the employee does not have the burden of demonstrating that the employer's stated reason is a pretext. Instead, the employer must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the stated reason was <i>not</i> a pretext; that is, that \"the action <i>would</i> have been taken in the absence of [the employee's military] service.\" 38 U.S.C. &#167; 4311(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Discriminatory Motivation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge held that Vel&#225;zquez failed to produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to believe that Vel&#225;zquez's military service was at least \"a motivating factor\" in Horizon's decision to fire him. That is, the judge ruled that Vel&#225;zquez was unable to show that Horizon at least partially based its decision to fire him on his military service. The district judge gave three principal reasons for this ruling. First, he discounted Vel&#225;zquez's testimony of anti-military remarks made by his co-workers, in part because he had not reported any harassment to Horizon. Second, he said that the evidence of the timing of his firing close to a return from training was of no probative value because he had returned from several other training sessions without being fired. Third, he noted that other Horizon employees in the military had not been demoted or fired. Although the district judge correctly cited the \"motivating factor\" test of <i>Sheehan,</i> we believe, after carefully reviewing the record, that the judge committed error on each of these three points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the court discounted Vel&#225;zquez's testimony of anti-military remarks because it was his own self-serving testimony and because he had not previously reported it or made a formal complaint. Here, the distinction in Rule 56 between \"specific facts\" and \"mere allegations\" is important. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Had Vel&#225;zquez merely rested on allegations of military discrimination, this would be a different case. Instead, he provided deposition testimony presenting specific instances of anti-military remarks, as well as complaints and pressure from his superiors, and it is for the jury, not the judge, to determine his credibility. <i>See Anderson,</i> 477 U.S. at 255, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/jack-anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc-and-willis-a-carto/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In an atmosphere such as a working seaport, it is reasonable for a person to avoid making a scene over such behavior, or even to believe that the behavior is only in jest, only to discover too late that it was a harbinger of worse discrimination to come. Vel&#225;zquez's failure to report the behavior may be considered by a jury in judging his credibility, but it is evident to us that a jury could reasonably decide to place no weight on his prior silence.

But the emphasis of Vel&#225;zquez's argument is elsewhere. The important factor, he argues, is not the time of his return from service, but rather the time of his final recoupment of the salary differential that he owed to Horizon. Horizon, according to Vel&#225;zquez, waited until Vel&#225;zquez had paid back the money he owed Horizon for the periods when his civilian salary was supplemented by his military salary. Once he had repaid the overage, he claims, Horizon then found the pretext to fire him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such facts, if true, could be considered evidence of discriminatory animus.

But that is not an exclusive test, and there is no reason to limit ourselves to looking only at the proximity of the adverse employment action to military activity. The proximity to other military-related events may also be probative. If what Vel&#225;zquez alleges is true, Horizon should not escape liability for making the tactical decision to wait until it recouped the salary it was owed before using a pretext to fire Vel&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district judge held that the fact that the company had not fired other employees who served in the military demonstrated that they did not fire Vel&#225;zquez for discriminatory reasons. As an initial matter, the failure to treat all members of a class with similar discriminatory animus does not preclude a claim by a member of that class who is so treated. <i>Cf. Conn. v.

A reasonable jury could conclude that the different situations of these employees could result in Horizon firing Vel&#225;zquez for his military service, while tolerating the other employees serving in the military.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find that Vel&#225;zquez has presented sufficient facts to withstand summary judgment on the question of whether his military status was at least a motivating factor in his dismissal.

Pretext</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding that Vel&#225;zquez had not provided sufficient evidence to show that his military status was a motivating factor in his dismissal, the district judge held further that, even if he had, Horizon had adequately demonstrated that it had a non-pretextual reason for firing Vel&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge stated the rule of law correctly, adopting, as we have today, the Federal Circuit's holding in <i>Sheehan.</i> However, he proceeded to implicitly follow the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework, keeping the burden on Vel&#225;zquez. For example, he held that Horizon \"was entitled to take the action it did,\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 12, that it was \"justified in dismissing\" Vel&#225;zquez, <i>id.</i> at 13, and that Vel&#225;zquez \"failed to produce evidence to counter this determination and has produced no evidence that would lead the Court to believe that [Horizon's] stated reason for his termination was pretextual in nature,\" <i>id.</i> The district court thus kept the burden of persuasion on Vel&#225;zquez, and this was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue under USERRA is not whether an employer is \"entitled\" to dismiss an employee for a particular reason, but whether it would have done so if the employee were not in the military. Here, Vel&#225;zquez's violation of the Code may well be a fireable offense under Horizon's policies, but that is only the beginning of the analysis. Horizon must go further and demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it <i>would</i> indeed have fired Vel&#225;zquez, regardless of his military status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is sufficient doubt on this issue to make it a jury question. Vel&#225;zquez points out that he never received a copy of the Code,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> nor any warnings to stop his check-cashing business, both of which one might have expected to occur before a firing, particularly in a case where the Code is arguably ambiguous as to whether something like check-cashing is in fact a violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Furthermore, some other employees who had similar Code violations were not summarily fired, as Vel&#225;zquez was. Also questionable is the fact that Vel&#225;zquez had been cashing checks for Horizon employees adjacent to Horizon property for seven months before Horizon claimed to discover these acts. A reasonable jury could question the truth of that claim, given that the alleged discovery occurred so close to the final recoupment of salary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Given this, Horizon has not met its burden at summary judgment of showing that no reasonable jury could find that Vel&#225;zquez's check-cashing business was a mere pretext for his dismissal. Horizon points only to the Code violation and, under USERRA, that is not enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

While we can think of reasons why having a manager run a check-cashing business for his supervisees is inappropriate, this proffered reason is not convincing. At some point, the stevedores must turn their checks into cash, and it's not clear to us why Horizon should desire otherwise.
