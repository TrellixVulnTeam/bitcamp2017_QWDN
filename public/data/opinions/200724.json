In this appeal, we are asked to\n\ndecide   one     question   of   law:      whether   petitioner   Lamphone\n\nVoravongsa’s1    pro   se   motion   for    appointment   of   state   post-\n\nconviction counsel constitutes a “properly filed application for\n\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to\n\nthe pertinent judgment or claim” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2244(d)(2), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, thereby tolling the\n\none-year period of limitations that would otherwise bar review of\n\nVoravongsa’s federal habeas corpus petition filed pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254.    Although the question is one of first impression in\n\nthis circuit, a straightforward reading of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2),\n\nas well as the Rhode Island post-conviction statutory scheme, and\n\nthe federal and state court decisions interpreting each of the\n\nstatutes, make plain that Voravongsa’s federal habeas petition was\n\nuntimely under AEDPA’s statute of limitations.            Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of Voravongsa’s habeas petition is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Although the petitioner spells his name “Voravongsa,” the\nbriefs in this appeal spell his name “Vorvavongsa” and the Rhode\nIsland courts spelled his name “Vorgvongsa.” Unless referring to\na state court decision, we will follow the district court’s\npractice of using the spelling “Voravongsa,” the same spelling\nemployed in the certificate of appealability.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f                             I. BACKGROUND\n\n      In 1994, Voravongsa was convicted in Rhode Island of first\n\ndegree murder.      Although the trial court granted Voravongsa’s\n\nmotion for a new trial, the Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded the\n\ncase with directions to deny the motion for a new trial, reinstate\n\nhis   conviction,   and   proceed   with   sentencing.    See   State   v.\n\nVorgvongsa, 670 A.2d 1250, 1255 (R.I. 1996) (Vorgvongsa I).             On\n\nremand, Voravongsa was sentenced to a mandatory term of life\n\nimprisonment.    His direct appeal of that conviction was denied by\n\nthe Rhode Island Supreme Court.      See State v. Vorgvongsa, 692 A.2d\n\n1194 (R.I. 1997) (Vorgvongsa II).         He did not file a petition for\n\ncertiorari with the United States Supreme Court, and, pursuant to\n\ncourt rules, the ninety-day period in which he had to do so expired\n\non July 14, 1997.    Thus, on that date, his conviction became final.\n\n      For purposes of this appeal, the parties agree that on June\n\n24, 1997, Voravongsa filed three separate motions in the Rhode\n\nIsland Superior Court:     (1) motion for appointment of counsel; (2)\n\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum; and (3)\n\nmotion to assign.2    On August 4, 1997, the Rhode Island Superior\n\n\n      2\n      The state docket sheet in the underlying criminal case (Rhode\nIsland Superior Court No. P1-1990-2966A) indicates that these three\nmotions were filed on July 24, 1997.       Also, the docket sheet\nreferences a separate application for state habeas relief\npurportedly filed on June 24, 1997.           The certificate of\nappealability in this case ordered the parties to address whether\na formal state post-conviction application was in fact made by\nVoravongsa on June 24, 1997, and, implicitly, whether the July 24,\n1997, date contained in the docket sheet represents a typographical\n\n                                    -3-\n\fCourt appointed an attorney to represent him.     The parties agree\n\nthat on September 4, 1998, thirteen months after being provided\n\nwith counsel, and nearly seventeen months after the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court affirmed his conviction, Voravongsa filed a counseled\n\napplication for state post-conviction relief pursuant to Rhode\n\nIsland General Laws § 10-9.1-1 et seq.   The application was denied\n\non October 20, 1999.   See In the Matter of Vorgvongsa, No. 98-4502,\n\n1999 WL 1001187, at *1 (R.I. Super. 1999) (Vorgvongsa III).      On\n\nDecember 3, 2001, the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the\n\ndenial of relief.   See State v. Vorgvongsa, 785 A.2d 542, 550 (R.I.\n\n2001) (Vorgvongsa IV).\n\n     While waiting for a decision from the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt on his petition for state post-conviction relief, on March\n\n24, 2000, Voravongsa filed in federal court a pro se petition for\n\na writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 and a motion\n\nfor the appointment of counsel.    The State then moved to dismiss\n\nthe petition on the ground that it was time-barred. The magistrate\n\njudge issued a report and recommendation that the habeas petition\n\nbe dismissed as barred by AEDPA’s statute of limitations.        In\n\n\nerror.     Rather than respond to this court’s order for\nclarification, each party repeatedly asserts that June 24, 1997, is\nthe only relevant date for purposes of determining whether AEDPA’s\ntime-limitations period was tolled by Voravongsa’s filing of his\nmotion for the appointment of counsel and other related motions.\nAccordingly, based on the parties’ agreement, we analyze this\nappeal on the basis that the only relevant date that these\ndocuments were filed was indeed June 24, 1997, and that no formal\napplication for state habeas relief was filed on that date.\n\n                                 -4-\n\frelevant part, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), as amended by AEDPA, which\n\nimposes a one-year period of limitations for filing a federal\n\nhabeas petition, provides:\n\n     A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an\n     application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in\n     custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court. The\n     limitation period shall run from the latest of--\n\n             (A) the date on which the judgment became\n             final by the conclusion of direct review or\n             the expiration of the time for seeking such\n             review[.]\n\nThe relevant tolling provision, which is contained in 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2244(d)(2), provides that “[t]he time during which a properly\n\nfiled application for State post-conviction or other collateral\n\nreview with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending\n\nshall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this\n\nsubsection.”\n\n        Accepting the State’s argument, the magistrate judge reasoned\n\nthat:     (1) AEDPA’s statute of limitations began to run when the\n\ntime to petition for certiorari review of Vorgvongsa II expired on\n\nJuly 14, 1997; (2) the statute of limitations expired one year\n\nlater on July 14, 1998; (3) Voravongsa’s March 24, 2000, federal\n\nhabeas application was untimely filed; and (4) there was no basis\n\nto toll the limitations period under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) because\n\nVoravongsa did not file his State motion for post-conviction relief\n\nuntil     September   4,   1998,   almost   two   months   after   AEDPA’s\n\nlimitations period expired.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f     Voravongsa’s        attorney   did   not    file      an   objection   to    the\n\nmagistrate judge’s report, although Voravongsa himself filed a pro\n\nse objection that, inter alia, argued that his habeas petition\n\nshould not be dismissed as untimely because he had diligently\n\npursued his state post-conviction remedy by filing--before AEDPA’s\n\nlimitations    period      expired--a     motion     to     appoint     counsel   to\n\nrepresent him in his state post-conviction proceeding, as well as\n\nother motions.       His objection implied that AEDPA’s statute of\n\nlimitations should be tolled onward from June 24, 1997, the date\n\nhis pro se motion for appointment of counsel and other related\n\nmotions were filed.        Subsequently, the district court adopted the\n\nmagistrate    judge’s     report    and   recommendation          and   granted   the\n\nState’s motion to dismiss Voravongsa’s habeas petition. It did not\n\naddress   Voravongsa’s       contention       that   his    pro    se   motion    for\n\nappointment of counsel, as well as other motions, tolled AEDPA’s\n\nlimitations period from the date on which those motions were filed.\n\nWe granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue of\n\nwhether Voravongsa’s “pro se motion for appointment of counsel to\n\nrepresent     him   in    his   state     post-conviction          proceeding     may\n\nconstitute a ‘properly filed application for State post-conviction\n\n. . . review’ within the meaning of                  28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2)”\n\n(alteration in the COA).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                           II.    ANALYSIS\n\n1.   Nature of Voravongsa’s Request for Appointment of Counsel\n\n      “We review de novo the . . . denial of [a] habeas application\n\non procedural grounds.”   Melancon v. Kaylo, 259 F.3d 401, 404 (5th\n\nCir. 2001); see also Simpson v. Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 205 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (applying de novo review to a district court's legal\n\nconclusions in a habeas proceeding).\n\n      As a matter of federal law, the Supreme Court has recently\n\nheld that a federal habeas case commences with the filing of an\n\napplication for habeas relief, not with the filing of a motion for\n\nappointment of federal habeas counsel, which the Court determined\n\nwas not a motion on the merits.    See Woodford v. Garceau, --- U.S.\n\n----, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 1401-02 (2003); see also Lookingbill v.\n\nCockrell, 293 F.3d 256, 263 (5th Cir. 2002) (“A habeas petition is\n\npending only after a petition for a writ of habeas corpus itself is\n\nfiled.   Thus, the filing of the federal habeas petition--not of a\n\nmotion for appointment of counsel--tolls limitations.”) (internal\n\nquotation marks, citation, and footnote omitted), cert. denied, 537\n\nU.S. 1116 (2003).   As the Court reasoned, the “motion for counsel\n\nis not itself a petition, because it does not call for (or even\n\npermit) a decision on the merits.       And it is 'the merits' that the\n\namended § 2254(d)(1) is all about.\" Woodford, 123 S.Ct. at 1401-02\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting Holman v. Gilmore, 126 F.3d 876, 880 (7th\n\nCir. 1997)); see also Isaacs v. Head, 300 F.3d 1232, 1245 (11th\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fCir. 2002) (“[W]e hold that the relevant date for purposes of\n\njudging AEDPA's applicability to a habeas petition is the date on\n\nwhich the actual § 2254 petition was filed. . . .                           A motion for\n\nappointment of counsel has no relation to the merits of a habeas\n\npetition and does not seek any form of merits relief from a\n\ndistrict court.”).\n\n        In this appeal, we must answer a nearly identical question,\n\nbut in the context of interpreting state law.                          Specifically, we\n\nmust        determine        whether    as    a   matter     of    Rhode    Island     law,\n\nVoravongsa’s           pro     se    filing   for    the    appointment      of     counsel\n\nconstitutes a “properly filed application for state post-conviction\n\nor other collateral review” pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2),\n\nthereby tolling AEDPA’s otherwise expired one-year statute of\n\nlimitations.3          Naturally, to answer this question, we will analyze\n\nRhode Island law.              See Carey v. Saffold, 536 U.S. 214, 223 (2002)\n\n(“[F]or purposes of applying a federal statute that interacts with\n\nstate procedural rules, we look to how a state procedure functions\n\n.   .       .   .”);   Artuz    v.     Bennett,     531    U.S.   4,   8   (2000)    (“[A]n\n\napplication is ‘properly filed’ when its delivery and acceptance\n\n\n        3\n       As indicated above, although Voravongsa filed three separate\nmotions on June 24, 1997, we granted a COA only on the question of\nwhether Voravongsa’s motion for appointment of state post-\nconviction counsel may serve as a properly filed application for\nState post-conviction review. “AEDPA limits the scope of habeas\nreview, so that issues not included in a COA cannot be heard on\nappeal.” Neverson v. Bissonnette, 261 F.3d 120, 125-26 (1st Cir.\n2001).    Accordingly, we concentrate our analysis on the issue\nbefore us.\n\n                                              -8-\n\fare in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing\n\nfilings.”) (emphasis removed).          For purposes of our analysis, we\n\nmust keep in mind that “there is no federal precedent for treating\n\na motion for appointment of counsel as a properly filed application\n\nfor postconviction relief.”          Beery v. Ault, 312 F.3d 948, 951 (8th\n\nCir. 2002), cert. denied, 123 S.Ct. 2590 (2003).\n\n     The Rhode Island Post Conviction Remedy Act (the Act), § 10-\n\n9.1-1 et seq., provides one general post-conviction remedy to\n\nchallenge criminal convictions and sentences.             See Id. § 10-9.1-\n\n1(b) (“Except as otherwise provided, . . . [the Act] comprehends\n\nand takes the place of all other common law, statutory, or other\n\nremedies . . . available for challenging the validity of the\n\nconviction or sentence.        It shall be used exclusively in place of\n\nthem.”); see also Palmigiano v. Mullen, 377 A.2d 242, 248 (R.I.\n\n1977).   Unlike federal habeas petitions, Rhode Island does not\n\nimpose   time   limits    on   the    filing   of   applications   for   post-\n\nconviction relief.       See R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-3 (“An application\n\nmay be filed at any time.”).             However, it specifies both the\n\nprocess by which post-conviction proceedings are to commence (i.e.,\n\nthe filing of an application) and the contents that must be\n\ncontained in the application that commences those proceedings.\n\nThus, pursuant to § 10-9.1-3, “[a] proceeding is commenced by\n\nfiling an application verified by the applicant with the clerk of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe appropriate court.” R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-3.              Concerning\n\napplication content, § 10-9.1-4 specifies that\n\n      The application shall identify the proceedings in which\n      the applicant was convicted, give the date of the entry\n      of the judgment and sentence complained of, specifically\n      set forth the grounds upon which the application is\n      based, and clearly state the relief desired.       Facts\n      within the personal knowledge of the applicant shall be\n      set forth separately from other allegations of facts and\n      shall be verified as provided in § 10-9.1-3. Affidavits,\n      records, or other evidence supporting its allegations\n      shall be attached to the application or the application\n      shall recite why they are not attached. The application\n      shall identify all previous proceedings, together with\n      the grounds therein asserted, taken by the applicant to\n      secure relief from his or her conviction or sentence.\n      Argument, citations, and discussion of authorities are\n      unnecessary.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-4 (emphasis added).                Based on these\n\nstatutory provisions, no Rhode Island decision that we can find has\n\never held that state post-conviction proceedings--the genesis of\n\n“State post-conviction or other collateral review”--are initiated\n\nwith the filing of a motion for appointment of post-conviction\n\ncounsel.4    Cf. Beery, 312 F.3d at 951 (finding that under a nearly\n\nidentical state post-conviction statutory scheme, “Iowa courts have\n\nnot   held   postconviction   proceedings   begin   with    a   motion   for\n\n\n\n      4\n        Voravongsa argues that pursuant to Shatney v. State, 755\nA.2d 130 (R.I. 2000) (per curiam), “[r]eview of a judgment\naccompanies every motion for appointment of counsel for post-\nconviction relief filed by an indigent defendant in Rhode Island.”\nVoravongsa’s analysis, however, says nothing with regard to whether\nsuch a motion amounts to an “application” for post-conviction\nreview as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2), the real crux of this\nappeal.\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fappointment of counsel”).                In fact, recently the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court rejected such an argument; it held that the mere\n\nfiling of a motion for appointment of counsel--without more--does\n\nnot    constitute        a    state      post-conviction      “application,”         the\n\ntriggering      mechanism        for    commencement     of   Rhode    Island       post-\n\nconviction collateral review.               See O’Neil v. State, 814 A.2d 366,\n\n367 (R.I. 2002).\n\n       O’Neil was a case in which the State and the petitioner\n\nassumed reverse roles to the parties’ positions here.                     In O’Neil,\n\na petitioner was appealing an order denying both his motion for\n\nmodification of sentence and his application for post-conviction\n\nrelief.    Id. at 366.         The petitioner argued that a motion justice\n\nprematurely denied him post-conviction relief because he (i.e., the\n\npetitioner) had not yet filed a request for such relief.                       Id.    It\n\nwas the petitioner’s position that “the motion justice misconstrued\n\nhis motions for appointment of counsel and for modification of\n\nsentence as a request for post-conviction relief.”                       Id. at 367.\n\nAccording    to    the       petitioner,     although    he   had     asked    for   the\n\nappointment of counsel to assist him in the preparation of his\n\napplication, he did not request post-conviction relief itself. Id.\n\nOn    appeal,     the    State    did     not   appear   to   disagree        with   the\n\npetitioner’s contention.               As the court pointed out, the State did\n\nnot oppose having the case remanded so that the petitioner could\n\nproceed with an application for post-conviction relief.                       Id.\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f      Finding    no     need   to    delve      into--or   even   mention--the\n\nrequirements of §§ 10-9.1-3 or 4, in a brief analysis the court\n\nheld that the motions to appoint counsel and for modification of\n\nsentence “could not be fairly construed as an application for post-\n\nconviction relief.” O’Neil, 814 A.2d at 367 (emphasis added). This\n\nconclusion   was      supported     by   two    grounds:   First,   the   court\n\nexplained that leniency should be afforded to pro se litigants.\n\nId.   Second, it observed that although the petitioner “mentions\n\npost-conviction relief in his motion to appoint counsel . . . he\n\ndid not seek that relief in the motion for modification of his\n\nsentence.”      Id. (emphasis added).             Thus, a motion to appoint\n\ncounsel may not be fairly construed as an “application” commencing\n\npost-conviction proceedings unless the motion--at the very minimum-\n\n-actually “seeks” post-conviction relief.              Therefore, as a matter\n\nof Rhode Island law, it appears that for a motion to appoint\n\ncounsel to qualify as an “application” commencing State post-\n\nconviction collateral review, at a minimum the motion must contain\n\na “request” for post-conviction relief.              See R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-\n\n9.1-4 (“The application shall . . . specifically set forth the\n\ngrounds upon which the application is based, and clearly state the\n\nrelief desired.”).\n\n      Giving the term “application” its natural meaning, a filing\n\nthat purports to be an application for State post-conviction or\n\nother collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fclaim must set forth the grounds upon which it is based, and must\n\nstate the relief desired; it must attack collaterally the relevant\n\nconviction or sentence.         See Mastracchio v. Houle, 416 A.2d 116,\n\n117 (R.I. 1980) (The Act “provides the exclusive remedy to be\n\nutilized   for   appropriate      collateral    attack     upon     a    criminal\n\nconviction on any ground of alleged error . . . available under\n\ncommon-law or statutory postconviction remedies.”).\n\n     Therefore, in the absence of an explicit request for post-\n\nconviction relief as specified in § 10-9.1-4, we interpret O’Neil\n\nto hold that a motion for the appointment of counsel fails to\n\ninitiate post-conviction proceedings and, thus, fails to give life\n\nto an application for post-conviction review:             “It does not appear\n\nthat the motions filed by [the petitioner] should be interpreted as\n\na request for post-conviction relief . . . .                [The petitioner]\n\nmentions post conviction relief in his motion to appoint counsel,\n\nbut he did not seek that relief in the motion for modification of\n\nhis sentence.”    O’Neil, 814 A.2d at 367.          If a motion to appoint\n\ncounsel does not qualify as an application for post-conviction\n\nreview   under   state   law,    then   it   does   not   satisfy       28   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2244(d)(2)’s requirement of a “properly filed application for\n\nState post-conviction or other collateral review.”             See Beery, 312\n\nF.3d at 951 (finding that because the petitioner’s “motion for\n\nappointment of . . . state postconviction counsel does not contain\n\nthe information required by [the Iowa statute] for postconviction\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fpetitions[,]” then “the request does not constitute a ‘properly\n\nfiled’ application for State post-conviction . . . review” under\n\n§ 2244(d)(2)).\n\n     In the instant case, a review of Voravongsa’s June 24, 1997,\n\npost-conviction motion for appointment of counsel makes plain that\n\nhe did not collaterally attack his state conviction or sentence; he\n\nsimply   did   not   “request”   post-conviction   or   other    collateral\n\nreview. In his motion, which was entitled “Petitioner’s Motion for\n\nAppointment    of    Counsel,”   Voravongsa   wrote,    “[n]ow   comes   the\n\npetitioner in the above entitled action, a motion to appoint\n\ncounsel, to represent his interests in this application for post\n\nconviction relief.”      (Emphasis added).    Although he uses the words\n\n“in this application for post conviction relief,” as was true in\n\nO’Neil, this is more of a fleeting reference to post-conviction\n\nrelief as opposed to a request for such relief.              Furthermore,\n\nVoravongsa then indicated that his motion was being made pursuant\n\nto Rhode Island General Law § 10-9.1-5, which affords indigent\n\napplicants legal representation.       He went on to list three reasons\n\nwhy he should be provided with counsel; he did not state any\n\ngrounds upon which any relief could be granted.           Finally, in his\n\nprayer for relief, he only sought the appointment of counsel--not\n\npost-conviction relief itself:       “For the reasons stated above, the\n\npetitioner prays that this Honorable Court appoint him counsel and\n\nthat said counsel be available to him at all and any future\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fproceedings which may occur in the instant matter.”           (Emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n     Here, no amount of analytical or linguistic massaging can\n\ntransmogrify Voravongsa’s passing reference to “this application\n\nfor post conviction relief” from a motion for counsel into an\n\napplication for post-conviction or other collateral review.        This\n\nconclusion is buttressed by the fact that the civil docket sheet\n\nshows that the court did not assign a civil docket number to\n\nVoravongsa’s post-conviction proceeding until September 4, 1998,\n\nwhen Voravongsa filed a traditional post-conviction application\n\nthat presumably complied with the statutory requirements of §§ 10-\n\n9.1-3 and 4.     See R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-3 (“The clerk shall\n\ndocket the application upon its receipt and promptly bring it to\n\nthe attention of the court and deliver a copy to the attorney\n\ngeneral.”).    Thus, contrary to Voravongsa’s argument, it appears\n\nthat the superior court did not view or treat Voravongsa’s pro se\n\nmotion as a properly filed application for post-conviction review.\n\nThe court certainly could not have undertaken any collateral\n\nreview--and did not provide any on-the-merits rulings--on the issue\n\nof post-conviction relief.      This explains why neither the superior\n\ncourt nor the State apparently invoked § 10-9.1-8 to dismiss\n\nVoravongsa’s   September   4,   1998,    formal   post-conviction-relief\n\napplication once it was filed.     See R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-8 (“All\n\ngrounds for relief available to an applicant at the time he or she\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fcommences a proceeding under this chapter must be raised in [the]\n\noriginal, or a supplemental or amended, application.                             Any ground\n\nfinally adjudicated or not so raised . . . may not be the basis for\n\na subsequent application” unless the court determines that justice\n\ndictates otherwise.).          Here, there is no hint that Voravongsa’s\n\nSeptember     4,    1998,    application             was   labeled       or   viewed    as   a\n\nsupplemental or amended application or that the trial court made a\n\nfinding that in the interest of justice, Voravongsa’s claims should\n\nbe considered notwithstanding the fact that they were not presented\n\nin his June 24, 1997, motions.                Accordingly, the historical facts,\n\ntoo, decisively point in the direction that Voravongsa’s motion for\n\ncounsel was not, and should not be, treated as an application for\n\nState    post-conviction        or       other       collateral     review.        With      no\n\npredicate State post-conviction application having been filed in a\n\ntimely manner,       Voravongsa          is    not    entitled      to    have   the    time-\n\nlimitations        period     of     §    2244(d)(1)            tolled    by     virtue      of\n\n§ 2244(d)(2).\n\n2.    Equitable Tolling\n\n       As a last resort, Voravongsa contends that we should exercise\n\nour discretion to equitably toll AEDPA’s one-year statute of\n\nlimitations.        In this circuit, however, it is unclear whether\n\nequitable tolling is even available with respect to § 2244(d)(1).\n\nSee Donovan v. Maine, 276 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2002) (“Whether, as\n\na    matter   of   law,     equitable         tolling      is   available,       even   in   a\n\n\n                                              -16-\n\ffactually appropriate case, in respect to section 2244(d)(1) . . .\n\nis not free from doubt.”) (citation omitted).                         As in Donovan, the\n\ncase at bar is not an appropriate case for us to decide this issue\n\nbecause even assuming hypothetically that equitable tolling is\n\navailable,       the     facts     of    this     case        would    not     warrant    its\n\nutilization.\n\n       Voravongsa’s argument for equitable tolling is predicated on\n\nthe Rhode Island Supreme Court’s decision in Shatney, 814 A.2d at\n\n135.    However, as already discussed above, Shatney cannot rescue\n\nVoravongsa’s            untimely        state        post-conviction           application.\n\nAccordingly, it, too, cannot serve as basis for equitable tolling.\n\nTo the extent Voravongsa suggests that his pro se status should\n\nprovide grounds for this extraordinary remedy, see Donovan, 276\n\nF.3d at 93 (explaining that “equitable tolling, if available at\n\nall, is the exception rather than the rule; and that resort to its\n\nprophylaxis        is      deemed        justified         only       in     extraordinary\n\ncircumstances”) (internal quotation marks, brackets and citation\n\nomitted),        this     argument      has     already        been    rejected:         “The\n\npetitioner’s assertion that his pro se status somehow entitles him\n\nto equitable tolling is wide of the mark.                       While pro se pleadings\n\nare    to   be    liberally      construed       .    .   .    the    policy    of   liberal\n\nconstruction cannot plausibly justify a party’s failure to file a\n\nhabeas petition on time.”               Id. at 94.        Thus, we decline to invoke\n\nequitable tolling in this case, even assuming that we could.\n\n\n                                              -17-\n\f    We affirm the dismissal of the petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus.\n\n\n\n\n                             -18-\n\f",

Although the question is one of first impression in this circuit, a straightforward reading of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2), as well as the Rhode Island post-conviction statutory scheme, and the federal and state court decisions interpreting each of the statutes, make plain that Voravongsa's federal habeas petition was untimely under AEDPA's statute of limitations. Accordingly, the district court's dismissal of Voravongsa's habeas petition is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, Voravongsa was convicted in Rhode Island of first degree murder. Although the trial court granted Voravongsa's motion for a new trial, the Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded the case with directions to deny the motion for a new trial, reinstate his conviction, and proceed with sentencing. <i>See State v. Vorgvongsa,</i> 670 A.2d 1250, 1255 (R.I.1996) (<i>Vorgvongsa I</i>). On remand, Voravongsa was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment. His direct appeal of that conviction was denied by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. <i>See State v. Vorgvongsa,</i> 692 A.2d 1194 (R.I.1997) (<i>Vorgvongsa II</i>). He did not file a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, and, pursuant to court rules, the ninety-day period in which he had to do so expired on July 14, 1997. Thus, on that date, his conviction became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this appeal, the parties agree that on June 24, 1997, Voravongsa filed three separate motions in the Rhode Island Superior Court: (1) motion for appointment of counsel; (2) petition for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum; and (3) motion to assign.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On August 4, 1997, the Rhode Island Superior Court appointed an attorney to represent him. The parties agree that on September 4, 1998, thirteen months after being provided with counsel, and nearly seventeen months after the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, Voravongsa filed a counseled application for state post-conviction relief pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws &#167; 10-9.1-1 <i>et seq.</i> The application was denied on October 20, 1999. <i>See In the Matter of Vorgvongsa,</i> No. 98-4502, 1999 WL 1001187, at *1 (R.I.Super.1999) (<i>Vorgvongsa III</i>). On December 3, 2001, the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the denial of relief. <i>See Vorgvongsa v.</i> <i>State,</i> 785 A.2d 542, 550 (R.I.2001) (<i>Vorgvongsa IV</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While waiting for a decision from the Rhode Island Supreme Court on his petition for state post-conviction relief, on March 24, 2000, Voravongsa filed in federal court a <i>pro se</i> petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 and a motion for the appointment of counsel. The State then moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was time-barred. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the habeas petition be dismissed as barred by AEDPA's statute of limitations. In relevant part, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1), as amended by AEDPA, which imposes a one-year period of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant tolling provision, which is contained in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2), provides that \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accepting the State's argument, the magistrate judge reasoned that: (1) AEDPA's statute of limitations began to run when the time to petition for certiorari review of <i>Vorgvongsa II</i> expired on July 14, 1997; (2) the statute of limitations expired one year later on July 14, 1998; (3) Voravongsa's March 24, 2000, federal habeas application was untimely filed; and (4) there was no basis to toll the limitations period under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2) because Voravongsa did not file his State motion for post-conviction relief until September 4, 1998, almost two months after AEDPA's limitations period expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Voravongsa's attorney did not file an objection to the magistrate judge's report, although Voravongsa himself filed a <i>pro se</i> objection that, <i>inter alia,</i> argued that his habeas petition should not be dismissed as untimely because he had diligently pursued his state post-conviction remedy by filing &#8212; <i>before</i> AEDPA's limitations period expired &#8212; a motion to appoint counsel to represent him in his state post-conviction proceeding, as well as other motions. His objection implied that AEDPA's statute of limitations should be tolled onward from June 24, 1997, the date his <i>pro se</i> motion for appointment of counsel and other related motions were filed. Subsequently, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and granted the State's motion to dismiss Voravongsa's habeas petition. It did not address Voravongsa's contention that his <i>pro se</i> motion for appointment of counsel, as well as other motions, tolled AEDPA's limitations period from the date on which those motions were filed. We granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue of whether Voravongsa's \"<i>pro se</i> motion for appointment of counsel to represent him in his state post-conviction proceeding may constitute a `properly filed application for State post-conviction ... review' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2)\" (alteration in the COA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Garceau,</i> 538 U.S. 202, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 1401-02, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003); <i>see also Lookingbill v. Cockrell,</i> 293 F.3d 256, 263 (5th Cir.2002) (\"A habeas petition is pending only after a petition for a writ of habeas corpus itself is filed.

As the Court reasoned, the \"motion for counsel <i>is not itself a petition,</i> because it does not call for (or even permit) a decision on the merits. And it is `the merits' that the amended &#167; 2254(d)(1) is all about.\" <i>Woodford,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1401-02 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Holman v.

However, it specifies both the process by which postconviction proceedings are to commence (i.e., the filing of an application) and the contents that must be contained in the application that commences those proceedings.

Laws &#167; 10-9.1-4 (emphasis added). Based on these statutory provisions, no Rhode Island decision that we can find has ever held that state post-conviction proceedings &#8212; the genesis of \"State post-conviction or other collateral review\" &#8212; are initiated with the filing of a motion for appointment of post-conviction counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Cf. Beery,</i> 312 F.3d at 951 (finding that under a nearly identical state post-conviction statutory scheme, \"Iowa courts have not held postconviction proceedings begin with a motion for appointment of counsel\"). In fact, recently the Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected such an argument; it held that the mere filing of a motion for appointment of counsel &#8212; without more &#8212; does not constitute a state post-conviction \"application,\" the triggering mechanism for commencement of Rhode Island post-conviction collateral review. <i>See O'Neil v. State,</i> 814 A.2d 366, 367 (R.I.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>O'Neil</i> was a case in which the State and the petitioner assumed reverse roles to the parties' positions here. In <i>O'Neil,</i> a petitioner was appealing an order denying both his motion for modification of sentence and his application for post-conviction relief. <i>Id.</i> at 366. The petitioner argued that a motion justice prematurely denied him post-conviction relief because he (i.e., the petitioner) had not yet filed a request for such relief. <i>Id.</i> It was the petitioner's position that \"the motion justice misconstrued his motions for appointment of counsel and for modification of sentence as a request for post-conviction relief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 367. According to the petitioner, although he had asked for the appointment of counsel to assist him in the preparation of his application, he did not request post-conviction relief itself. <i>Id.</i> On appeal, the State did not appear to disagree with the petitioner's contention. As the court pointed out, the State did not oppose having the case remanded so that the petitioner could proceed with an application for post-conviction relief. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no need to delve into &#8212; or even mention &#8212; the requirements of &#167;&#167; 10-9.1-3 or 4, in a brief analysis the court held that the motions to appoint counsel and for modification of sentence \"could not be fairly construed as an <i>application</i> for post-conviction relief.\" <i>O'Neil,</i> 814 A.2d at 367 (emphasis added). This conclusion was supported by two grounds: First, the court explained that leniency should be afforded to <i>pro se</i> litigants. <i>Id.</i> Second, it observed that although the petitioner \"mentions post-conviction relief in his motion to appoint counsel ... <i>he did not seek that relief in the motion</i> for modification of his sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Thus, a motion to appoint counsel may not be fairly construed as an \"application\" commencing post-conviction proceedings unless the motion &#8212; at the very minimum &#8212; actually \"seeks\" post-conviction relief. Therefore, as a matter of Rhode Island law, it appears that for a motion to appoint counsel to qualify as an \"application\" commencing State post-conviction collateral review, at a minimum the motion must contain a \"request\" for post-conviction relief. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-9.1-4 (\"The application shall ... specifically set forth the grounds upon which the application is based, and clearly state the relief desired.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giving the term \"application\" its natural meaning, a filing that purports to be an application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim must set forth the grounds upon which it is based, and must state the relief desired; it must attack collaterally the relevant conviction or sentence. <i>See Mastracchio v. Houle,</i> 416 A.2d 116, 117 (R.I.1980) (The Act \"provides the exclusive remedy to be utilized for appropriate collateral attack upon a criminal conviction on any ground of alleged error ... available under common-law or statutory postconviction remedies.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, in the absence of an explicit request for post-conviction relief as specified in &#167; 10-9.1-4, we interpret <i>O'Neil</i> to hold that a motion for the appointment of counsel fails to initiate post-conviction proceedings and, thus, fails to give life to an application for post-conviction review: \"It does not appear that the motions filed by [the petitioner] should be interpreted as a request for post-conviction relief.... [The petitioner] mentions post conviction relief in his motion to appoint counsel, but he did not seek that relief in the motion for modification of his sentence.\" <i>O'Neil,</i> 814 A.2d at 367. If a motion to appoint counsel does not qualify as an application for post-conviction review under state law, then it does not satisfy 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2)'s requirement of a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\" <i>See Beery,</i> 312 F.3d at 951 (finding that because the petitioner's \"motion for appointment of ... state postconviction counsel does not contain the information required by [the Iowa statute] for postconviction petitions[,]\" then \"the request does not constitute a `properly filed' application for State post-conviction ... review\" under &#167; 2244(d)(2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, a review of Voravongsa's June 24, 1997, post-conviction motion for appointment of counsel makes plain that he did not collaterally attack his state conviction or sentence; he simply did not \"request\" post-conviction or other collateral review. In his motion, which was entitled \"Petitioner's Motion for Appointment of Counsel,\" Voravongsa wrote, \"[n]ow comes the petitioner <i>in the above entitled action, a motion to appoint counsel,</i> to represent his interests in this application for post conviction relief.\" (Emphasis added). Although he uses the words \"in this application for post conviction relief,\" as was true in <i>O'Neil,</i> this is more of a fleeting reference to post-conviction relief as opposed to a request for such relief. Furthermore, Voravongsa then indicated that his motion was being made pursuant to Rhode Island General Law &#167; 10-9.1-5, which affords indigent applicants legal representation. He went on to list three reasons why he should be provided with counsel; he did not state any grounds upon which any relief could be granted. Finally, in his prayer for relief, he only sought the appointment of counsel &#8212; not post-conviction relief itself: \"For the reasons stated above, the petitioner <i>prays that this Honorable Court appoint him counsel</i> and that said counsel be available to him at all and any future proceedings which may occur in the instant matter.\" (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, no amount of analytical or linguistic massaging can transmogrify Voravongsa's passing reference to \"this application for post conviction relief\" from a motion for counsel into an application for post-conviction or other collateral review. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the civil docket sheet shows that the court did not assign a civil docket number to Voravongsa's post-conviction proceeding until September 4, 1998, when Voravongsa filed a traditional post-conviction application that presumably complied with the statutory requirements of &#167;&#167; 10-9.1-3 and 4. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-9.1-3 (\"The clerk shall docket the application upon its receipt and promptly bring it to the attention of the court and deliver a copy to the attorney general.\"). Thus, contrary to Voravongsa's argument, it appears that the superior court did not view or treat Voravongsa's <i>pro se</i> motion as a properly filed application for post-conviction review. The court certainly could not have undertaken any collateral review &#8212; and did not provide any on-the-merits rulings &#8212; on the issue of post-conviction relief. This explains why neither the superior court nor the State apparently invoked &#167; 10-9.1-8 to dismiss Voravongsa's September 4, 1998, formal post-conviction-relief application once it was filed. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-9.1-8 (\"All grounds for relief available to an applicant at the time he or she commences a proceeding under this chapter must be raised in [the] original, or a supplemental or amended, application. Any ground finally adjudicated or not so raised ... may not be the basis for a subsequent application\" unless the court determines that justice dictates otherwise.). Here, there is no hint that Voravongsa's September 4, 1998, application was labeled or viewed as a supplemental or amended application or that the trial court made a finding that in the interest of justice, Voravongsa's claims should be considered notwithstanding the fact that they were not presented in his June 24, 1997, motions. Accordingly, the historical facts, too, decisively point in the direction that Voravongsa's motion for counsel was not, and should not be, treated as an application for State post-conviction or other collateral review. With no predicate State post-conviction application having been filed in a timely manner, Voravongsa is not entitled to have the time-limitations period of &#167; 2244(d)(1) tolled by virtue of &#167; 2244(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Equitable Tolling</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a last resort, Voravongsa contends that we should exercise our discretion to equitably toll AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. In this circuit, however, it is unclear whether equitable tolling is even available with respect to &#167; 2244(d)(1). <i>See Donovan v. Maine,</i> 276 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir.2002) (\"Whether, as a matter of law, equitable tolling is available, even in a factually appropriate case, in respect to section 2244(d)(1) ... is not free from doubt.\") (citation omitted). As in <i>Donovan,</i> the case at bar is not an appropriate case for us to decide this issue because even assuming hypothetically that equitable tolling is available, the facts of this case would not warrant its utilization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Voravongsa's argument for equitable tolling is predicated on the Rhode Island Supreme Court's decision in <i>Shatney,</i> 755 A.2d at 135. However, as already discussed above, <i>Shatney</i> cannot rescue Voravongsa's untimely state post-conviction application. Accordingly, it, too, cannot serve as basis for equitable tolling. To the extent Voravongsa suggests that his <i>pro se</i> status should provide grounds for this extraordinary remedy, <i>see Donovan,</i> 276 F.3d at 93 (explaining that \"equitable tolling, if available at all, is the exception rather than the rule; and that resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified only in extraordinary circumstances\") (internal quotation marks, brackets and citation omitted), this argument has already been rejected: \"The petitioner's assertion that his <i>pro se</i> status somehow entitles him to equitable tolling is wide of the mark. While <i>pro se</i> pleadings are to be liberally construed ... the policy of liberal construction cannot plausibly justify a party's failure to file a habeas petition on time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 94. Thus, we decline to invoke equitable tolling in this case, even assuming that we could.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the dismissal of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the petitioner spells his name \"Vor<i>a</i> vongsa,\" the briefs in this appeal spell his name \"Vor<i>v</i> avongsa\" and the Rhode Island courts spelled his name \"Vor<i>g</i> vongsa.\" Unless referring to a state court decision, we will follow the district court's practice of using the spelling \"Voravongsa,\" the same spelling employed in the certificate of appealability.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The state docket sheet in the underlying criminal case (Rhode Island Superior Court No. P1-1990-2966A) indicates that these three motions were filed on<i>July</i> 24, 1997.

The certificate of appealability in this case ordered the parties to address whether a formal state post-conviction application was in fact made by Voravongsa on June 24, 1997, and, implicitly, whether the July 24, 1997, date contained in the docket sheet represents a typographical error. Rather than respond to this court's order for clarification, each party repeatedly asserts that June 24, 1997, is the only relevant date for purposes of determining whether AEDPA's time-limitations period was tolled by Voravongsa's filing of his motion for the appointment of counsel and other related motions. Accordingly, based on the parties' agreement, we analyze this appeal on the basis that the only relevant date that these documents were filed was indeed June 24, 1997, and that no formal application for state habeas relief was filed on that date.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As indicated above, although Voravongsa filed three separate motions on June 24, 1997, we granted a COA only on the question of whether Voravongsa's motion for appointment of state post-conviction counsel may serve as a properly filed application for State post-conviction review. \"AEDPA limits the scope of habeas review, so that issues not included in a COA cannot be heard on appeal.\"<i>Neverson v.

Although the question is one of first impression in this circuit, a straightforward reading of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2), as well as the Rhode Island post-conviction statutory scheme, and the federal and state court decisions interpreting each of the statutes, make plain that Voravongsa's federal habeas petition was untimely under AEDPA's statute of limitations. Accordingly, the district court's dismissal of Voravongsa's habeas petition is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, Voravongsa was convicted in Rhode Island of first degree murder. Although the trial court granted Voravongsa's motion for a new trial, the Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded the case with directions to deny the motion for a new trial, reinstate his conviction, and proceed with sentencing. <i>See State v. Vorgvongsa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436855\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436855/state-v-vorgvongsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span>, 1255 (R.I.1996) (<i>Vorgvongsa I</i>). On remand, Voravongsa was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment. His direct appeal of that conviction was denied by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. <i>See State v. Vorgvongsa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1969607\"><a href=\"/opinion/1969607/state-v-vorgvongsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span> (R.I.1997) (<i>Vorgvongsa II</i>). He did not file a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, and, pursuant to court rules, the ninety-day period in which he had to do so expired on July 14, 1997. Thus, on that date, his conviction became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this appeal, the parties agree that on June 24, 1997, Voravongsa filed three separate motions in the Rhode Island Superior Court: (1) motion for appointment of counsel; (2) petition for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum; and (3) motion to assign.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On August 4, 1997, the Rhode Island Superior Court appointed an attorney to represent him. The parties agree that on September 4, 1998, thirteen months after being provided with counsel, and nearly seventeen months after the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, Voravongsa filed a counseled application for state post-conviction relief pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws &#167; 10-9.1-1 <i>et seq.</i> The application was denied on October 20, 1999. <i>See In the Matter of Vorgvongsa,</i> No. 98-4502, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1001187</span></span>, at *1 (R.I.Super.1999) (<i>Vorgvongsa III</i>). On December 3, 2001, the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the denial of relief. <i>See Vorgvongsa v.</i> <i>State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2376401\"><a href=\"/opinion/2376401/vorgvongsa-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 550 (R.I.2001) (<i>Vorgvongsa IV</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While waiting for a decision from the Rhode Island Supreme Court on his petition for state post-conviction relief, on March 24, 2000, Voravongsa filed in federal court a <i>pro se</i> petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 and a motion for the appointment of counsel. The State then moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was time-barred. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the habeas petition be dismissed as barred by AEDPA's statute of limitations. In relevant part, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1), as amended by AEDPA, which imposes a one-year period of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.

His objection implied that AEDPA's statute of limitations should be tolled onward from June 24, 1997, the date his <i>pro se</i> motion for appointment of counsel and other related motions were filed. Subsequently, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and granted the State's motion to dismiss Voravongsa's habeas petition. It did not address Voravongsa's contention that his <i>pro se</i> motion for appointment of counsel, as well as other motions, tolled AEDPA's limitations period from the date on which those motions were filed. We granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue of whether Voravongsa's \"<i>pro se</i> motion for appointment of counsel to represent him in his state post-conviction proceeding may constitute a `properly filed application for State post-conviction ... review' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2)\" (alteration in the COA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Unlike federal habeas petitions, Rhode Island does not impose time limits on the filing of applications for post-conviction relief. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-9.1-3 (\"An application may be filed at any time.\"). However, it specifies both the process by which postconviction proceedings are to commence (i.e., the filing of an application) and the contents that must be contained in the application that commences those proceedings. Thus, pursuant to &#167; 10-9.1-3, \"[a] proceeding is commenced by filing an application verified by the applicant with the clerk of the appropriate court.\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-9.1-3.

Laws &#167; 10-9.1-4 (emphasis added). Based on these statutory provisions, no Rhode Island decision that we can find has ever held that state post-conviction proceedings &#8212; the genesis of \"State post-conviction or other collateral review\" &#8212; are initiated with the filing of a motion for appointment of post-conviction counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Cf. Beery,</i> 312 F.3d at 951 (finding that under a nearly identical state post-conviction statutory scheme, \"Iowa courts have not held postconviction proceedings begin with a motion for appointment of counsel\"). In fact, recently the Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected such an argument; it held that the mere filing of a motion for appointment of counsel &#8212; without more &#8212; does not constitute a state post-conviction \"application,\" the triggering mechanism for commencement of Rhode Island post-conviction collateral review. <i>See O'Neil v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258247/oneil-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span>, 367 (R.I.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>O'Neil</i> was a case in which the State and the petitioner assumed reverse roles to the parties' positions here. In <i>O'Neil,</i> a petitioner was appealing an order denying both his motion for modification of sentence and his application for post-conviction relief. <i>Id.</i> at 366. The petitioner argued that a motion justice prematurely denied him post-conviction relief because he (i.e., the petitioner) had not yet filed a request for such relief. <i>Id.</i> It was the petitioner's position that \"the motion justice misconstrued his motions for appointment of counsel and for modification of sentence as a request for post-conviction relief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 367. According to the petitioner, although he had asked for the appointment of counsel to assist him in the preparation of his application, he did not request post-conviction relief itself. <i>Id.</i> On appeal, the State did not appear to disagree with the petitioner's contention. As the court pointed out, the State did not oppose having the case remanded so that the petitioner could proceed with an application for post-conviction relief. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no need to delve into &#8212; or even mention &#8212; the requirements of &#167;&#167; 10-9.1-3 or 4, in a brief analysis the court held that the motions to appoint counsel and for modification of sentence \"could not be fairly construed as an <i>application</i> for post-conviction relief.\" <i>O'Neil,</i> 814 A.2d at 367 (emphasis added). This conclusion was supported by two grounds: First, the court explained that leniency should be afforded to <i>pro se</i> litigants. <i>Id.</i> Second, it observed that although the petitioner \"mentions post-conviction relief in his motion to appoint counsel ... <i>he did not seek that relief in the motion</i> for modification of his sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Thus, a motion to appoint counsel may not be fairly construed as an \"application\" commencing post-conviction proceedings unless the motion &#8212; at the very minimum &#8212; actually \"seeks\" post-conviction relief. Therefore, as a matter of Rhode Island law, it appears that for a motion to appoint counsel to qualify as an \"application\" commencing State post-conviction collateral review, at a minimum the motion must contain a \"request\" for post-conviction relief. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-9.1-4 (\"The application shall ... specifically set forth the grounds upon which the application is based, and clearly state the relief desired.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giving the term \"application\" its natural meaning, a filing that purports to be an application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim must set forth the grounds upon which it is based, and must state the relief desired; it must attack collaterally the relevant conviction or sentence. <i>See Mastracchio v. Houle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1961968\"><a href=\"/opinion/1961968/mastracchio-v-houle/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span>, 117 (R.I.1980) (The Act \"provides the exclusive remedy to be utilized for appropriate collateral attack upon a criminal conviction on any ground of alleged error ... available under common-law or statutory postconviction remedies.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, in the absence of an explicit request for post-conviction relief as specified in &#167; 10-9.1-4, we interpret <i>O'Neil</i> to hold that a motion for the appointment of counsel fails to initiate post-conviction proceedings and, thus, fails to give life to an application for post-conviction review: \"It does not appear that the motions filed by [the petitioner] should be interpreted as a request for post-conviction relief.... [The petitioner] mentions post conviction relief in his motion to appoint counsel, but he did not seek that relief in the motion for modification of his sentence.\" <i>O'Neil,</i> 814 A.2d at 367. If a motion to appoint counsel does not qualify as an application for post-conviction review under state law, then it does not satisfy 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2)'s requirement of a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\" <i>See Beery,</i> 312 F.3d at 951 (finding that because the petitioner's \"motion for appointment of ... state postconviction counsel does not contain the information required by [the Iowa statute] for postconviction petitions[,]\" then \"the request does not constitute a `properly filed' application for State post-conviction ... review\" under &#167; 2244(d)(2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, a review of Voravongsa's June 24, 1997, post-conviction motion for appointment of counsel makes plain that he did not collaterally attack his state conviction or sentence; he simply did not \"request\" post-conviction or other collateral review. In his motion, which was entitled \"Petitioner's Motion for Appointment of Counsel,\" Voravongsa wrote, \"[n]ow comes the petitioner <i>in the above entitled action, a motion to appoint counsel,</i> to represent his interests in this application for post conviction relief.\" (Emphasis added). Although he uses the words \"in this application for post conviction relief,\" as was true in <i>O'Neil,</i> this is more of a fleeting reference to post-conviction relief as opposed to a request for such relief. Furthermore, Voravongsa then indicated that his motion was being made pursuant to Rhode Island General Law &#167; 10-9.1-5, which affords indigent applicants legal representation. He went on to list three reasons why he should be provided with counsel; he did not state any grounds upon which any relief could be granted. Finally, in his prayer for relief, he only sought the appointment of counsel &#8212; not post-conviction relief itself: \"For the reasons stated above, the petitioner <i>prays that this Honorable Court appoint him counsel</i> and that said counsel be available to him at all and any future proceedings which may occur in the instant matter.\" (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, no amount of analytical or linguistic massaging can transmogrify Voravongsa's passing reference to \"this application for post conviction relief\" from a motion for counsel into an application for post-conviction or other collateral review. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the civil docket sheet shows that the court did not assign a civil docket number to Voravongsa's post-conviction proceeding until September 4, 1998, when Voravongsa filed a traditional post-conviction application that presumably complied with the statutory requirements of &#167;&#167; 10-9.1-3 and 4. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-9.1-3 (\"The clerk shall docket the application upon its receipt and promptly bring it to the attention of the court and deliver a copy to the attorney general.\"). Thus, contrary to Voravongsa's argument, it appears that the superior court did not view or treat Voravongsa's <i>pro se</i> motion as a properly filed application for post-conviction review. The court certainly could not have undertaken any collateral review &#8212; and did not provide any on-the-merits rulings &#8212; on the issue of post-conviction relief. This explains why neither the superior court nor the State apparently invoked &#167; 10-9.1-8 to dismiss Voravongsa's September 4, 1998, formal post-conviction-relief application once it was filed. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 10-9.1-8 (\"All grounds for relief available to an applicant at the time he or she commences a proceeding under this chapter must be raised in [the] original, or a supplemental or amended, application. Any ground finally adjudicated or not so raised ... may not be the basis for a subsequent application\" unless the court determines that justice dictates otherwise.). Here, there is no hint that Voravongsa's September 4, 1998, application was labeled or viewed as a supplemental or amended application or that the trial court made a finding that in the interest of justice, Voravongsa's claims should be considered notwithstanding the fact that they were not presented in his June 24, 1997, motions. Accordingly, the historical facts, too, decisively point in the direction that Voravongsa's motion for counsel was not, and should not be, treated as an application for State post-conviction or other collateral review. With no predicate State post-conviction application having been filed in a timely manner, Voravongsa is not entitled to have the time-limitations period of &#167; 2244(d)(1) tolled by virtue of &#167; 2244(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Equitable Tolling</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a last resort, Voravongsa contends that we should exercise our discretion to equitably toll AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. In this circuit, however, it is unclear whether equitable tolling is even available with respect to &#167; 2244(d)(1). <i>See Donovan v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199772\"><a href=\"/opinion/199772/donovan-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.2002) (\"Whether, as a matter of law, equitable tolling is available, even in a factually appropriate case, in respect to section 2244(d)(1) ... is not free from doubt.\") (citation omitted). As in <i>Donovan,</i> the case at bar is not an appropriate case for us to decide this issue because even assuming hypothetically that equitable tolling is available, the facts of this case would not warrant its utilization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Voravongsa's argument for equitable tolling is predicated on the Rhode Island Supreme Court's decision in <i>Shatney,</i> 755 A.2d at 135. However, as already discussed above, <i>Shatney</i> cannot rescue Voravongsa's untimely state post-conviction application. Accordingly, it, too, cannot serve as basis for equitable tolling. To the extent Voravongsa suggests that his <i>pro se</i> status should provide grounds for this extraordinary remedy, <i>see Donovan,</i> 276 F.3d at 93 (explaining that \"equitable tolling, if available at all, is the exception rather than the rule; and that resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified only in extraordinary circumstances\") (internal quotation marks, brackets and citation omitted), this argument has already been rejected: \"The petitioner's assertion that his <i>pro se</i> status somehow entitles him to equitable tolling is wide of the mark. While <i>pro se</i> pleadings are to be liberally construed ... the policy of liberal construction cannot plausibly justify a party's failure to file a habeas petition on time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 94. Thus, we decline to invoke equitable tolling in this case, even assuming that we could.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the dismissal of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the petitioner spells his name \"Vor<i>a</i> vongsa,\" the briefs in this appeal spell his name \"Vor<i>v</i> avongsa\" and the Rhode Island courts spelled his name \"Vor<i>g</i> vongsa.\" Unless referring to a state court decision, we will follow the district court's practice of using the spelling \"Voravongsa,\" the same spelling employed in the certificate of appealability.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The state docket sheet in the underlying criminal case (Rhode Island Superior Court No. P1-1990-2966A) indicates that these three motions were filed on<i>July</i> 24, 1997.

The certificate of appealability in this case ordered the parties to address whether a formal state post-conviction application was in fact made by Voravongsa on June 24, 1997, and, implicitly, whether the July 24, 1997, date contained in the docket sheet represents a typographical error. Rather than respond to this court's order for clarification, each party repeatedly asserts that June 24, 1997, is the only relevant date for purposes of determining whether AEDPA's time-limitations period was tolled by Voravongsa's filing of his motion for the appointment of counsel and other related motions. Accordingly, based on the parties' agreement, we analyze this appeal on the basis that the only relevant date that these documents were filed was indeed June 24, 1997, and that no formal application for state habeas relief was filed on that date.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As indicated above, although Voravongsa filed three separate motions on June 24, 1997, we granted a COA only on the question of whether Voravongsa's motion for appointment of state post-conviction counsel may serve as a properly filed application for State post-conviction review. \"AEDPA limits the scope of habeas review, so that issues not included in a COA cannot be heard on appeal.\"<i>Neverson v.
