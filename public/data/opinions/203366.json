Roberto Loyo-Arévalo (\"Loyo\")\n\nis a twenty-eight year-old national of Guatemala who entered the\n\nUnited States without inspection in December 1999. Loyo was placed\n\nin deportation proceedings, and he requested withholding of removal\n\nbased on political persecution. The immigration judge (\"IJ\") found\n\nLoyo's allegations of persecution to be incredible, denied his\n\npetition to withhold removal, and ordered him removed to Guatemala.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") summarily affirmed this\n\ndecision.    After careful consideration, we deny Loyo's petition.\n\n                               I.    Background1\n\n            Loyo    claims    that   when    he   was   in   Guatemala   he   was\n\npolitically active in the Guatemala Republican Front (\"FRG\") and\n\nofficially joined the party in mid-1999.                In November 1999, he\n\nassisted    the    campaign    of    FRG   presidential      candidate   Alfonso\n\nPortillo in his hometown of Zacapa, distributing flyers and talking\n\nto people about Portillo's platform.\n\n            While   riding    with    Portillo's    100-plus     car   motorcade\n\nbetween Zacapa and San Jorge, Loyo claims to have been attacked\n\nwhen he stopped his vehicle to set up fireworks on the side of the\n\nroad.   He was allegedly shot in the left leg.               He did not see his\n\nattacker, but asserts that the shots came from behind bushes on the\n\n\n\n1\n   We gather the facts as presented to the IJ, along with the\naffidavit accompanying Loyo's withholding application, and consider\nthe agency's findings with respect to that evidence. See Sok v.\nMukasey, 526 F.3d 48, 50 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fside of the road.    Nobody else was injured.         Loyo was taken to a\n\nhospital under police protection, which he claims was necessary\n\nbecause rivals would often come to the hospital to kill a target\n\nwho survived an attack.    He left the hospital without an operation\n\nbecause he claims his family received threats about his safety. At\n\nhome, he and his family received threatening phone calls nearly\n\nevery day for six months -- even after Loyo left the country --\n\nuntil the callers realized that he was no longer in Guatemala.\n\nFearing for his life, Loyo testified that he applied for a U.S.\n\nvisa before the shooting in 1999, but was denied.                He later\n\nobtained a visa to Mexico.      In December 1999, he left Guatemala and\n\ncrossed the border into Texas from Mexico.       After his arrest with\n\nhis brother for a traffic violation in 2003, Loyo was placed in\n\ndeportation proceedings.\n\n          During the proceedings, Loyo admitted to removability,\n\nbut filed a petition for withholding of removal.            On January 12,\n\n2006, the IJ denied Loyo's petition and ordered him removed.             The\n\nIJ based this decision on the determination that Loyo's allegations\n\nof   persecution   were   not    credible   because    of   a   number    of\n\ninconsistencies in his representation before the court:             First,\n\nLoyo testified that he stayed at the hospital for three days and\n\nthat he did not have an operation on his leg; his I-589 form stated\n\nthat he stayed at the hospital for ten days and that he had an\n\noperation. Second, Loyo testified that the bullet went through his\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fleft leg; one of his corroborating documents, however, stated that\n\nhe had been shot in his right leg and there was no exit wound.\n\nThird, Loyo testified that he was shot in November 1999; his\n\nsupporting documents, however, indicate that the shooting occurred\n\non October 31, 1999.      Fourth, Loyo testified that he applied for a\n\nU.S. visa before he was shot; his Form I-589, however, said he\n\napplied for the visa after he was released from the hospital.\n\nFurthermore,   the   IJ    found   that   Loyo   had   not   sufficiently\n\ncorroborated his claims that he was shot in the leg during a\n\npolitical campaign or that he was threatened after the alleged\n\nshooting, thus undermining his claim that he was targeted for his\n\npolitical beliefs. Accordingly, the IJ concluded that Loyo had not\n\nestablished past persecution based on political affiliation.         The\n\nBIA affirmed, and Loyo now petitions for review.\n\n                             II.   Discussion\n\n           A. Standard of Review\n\n           Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ's\n\ndecision, we review the IJ's decision.       See Tota v. Gonzáles, 457\n\nF.3d 161, 165 (1st Cir. 2006).      We review the findings of fact and\n\nthe reasons given for substantial evidence, where the credibility\n\ndetermination must be upheld \"'unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\"             Journal v.\n\nKeisler, 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)\n\n(4)(B)).\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            B. Withholding of Removal\n\n            Loyo asserts that the IJ's determination and order of\n\nremoval    was   not     based   on   substantial     evidence   and   should   be\n\nvacated.    He claims that he was not offered any opportunity to\n\nexplain any of these discrepancies, and such discrepancies did not\n\nreach the heart of his claim.               He also claims that he did not\n\nobtain any additional corroborating evidence because he did not\n\nknow such evidence was necessary and he was not instructed to do so\n\nby his counsel.         We find his arguments unavailing.\n\n            Withholding of removal is a form of relief available to\n\nan alien who establishes that it is more likely than not that he\n\nwould be persecuted if he returns to his country of origin.                 See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2); Journal, 507 F.3d at 13.                       An adverse\n\ncredibility determination disposes of an alien's claim of past\n\npersecution.      See Toloza-Jiménez v. Gonzáles, 457 F.3d 155, 160\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (citing Olujoke v. González, 411 F.3d 16, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 2005)).       An alien may be found to be incredible based on\n\ndiscrepancies      in    testimony     where   \"(1)    the   discrepancies      and\n\nomissions described by the [IJ or BIA] are actually present; (2)\n\nthese discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent\n\nreasons    to    conclude    that     the   respondent    provided     incredible\n\ntestimony; and (3) the respondent has not provided a convincing\n\nexplanation for the discrepancies and omissions.\"                In re A-S-, 21\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fI. & N. Dec. 1106, 1109 (BIA 1998); see also Hoxha v. Gonzáles, 446\n\nF.3d 210, 216-17 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Substantial evidence in the record supports the IJ's\n\nfinding   that    Loyo    failed   to   meet   his   burden    of   establishing\n\neligibility for withholding of removal.              The record supports the\n\nIJ's finding that Loyo was not a credible witness, and he failed to\n\nprovide sufficient corroborating evidence.            See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13\n\n(a). Loyo rests his entire relief application on a single incident\n\n-- the alleged shooting -- that is not adequately documented, and\n\nhis story has numerous inconsistencies.\n\n            The    IJ's    credibility    determination       is    supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence.        Loyo was given the opportunity to account\n\nfor the inconsistencies noted above during cross-examination at his\n\ndeportation hearing; he was unable to do so.                   Loyo could not\n\nadequately explain the inconsistency regarding how long he was in\n\nthe hospital.      His claim that he did not remember only serves to\n\nrender    him    more    incredible.2     Loyo's     testimony      as   to   other\n\ninconsistencies in his supporting documents -- that they were\n\nwritten in by Guatemalan officials who \"write down whatever they\n\nwant\" -- undermines the authenticity of the few documents he did\n\n\n\n2\n   Loyo also testified that the night he left the hospital his\nhouse was surrounded by people who dared him to come out, but when\nhe was asked about this incident on cross-examination and why he\nhad not mentioned it in his application, he twice claimed that he\nhad mentioned it in his application. The incident does not appear\nin his application.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fsubmit.3    While some of the discrepancies may seem minor, \"their\n\ncumulative effect is great.\"4         Pan v. Gonzáles, 489 F.3d 80, 86\n\n(1st Cir. 2007). The IJ gave a \"'specific, cogent, and supportable\n\nexplanation'\" for his adverse credibility determination.          Yosd v.\n\nMukasey, 514 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Heng v. Gonzáles,\n\n493 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 2007)).       Loyo has failed to meet the high\n\nthreshold   of   showing   that   a   reasonable   fact-finder   would   be\n\ncompelled to find otherwise.\n\n            C. Summary Affirmance Procedure\n\n            Loyo asserts that the BIA abused its discretion in using\n\nthe summary affirmance procedure in this case, and he challenges\n\nthis court's jurisdiction over his claim that the BIA violated the\n\nsummary affirmance procedure.         He claims that summary affirmance\n\nwas not appropriate under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(i) because the\n\nlower IJ opinion 1) was not correct, and 2) its errors were not\n\nharmless or non-material.     We disagree.\n\n            As we found above, the IJ's decision was correct and\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.          As such, Loyo's statutory\n\nargument fails.     The BIA was within its statutory discretion to\n\nutilize the summary affirmance procedure.          See Hoxha, 446 F.3d at\n\n\n3\n   The police report he submitted, for example, states only that\nLoyo was shot while walking. The report does not mention anything\nabout a presidential motorcade or campaign.\n4\n   For example, Loyo was also unable to adequately explain why he\ntestified that his brother came to the United States in 2004 when\nthey were arrested together in 2003.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f220-21.   The jurisdictional issue pointed out by the parties will\n\nhave to await resolution on another day.     See Feliz v. Gonzáles,\n\n487 F.3d 71, 75-76 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, Loyo's petition is denied.\n\n          Denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

See 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2); Journal, 507 F.3d at 13.                       An adverse\n\ncredibility determination disposes of an alien's claim of past\n\npersecution.      See Toloza-Jiménez v.

An alien may be found to be incredible based on\n\ndiscrepancies      in    testimony     where   \"(1)    the   discrepancies      and\n\nomissions described by the [IJ or BIA] are actually present; (2)\n\nthese discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent\n\nreasons    to    conclude    that     the   respondent    provided     incredible\n\ntestimony; and (3) the respondent has not provided a convincing\n\nexplanation for the discrepancies and omissions.\"                In re A-S-, 21\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fI. & N.

The record supports the\n\nIJ's finding that Loyo was not a credible witness, and he failed to\n\nprovide sufficient corroborating evidence.            See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13\n\n(a). Loyo rests his entire relief application on a single incident\n\n-- the alleged shooting -- that is not adequately documented, and\n\nhis story has numerous inconsistencies.\n\n            The    IJ's    credibility    determination       is    supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence.        Loyo was given the opportunity to account\n\nfor the inconsistencies noted above during cross-examination at his\n\ndeportation hearing; he was unable to do so.                   Loyo could not\n\nadequately explain the inconsistency regarding how long he was in\n\nthe hospital.      His claim that he did not remember only serves to\n\nrender    him    more    incredible.2     Loyo's     testimony      as   to   other\n\ninconsistencies in his supporting documents -- that they were\n\nwritten in by Guatemalan officials who \"write down whatever they\n\nwant\" -- undermines the authenticity of the few documents he did\n\n\n\n2\n   Loyo also testified that the night he left the hospital his\nhouse was surrounded by people who dared him to come out, but when\nhe was asked about this incident on cross-examination and why he\nhad not mentioned it in his application, he twice claimed that he\nhad mentioned it in his application. The incident does not appear\nin his application.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fsubmit.3    While some of the discrepancies may seem minor, \"their\n\ncumulative effect is great.\"4         Pan v.

Loyo has failed to meet the high\n\nthreshold   of   showing   that   a   reasonable   fact-finder   would   be\n\ncompelled to find otherwise.\n\n            C. Summary Affirmance Procedure\n\n            Loyo asserts that the BIA abused its discretion in using\n\nthe summary affirmance procedure in this case, and he challenges\n\nthis court's jurisdiction over his claim that the BIA violated the\n\nsummary affirmance procedure.         He claims that summary affirmance\n\nwas not appropriate under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(i) because the\n\nlower IJ opinion 1) was not correct, and 2) its errors were not\n\nharmless or non-material.     We disagree.\n\n            As we found above, the IJ's decision was correct and\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.          As such, Loyo's statutory\n\nargument fails.     The BIA was within its statutory discretion to\n\nutilize the summary affirmance procedure.          See Hoxha, 446 F.3d at\n\n\n3\n   The police report he submitted, for example, states only that\nLoyo was shot while walking. The report does not mention anything\nabout a presidential motorcade or campaign.\n4\n   For example, Loyo was also unable to adequately explain why he\ntestified that his brother came to the United States in 2004 when\nthey were arrested together in 2003.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f220-21.
