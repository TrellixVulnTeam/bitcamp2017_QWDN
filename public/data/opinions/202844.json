Un on brief for petitioner.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Gina Walcott-\nTorres, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n                              July 13, 2007\n\f            Per Curiam.    The petitioner, Seda Bunthan, is a middle-\n\naged native and citizen of Cambodia. She entered the United States\n\non April 1, 2001, as a visitor, and overstayed the time allotted in\n\nher visa.    Within one year of her arrival, she sought asylum.   When\n\nher case was referred for the institution of removal proceedings,\n\nshe conceded removability and cross-applied for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT) on the ground that she had suffered from, and continued to\n\nfear, persecution and torture related to her involvement in a\n\nCambodian political group.\n\n            An Immigration Judge (IJ) ruled that the petitioner had\n\nfailed to present sufficient evidence to support any ground for\n\nrelief.      Consequently, he denied her application and ordered\n\nremoval.    The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted the IJ's\n\ndecision and affirmed his ukase. The petitioner now seeks judicial\n\nreview.     Concluding, as we do, that there is substantial evidence\n\nin the record to support the BIA's decision, we deny the petition.\n\n            We set out the petitioner's version of the raw facts.\n\nShe worked for many years as a schoolteacher in Takhmao, Cambodia.\n\nOn June 4, 1998, she and several other teachers joined the Sam\n\nRainsy Party (SRP).       At the time, the SRP stood in opposition to\n\nthe reigning Cambodia People's Party (CPP) and its leader, Prime\n\nMinister Hun Sen. The school committee took umbrage at this action\n\nand chastised the teachers.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          During the 1998 elections, the petitioner claims to have\n\nworked with the SRP's national campaign committee.    Between August\n\n23 and September 8 of that year, she participated in a long-running\n\ndemonstration against Hun Sen and his regime — a demonstration that\n\ncalled for his resignation.1    She claims that, as a result of these\n\nactivities, shots were fired at her.2       Moreover, CPP adherents\n\ntried to assault her.   After a grenade explosion inflicted minor\n\ninjuries, she left the scene of the demonstration.\n\n          The petitioner also recounted an incident that happened\n\nmore than two years later.     She claimed that, on January 20, 2001,\n\nshe and her husband came under fire as they were riding on a\n\nmotorcycle in the Takhmao market area. Shortly after this episode,\n\nthe petitioner repaired to the United States.\n\n          Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ rendered a\n\nbench decision.   He determined that the petitioner had failed to\n\nshow either that she had suffered past persecution or that she\n\nharbored a well-founded fear of future persecution.      The IJ also\n\nfound that she had not shown a likelihood of torture were she to be\n\nreturned to her homeland.      In explaining these findings, the IJ\n\n\n     1\n      There is also some suggestion in the hearing transcript that\nthe petitioner, along with other faculty members at her school,\nparticipated in an April 1998 demonstration. The details of that\nrally are hazy and, in all events, the petitioner does not mention\nit in her appellate briefing.\n     2\n      Although the petitioner testified before the IJ about the\nfiring of shots, she made no mention of that in her asylum\napplication.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fconstrued the 1998 incident as an unfortunate case of police\n\noverreaction, not a direct attack on the petitioner based on her\n\npolitical views. He noted that the incident had occurred over two-\n\nand-one-half years prior to the petitioner's exodus from Cambodia\n\nand that, in the interim, the petitioner had \"continued to maintain\n\nher profession in that country.\"\n\n          The IJ also squarely addressed the 2001 incident.     He\n\ndetermined that it was much more likely to have been the product of\n\nrandom criminal activity than to have been retribution for the\n\npetitioner's political activities. In this regard, the IJ observed\n\nthat the petitioner, who initially had written in her asylum\n\napplication that Hun Sen's \"hit men\" had fired the shots, had\n\nretracted that claim at the hearing and had conceded that she could\n\nnot identify the perpetrators.\n\n          The IJ concluded that, taken together, the 1998 and 2001\n\nincidents did not fairly support the petitioner's claim of past\n\npersecution.   The fact that she had continued to maintain her\n\nposition as a schoolteacher until the date of her departure from\n\nCambodia further undermined any inference of past persecution.\n\nAccordingly, the IJ rejected that theorem.\n\n          With respect to fear of future persecution, the IJ found\n\ninsufficient evidence to satisfy the objective component of the\n\napplicable legal standard.   In so holding, he emphasized that the\n\npetitioner's husband and children continued to live unharmed in\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fCambodia.    Based on these findings and conclusions, the IJ denied\n\nthe asylum and withholding of removal claims.\n\n            That left the CAT claim, which the IJ gave short shrift.\n\nStressing    the   paucity   of    evidence     and   the   same    familial\n\nconsiderations     previously     mentioned,    he    concluded    that   the\n\npetitioner would not likely face torture were she repatriated.\n\n            In sum, the IJ denied the petitioner's cross-application\n\nfor any form of relief (save voluntary departure) and ordered\n\nremoval if no voluntary departure occurred.           The BIA subsequently\n\nadopted and affirmed the IJ's decision.         This timely petition for\n\njudicial review followed.\n\n            Where, as here, the BIA has written separately while\n\nadopting and affirming an IJ's decision, we look to both the BIA's\n\nopinion and the IJ's opinion for purposes of judicial review.             See\n\nOuk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).          In conducting\n\nthis review, we assess the IJ's factual findings pursuant to the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.        See id.     That standard is quite\n\ndeferential and requires us to accept findings of fact as long as\n\nthey are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"              INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\nIn the absence of an error of law — and we discern none here — we\n\nmay reverse the BIA's determination only if the evidence compels\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fsome other conclusion.      See Sou v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2006); Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            In order to qualify for asylum, an alien first must\n\nestablish her status as a refugee, that is, a person who is unable\n\nor unwilling to return to her homeland \"because of persecution or\n\na well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,\n\n480 U.S. 421, 428 (1987).      Proof of past persecution gives rise to\n\na   rebuttable   presumption   that   a    well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution exists.       See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); Orelien v.\n\nGonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Persecution is a protean term, not defined by statute.\n\nTo rise to the level of persecution, the sum of the alien's\n\nexperiences must add up to more than mere harassment, garden-\n\nvariety   mistreatment,   or    ordinary    suffering.     See   Attia    v.\n\nGonzales, 477 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 2007); Bocova v. Gonzales, 412\n\nF.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005).        In drawing this distinction, it\n\noften is useful to determine whether particular mistreatment is\n\nsystematic as opposed to a collection of isolated incidents.\n\nBocova, 412 F.3d at 263.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           Here,   the   petitioner   claims   to   have    suffered    past\n\npersecution based on her political activities and opinion.3            The IJ\n\nand the BIA found, however, that the petitioner did not suffer past\n\npersecution on account of her political views.             That finding is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.4\n\n           At the hearing, the petitioner claimed that she had been\n\nwarned by school committee members about her fledgling political\n\nallegiance and that she had been subjected to police brutality at\n\na demonstration in the fall of 1998.      She conceded, however, that\n\nshe had never been arrested, imprisoned, or seriously harmed.\n\nMoreover, she was an unlikely target; while she claimed that she\n\nwas active in the SRP, she did not organize others or play a\n\nleadership role in the demonstration (or any other political event,\n\nfor that matter).    This back-bench posture tends to undercut her\n\nclaim that she was specially targeted on account of political\n\nopinion.   See Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 330 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Although the petitioner asserts in her brief that she also\nwas persecuted on account of her membership in a particular social\ngroup, she makes no effort to define that social group. We deem\nthat claim abandoned. See Pan v. Gonzales, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st\nCir. 2007) [No. 06-2166, slip op. at 16] (\"We long have held that\nlegal theories advanced in skeletal form, unaccompanied by some\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed abandoned.\"); United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (same).\n     4\n      In her brief, the petitioner suggests, without citation to\nthe record, that this finding rests on an adverse credibility\ndetermination. It does not.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f              The episode that occurred nearly three years later, in\n\n2001, is even less probative of past persecution.                         The petitioner\n\nwholly failed to show that the incident had anything to do with her\n\npolitics.         By     the   same   token,      she    failed     to    show    that    the\n\ngovernment played any part in it.                   Although she asserted in her\n\nasylum application that two of Hun Sen's hit men had fired the\n\nwayward shots, she retracted that assertion at the hearing and\n\nadmitted that she did not know who had pulled the trigger.\n\n              As the IJ remarked in his well-reasoned decision, these\n\ntwo incidents add up to very little.                Taken together, they fall far\n\nshort of compelling a finding of past persecution.                               See, e.g.,\n\nTopalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir. 2005) (upholding\n\na   finding       that    seven   arrests      over      a    two-year     period,       some\n\naccompanied        by    beatings     and    detentions,          did    not     constitute\n\npersecution); Bocova, 412 F.3d at 263 (upholding a finding of no\n\npersecution,       notwithstanding          testimony        of   two    police    beatings\n\noccurring more than twenty-five months apart).\n\n              The petitioner's contention that she had a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution fares no better.                       Without a showing of\n\npast persecution, the petitioner must make the requisite showing\n\nunaided by any presumption.             She failed to do so.\n\n              A    well-founded       fear     of       persecution       must     be    both\n\nsubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.                               See Toloza-\n\nJiménez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155, 161 (1st Cir. 2006); Palma-\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fMazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2005).       This\n\nrecord reveals no objectively reasonable basis for such a fear.5\n\nThe two isolated incidents already discussed hardly suffice to lay\n\na foundation for the contention, and other uncontradicted evidence\n\nin the record indicates that the political climate in Cambodia has\n\nimproved since the date of the petitioner's departure.    The State\n\nDepartment's 2004 report on country conditions adequately evinces\n\nthat, in 2002, the government for the first time held nationwide\n\nlocal-level elections.   The SRP participated and won over 1,300\n\ncouncilmanic seats.   Because the SRP is now a legitimate player in\n\nCambodian politics, there seems little reason to fear targeted\n\npersecution on account of allegiance to that party.\n\n          If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the fact\n\nthat the petitioner's family continues to reside in Cambodia\n\nwithout apparent incident strongly suggests that persecution does\n\nnot await upon her return.   See Zheng v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 97, 101\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n          The petitioner's alternative claim for withholding of\n\nremoval need not detain us.     A claim for withholding of removal\n\n\n\n     5\n      To be sure, the record suggests that Cambodia is not a\ntranquil place. Generally speaking, however, evidence of episodic\nviolence or human rights violations affecting all citizens is\ninadequate, without more, to establish a likelihood of future\npersecution. Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f\"places a more stringent burden of proof on an alien than does a\n\ncounterpart claim for asylum.\"            Olujoke, 411 F.3d at 22 (quoting\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005)).\n\nIt follows, a fortiori, that the rejection of the petitioner's\n\nclaim for asylum necessitates a similar disposition of her claim\n\nfor withholding of removal.\n\n           That brings us to the petitioner's claim for relief under\n\nthe CAT.   To prevail on such a claim, the petitioner has the burden\n\nof demonstrating that it is more likely than not that she will be\n\ntortured if returned to her homeland. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2);\n\nElien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2004).                 Torture is\n\ndefined as \"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether\n\nphysical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person . . . by\n\nor at the . . . acquiescence of a public official or other person\n\nacting in an official capacity.\"              8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1).\n\n           In this instance, the petitioner has failed to point to\n\nany evidence that would allow us to set aside the denial of her CAT\n\nclaim. The documentary evidence that she introduced (internet news\n\narticles   and    the    like)    does    no    more   than    make   generalized\n\nreferences to the commission of atrocities against the local\n\npopulace   from   time    to     time    by    Hun   Sen's    henchmen.   Random\n\natrocities are not to be countenanced, but the record is bereft of\n\nany evidence — let alone substantial evidence — suggesting that\n\nthose atrocities are targeted at persons like the petitioner.                 To\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fsay it is more likely than not that the petitioner will be\n\nsubjected    to    torture   if   she   returns     to   Cambodia   is    pure\n\nspeculation.      Because the evidence does not \"point[] unerringly in\n\nthe opposite direction,\" Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), we must uphold the determination that the petitioner\n\nfailed to prove her claim for relief under the CAT.\n\n            There is one loose end.        The petitioner introduced into\n\nevidence at the hearing several articles that described acts of\n\ngeneral   violence    committed   against     SRP   candidates.     She   now\n\nasseverates that her due process rights were violated because the\n\nIJ failed to discuss this evidence.\n\n            We review the question of whether a party's due process\n\nrights have been infringed de novo.        Morales, 208 F.3d at 327.      For\n\ndue process protections to attach, there must be a cognizable\n\nproperty or liberty interest at stake. Naeem v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d\n\n33, 38-39 (1st Cir. 2006). The petitioner has no property interest\n\nin asylum. See Jupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 492 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    She does have a liberty interest in a fair hearing — but\n\nhere, the petitioner received all the process that was due.                An\n\nagency need not \"dissect in minute detail\" every argument or piece\n\nof evidence that the petitioner puts forward.            Raza v. Gonzales,\n\n484 F.3d 125, 128 (1st Cir. 2007).            It is sufficient that the\n\nagency considers the evidence adduced and constructs a plausible\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdecision that allows a reviewing court to follow its reasoning.\n\nSee id.   That is what occurred here.6\n\n           We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe deny the petition for judicial review.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      We add a coda: to the extent that attacks on candidates of\nthe SRP have occurred, that is of little relevance here.     The\npetitioner has never been a candidate.\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

Concluding, as we do, that there is substantial evidence\n\nin the record to support the BIA's decision, we deny the petition.\n\n            We set out the petitioner's version of the raw facts.\n\nShe worked for many years as a schoolteacher in Takhmao, Cambodia.\n\nOn June 4, 1998, she and several other teachers joined the Sam\n\nRainsy Party (SRP).       At the time, the SRP stood in opposition to\n\nthe reigning Cambodia People's Party (CPP) and its leader, Prime\n\nMinister Hun Sen. The school committee took umbrage at this action\n\nand chastised the teachers.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          During the 1998 elections, the petitioner claims to have\n\nworked with the SRP's national campaign committee.    Between August\n\n23 and September 8 of that year, she participated in a long-running\n\ndemonstration against Hun Sen and his regime — a demonstration that\n\ncalled for his resignation.1    She claims that, as a result of these\n\nactivities, shots were fired at her.2       Moreover, CPP adherents\n\ntried to assault her.   After a grenade explosion inflicted minor\n\ninjuries, she left the scene of the demonstration.\n\n          The petitioner also recounted an incident that happened\n\nmore than two years later.     She claimed that, on January 20, 2001,\n\nshe and her husband came under fire as they were riding on a\n\nmotorcycle in the Takhmao market area. Shortly after this episode,\n\nthe petitioner repaired to the United States.\n\n          Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ rendered a\n\nbench decision.   He determined that the petitioner had failed to\n\nshow either that she had suffered past persecution or that she\n\nharbored a well-founded fear of future persecution.      The IJ also\n\nfound that she had not shown a likelihood of torture were she to be\n\nreturned to her homeland.      In explaining these findings, the IJ\n\n\n     1\n      There is also some suggestion in the hearing transcript that\nthe petitioner, along with other faculty members at her school,\nparticipated in an April 1998 demonstration. The details of that\nrally are hazy and, in all events, the petitioner does not mention\nit in her appellate briefing.\n     2\n      Although the petitioner testified before the IJ about the\nfiring of shots, she made no mention of that in her asylum\napplication.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fconstrued the 1998 incident as an unfortunate case of police\n\noverreaction, not a direct attack on the petitioner based on her\n\npolitical views. He noted that the incident had occurred over two-\n\nand-one-half years prior to the petitioner's exodus from Cambodia\n\nand that, in the interim, the petitioner had \"continued to maintain\n\nher profession in that country.\"\n\n          The IJ also squarely addressed the 2001 incident.     He\n\ndetermined that it was much more likely to have been the product of\n\nrandom criminal activity than to have been retribution for the\n\npetitioner's political activities. In this regard, the IJ observed\n\nthat the petitioner, who initially had written in her asylum\n\napplication that Hun Sen's \"hit men\" had fired the shots, had\n\nretracted that claim at the hearing and had conceded that she could\n\nnot identify the perpetrators.\n\n          The IJ concluded that, taken together, the 1998 and 2001\n\nincidents did not fairly support the petitioner's claim of past\n\npersecution.   The fact that she had continued to maintain her\n\nposition as a schoolteacher until the date of her departure from\n\nCambodia further undermined any inference of past persecution.\n\nAccordingly, the IJ rejected that theorem.\n\n          With respect to fear of future persecution, the IJ found\n\ninsufficient evidence to satisfy the objective component of the\n\napplicable legal standard.   In so holding, he emphasized that the\n\npetitioner's husband and children continued to live unharmed in\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fCambodia.    Based on these findings and conclusions, the IJ denied\n\nthe asylum and withholding of removal claims.\n\n            That left the CAT claim, which the IJ gave short shrift.\n\nStressing    the   paucity   of    evidence     and   the   same    familial\n\nconsiderations     previously     mentioned,    he    concluded    that   the\n\npetitioner would not likely face torture were she repatriated.\n\n            In sum, the IJ denied the petitioner's cross-application\n\nfor any form of relief (save voluntary departure) and ordered\n\nremoval if no voluntary departure occurred.           The BIA subsequently\n\nadopted and affirmed the IJ's decision.         This timely petition for\n\njudicial review followed.\n\n            Where, as here, the BIA has written separately while\n\nadopting and affirming an IJ's decision, we look to both the BIA's\n\nopinion and the IJ's opinion for purposes of judicial review.

That finding is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.4\n\n           At the hearing, the petitioner claimed that she had been\n\nwarned by school committee members about her fledgling political\n\nallegiance and that she had been subjected to police brutality at\n\na demonstration in the fall of 1998.      She conceded, however, that\n\nshe had never been arrested, imprisoned, or seriously harmed.\n\nMoreover, she was an unlikely target; while she claimed that she\n\nwas active in the SRP, she did not organize others or play a\n\nleadership role in the demonstration (or any other political event,\n\nfor that matter).    This back-bench posture tends to undercut her\n\nclaim that she was specially targeted on account of political\n\nopinion.   See Morales v.

The petitioner\n\nwholly failed to show that the incident had anything to do with her\n\npolitics.         By     the   same   token,      she    failed     to    show    that    the\n\ngovernment played any part in it.                   Although she asserted in her\n\nasylum application that two of Hun Sen's hit men had fired the\n\nwayward shots, she retracted that assertion at the hearing and\n\nadmitted that she did not know who had pulled the trigger.\n\n              As the IJ remarked in his well-reasoned decision, these\n\ntwo incidents add up to very little.                Taken together, they fall far\n\nshort of compelling a finding of past persecution.                               See, e.g.,\n\nTopalli v.

This\n\nrecord reveals no objectively reasonable basis for such a fear.5\n\nThe two isolated incidents already discussed hardly suffice to lay\n\na foundation for the contention, and other uncontradicted evidence\n\nin the record indicates that the political climate in Cambodia has\n\nimproved since the date of the petitioner's departure.    The State\n\nDepartment's 2004 report on country conditions adequately evinces\n\nthat, in 2002, the government for the first time held nationwide\n\nlocal-level elections.   The SRP participated and won over 1,300\n\ncouncilmanic seats.   Because the SRP is now a legitimate player in\n\nCambodian politics, there seems little reason to fear targeted\n\npersecution on account of allegiance to that party.\n\n          If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the fact\n\nthat the petitioner's family continues to reside in Cambodia\n\nwithout apparent incident strongly suggests that persecution does\n\nnot await upon her return.
