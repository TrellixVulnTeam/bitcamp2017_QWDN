S.A.    Recasens,   a\n\nmanufacturer    of    fabric     located     in    Barcelona,   Spain,    appeals\n\nfollowing a jury verdict in favor of Sun Blinds, Inc., on a claim\n\nbrought under the Puerto Rico Dealership Act, Law 75 of June 24,\n\n1964, Puerto Rico Laws Annotated, title 10 § 278, et seq.                Recasens\n\nseeks judgment in its favor or a new trial.                  We agree that Sun\n\nBlinds’s claim should have been dismissed as a matter of law.\n\n            Sun Blinds was the exclusive distributor in Puerto Rico\n\nand the Caribbean Basin of awning fabric manufactured by Recasens.\n\nAfter Recasens terminated their distributorship agreement, Sun\n\nBlinds brought suit under Law 75, alleging that Recasens engaged in\n\nconduct that impaired their relationship and terminated their\n\nagreement   without       just   cause.      Sun   Blinds   also    alleged   that\n\nRecasens    sold     it   defective       merchandise.   Recasens     brought   a\n\ncounterclaim, alleging that Sun Blinds breached their agreement by\n\nfailing to pay outstanding balances.\n\n            The case was tried to a jury over the course of five\n\ndays.     At the close of Sun Blinds’s case, Recasens moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n50.     The court granted the motion as to Sun Blinds’s defective\n\nmerchandise claim, ruling that Sun Blinds “did not establish a\n\nreasonable basis for the valuation of said damages and any jury\n\naward would have to be based on mere speculation.”                 The motion was\n\notherwise denied.         After the court denied Recasens’s request that\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fits sole witness, Kay Ludwig, be permitted to testify on the\n\nfollowing Monday, when closing arguments and jury instructions were\n\nscheduled      to    be    given,    Recasens     rested      without      presenting\n\nwitnesses.          The   jury   found    that   Recasens     had   just    cause   to\n\nterminate the distributorship relationship but found in favor of\n\nSun Blinds on the impairment claim, awarding $71,577.50 in damages.\n\nOn the counterclaim, the jury found that Sun Blinds owed Recasens\n\n$14,297.18 for unpaid balances.\n\n            Recasens renewed its motion under Rule 50, arguing that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to prove that any impairment caused\n\ndamages or to prove the amount of the damages awarded.                       Recasens\n\nalso argued that Law 75 does not apply to sales outside of Puerto\n\nRico.    At the same time, Recasens moved for a new trial, asserting\n\nthat the district court erred in permitting the testimony of Sun\n\nBlinds’s co-owner on damages and in giving a missing witness\n\ninstruction with regard to Ludwig. Recasens did not prevail in the\n\ndistrict court on these issues and raises them on appeal.\n\n            The denial of a Rule 50 motion is reviewed de novo.\n\nTapalian v. Tusino, 377 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).                    We review the\n\nevidence and draw reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\n\nparty,   without      considering        the   credibility    of    the    witnesses,\n\nresolving conflicting testimony, or weighing the evidence.                     Santos\n\nv.   Sunrise    Med.,      Inc.,    351   F.3d   587,   590    (1st     Cir.   2003).\n\nNevertheless, “the plaintiff is not entitled to inferences based on\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fspeculation and conjecture.”       Vázquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz,\n\n2004 WL 2106344, at *4 (1st Cir. Sept. 22, 2004).             The district\n\ncourt’s   decision   will   be   reversed   only   when    the   facts   and\n\ninferences show that there is a total failure of evidence to prove\n\nan element of the plaintiff’s case so that a reasonable jury could\n\nnot have reached a verdict for the plaintiff.             Id.; Santos, 351\n\nF.3d at 590.\n\n           Law 75 protects dealers and distributors in Puerto Rico\n\nfrom arbitrary or inequitable practices by their principal after\n\ntheir business relationship is established.         Caribe Indus. Sys.,\n\nInc. v. Nat’l Starch & Chem. Co., 212 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nSpecifically, Law 75 provides:\n\n           Notwithstanding the existence in a dealer’s\n           contract of a clause reserving to the parties\n           the unilateral right to terminate the existing\n           relationship, no principal or grantor may\n           directly or indirectly perform any act\n           detrimental to the established relationship or\n           refuse to renew said contract on its normal\n           expiration, except for just cause.1\n\n10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 278a.        Some actions by the principal, when\n\nproven, establish a rebuttable presumption of impairment: “whenever\n\na principal bypasses a dealer by distributing merchandise directly;\n\nappoints additional dealers in contravention of the agreement;\n\n\n     1\n      The phrase “act detrimental to,” used in the English\ntranslation of § 278a, also means “impairment,” and the terms are\nused interchangeably in cases involving Law 75. See Caribe, 212\nF.3d at 29; Irvine v. Murad Skin Res. Labs., Inc., 194 F.3d 313,\n318 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999); Goya de P.R., Inc. v. Rowland Coffee, 206\nF. Supp. 2d 211, 217 (D.P.R. 2002).\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffails       to   adequately    fill   orders;    or   arbitrarily   changes   the\n\ntransportation and/or payment terms.” Irvine, 194 F.3d at 318. If\n\na plaintiff proves termination or impairment of the business\n\nrelationship by the defendant, Law 75 provides a formula for\n\nindemnification but only “to the extent of the damages caused.” 10\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. § 278b.            Sun Blinds bore the burden at trial of\n\nproving that Recasens’s actions were detrimental to their business\n\nrelationship and caused damages.                See Irvine, 194 F.3d at 320.\n\n                 Sun Blinds claimed that its distributorship was impaired\n\nwhen Recasens changed its credit terms in 1999, sold fabric in the\n\nDominican Republic in violation of the exclusivity provision in\n\ntheir       agreement,   and   provided   defective      fabric.    Sun   Blinds\n\nacknowledges that no evidence was presented during trial that any\n\nactions by Recasens caused specific losses or damages.2                Instead,\n\nSun Blinds argues that those actions breached Recasens’s good faith\n\nobligation, which led to the termination of the agreement.\n\n                 Sun Blinds contends that “[t]his is not strictly an\n\nimpairment claim” because Recasens also terminated the agreement.\n\nThe jury found, however, that just cause existed for Recasen’s\n\ndecision to terminate the agreement and denied Sun Blinds recovery\n\nunder the termination claim. Sun Blinds cannot recover damages for\n\n\n\n        2\n      The district court ruled that Sun Blinds was unable to prove\ndamages caused by the allegedly defective fabric.      The record\nincludes no evidence of damages caused by the change in credit\nterms or by sales in the Dominican Republic.\n\n                                         -5-\n\ftermination under its impairment claim.3          Instead, Law 75 requires\n\nproof of specific damages caused by the alleged impairment, which,\n\nif proven, may be calculated using the formula provided in § 278b.\n\n              Sun Blinds argues, nevertheless, that Law 75 permits\n\n“indirect” proof of damages and should be read broadly to allow the\n\ndamages claimed here.      The “indirect” language in Law 75 describes\n\nconduct by the principal that may cause impairment and does not\n\npertain to proof of damages.        Further, “Law 75 specifically limits\n\npayment ‘to the extent of the damages caused [the dealer/dis-\n\ntributor].’” Irvine, 194 F.3d at 319 (quoting § 278b). “Therefore,\n\nin order to prevail, a Law 75 plaintiff must submit evidence of\n\ndamages as part of its action.”           Id. at 320.\n\n              To avoid judgment as a matter of law, Sun Blinds had the\n\nburden of introducing sufficient evidence at trial to make the\n\nexistence of damages more likely than not.              Id. at 317.   A “mere\n\nscintilla” of evidence is not enough, nor may a plaintiff rely on\n\nconjecture or speculation to sustain its burden.              Id.   Sun Blinds\n\nfailed   to    provide   evidence    of    damages   caused    by   Recasens’s\n\ndetrimental actions.        Therefore, the district court erred in\n\ndenying Recasens’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. Because\n\n\n     3\n      Sun Blinds provided evidence of damages caused by the\ntermination of the agreement through the testimony of Liz Ann\nIsgut, who owns Sun Blinds with her husband. Mrs. Isgut calculated\nthe loss under § 278b by averaging the amount of the company’s net\nprofits attributable to sales of Recasens’s fabric during past\nyears and multiplying that amount by five. The total amount she\ncalculated was $71,575.50. The jury awarded $71,577.50.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthis issue is dispositive, we need not consider the other grounds\n\nRecasens raises on appeal.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment in favor of Sun\n\nBlinds is vacated and the matter remanded. On remand, the district\n\ncourt is directed to enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of\n\nRecasens on the impairment claim brought by Sun Blinds.       The\n\nparties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

See Irvine, 194 F.3d at 320.\n\n                 Sun Blinds claimed that its distributorship was impaired\n\nwhen Recasens changed its credit terms in 1999, sold fabric in the\n\nDominican Republic in violation of the exclusivity provision in\n\ntheir       agreement,   and   provided   defective      fabric.    Sun   Blinds\n\nacknowledges that no evidence was presented during trial that any\n\nactions by Recasens caused specific losses or damages.2                Instead,\n\nSun Blinds argues that those actions breached Recasens’s good faith\n\nobligation, which led to the termination of the agreement.\n\n                 Sun Blinds contends that “[t]his is not strictly an\n\nimpairment claim” because Recasens also terminated the agreement.\n\nThe jury found, however, that just cause existed for Recasen’s\n\ndecision to terminate the agreement and denied Sun Blinds recovery\n\nunder the termination claim. Sun Blinds cannot recover damages for\n\n\n\n        2\n      The district court ruled that Sun Blinds was unable to prove\ndamages caused by the allegedly defective fabric.      The record\nincludes no evidence of damages caused by the change in credit\nterms or by sales in the Dominican Republic.\n\n                                         -5-\n\ftermination under its impairment claim.3          Instead, Law 75 requires\n\nproof of specific damages caused by the alleged impairment, which,\n\nif proven, may be calculated using the formula provided in § 278b.\n\n              Sun Blinds argues, nevertheless, that Law 75 permits\n\n“indirect” proof of damages and should be read broadly to allow the\n\ndamages claimed here.      The “indirect” language in Law 75 describes\n\nconduct by the principal that may cause impairment and does not\n\npertain to proof of damages.        Further, “Law 75 specifically limits\n\npayment ‘to the extent of the damages caused [the dealer/dis-\n\ntributor].’” Irvine, 194 F.3d at 319 (quoting § 278b). “Therefore,\n\nin order to prevail, a Law 75 plaintiff must submit evidence of\n\ndamages as part of its action.”           Id. at 320.\n\n              To avoid judgment as a matter of law, Sun Blinds had the\n\nburden of introducing sufficient evidence at trial to make the\n\nexistence of damages more likely than not.              Id. at 317.   A “mere\n\nscintilla” of evidence is not enough, nor may a plaintiff rely on\n\nconjecture or speculation to sustain its burden.              Id.   Sun Blinds\n\nfailed   to    provide   evidence    of    damages   caused    by   Recasens’s\n\ndetrimental actions.        Therefore, the district court erred in\n\ndenying Recasens’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. Because\n\n\n     3\n      Sun Blinds provided evidence of damages caused by the\ntermination of the agreement through the testimony of Liz Ann\nIsgut, who owns Sun Blinds with her husband. Mrs. Isgut calculated\nthe loss under § 278b by averaging the amount of the company’s net\nprofits attributable to sales of Recasens’s fabric during past\nyears and multiplying that amount by five. The total amount she\ncalculated was $71,575.50. The jury awarded $71,577.50.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthis issue is dispositive, we need not consider the other grounds\n\nRecasens raises on appeal.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment in favor of Sun\n\nBlinds is vacated and the matter remanded. On remand, the district\n\ncourt is directed to enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of\n\nRecasens on the impairment claim brought by Sun Blinds.       The\n\nparties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f</pre>",
