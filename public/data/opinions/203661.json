Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n          Torruella, Boudin and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Douglas J. Beaton for appellant.\n     Sandra S. Bower, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         February 11, 2009\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge. A jury found Antoin Quarles Combs\n\nguilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).                 He was sentenced to 240\n\nmonths'    imprisonment.      In    this    appeal,    Combs    challenges      his\n\nconviction on two grounds:         first, that the trial court improperly\n\ndeclined to give his proposed jury instruction regarding witness\n\nintimidation; and second, that the government failed to offer\n\nsufficient evidence that the firearm and ammunition had traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce.       We reject both arguments and affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            The events leading up to Combs's arrest may be described\n\nbriefly.     Combs   was   arrested     after   a     motor    vehicle   stop    in\n\nDorchester, Massachusetts in 2005.            Boston Police Officers John\n\nConway and Dean Bickerton stopped the car in which Combs and two\n\nothers (Somia Hicks and Tanisha Montgomery) were riding, citing\n\nsuspicious activity. The officers testified that, after asking the\n\ndriver Montgomery for her license and registration, they noticed a\n\nsmell of marijuana coming from the car.             They asked Combs to step\n\nout of the car, which he did.\n\n            Here the narratives offered by the witnesses diverge\n\nslightly.    The officers testified that they saw that Combs was\n\ncarrying a gun.      Hicks, testifying as a defense witness, stated\n\nthat she did not see a gun belonging to Combs at any point.                     The\n\nother differences between Hicks's testimony and the testimony of\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthe   officers   about    the    events    of    that   evening   amount   to   a\n\ndisagreement about the specific words exchanged between Combs and\n\nthe   officers   before   and     during    an   ensuing    struggle.      It   is\n\nundisputed that there was an altercation between Combs and the\n\nofficers, and that they struck him with their firearms in an\n\nattempt to subdue him.          At the conclusion of the struggle, Combs\n\nwas handcuffed and arrested. The officers recovered from the scene\n\na .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver and five rounds of .38\n\ncaliber Remington Peters ammunition.\n\n           In due course, Combs was indicted for being a felon in\n\npossession of a firearm and ammunition.            Four days prior to trial,\n\nLisa Rudnicki, an agent of the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms\n\nand Explosives (ATF), visited Hicks in her home.               At trial, Hicks\n\ntestified that Rudnicki had asked her a series of questions about\n\nthe events surrounding the arrest.           In response to her answers to\n\nthose questions, Hicks testified, Rudnicki called her a liar and\n\ntold her that she could be charged with perjury and sentenced to\n\nten years in jail.1       Hicks did not testify about either of these\n\nstatements made by Rudnicki.\n\n           This exchange took place at Hicks's home, in front of two\n\nof Hicks's children, ages three and fifteen.               Hicks had her three-\n\n\n      1\n      In a sidebar conversation with counsel, the trial judge noted\nthat Rudnicki also suggested to Hicks that Hicks's version of the\nevents contradicted that of another witness and, in addition, that\nRudnicki told Hicks that Combs had at one point planned to plead\nguilty.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fyear-old child on her lap during the encounter.                Hicks testified\n\nthat Rudnicki suggested that she should not \"be with\" anyone who\n\nhad Combs's record, asked her what her children would do without\n\nher, and advised her to put her family first.            Hicks testified that\n\nafter this conversation, she was very upset and cried for about\n\nthirty or forty-five minutes.       She said that she felt threatened\n\nand   that   she   believed   Rudnicki    was   trying    to   stop   her   from\n\ntestifying in this case. Hicks did, nevertheless, testify at trial\n\non Combs's behalf both about the arrest and the visit by Rudnicki.\n\n             Asserting that Rudnicki's visit with Hicks created an\n\nissue of witness intimidation, Combs's counsel requested a jury\n\ninstruction that would permit a finding of reasonable doubt based\n\non the government's allegedly improper conduct.                  The proposed\n\ninstruction was:\n\n             If you find that ATF Special Agent Lisa Rudnicki\n             attempted to prevent Somia Hicks from testifying by\n             threats or intimidation, you may draw an inference\n             adverse to the prosecution. Such an adverse inference\n             may be sufficient by itself to raise a reasonable doubt\n             as to the defendant's guilt in this case.\n\nThe trial judge declined to give the requested instruction, because\n\neven though Rudnicki's conduct may have been improper, Hicks did in\n\nfact testify.2     The court observed that, \"[m]aybe something should\n\n\n\n      2\n      The court stated that although Rudnicki's conduct was \"quite\nclose to the line, if not over the line\" of impropriety, he did not\nhave to \"reach a decision as to whether [the statements made to\nHicks] were improper, whether they went over the line because the\nwitness did[] testify . . .\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\fbe done with regard to the ATF . . . but I'm not inclined to give\n\nan instruction to sanction possible misconduct that I haven't found\n\nto be misconduct in the circumstances where I don't perceive that\n\nthe integrity of the trial has been injured.\"\n\n           During closing argument, defense counsel mentioned the\n\nalleged intimidation by Rudnicki, but he did not object to the\n\ninstructions    given   to    the   jury,    even   though    the   trial   judge\n\nexpressly invited objections at the conclusion of his charge to the\n\njury.   Combs was convicted of being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).\n\n           Combs makes two arguments on appeal.              First, he contends\n\nthat the trial court improperly declined to give his proposed jury\n\ninstruction on witness intimidation in response to Rudnicki's\n\nconduct.   Second, he argues that the government did not offer\n\nsufficient evidence that the firearm and ammunition had traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce, as required by 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).\n\n                                      II.\n\n                             A.   Jury Instruction\n\n           In   order   to    properly      preserve   a   challenge   to    jury\n\ninstructions, a defendant must object to the instructions after the\n\njudge has charged the jury. See United States v. Munoz-Franco, 487\n\nF.3d 25, 64 n. 40 (1st Cir. 2007); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(d).\n\nWhen a defendant fails to object, we review the charge for plain\n\nerror only.     Munoz-Franco, 487 F.3d at 64 n. 40; see also Fed. R.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fCrim. P. 52(b).        Here Combs did not object despite an express\n\ninvitation by the trial judge, and we accordingly apply the plain\n\nerror test.        That test requires that an appellant demonstrate:\n\n\"(1) that an error occurred; (2) which was clear or obvious; and\n\nwhich not only; (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights,\n\nbut also; (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"          United States v. Moran, 393\n\nF.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).                  See also United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993).\n\n             Combs argues that Rudnicki's conduct violated his due\n\nprocess rights as her actions interfered with Combs's right to\n\npresent    his   defense   witnesses   freely,     and   that     the   proposed\n\ninstruction was an \"appropriate remedy\".           See Washington v. Texas,\n\n388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967) (holding that the Sixth Amendment right to\n\npresent    one's    own   witnesses   as    part   of   one's    defense    is   a\n\n\"fundamental element of due process\").\n\n            The trial judge, although troubled by the agent's alleged\n\nstatements, declined to make a finding of misconduct.               More to the\n\npoint, the court determined that no prejudice resulted from the\n\nconduct.   We review that ruling for an abuse of discretion,               United\n\nStates v. Jahagirdar, 466 F.3d 149, 156 (1st Cir. 2006), but in\n\nfact there is no evidence whatever of actual prejudice.                       The\n\nwitness testified in favor of the defendant; and nothing indicates\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthat the testimony was hedged or that even more favorable testimony\n\nwas suppressed.\n\n          Hicks testified about both her recollection of the events\n\nof the arrest, and the interaction with Rudnicki.      Although Combs\n\ncharacterizes Hicks's trial testimony as \"halting[]\" and suggests\n\nabstractly that it is impossible to know how Hicks might have\n\ntestified absent Rudnicki's conduct, he does not argue that the\n\nsubstance of her testimony can be shown to have been affected by\n\nthe alleged intimidation.\n\n              \"There can be no violation of the defense's right to\n\npresent evidence . . . unless some contested act or omission (1)\n\ncan be attributed to the sovereign and (2) causes the loss or\n\nerosion of testimony which is both (3) material to the case and (4)\n\nfavorable to the accused.\"     United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d\n\n1299, 1303 (1st Cir. 1987).          This accords with the ordinary\n\nrequirement     that   a   claimed     violation   cause   prejudice.3\n\n\n     3\n      There is some authority in other circuits that government\nintimidation of a defense witness, even absent a showing of\nprejudice, can nevertheless amount to a due process violation. See\nUnited States v. Morrison, 535 F.2d 223, 228 (3rd Cir. 1976);\nUnited States v. Hammond, 598 F.2d 1008, 1013 (5th Cir. 1979).\nThose opinions predate United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499\n(1983), where the Supreme Court held that a reviewing court must\nignore harmless errors, including most constitutional violations.\n461 U.S. at 509. The court did distinguish three specific rights\nas rights that, when violated, can never be treated as harmless\nerror: respecting counsel, an impartial judge and freedom from\ncoerced confession. Id. at 508 n.6. None of those rights are at\nissue here.    Later opinions have acknowledged that Hammond's\nanalysis is no longer viable in the wake of Hasting. See, e.g.,\nPeeler v. Wyrick, 734 F.2d 378, 381 (8th Cir. 1984).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fAccordingly, under the test framed by Hoffman, there was no due\n\nprocess violation.\n\n            The requested instruction also presents a separate issue.\n\nEven though Hicks's testimony was available and employed, the\n\ninstruction sought could conceivably be helpful to the defense and\n\ncould rest on a theory of its own independent of a due process\n\nviolation.       An effort to tamper with evidence by a defendant can\n\nsometimes justify an inference of guilt, as can flight, deliberate\n\nprovision of a false alibi, and similar conduct.                 See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Ayala-Tapia, 520 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(inference from deliberately false alibi); United States v. Otero-\n\nMendez, 273 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2001) (inference from defendant's\n\nflight).\n\n            In such cases, an adverse inference is permitted because\n\nthe conduct is deemed relevant to the defendant's consciousness of\n\nguilt, see, e.g., United States v. Rosario-Diaz, 202 F.3d 54, 70\n\n(1st Cir. 2000), which may weigh in favor of an inference that the\n\ndefendant is in fact guilty.         There is however, no direct analogue\n\nto \"consciousness of guilt\" when an individual government agent is\n\naccused of intimidating the witness; a concern arises if evidence\n\nis thereby lost, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), but in\n\nthis case evidence was not lost.\n\n            The defendant does not point us to any federal decision\n\ncalling    for    an   instruction   that,   where   the   evidence   is   not\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\faffected, the jury may draw an adverse inference against the\n\ngovernment.         Combs suggests that the requested instruction was\n\nbased on language from two earlier cases.                   See Merced v. McGrath,\n\n2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2107, at *32 (N.D. Cal., Feb. 10, 2004), and\n\nPeople v. Zamora, 615 P.2d 1361, 1370 (Cal. 1980).                         Both cases,\n\nhowever, involved issues of state and not federal law (with the\n\nformer being in federal court on a habeas claim), and in neither\n\ncase did the court hold that such an instruction was required.\n\n                 Without laying down blanket rules, it is enough here that\n\nthere was no clear error in refusing the instruction.                           Like the\n\ndistrict judge, we have no reason to decide whether the questioning\n\nwent       too   far.    If   we    accept    Hicks's      version,   it   is    not    an\n\nespecially        attractive       picture,    but   law    enforcement     is    not    a\n\ndelicate business.            And to make a complete assessment, the full\n\ncontext and a range of specific circumstances would need to be\n\ndeveloped.         See generally Webb v. Texas, 409 U.S. 95, 98 (1972)\n\n(per curiam).4          Where, as here, the issue involves a particular\n\nfact pattern not likely to be repeated in just the same form, an\n\nassessment is all the more unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      See also United States v. Vega-Figureroa, 234 F.3d 744, 752\n(1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Jackson, 935 F.2d 832, 847 (7th\nCir. 1991); United States v. Morrison, 535 F.2d 223, 228 (3d Cir.\n1976); United States v. Thomas, 488 F.2d 334, 336 (6th Cir. 1973);\nUnited States v. Smith, 478 F.2d 976, 978-79 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\n\n                                             -9-\n\f                     B.   Firearm and Ammunition\n\n          Combs challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for one\n\nelement of the underlying offense: the requirement under 18 U.S.C.\n\nยง 922(g) that the firearm or the ammunition be \"in or affecting\n\ncommerce.\"5   We review sufficiency challenges to determine whether\n\nthe evidence presented at trial, together with all reasonable\n\ninferences and viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n\nwould allow a rational jury to establish the defendant's guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.    See United States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282\n\nF.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Combs's arrest and the recovery of the firearm and\n\nammunition took place in Dorchester, Massachusetts.6   We conclude\n\nthat the jury reasonably determined there was sufficient evidence\n\nthat the ammunition was \"in or affecting commerce.\"        In this\n\nregard, we note that the felon in possession statute applies\n\nindependently to the possession of the firearm or the ammunition.\n\nIf either the firearm or the ammunition was \"in or affecting\n\n\n     5\n      That statute provides in relevant part:\n     It shall be unlawful for any person --\n     (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime\n     punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;\n     . . .\n     to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or\n     possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition;\n     or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped\n     or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n     6\n      At trial, Combs suggested that the gun was planted on him.\nOn appeal, however, he does not challenge the finding that he was\nin possession of the gun and the ammunition.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcommerce,\" that is sufficient to meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C.\n\nยง 922(g).      Although there also may well have been sufficient\n\nevidence that the firearm was \"in or affecting commerce,\" we need\n\nnot reach this question here.7\n\n              In Scarborough v. United States, 431 U.S. 563, 572\n\n(1977), the Supreme Court addressed the \"in or affecting commerce\"\n\nrequirement of a precursor to the current felon in possession\n\nstatute.      The    Court   established     a   \"minimal   nexus\"       standard,\n\nrequiring    proof    only    of   interstate    travel     of    a    firearm   or\n\nammunition.    Id.    In United States v. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d 1, 9-10\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), we applied Scarborough and held that a firearm or\n\nammunition is \"in or affecting commerce\" for the purposes of 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 922(g) if it has \"traveled at some time\" in interstate\n\ncommerce.    We have also said that the standard requires a showing\n\nthat a firearm or ammunition has \"been transported across State\n\nlines.\"    United States v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir. 2003),\n\ncert. denied, 540 U.S. 892 (2003).\n\n            Combs would have us interpret the statute differently.\n\nHe points to Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 855 (2000), and\n\nargues that the government must show that a firearm or ammunition\n\nhad more than \"merely a passive, passing, or past connection to\n\ncommerce.\"      Jones,       involving   a   federal      arson       statute,   is\n\n\n     7\n      The government introduced evidence that the firearm was\nmanufactured by Smith & Wesson Corporation in Springfield,\nMassachusetts and was shipped to New York in January, 1977.\n\n                                     -11-\n\finapplicable here.        Combs's exact argument has been before us in\n\nWilkerson and in Weems, and we rejected it on those occasions as we\n\ndo here.8    The language linking the regulated conduct to commerce\n\nin the statute in Jones differs from the language of 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n922(g),     and   Jones   does   not   disrupt   the   Court's   holding   in\n\nScarborough.\n\n             The government presented uncontroverted evidence that\n\nthere are no commercial manufacturers of ammunition in the state of\n\nMassachusetts, as well as uncontroverted evidence that Remington\n\nPeters, the manufacturer of the recovered ammunition, has two\n\nmanufacturing facilities:        one in Connecticut and one in Arkansas.\n\nThus, ammunition recovered in Dorchester, Massachusetts must have\n\ncrossed state lines to get there.\n\n             In conclusion, (1) there was no error in the district\n\ncourt's refusal to issue Combs's requested instruction; and (2)\n\nthere was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that either\n\nthe firearm or the ammunition were \"in or affecting commerce\" as\n\nrequired by 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n     8\n      Other circuits have treated this issue identically, holding\nthe nexus to interstate commerce to be satisfied under 18 U.S.C. ยง\n922(g) if the firearm or ammunition has \"traveled at some time\" in\ninterstate commerce. See United States v. Sawyers, 409 F.3d 732,\n736 (6th Cir. 2005); see also United States v. Darrington, 351 F.3d\n632, 634 (5th Cir. 2003); United States v. Gaines, 295 F.3d 293,\n302 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Gallimore, 247 F.3d 134, 138\n(4th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                       -12-\n\f",

Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n          Torruella, Boudin and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Douglas J. Beaton for appellant.\n     Sandra S. Bower, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         February 11, 2009\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge. A jury found Antoin Quarles Combs\n\nguilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).                 He was sentenced to 240\n\nmonths'    imprisonment.      In    this    appeal,    Combs    challenges      his\n\nconviction on two grounds:         first, that the trial court improperly\n\ndeclined to give his proposed jury instruction regarding witness\n\nintimidation; and second, that the government failed to offer\n\nsufficient evidence that the firearm and ammunition had traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce.       We reject both arguments and affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            The events leading up to Combs's arrest may be described\n\nbriefly.     Combs   was   arrested     after   a     motor    vehicle   stop    in\n\nDorchester, Massachusetts in 2005.            Boston Police Officers John\n\nConway and Dean Bickerton stopped the car in which Combs and two\n\nothers (Somia Hicks and Tanisha Montgomery) were riding, citing\n\nsuspicious activity. The officers testified that, after asking the\n\ndriver Montgomery for her license and registration, they noticed a\n\nsmell of marijuana coming from the car.             They asked Combs to step\n\nout of the car, which he did.\n\n            Here the narratives offered by the witnesses diverge\n\nslightly.    The officers testified that they saw that Combs was\n\ncarrying a gun.      Hicks, testifying as a defense witness, stated\n\nthat she did not see a gun belonging to Combs at any point.                     The\n\nother differences between Hicks's testimony and the testimony of\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthe   officers   about    the    events    of    that   evening   amount   to   a\n\ndisagreement about the specific words exchanged between Combs and\n\nthe   officers   before   and     during    an   ensuing    struggle.      It   is\n\nundisputed that there was an altercation between Combs and the\n\nofficers, and that they struck him with their firearms in an\n\nattempt to subdue him.          At the conclusion of the struggle, Combs\n\nwas handcuffed and arrested. The officers recovered from the scene\n\na .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver and five rounds of .38\n\ncaliber Remington Peters ammunition.\n\n           In due course, Combs was indicted for being a felon in\n\npossession of a firearm and ammunition.            Four days prior to trial,\n\nLisa Rudnicki, an agent of the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms\n\nand Explosives (ATF), visited Hicks in her home.               At trial, Hicks\n\ntestified that Rudnicki had asked her a series of questions about\n\nthe events surrounding the arrest.           In response to her answers to\n\nthose questions, Hicks testified, Rudnicki called her a liar and\n\ntold her that she could be charged with perjury and sentenced to\n\nten years in jail.1       Hicks did not testify about either of these\n\nstatements made by Rudnicki.\n\n           This exchange took place at Hicks's home, in front of two\n\nof Hicks's children, ages three and fifteen.               Hicks had her three-\n\n\n      1\n      In a sidebar conversation with counsel, the trial judge noted\nthat Rudnicki also suggested to Hicks that Hicks's version of the\nevents contradicted that of another witness and, in addition, that\nRudnicki told Hicks that Combs had at one point planned to plead\nguilty.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fyear-old child on her lap during the encounter.                Hicks testified\n\nthat Rudnicki suggested that she should not \"be with\" anyone who\n\nhad Combs's record, asked her what her children would do without\n\nher, and advised her to put her family first.            Hicks testified that\n\nafter this conversation, she was very upset and cried for about\n\nthirty or forty-five minutes.       She said that she felt threatened\n\nand   that   she   believed   Rudnicki    was   trying    to   stop   her   from\n\ntestifying in this case. Hicks did, nevertheless, testify at trial\n\non Combs's behalf both about the arrest and the visit by Rudnicki.\n\n             Asserting that Rudnicki's visit with Hicks created an\n\nissue of witness intimidation, Combs's counsel requested a jury\n\ninstruction that would permit a finding of reasonable doubt based\n\non the government's allegedly improper conduct.                  The proposed\n\ninstruction was:\n\n             If you find that ATF Special Agent Lisa Rudnicki\n             attempted to prevent Somia Hicks from testifying by\n             threats or intimidation, you may draw an inference\n             adverse to the prosecution. Such an adverse inference\n             may be sufficient by itself to raise a reasonable doubt\n             as to the defendant's guilt in this case.\n\nThe trial judge declined to give the requested instruction, because\n\neven though Rudnicki's conduct may have been improper, Hicks did in\n\nfact testify.2     The court observed that, \"[m]aybe something should\n\n\n\n      2\n      The court stated that although Rudnicki's conduct was \"quite\nclose to the line, if not over the line\" of impropriety, he did not\nhave to \"reach a decision as to whether [the statements made to\nHicks] were improper, whether they went over the line because the\nwitness did[] testify . . .\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\fbe done with regard to the ATF . . . but I'm not inclined to give\n\nan instruction to sanction possible misconduct that I haven't found\n\nto be misconduct in the circumstances where I don't perceive that\n\nthe integrity of the trial has been injured.\"\n\n           During closing argument, defense counsel mentioned the\n\nalleged intimidation by Rudnicki, but he did not object to the\n\ninstructions    given   to    the   jury,    even   though    the   trial   judge\n\nexpressly invited objections at the conclusion of his charge to the\n\njury.   Combs was convicted of being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).\n\n           Combs makes two arguments on appeal.              First, he contends\n\nthat the trial court improperly declined to give his proposed jury\n\ninstruction on witness intimidation in response to Rudnicki's\n\nconduct.   Second, he argues that the government did not offer\n\nsufficient evidence that the firearm and ammunition had traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce, as required by 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).\n\n                                      II.\n\n                             A.

Although there also may well have been sufficient\n\nevidence that the firearm was \"in or affecting commerce,\" we need\n\nnot reach this question here.7\n\n              In Scarborough v.

The    Court   established     a   \"minimal   nexus\"       standard,\n\nrequiring    proof    only    of   interstate    travel     of    a    firearm   or\n\nammunition.    Id.

Combs's exact argument has been before us in\n\nWilkerson and in Weems, and we rejected it on those occasions as we\n\ndo here.8    The language linking the regulated conduct to commerce\n\nin the statute in Jones differs from the language of 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n922(g),     and   Jones   does   not   disrupt   the   Court's   holding   in\n\nScarborough.\n\n             The government presented uncontroverted evidence that\n\nthere are no commercial manufacturers of ammunition in the state of\n\nMassachusetts, as well as uncontroverted evidence that Remington\n\nPeters, the manufacturer of the recovered ammunition, has two\n\nmanufacturing facilities:        one in Connecticut and one in Arkansas.\n\nThus, ammunition recovered in Dorchester, Massachusetts must have\n\ncrossed state lines to get there.\n\n             In conclusion, (1) there was no error in the district\n\ncourt's refusal to issue Combs's requested instruction; and (2)\n\nthere was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that either\n\nthe firearm or the ammunition were \"in or affecting commerce\" as\n\nrequired by 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n     8\n      Other circuits have treated this issue identically, holding\nthe nexus to interstate commerce to be satisfied under 18 U.S.C. ยง\n922(g) if the firearm or ammunition has \"traveled at some time\" in\ninterstate commerce.
