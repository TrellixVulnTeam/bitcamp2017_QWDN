Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.   Petitioner Ariel Punzalan, a native\n\nand citizen of the Philippines, seeks review of a final order of\n\nremoval issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") on\n\nSeptember 5, 2008 denying petitioner's second motion to reopen.\n\nPetitioner argues that the time and number limitations on filing\n\nhis second motion should be equitably tolled and proceedings\n\nreopened due to the alleged ineffective assistance of his prior\n\ncounsel on the first motion to reopen.   The BIA rejected the second\n\nmotion to reopen for several reasons, including that petitioner had\n\nfailed to demonstrate that his former counsel acted deficiently.\n\nWe deny the petition.\n\n                                I.\n\n          Petitioner entered the United States on October 5, 2001\n\nfor a period not to exceed April 4, 2002.   He did not depart.   The\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") then commenced removal\n\nproceedings by filing a Notice to Appear on July 29, 2005.        On\n\nSeptember 16, 2005, petitioner appeared with counsel before an\n\nimmigration judge (\"IJ\") and conceded removability. He stated that\n\nhe would seek asylum or, in the alternative, voluntary departure.\n\nOn October 25, 2005, petitioner filed a motion seeking a change of\n\nvenue and stated that the only request he sought was voluntary\n\ndeparture; he withdrew his request for asylum.    Two months later,\n\non December 29, 2005, the petitioner married a U.S. citizen.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f              On    January    9,    2006,     an    IJ    granted        the    petitioner\n\nvoluntary     departure       up    to   March      10,    2006.      On        January   25,\n\npetitioner's new wife filed an I-130 immediate relative visa\n\npetition with DHS on his behalf.                On February 2, 2006, Venu Alagh\n\nof Korenberg & Abramowitz in Sherman Oaks, California filed an\n\nappearance as attorney for petitioner.                    Petitioner faxed Korenberg\n\n& Abramowitz on March 2, 2006 relevant materials to prepare an\n\napplication for a motion to reopen seeking an adjustment of status\n\nbased   on    the    pending       I-130      petition.        On    March       17,   2006,\n\npetitioner's motion to reopen was filed.                      This motion was filed\n\nseven days past the voluntary departure deadline.\n\n              On March 29, 2006, the IJ ultimately denied petitioner's\n\nmotion to reopen, citing the fact that he had failed to depart by\n\nthe   March    10    voluntary      departure        deadline       and    was    therefore\n\nineligible for a status adjustment.                  See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229c(d)(1).\n\n              Six   weeks     later,     on    May    9,    2006,    new     counsel      for\n\npetitioner filed a second motion to reopen, alleging that Korenberg\n\n& Abramowitz had provided deficient performance because the first\n\nmotion to reopen should have been filed prior to the March 10, 2006\n\ndeadline.     Punzalan was still represented by the same firm for the\n\nsecond motion. A different attorney within Korenberg & Abramowitz,\n\nDan Korenberg, filed the second motion, accusing his own firm of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.                   He argued that Korenberg &\n\nAbramowitz had provided ineffective assistance on the first motion\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fbecause the first motion to reopen should have been filed before\n\nthe expiration of the voluntary departure period.             Petitioner\n\nclaimed that although the firm had mailed the motion on March 6, it\n\nwas not filed using the proper method and therefore did not arrive\n\nin a timely manner.      Petitioner also claimed to have fulfilled the\n\nLozada requirements1 for showing ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nby filing a complaint with the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme\n\nCourt of California against Korenberg & Abramowitz.                The firm\n\npurportedly received notice of the allegations by serving itself\n\nwith the bar complaint, with Dan Korenberg accepting service as\n\nthe firm's representative.\n\n           The IJ denied the second motion to reopen on June 1, 2006\n\nby simply saying she adopted the government's reasons for denying\n\nthe   motion   without   further   analysis   or   specification    of   the\n\nreasons. Petitioner appealed to the BIA, arguing, inter alia, that\n\nthis was an insufficient explanation.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Under In re Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988),\nan alien seeking to reopen removal proceedings based on a claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel must include with the motion 1)\nan affidavit explaining the petitioner's agreement with counsel\nregarding legal representation; 2) evidence that counsel has been\ninformed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and has had\nan opportunity to respond; and 3) if it is asserted that counsel's\nhandling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal\nresponsibilities, a complaint against the attorney filed with\ndisciplinary authorities or, in the alternative, an explanation for\nwhy such a complaint has not been filed. Id.; Dawoud v. Holder,\n561 F.3d 31, 34 n.3 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f              On August 21, 2006, the BIA remanded to the IJ to fully\n\nexplain her reasons for the denial, rather than stating solely that\n\nshe adopted DHS's arguments.            See In re M-P-, 20 I. & N. Dec. 786\n\n(BIA 1994).         The IJ issued a new decision on September 5, 2006\n\ndiscussing the reasons for the denial of the second motion to\n\nreopen. The IJ stated that Punzalan had filed the motion to reopen\n\nafter the voluntary departure deadline, that he had failed to\n\ncomply with the Lozada requirements, and that he was not diligent\n\nin pursuing his first motion to reopen.\n\n              Petitioner appealed that decision to the BIA.               He argued\n\nfirst that the IJ had inadequately explained the basis for the\n\ndenial, and second that the time and number limitations on the\n\nmotion to reopen should have been tolled due to the supposed\n\nineffective assistance of counsel on the first motion to reopen.\n\n              The BIA dismissed petitioner's appeal on September 5,\n\n2008,   for    the    BIA      stated   that    it   was   \"not   persuaded    that\n\nrespondent's prior counsel acted ineffectively.\"                    The BIA found\n\nthat the petitioner had failed to set forth sufficient detail to\n\nsupport a claim of ineffectiveness.                    The BIA noted that the\n\nevidence submitted \"neither describes the terms according to which\n\nthe   work    was    to   be    performed      nor   how   the   former   counsel's\n\nperformance of the work was ineffective.\"\n\n              The BIA also rejected the ineffective assistance claim on\n\nthe grounds that the record showed that the petitioner did not fax\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthe Form I-485, the application for adjustment of status, to his\n\nfirst counsel until March 2, 2006, just eight days before the\n\nvoluntary departure deadline, and that \"it is clear to us that the\n\nrespondent's former counsel could only act as quickly as permitted\n\nby the respondent's piecemeal manner of supplying him the requisite\n\nevidentiary documents.\"\n\n             Because the BIA resolved the case by rejecting Punzalan's\n\nineffectiveness claim, it did not reach the equitable tolling\n\nargument.2\n\n                                     II.\n\n             \"Motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored\n\nbecause . . . such motions are at odds with 'the compelling public\n\ninterests     in    finality   and   the   expeditious   processing   of\n\nproceedings.'\"       Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting Guerrero-Santana v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 90, 92 (1st\n\nCir. 2007)).       We therefore review the BIA's decision for abuse of\n\n\n     2\n          The BIA also determined that even assuming the first\nmotion to reopen had been filed prior to the expiration of the\nvoluntary departure period on March 10, there was \"no basis upon\nwhich to presume the motion would have been adjudicated\" before the\nvoluntary departure period deadline. Citing Chedad v. Gonzales,\n497 F.3d 57, 64 (1st Cir. 2007), overruled in Dada v. Mukasey, 128\nS. Ct. 2307 (2008), the BIA emphasized that the mere filing of a\nmotion to reopen prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure\nperiod does not automatically toll the running of the voluntary\ndeparture period. In Dada, the Supreme Court held that the filing\nof a motion to reopen does not toll the voluntary departure period,\nbut that \"the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a\nvoluntary departure request before expiration of the departure\nperiod, without regard to the underlying merits of the motion to\nreopen.\" 128 S. Ct. at 2319.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fdiscretion.3   Arias-Valencia v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 428, 430 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).    \"Our review is highly deferential, focusing on the\n\nrationality of the decision to deny . . . reopening, not on the\n\nmerits per se, of the underlying claim.\" Abdullah v. Gonzales, 461\n\nF.3d 92, 99 (1st Cir. 2006).   We will set aside the BIA's decision\n\n\"only where it rests on an error of law or reflects arbitrary or\n\ncapricious decisionmaking.\"    Oliveira v. Holder, 568 F.3d 275, 277\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          Petitioner first argues that the time and number limits\n\non his second motion to reopen should be tolled and the proceedings\n\nreopened because of the ineffective assistance of his counsel,\n\nKorenberg & Abramowitz, on the first motion to reopen.     Ordinarily\n\na petitioner may file only one motion to reopen, which must be\n\nfiled within ninety days of the BIA's final decision.      8 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.2(c)(2).       We have reserved the\n\nquestion of whether \"the statutory provision limiting motions to\n\nreopen is subject to equitable tolling.\" Da Silva Neves v. Holder,\n\n568 F.3d 41, 42 (1st Cir. 2009).       And even if it were available,\n\n\"equitable tolling is a 'sparingly' invoked doctrine.\"       Jobe v.\n\nINS, 238 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2001) (en banc) (quoting Irwin v.\n\nDep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990)).      Moreover, we\n\n\n\n     3\n          The parties have not argued that this court lacks\njurisdiction to consider the petition, cf. Fustaguio Do Nascimento\nv. Mukasey, 549 F.3d 12, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2008), and we assume\narguendo that we do have jurisdiction.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fwould only reach this issue if we first held that the BIA had\n\nabused its discretion in finding that petitioner failed to meet his\n\nburden under Lozada of providing sufficient detail of counsel's\n\nineffectiveness.    See Chedid v. Holder, No. 08-1552, ___ F.3d ___,\n\n2009 WL 2100615, at *4 (1st Cir. July 17, 2009).         The BIA did not\n\nabuse its discretion.\n\n          \"The BIA acts within its discretion in denying motions to\n\nreopen that fail to meet the Lozada requirements as long as it does\n\nso in a non-arbitrary manner.\"       Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 11\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).    The Lozada framework \"is designed to screen out\n\nfrivolous, stale, and collusive claims.\" Beltre-Veloz, 533 F.3d at\n\n10. A petitioner's affidavit that \"makes no mention of the nature,\n\nscope, or substance of the petitioner's arrangement with [his\n\nattorney],   [and   fails     to]   indicate   what   communications   the\n\npetitioner had with the attorney\" contains a \"fatal flaw\" under the\n\nLozada requirements.    Id.\n\n          The BIA's determination that the petitioner failed to\n\nmeet the Lozada requirements, which rested on several grounds, was\n\nnot arbitrary or capricious.         Although petitioner did submit an\n\naffidavit, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that\n\n\"the evidence submitted for the purpose of establishing the claimed\n\nineffectiveness neither describes the terms according to which the\n\nwork was to be performed [n]or how the former counsel's performance\n\nof the work was ineffective.\"         The affidavit contained a spare\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdescription of the case.        It contained no record of specific\n\ncontacts with attorney Venu Alagh or anyone else at Korenberg &\n\nAbramowitz. It only stated that Punzalan had \"repeatedly contacted\n\nhis counsel\" and that the motion was not timely filed because of\n\ncounsel's alleged failure to follow the proper filing procedure.\n\nThis failure to file before the voluntary departure deadline was\n\nthe only allusion to any error made by Korenberg & Abramowitz.\n\n          The BIA also found that the petitioner was to blame for\n\nthe failure to make a more timely filing.          The record shows that\n\nPunzalan sent his materials to Korenberg & Abramowitz on March 2,\n\neight days before the deadline, but the affidavit provides no\n\ndescription   of   the   contacts   with   Alagh   between   the   date   of\n\npetitioner's submission and Alagh's filing of the motion to reopen.\n\nThe affidavit neither explains the nature of the filing error nor\n\nwhy it prevented the motion from being filed until March 17, 2007.\n\n          Further, the BIA rightfully was skeptical as to whether\n\nthe petitioner \"registered a meaningful complaint about his former\n\ncounsel\" in compliance with Lozada.        Beltre-Veloz, 533 F.3d at 11.\n\nTo put it mildly, the law firm Korenberg & Abramowitz had divided\n\nand conflicting interests.\n\n          Petitioner further argues that the BIA erred by relying\n\non Chedad, because that decision was later withdrawn after the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fSupreme Court decided Dada v. Mukasey.4       We need not address the\n\nargument,      because   the   BIA      independently   rejected   the\n\nineffectiveness claim in determining that petitioner failed to\n\ncomply with the Lozada requirements.\n\n            Petitioner's final claim of error is easily rejected. He\n\nargues that because the IJ adopted the arguments and reasoning of\n\nDHS in her decision, she failed to fully explain her reasons under\n\nIn re M-P-, and the BIA was wrong to conclude otherwise.           The\n\nfactual basis for this claim is wrong.      The IJ issued a three-page\n\ndecision that set forth her reasoning in sufficient detail to allow\n\nthe BIA to meaningfully exercise its reviewing responsibility. See\n\nIn re M-P-, 20 I. & N. Dec. at 787-88.      Petitioner's argument thus\n\nlacks merit.\n\n            The petition is denied.   Copies of this opinion shall be\n\nsent by the Clerk to the bar disciplinary authorities of California\n\nfor their review concerning attorney Dan Korenberg and the firm of\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          After the Dada decision (although on the basis of a\nproposed rule that preceded Dada), the Executive Office of\nImmigration Review (\"EOIR\") issued a rule stating that the filing\nof any motion for reconsideration or reopening automatically\nterminates voluntary departure. See Voluntary Departure: Effect of\na Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73\nFed.Reg. 76,927, 76,937 (Dec. 18, 2008) (codified at 8 C.F.R.\nยง 1240.26(e)(1)). The EOIR expressly stated that this new rule is\nto be applied prospectively only, and so it does not apply to the\ninstant petition. Id. at 76,936. To the extent petitioner may be\nmaking a claim that Dada applies retroactively to this case, the\nargument is waived and we will not address it.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fKorenberg & Abramowitz.

The IJ stated that Punzalan had filed the motion to reopen after the voluntary departure deadline, that he had failed to comply with the <i>Lozada</i> requirements, and that he was not diligent in pursuing his first motion to reopen.</p>\n<p>Petitioner appealed that decision to the BIA. He argued first that the IJ had inadequately explained the basis for the denial, and second that the time and number limitations on the motion to reopen should have been tolled due to the supposed ineffective assistance of counsel on the first motion to reopen.</p>\n<p>The BIA dismissed petitioner's appeal on September 5, 2008, for the BIA stated that it was \"not persuaded that respondent's prior counsel acted ineffectively.\" The BIA found that the petitioner had failed to set forth sufficient detail to support a claim of ineffectiveness. The BIA noted that the evidence submitted \"neither describes the terms according to which the work was to be performed nor how the former counsel's performance of the work was ineffective.\"</p>\n<p>The BIA also rejected the ineffective assistance claim on the grounds that the record showed that the petitioner did not fax the Form I-485, the application for adjustment of status, to his first counsel until March 2, 2006, just eight days before the voluntary departure deadline, and that \"it is clear to us that the respondent's former counsel could only act as quickly as permitted by the respondent's piecemeal manner of supplying him the requisite evidentiary documents.\"</p>\n<p>Because the BIA resolved the case by rejecting Punzalan's ineffectiveness claim, it did not reach the equitable tolling argument.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*111</span> II.</h2>\n<p>\"Motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored because ... such motions are at odds with `the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.'\" <i>Beltre-Veloz v.

It contained no record of specific contacts with attorney Venu Alagh or anyone else at Korenberg &amp; Abramowitz. It only stated that Punzalan had \"repeatedly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> contacted his counsel\" and that the motion was not timely filed because of counsel's alleged failure to follow the proper filing procedure.

The affidavit neither explains the nature of the filing error nor why it prevented the motion from being filed until March 17, 2007.</p>\n<p>Further, the BIA rightfully was skeptical as to whether the petitioner \"registered a meaningful complaint about his former counsel\" in compliance with <i>Lozada. </i><i>Beltre-Veloz,</i> 533 F.3d at 11.

In <i>Dada,</i> the Supreme Court held that the filing of a motion to reopen does not toll the voluntary departure period, but that \"the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before expiration of the departure period, without regard to the underlying merits of the motion to reopen.\" 128 S.Ct. at 2319.</p>\n<p>[3]  The parties have not argued that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the petition, <i>cf. </i><i>Fustaguio Do Nascimento v.

Petitioner argues that the time and number limitations on filing his second motion should be equitably tolled and proceedings reopened due to the alleged ineffective assistance of his prior counsel on the first motion to reopen. The BIA rejected the second motion to reopen for several reasons, including that petitioner had failed to demonstrate that his former counsel acted deficiently. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Petitioner entered the United States on October 5, 2001 for a period not to exceed April 4, 2002. He did not depart. The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") then commenced removal proceedings by filing a Notice to Appear on July 29, 2005. On September 16, 2005, petitioner appeared with counsel before an immigration judge (\"IJ\") and conceded removability. He stated that he would seek asylum or, in the alternative, voluntary departure. On October 25, 2005, petitioner filed a motion seeking a change of venue and stated that the only request he sought was voluntary departure; he withdrew his request for asylum. Two months later, on December 29, 2005, the petitioner married a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p>On January 9, 2006, an IJ granted the petitioner voluntary departure up to March 10, 2006. On January 25, petitioner's new wife filed an I-130 immediate relative visa petition with DHS on his behalf. On February 2, 2006, Venu Alagh of Korenberg &amp; Abramowitz in Sherman Oaks, California filed an appearance as attorney for petitioner. Petitioner faxed Korenberg &amp; Abramowitz on March 2, 2006 relevant materials to prepare an application for a motion to reopen seeking an adjustment of status based on the pending I-130 petition. On March 17, 2006, petitioner's motion to reopen was filed. This motion was filed seven days past the voluntary departure deadline.</p>\n<p>On March 29, 2006, the IJ ultimately denied petitioner's motion to reopen, citing the fact that he had failed to depart by the March 10 voluntary departure deadline and was therefore ineligible for a status adjustment. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229c(d)(1).</p>\n<p>Six weeks later, on May 9, 2006, new counsel for petitioner filed a second motion to reopen, alleging that Korenberg &amp; Abramowitz had provided deficient performance because the first motion to reopen should have been filed prior to the March 10, 2006 deadline. Punzalan was still represented by the same firm for the second motion. A different attorney within Korenberg &amp; Abramowitz, Dan Korenberg, filed the second motion, accusing his own firm of ineffective assistance of counsel. He argued that Korenberg &amp; Abramowitz had provided ineffective assistance on the first motion because the first motion to reopen should have been filed before the expiration of the voluntary departure period. Petitioner claimed that although the firm had mailed the motion on March 6, it was not filed using the proper method and therefore did not arrive in a timely manner. Petitioner also claimed to have fulfilled the <i>Lozada</i> requirements<sup>[1]</sup> for showing ineffective assistance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> of counsel by filing a complaint with the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of California against Korenberg &amp; Abramowitz. The firm purportedly received notice of the allegations by serving itself with the bar complaint, with Dan Korenberg accepting service as the firm's representative.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied the second motion to reopen on June 1, 2006 by simply saying she adopted the government's reasons for denying the motion without further analysis or specification of the reasons. Petitioner appealed to the BIA, arguing, inter alia, that this was an insufficient explanation.</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2006, the BIA remanded to the IJ to fully explain her reasons for the denial, rather than stating solely that she adopted DHS's arguments. <i>See In re M-P-,</i> 20 I. &amp; N.

In <i>Dada,</i> the Supreme Court held that the filing of a motion to reopen does not toll the voluntary departure period, but that \"the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before expiration of the departure period, without regard to the underlying merits of the motion to reopen.\" 128 S.Ct. at 2319.</p>\n<p>[3]  The parties have not argued that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the petition, <i>cf. </i><i>Fustaguio Do Nascimento v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203576\"><a href=\"/opinion/203576/fustaguio-do-nascimento-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1st Cir.2008), and we assume arguendo that we do have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[4]  After the <i>Dada</i> decision (although on the basis of a proposed rule that preceded <i>Dada</i>), the Executive Office of Immigration Review (\"EOIR\") issued a rule stating that the filing of any motion for reconsideration or reopening automatically terminates voluntary departure. <i>See Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review,</i> 73 Fed.Reg. 76,927, 76,937 (Dec. 18, 2008) (codified at 8 C.F.R. ยง 1240.26(e)(1)). The EOIR expressly stated that this new rule is to be applied prospectively only, and so it does not apply to the instant petition. <i>Id.</i> at 76,936. To the extent petitioner may be making a claim that <i>Dada</i> applies retroactively to this case, the argument is waived and we will not address it.</p>\n\n</div>",
