Rya W. Zobel,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                    Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Jack R. Pirozzolo, Sarah Cooleybeck and Foley Hoag LLP, on\nresponse to appellee's motion to dismiss and appellant's cross-\nmotion to transfer, for appellant.\n     Todd M. McGrath, Seyfarth Shaw LLP, Michael P. Foradas, Mark\nA. Pals and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, on motion to dismiss, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                          January 17, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.   This is an appeal from a single judgment of\n\nthe district court in two cases, both brought by CytoLogix Corp.\n\nagainst Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.           One of the two district\n\ncourt cases, No. 01-10178, was a patent infringement action; the\n\nother, No. 01-12231, was an antitrust/misappropriation action.\n\nAfter two trials, both combining claims from each action, the\n\ndistrict court entered final judgment on all claims.                  Although\n\nthere was no formal order of consolidation before those trials, the\n\ndistrict court later entered an order stating that, in actuality,\n\nthe cases were consolidated for trial and ordering that they be\n\nconsolidated, nunc pro tunc, as of the commencement of the first\n\ntrial.   CytoLogix then filed two identical notices of appeal from\n\nthe consolidated judgment, one in this court and one in the Court\n\nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\n            Ventana has now moved to dismiss the appeal to this court\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction and has also sought sanctions under Rule\n\n38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.          CytoLogix opposes\n\ndismissal    and   sanctions   but   concedes   that   its   appeal    of   the\n\ndisposition of its patent claims should be transferred to the\n\nFederal Circuit.     In the alternative, CytoLogix requests that the\n\nentire appeal be transferred to the Federal Circuit rather than\n\ndismissed.    For the reasons discussed below, we dismiss the appeal\n\nbut deny sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f               \"Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1295(a) the Federal Circuit has\n\nexclusive jurisdiction of an appeal if the jurisdiction of the\n\ndistrict court was based, in whole or in part, on 28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1338.\"      Wang Labs., Inc. v. Applied Computer Sciences, Inc., 926\n\nF.2d 92, 94-95 (1st Cir. 1991).              In turn, section 1338 provides\n\nthat \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any\n\ncivil       action   arising   under   any   Act   of   Congress   relating   to\n\npatents.\"       28 U.S.C. ยง 1338(a).     As is apparent on the face of the\n\ncomplaint in No. 01-10178, the district court's jurisdiction in\n\nthat case arose under patent law.1            Although the complaint in No.\n\n01-12231 did not arise under patent law, \"once the [two cases] were\n\nconsolidated, jurisdiction of the entire case was necessarily based\n\n'in part' on section 1338.\"2           Xeta, Inc. v. Atex, Inc., 825 F.2d\n\n604, 607-08 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing In re Innotron Diagnostics, 800\n\n\n        1\n      Because the district court's jurisdiction under section 1338\nis determined by application of the well-pleaded complaint rule,\nthe fact that a counterclaim or defense is based on patent law is\nnot sufficient to confer jurisdiction under that section. Holmes\nGroup, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., 535 U.S. 826, 830-33\n(2002). Prior cases holding to the contrary, e.g., Aerojet-General\nCorp. v. Machine Tool Works, Oerlikon-Buehrle, Ltd., 895 F.2d 736,\n742-43 (Fed. Cir. 1990), are therefore no longer good law on that\npoint.    See Telcomm Technical Servs., Inc. v. Siemens Rolm\nCommc'ns, Inc., 295 F.3d 1249, 1251-52 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n        2\n      Indeed, in an order in an interlocutory appeal in this case,\nthe Federal Circuit indicated that its jurisdiction over an appeal\nfrom final judgment in the non-patent case would depend on whether\nthe two cases were consolidated, which was unclear from the record\nat that point. Accordingly, the Federal Circuit expressed hope\nthat \"the district court w[ould] illuminate its view of the issue\nof whether the cases are consolidated or not during the remaining\nproceedings,\" which the court ultimately did.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fF.2d 1077, 1080 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); see also Wang Labs., 926 F.2d at\n\n95.    Accordingly, the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover this appeal.3     Wang Labs., 926 F.2d at 95.\n\n            Ordinarily, having reached the above conclusion about an\n\nappeal filed in this circuit, we would transfer the appeal to the\n\nFederal Circuit as authorized by 28 U.S.C. ยง 1631.              See id. at 95\n\n& n.4.     However, because an identical appeal is already pending\n\nthere, we will simply dismiss the appeal mistakenly filed here,\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n            Although Ventana has thus prevailed on its motion to\n\ndismiss, we do not find Cytologix's position to be so frivolous as\n\nto    warrant   sanctions    under   Rule   38   of   the   Federal   Rules   of\n\nAppellate Procedure.        See Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 24 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).       Accordingly, Ventana's request for sanctions is\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      Cytologix relies on In re Mass. Helicopter Airlines, Inc.,\n469 F.2d 439, 441-42 (1st Cir. 1972), for the proposition that\nconsolidated cases remain separate for purposes of determining\nappellate jurisdiction. In doing so, it reads Mass. Helicopter too\nbroadly.   That case involved appealability in the absence of a\nfinal judgment on all claims or a certificate under Rule 54(b) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Even in that context, we\nreserved decision on \"[w]hether consolidated actions must remain\nseparate actions under every conceivable set of circumstances.\"\nId. at 442 n.3.    In a later case, we expressly limited Mass.\nHelicopter's holding to the Rule 54(b) context, stating that it\n\"does not mandate that consolidated cases always retain their\nseparateness for all purposes.\"    Bay State HMO Mgmt., Inc. v.\nTingley Sys., Inc., 181 F.3d 174, 177-78 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                      -4-\n\f          The   motion   to   dismiss    is   granted.
