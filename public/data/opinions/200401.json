Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, were on brief for appellant.\n     David R. Beneman with whom Levenson, Vickerson & Beneman was\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 31, 2003\n\f      Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge.            The defendant-appellee, Ernest\n\nWeidul (\"Weidul\"), was charged with being a felon in possession of\n\na firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).                  The police found the\n\nfirearm after conducting a warrantless search of the home of Trisha\n\nMalloch (\"Malloch\"), Weidul's fiancee.                 Weidul moved to suppress\n\nthe firearm.         A Magistrate Judge found that Malloch did not\n\nvoluntarily consent to the search of her home and recommended that\n\nWeidul's    motion      be   granted.      The   district       court     adopted    the\n\nMagistrate       Judge's     recommendation      and    granted     the    motion     to\n\nsuppress.    The government appealed.            We affirm.\n\n                                   I.   BACKGROUND\n\n      We take the facts from the Magistrate-Judge's recommended\n\ndecision, which the district court adopted.                    See United States v.\n\nWeidul, 227 F. Supp.2d 161, 162-65 (D. Me. 2002).                   When motions to\n\nsuppress are       at   issue,     we   review   a     district    court's    factual\n\nfindings for clear error.           See United States v. Palmer, 203 F.3d\n\n55, 60 (1st Cir. 2000).             The ultimate conclusion as to whether\n\nthere is a Fourth Amendment violation is reviewed de novo.                           See\n\nOrnelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 691 (1996).\n\n      On   the    evening     of   January     11,     2001,    Weidul    called     the\n\nemergency department of Southern Maine Medical Center (\"SMMC\") and\n\nthreatened to \"blow his head off\" with a loaded .22 caliber gun.\n\nThe   crisis-response         worker    who    answered    Weidul's       phone     call\n\noverheard a female voice in the background screaming, \"Oh my God,\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fdon't do it, don't do it.\" The crisis-response worker asked Weidul\n\nto identify the person yelling and he replied that it was his\n\nfiancee, Malloch. Weidul refused to let the crisis-response worker\n\nspeak with Malloch.      The worker also observed that Weidul was\n\nslurring his    words   and   seemed     to   be   intoxicated.    Following\n\nprotocol, the crisis-response worker signaled for her colleague to\n\nphone the police.\n\n     The colleague ascertained that the call was coming from a\n\nresidence in Kennebunk, Maine, and phoned the Kennebunk Police\n\nDepartment.     She   told    the    police   dispatcher   that   Weidul   was\n\nsuicidal, had a loaded gun in his hand \"two inches from his mouth,\"\n\nhad been drinking, had two boxes of ammunition, and was threatening\n\nto shoot police officers.           She also reported that Weidul was at\n\nMalloch's home and that Weidul refused to let Malloch speak with\n\nthe crisis-response workers.1         After five minutes, Weidul repeated\n\nthat there was nothing that could stop him from killing himself and\n\nhung up the phone.\n\n         While officers were en route to Malloch's residence, the\n\nKennebunk police dispatcher received a phone call from Malloch.\n\nMalloch reported that Weidul had passed out and was asleep, that\n\n\n\n     1\n       It can be inferred from the record that Weidul was staying\nor living with Malloch.     Therefore, he had an expectation of\nprivacy in her home and standing to challenge the warrantless\nsearch.    See Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 99-100 (1990)\n(overnight guests have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their\nhost's home).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthere was no gun involved, that Weidul was just a little depressed,\n\nand there was nothing more to the situation.           The dispatcher, who\n\nwas in simultaneous communication with the officers en route, asked\n\nMalloch to meet the officers outside her home and she obliged.\n\n         One of the officers, Keith Mills (\"Mills\"), knew Weidul from\n\ntwo previous domestic violence incidents in which he had threatened\n\nto shoot his mother and sister, and had assaulted his father and\n\nsister.      Mills   considered   Weidul   to   have   a   \"propensity   for\n\nviolence\" and knew that he had a history of mental instability.\n\nAnother officer, Zachary Brooks Harmon (\"Harmon\"), recalled an\n\nincident in July, 2000, when Weidul pointed a gun at Malloch.            Both\n\nofficers considered Weidul to be very dangerous.           Mills also knew\n\nMalloch from her work in Kennebunkport and from minor traffic\n\nstops.    Harmon knew Malloch from her previous traffic infractions\n\nand chance encounters.     He characterized her as a \"cop nut\" who was\n\nfascinated by the police.\n\n      When the officers arrived at the scene, they met Malloch who\n\nwas outside her house.    They spoke to Malloch as they went into the\n\nhouse and asked her where both Weidul and the gun were located.\n\nMalloch cooperated with police by telling them that Weidul was\n\nupstairs sleeping in the bedroom; she did not protest them entering\n\nher home.     She did, however, deny that there was a gun in the\n\nhouse.\n\n     The officers found Weidul upstairs, but found no weapon. They\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdid, however, observe a gun cleaning kit on the right side of the\n\nbed,    along   with   a    small,   uncovered   plastic   box    containing\n\nmedication bottles and .22 caliber ammunition. Weidul was lying on\n\nthe bed, apparently asleep.           The police officers put plastic\n\n\"flexcuffs\" on Weidul and placed him in a waiting patrol car, which\n\nimmediately departed from the Malloch residence to SMMC.\n\n       Harmon, Mills, and another officer re-entered Malloch's home.\n\nMalloch was in her downstairs' living room, sitting in an armchair\n\nspeaking to Kennebunk police captain, Mike LeBlanc (\"LeBlanc\").\n\nThe substance of the conversation between Malloch and LeBlanc is\n\nnot in the record.         LeBlanc had arrived on the scene at some time\n\nsubsequent to the other officers.            A fifth officer was also\n\npresent. In Malloch's presence, LeBlanc instructed the officers to\n\nmake sure, for safety reasons, that there were no weapons in the\n\nhouse.    Malloch, still sitting in her armchair, did not protest.\n\nTo Harmon, she appeared \"blase\" and unconcerned that a search was\n\ntranspiring.      Mills began looking around the living room and\n\nnoticed ammunition rounds in plain view on shelves and on the floor\n\nnext to the chair where Malloch was sitting.          He found no weapons\n\nin the living room.\n\n       Harmon proceeded from the living room toward the kitchen,\n\nsaying to Malloch, \"I'm going to look in here, okay?\"            Malloch gave\n\nno response.    Harmon nonetheless entered the kitchen.           After a few\n\nmoments in the kitchen, Harmon moved on to a small laundry room\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fadjacent to the kitchen, telling Malloch, whom he could still see,\n\n\"I'm going to look in here.\"         Malloch responded, \"Okay.\"       Harmon\n\nentered the laundry room.           The floor was littered with dirty\n\nclothes.    Harmon kicked aside some of the clothes and discovered a\n\nloaded .22 caliber handgun, the object of the motion to suppress.\n\nThe officers continued to search the house for an hour after Harmon\n\nfound the gun.\n\n                             II.     DISCUSSION\n\n     The primary issue in this case is whether Malloch voluntarily\n\ngave consent for the police to conduct a warrantless search of her\n\nhome.   No claim is made that this search is warranted by exigent\n\ncircumstances.    The government initially raises a question about\n\nthe proper standard of appellate review.             It argues that whether\n\nMalloch voluntarily gave consent to the search of her home is a\n\nquestion of law that we should review de novo.            Our rule has been\n\nthat voluntariness of consent is a factual matter that is subjected\n\nto the clear error standard of review, and we adhere to that rule.\n\nSee United States v. Laine, 270 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nBarnett, 989 F.2d 546, 554 (1st Cir. 1993).            Under this standard,\n\na   district   court's     choice    between   two     plausible   competing\n\ninterpretations of the facts cannot be clearly erroneous.                 See\n\nPalmer, 203 F.3d at 60.        Instead, \"the only real question for\n\nappellate    review   is   whether    the   evidence     presented   at   the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fsuppression     hearing     fairly       supports    [the      district      court's]\n\nfinding.\"     Laine, 270 F.3d at 75.\n\n     Turning to the merits, \"warrantless search and seizures in the\n\nhome violate the Fourth Amendment, absent consent or exigent\n\ncircumstances.\"      Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 883 (1987)\n\n(Blackmun, J., dissenting). Consent must be voluntary to be valid.\n\nSee United States v. Perez-Montanez, 202 F.3d 434, 438 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).      Whether consent is voluntary is to be determined by\n\nexamining     the   totality      of    the    circumstances,        including     the\n\ninteraction between the police and the person alleged to have given\n\nconsent.     See United States v. Esquilin, 208 F.3d 315, 318 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); Perez-Montanez, 202 F.3d at 438.\n\n     The    heart   of    the    government's       argument    is    that   Malloch\n\nvoluntarily consented to the search when she responded \"Okay\" to\n\nOfficer Harmon's statement, \"I'm going to look in here.\"                           The\n\ngovernment     argues     that    the     totality     of    the      circumstances\n\ndemonstrate     Malloch's       \"Okay\"    was    voluntary      consent.          These\n\ncircumstances include the fact that Malloch was sitting in a chair\n\nin her living room; that Malloch was a \"cop nut\" and was fascinated\n\nby the police; the fact that Malloch had met Officer Harmon on a\n\nprior occasion; the fact that Malloch's demeanor was low-key; and\n\nthe fact that Malloch did not protest when Captain LeBlanc told the\n\nother officers to search the house for weapons.\n\n     The     Magistrate     Judge        examined     the      totality      of     the\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fcircumstances and found that Malloch did not voluntarily consent to\n\nthe search of her home.    The Magistrate Judge held:\n\n     Under all of these circumstances, Malloch's uttering of\n     the word \"okay\" as Harmon stated that he was about to\n     search the laundry room (meanwhile walking purposefully\n     in that direction) was not a consent to search--it was a\n     simple acquiescence to what any reasonable person would\n     have perceived, under the circumstances, as police\n     conduct tantamount to a claim of lawful authority to\n     search for weapons.\n\nWeidul, 227 F. Supp.2d at 167-68.\n\n     We rule that the evidence fairly supports the Magistrate\n\nJudge's finding.   The critical facts are as follows.          After Weidul\n\nwas removed from the house, Officer Harmon and two other officers\n\nre-entered Malloch's home without permission.         Once inside, they\n\nfound Malloch talking with Captain Leblanc.         A fifth officer was\n\nalso present.      In Malloch's presence, Leblanc told the other\n\nofficers that they had to search Malloch's house for weapons.\n\nMalloch sat in a chair as the officers dispersed to search her\n\nhouse.     Officer Harmon asked Malloch if he could look in the\n\nkitchen, but she did not respond.       Harmon nevertheless entered the\n\nkitchen.   Harmon then told Malloch that he was going to look in the\n\nlaundry room.   Malloch responded \"Okay.\"\n\n                          III.   CONCLUSION\n\n     The Magistrate Judge's factual findings on the voluntariness\n\nof Malloch's consent are fairly supported by the record.               The\n\ngovernment   merely   offers   evidence    from   which   an   alternative\n\nconclusion can be drawn.       This is not enough under the clearly\n\n                                  -8-\n\ferroneous standard of review.    See United States v. Coraine, 198\n\nF.3d 306, 310 (1st Cir. 1999).        Absent voluntary consent, this\n\nsearch violated the Fourth Amendment.     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

The crisis-response worker who answered Weidul's phone call overheard a female voice in the background screaming, \"Oh my God, don't do it, don't do it.\" The crisis-response worker asked Weidul to identify the person yelling and he replied that it was his fiancee, Malloch.

It argues that whether Malloch voluntarily gave consent to the search of her home is a question of law that we should review <i>de novo.</i> Our rule has been that voluntariness of consent is a factual matter that is subjected to the clear error standard of review, and we adhere to that rule. <i>See United States v. Laine,</i> 270 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d 546, 554 (1st Cir.1993). Under this standard, a district court's choice between two plausible competing interpretations of the facts cannot be clearly erroneous. <i>See Palmer,</i> 203 F.3d at 60. Instead, \"the only real question for appellate review is whether the evidence presented at the suppression hearing fairly supports [the district court's] finding.\" <i>Laine,</i> 270 F.3d at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, \"warrantless search and seizures in the home violate the Fourth Amendment, absent consent or exigent circumstances.\" <i>Griffin v. Wisconsin,</i> 483 U.S. 868, 883, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). Consent must be voluntary to be valid. <i>See United States v. Perez-Montanez,</i> 202 F.3d 434, 438 (1st Cir.2000). Whether consent is voluntary is to be determined by examining the totality of the circumstances, including the interaction between the police and the person alleged to have given consent. <i>See United States v. Esquilin,</i> 208 F.3d 315, 318 (1st Cir. 2000); <i>Perez-Montanez,</i> 202 F.3d at 438.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The heart of the government's argument is that Malloch voluntarily consented to the search when she responded \"Okay\" to Officer Harmon's statement, \"I'm going to look in here.\" The government argues that the totality of the circumstances demonstrate Malloch's \"Okay\" was voluntary consent. These circumstances include the fact that Malloch was sitting in a chair in her living room; that Malloch was a \"cop nut\" and was fascinated by the police; the fact that Malloch had met Officer Harmon on a prior occasion; the fact that Malloch's demeanor was low-key; and the fact that Malloch did not protest when Captain LeBlanc told the other officers to search the house for weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Magistrate Judge examined the totality of the circumstances and found that Malloch did not voluntarily consent to the search of her home. The Magistrate Judge held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under all of these circumstances, Malloch's uttering of the word \"okay\" as Harmon stated that he was about to search the laundry room (meanwhile walking purposefully in that direction) was not a consent to search &#8212; it was a simple acquiescence to what any reasonable person would have perceived, under the circumstances, as police conduct tantamount to a claim of lawful authority to search for weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Weidul,</i> 227 F.Supp.2d at 167-68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that the evidence fairly supports the Magistrate Judge's finding. The critical facts are as follows. After Weidul was removed from the house, Officer Harmon and two other officers re-entered Malloch's home without permission. Once inside, they found Malloch talking with Captain Leblanc. A fifth officer was also present. In Malloch's presence, Leblanc told the other officers that they had to search Malloch's house for weapons. Malloch sat in a chair as the officers dispersed to search her house. Officer Harmon asked Malloch if he could look in the kitchen, but she did not respond. Harmon nevertheless entered the kitchen. Harmon then told Malloch that he was going to look in the laundry room.

The crisis-response worker who answered Weidul's phone call overheard a female voice in the background screaming, \"Oh my God, don't do it, don't do it.\" The crisis-response worker asked Weidul to identify the person yelling and he replied that it was his fiancee, Malloch. Weidul refused to let the crisis-response worker speak with Malloch. The worker also observed that Weidul was slurring his words and seemed to be intoxicated. Following protocol, the crisis-response worker signaled for her colleague to phone the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The colleague ascertained that the call was coming from a residence in Kennebunk, Maine, and phoned the Kennebunk Police Department. She told the police dispatcher that Weidul was suicidal, had a loaded gun in his hand \"two inches from his mouth,\" had been drinking, had two boxes of ammunition, and was threatening to shoot police officers. She also reported that Weidul was at Malloch's home and that Weidul refused to let Malloch speak with the crisis-response workers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After five minutes, Weidul repeated that there was nothing that could stop him from killing himself and hung up the phone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While officers were en route to Malloch's residence, the Kennebunk police dispatcher received a phone call from Malloch. Malloch reported that Weidul had passed out and was asleep, that there was no gun involved, that Weidul was just a little depressed, and there was nothing more to the situation. The dispatcher, who was in simultaneous communication with the officers en route, asked Malloch to meet the officers outside her home and she obliged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the officers, Keith Mills (\"Mills\"), knew Weidul from two previous domestic violence incidents in which he had threatened to shoot his mother and sister, and had assaulted his father and sister. Mills considered Weidul to have a \"propensity for violence\" and knew that he had a history of mental instability. Another officer, Zachary Brooks Harmon (\"Harmon\"), recalled an incident in July, 2000, when Weidul pointed a gun at Malloch. Both officers considered Weidul to be very dangerous. Mills also knew Malloch from her work in Kennebunkport and from minor traffic stops. Harmon knew Malloch from her previous traffic infractions and chance encounters. He characterized her as a \"cop nut\" who was fascinated by the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the officers arrived at the scene, they met Malloch who was outside her house. They spoke to Malloch as they went into the house and asked her where both Weidul and the gun were located. Malloch cooperated with police by telling them that Weidul was upstairs sleeping in the bedroom; she did not protest them entering her home. She did, however, deny that there was a gun in the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers found Weidul upstairs, but found no weapon. They did, however, observe a gun cleaning kit on the right side of the bed, along with a small, uncovered plastic box containing medication bottles and .22 caliber ammunition. Weidul was lying on the bed, apparently asleep. The police officers put plastic \"flexcuffs\" on Weidul and placed him in a waiting patrol car, which immediately departed from the Malloch residence to SMMC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harmon, Mills, and another officer re-entered Malloch's home. Malloch was in her downstairs' living room, sitting in an armchair speaking to Kennebunk police captain, Mike LeBlanc (\"LeBlanc\"). The substance of the conversation between Malloch and LeBlanc is not in the record. LeBlanc had arrived on the scene at some time subsequent to the other officers. A fifth officer was also present. In Malloch's presence, LeBlanc instructed the officers to make sure, for safety reasons, that there were no weapons in the house. Malloch, still sitting in her armchair, did not protest. To Harmon, she appeared \"blase\" and unconcerned that a search was transpiring. Mills began looking around the living room and noticed ammunition rounds in plain view on shelves and on the floor next to the chair where Malloch was sitting. He found no weapons in the living room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harmon proceeded from the living room toward the kitchen, saying to Malloch, \"I'm going to look in here, okay?\" Malloch gave no response. Harmon nonetheless entered the kitchen. After a few moments in the kitchen, Harmon moved on to a small laundry room adjacent to the kitchen, telling Malloch, whom he could still see, \"I'm going to look in here.\" Malloch responded, \"Okay.\" Harmon entered the laundry room. The floor was littered with dirty clothes. Harmon kicked aside some of the clothes and discovered a loaded .22 caliber handgun, the object of the motion to suppress. The officers continued to search the house for an hour after Harmon found the gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary issue in this case is whether Malloch voluntarily gave consent for the police to conduct a warrantless search of her home.
