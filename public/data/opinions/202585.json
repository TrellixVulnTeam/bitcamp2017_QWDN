R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 06-1523\n\n                             PETER K. FREI,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                      TOWN OF HOLLAND, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Michael A. Ponsor,          U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Peter K. Frei on brief pro se.\n     Nancy Frankel Pelletier, Dorothy Varon and Robinson Donovan,\nP.C., on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            January 5, 2007\n\f           Per Curiam.       Pro se appellant Peter Frei appeals from\n\nthe district court's grant of defendants' Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c)\n\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings.          After careful consideration\n\nof the record and appellate claims, we affirm, substantially for\n\nthe reasons given in the comprehensive and well-written Memorandum\n\nand Order by District Judge Ponsor, which is dated February 17,\n\n2006.   We make only the following additional comments.\n\n           1.    Even if we deem the April 3, 2001 event Frei\n\nhighlights to have been within the limitations period, that would\n\nnot affect the result here.         By itself, the April 3rd event did not\n\nstate a federal claim and so could not \"anchor\" the remaining\n\nuntimely claims against the board of health.              Centro Medico del\n\nTurabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(where serial continuing violations are alleged, \"the act that\n\nfalls within the limitations period must itself constitute an\n\nactionable violation\").\n\n           2.    In his appellate brief, Frei fails to address a\n\ncritical element of his \"class of one\" equal protection claim\n\nagainst   the   town   planning     board.     See    Barrington      Cove    Ltd.\n\nPartnership v. Rhode Island Housing & Mortg. Finance Corp., 246\n\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2001) (confirming that the complaint must\n\nadequately    allege   all   of   the    relevant    respects   in    which    the\n\nplaintiff and more favorably treated applicants were \"similarly\n\nsituated\").     Thus,   he    has    waived   or    forfeited   his    right    to\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fappellate consideration.         Casillas-Díaz v. Palau, 463 F.3d 77, 83\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (\"Few principles are more a part of the warp and\n\nwoof of appellate practice than the principle that 'issues adverted\n\nto   in   a   perfunctory     manner,    unaccompanied     by   some    effort   at\n\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.'\") (citation omitted).\n\n              3.    The pertinent state law, M.G.L. c. 41, §§ 81L and\n\n81P, did not entitle Frei to the planning board's endorsement of\n\nhis plans to divide one parcel of land.                 The mandatory language\n\nFrei focuses on is qualified by other statutory language, as the\n\ndistrict judge recognized.            Hence, the dismissal of the procedural\n\ndue process claim was proper for that reason alone.\n\n              4.      The    substantive       due   process    claim   based    on\n\nallegations of perjury, falsification of documents, and retaliatory\n\naction, fails under this circuit's case law. See, e.g., Cruz-Erazo\n\nv. Rivera-Montañez, 212 F.3d 617, 623-24 (1st Cir. 2000) (rejecting\n\nsubstantive due process claim based on police provision of false\n\naffidavits and testimony to support a trumped-up burglary charge);\n\nPagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 33-34 (1st Cir. 2006) (rejecting\n\nretaliation        claim    because    \"[s]ubstantive     due    process   is    an\n\ninappropriate avenue of relief when the governmental conduct at\n\nissue is covered by a specific constitutional provision\" like the\n\nFirst Amendment).\n\n              5.    Frei has not established that the district judge's\n\ndecision on his takings claim is inconsistent with Supreme Court\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\flaw, as he maintains.       He fails to cite any case or other authority\n\nthat would support his claim that the one-year limitations period\n\nfor his state remedy renders that remedy inadequate.                At this\n\npoint, it is speculative whether the state law cap on municipal\n\nliability would render the state remedy inadequate.\n\n          6.     As   for    the   retaliation   claim   against   the   town\n\nplanning board, the complaint itself indicates that the board\n\ndeclined to endorse Frei's plans before learning that Frei intended\n\nto file a mandamus action.         Moreover, Frei's prior applications to\n\nstate courts or agencies were all too remote in time to give rise\n\nto an inference of retaliation by the board.             See Centro Medico,\n\n406 F.3d at 11 n.5 (even a two-year lapse of time between the\n\nplaintiff's    and    defendant's      actions   \"undercuts   rather     than\n\nsupports\" the existence of a causal connection).\n\n          7. Contrary to Frei's contention on appeal, the district\n\njudge did rule on his motion to amend his complaint a second time,\n\ndenying it as untimely.       Moreover, the claim Frei now seeks to add\n\n-- that one defendant misrepresented the facts and law to the state\n\ncourt judge presiding over Frei's mandamus action -- is not a\n\nfederal claim.   See Cruz-Erazo, supra, 212 F.3d at 623-24.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
