Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Lipez, Selya and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n      Edwin E. León León on brief for appellant Ramón Pérez-Mejías.\n\n     Rafael Anglada-Lopez on brief for appellant Tomás Rosario-\nPaché.\n\f     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Thomas E. Klumper,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Vélez, United\nStates Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        September 17, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.   These two consolidated appeals arise from a\n\nmulti-defendant prosecution for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into\n\nthe United States from the Dominican Republic and to possess the\n\ncocaine with intent to distribute it.            On appeal, one defendant,\n\nTomás Rosario-Paché (Rosario), argues that (i) the government\n\n\"entrapped\" him by inducing criminal conduct that he was not\n\npredisposed to commit and (ii) he was entitled to a much more\n\nlenient sentence because of his substantial assistance to the\n\ngovernment.      The other defendant, Ramón Pérez-Mejías (Pérez),\n\nargues that the district court erred in not vacating his guilty\n\nplea at sentencing.       Both appeals raise the threshold issue of\n\nwhether   they   are   barred    by   the    appeal   waivers   contained   in\n\ndefendants' plea agreements.          For the reasons discussed below, we\n\naffirm both judgments.\n\n            Rosario pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, which\n\ncontained the following appeal waiver:           \"Defendant agrees that if\n\nthis Honorable Court accepts this agreement and sentences hi[m]\n\naccording   to   its   terms    and   conditions,     defendant   waives    and\n\nsurrenders his right to appeal the conviction and sentence in this\n\ncase.\" In that agreement, the parties further agreed \"to recommend\n\na sentence at the lower end of the applicable guideline range,\" and\n\nRosario ultimately received a sentence two months below the bottom\n\nof that range.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f          In his appellate brief, Rosario makes no mention of the\n\nappeal waiver.   Nor did he file a reply brief addressing the appeal\n\nwaiver even though the government's brief primarily argued that\n\nRosario's appeal was barred by that waiver.       Rather, his brief\n\nmakes two bare-boned merits arguments, namely, that the government\n\ncommitted entrapment by inducing him to commit a crime that he was\n\nnot predisposed to commit and that he was entitled to a more\n\nlenient sentence due to his substantial assistance.\n\n          Where, as here, a defendant agrees to waive his right to\n\nappeal but then appeals and does not address the appeal waiver in\n\nhis appellate brief, \"he forfeits any right to contend either that\n\nthe waiver should not be enforced or that it does not apply.\"\n\nUnited States v. Miliano, 480 F.3d 605, 607 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nRosario's appeal \"is subject to dismissal for this reason alone.\"\n\nId. at 608.\n\n          Moreover, even if we were to overlook the appeal waiver\n\nand Rosario's failure to address it, his appellate arguments would\n\nbe deemed waived because they are not adequately developed. United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).    Both arguments\n\nare made only in a conclusory fashion, primarily in the summary of\n\nargument and argument headings; and no attempt is made to apply the\n\ngenerally stated legal principles to the facts.    Such briefing is\n\npatently insufficient to warrant appellate review.    United States\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fv. Martí-Lón, 524 F.3d 295, 299 n.2 (1st Cir. 2008); Casillas-Díaz\n\nv. Palau, 463 F.3d 77, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n             Like Rosario, Pérez waived his right to appeal the\n\n\"judgment and sentence\" if the district court \"accept[ed] [his\n\nplea] agreement and sentence[d] him according to its terms and\n\nconditions.\"     However, unlike Rosario, Pérez does not entirely\n\nignore the appeal waiver in his appellate brief.            He repeatedly\n\nmentions the waiver in the context of arguing that his plea was\n\nunknowing.     Nevertheless, he does not address the waiver's effect\n\non his right to appeal.      So, it could be argued that Pérez's appeal\n\nshould also be dismissed under Miliano.           The real difference is\n\nthat   the   government,    in   its   brief,   affirmatively    waived   any\n\nargument that the appeal waiver bars Pérez's appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's failure to vacate his guilty plea.             We therefore\n\nproceed to consider the merits of Pérez's appeal.\n\n             On the merits, Pérez's sole argument is that the district\n\ncourt erred in not considering his statements at sentencing as a\n\nrequest to withdraw his plea and in not granting that request.             If\n\na defendant moves to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing and\n\nthe district court denies the motion, that denial is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion.       United States v. Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d 1, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).    However, if a defendant does not move to withdraw\n\nhis guilty plea before sentencing, he cannot mount an appellate\n\nchallenge to the district court's failure to allow him to do so.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fUnited States v. Pimentel, 2008 WL 3866732, at *4 (1st Cir. Aug.\n\n21, 2008).    Here, Pérez filed no motion to withdraw his guilty plea\n\nbefore sentencing.     Moreover, the district court was not required\n\nto treat Pérez's various questions about the plea agreement and the\n\npresentence report during the sentencing hearing as a request to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea. This is particularly so because when the\n\ncourt stated its belief that Pérez was not seeking to withdraw his\n\nplea, neither Pérez nor his counsel said anything to the contrary.1\n\nAccordingly, Pérez's claim that the district court should have\n\nallowed him to withdraw his plea fails under Pimentel.\n\n             The   district   court's   judgments   in   both   cases   are\n\naffirmed.     See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      We note parenthetically that, even if we were inclined to\nview what happened at sentencing as a denial of a request to\nwithdraw the plea, such a denial would not be an abuse of\ndiscretion. This conclusion derives from the timing of the request\n(on the day of sentencing, more than three months after the plea\nwas accepted) and the lack of any claim of actual innocence. See\nUnited States v. Sousa, 468 F.3d 42, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                    -6-\n\f",
