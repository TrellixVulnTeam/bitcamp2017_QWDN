O'Connor, Assistant Director, and Joseph D. Hardy, Trial\nAttorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                            May 21, 2010\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.    The petitioner, Luiz Carlos Vaz\n\ndos Reis, a Brazilian national, seeks judicial review of an order\n\nof the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed the\n\ndenial by an immigration judge (IJ) of his motion to reopen removal\n\nproceedings. The petitioner asserts that he did not receive notice\n\nof a scheduled hearing before the IJ; that the IJ erred by refusing\n\nto rescind the ensuing in absentia removal order and reopen his\n\ncase; and that the BIA compounded the error by improvidently\n\nupholding the IJ's order.      Discerning no misuse of the agency's\n\nconsiderable discretion in such matters, we deny the petition.\n\n            The facts are uncomplicated.       On July 9, 1999, the\n\npetitioner, his wife, and their minor son tried to enter the United\n\nStates using an invalid visa.       They were taken into custody and\n\ndetained.\n\n            A credible fear interview took place on July 15, 1999.\n\nThe interviewer thought the petitioner credible, but nevertheless\n\nissued a notice directing him to appear in the immigration court in\n\nMiami, Florida.    Two days later, immigration officials paroled the\n\npetitioner into the United States.\n\n            The   petitioner   settled   temporarily   in   Framingham,\n\nMassachusetts, and moved successfully to transfer his case to\n\nBoston.     On December 16, 1999, he filed a change-of-address form\n\nwith the immigration court. The form recounted that the petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fhad moved to 10 Locust Avenue, Southampton, New York.      The removal\n\nproceedings remained before the immigration court in Boston.1\n\n            The petitioner, through counsel, filed an application for\n\nasylum and other relief, which became part and parcel of the\n\nremoval proceedings.    On March 27, 2000, the petitioner's lawyer\n\nwithdrew.   The petitioner retained successor counsel in the person\n\nof Attorney James C. Dragon, who filed an appearance on his behalf.\n\nAll   notices   and   correspondence   from   the   immigration   court\n\nthereafter were sent to Dragon at the office address stipulated on\n\nhis entry-of-appearance form.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).\n\n            The IJ scheduled a hearing in the petitioner's case for\n\nJuly 6, 2000.    The immigration court gave written notice of the\n\nhearing to Dragon, as the petitioner's counsel. Because the notice\n\ncontained an incorrect date, the case had to be rescheduled.\n\n            On August 17, 2000, the immigration court mailed a new\n\nnotice to Dragon, informing him that the hearing would take place\n\non September 28, 2000.     The petitioner alleges that Dragon spoke\n\nonly with the petitioner's wife (now his ex-wife) and never told\n\nhim about the newly scheduled hearing.        The petitioner further\n\nalleges that, due to marital discord, his wife misled him, stating\n\nthat the hearing was to take place on October 28, 2000.      No notice\n\n\n\n      1\n       The petitioner's wife and son were parties to these\nproceedings, but their cases were severed from the petitioner's\nafter marital difficulties arose.  The petitioner and his wife\ndivorced on April 24, 2001.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fof the September 28 hearing was sent by the court directly to the\n\npetitioner.\n\n          On the appointed date — September 28, 2000 — Dragon\n\nattended the hearing.     The petitioner did not appear.     The IJ\n\nallowed Dragon to withdraw as counsel for the petitioner and\n\nordered the petitioner removed.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A).\n\nAccording to the petitioner, his wife told him about the in\n\nabsentia removal order no later than October 28, 2000.\n\n          For aught that appears, immigration officials did very\n\nlittle to follow up on the removal order, and almost eight years\n\npassed.   On March 14, 2008, the petitioner moved to reopen the\n\nremoval proceedings and rescind the order. He premised this motion\n\non a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, averring that\n\nDragon had neglected to inform him of the date and time of the\n\npivotal hearing.\n\n          The government opposed the motion.      The IJ deemed the\n\nmotion untimely; the petitioner, by his own admission, had known of\n\nthe removal order since the fall of 2000, yet had not taken any\n\nsteps to vacate it during the intervening years.\n\n          The petitioner appealed to the BIA, positing that the IJ\n\nhad abused her discretion in denying the motion.      The BIA upheld\n\nthe IJ's decision.      It ruled that notice to the petitioner's\n\nattorney of record qualified as notice to the petitioner.      See 8\n\nC.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a). The BIA also observed that the\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fpetitioner's eight-year delay in moving to reopen demonstrated a\n\nlack of due diligence.       This timely petition for judicial review\n\nfollowed.\n\n              We review decisions to grant or deny motions to reopen\n\nfor abuse of discretion.     INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992);\n\nJupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 490 (1st Cir. 2005).              This\n\nstandard is not monolithic. Within it, we will uphold the agency's\n\nsubsidiary findings of fact as long as they are supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence; we will assay embedded legal conclusions de\n\nnovo; and we will review judgment calls for abuse of discretion,\n\nsimpliciter.     Radkov v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 96, 98 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nA material error of law constitutes a per se abuse of discretion.\n\nId.\n\n              When proceedings are pending in the immigration court,\n\nthe affected alien must provide the court with a written record of\n\nhis current address and must furnish a written update whenever a\n\nchange   in    address   occurs.   8   U.S.C.   §   1229(a)(1)(F).    The\n\nimmigration court has a parallel set of obligations.           The basic\n\nnotice requirement for removal proceedings is that \"written notice\n\n. . . shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal\n\nservice is not practicable, through service by mail to the alien or\n\nto the alien's counsel of record).\"      Id. § 1229(a)(1).   The BIA has\n\nheld that personal service is deemed impracticable when the alien\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fis not physically present in the immigration court.             See In re\n\nGrijalva, 21 I. & N. Dec. 27, 35 (BIA 1995).\n\n           If there is any change in either the time or place of a\n\nscheduled hearing, the court must give written notice to the alien\n\neither personally or through service by mail on the alien or his\n\ncounsel of record.     8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2)(A).           An applicable\n\nregulation glosses these basic notice requirements. The regulation\n\ndirects that any time notice to a represented alien is required,\n\nthe notice shall be served on the alien's attorney of record.            8\n\nC.F.R. § 1292.5(a).\n\n           Assuming proper notice, a failure to appear at a removal\n\nhearing can have dire consequences.      In particular, such a failure\n\ncan ground an in absentia removal order against the non-appearing\n\nalien.    8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A).      Once an in absentia removal\n\norder becomes final, it can be rescinded only if the alien can show\n\nthat either (i) his failure to appear was due to exceptional\n\ncircumstances, or (ii) no proper notice was furnished to him.2         Id.\n\n§   1229a(b)(5)(C).   A   motion   to    reopen   based   on   exceptional\n\ncircumstances must be made within 180 days of the entry of the\n\nfinal order of removal.     See id. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); see also\n\nBeltre-Véloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 2008).                In\n\n\n      2\n       Removal proceedings also can be reopened and an order of\nremoval rescinded if the alien can show that he was in federal or\nstate custody at the critical time, and that his failure to appear\nwas through no fault of his own. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).\nThis potential avenue of relief is not implicated here.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fcontrast, there is no fixed time limit for making a motion to\n\nreopen based on lack of notice. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii);\n\nsee also Shah v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2008); Aragón-\n\nMunoz v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 2008).             We discuss\n\nthese two avenues to reopening in sequence.\n\n            The centerpiece of the petitioner's argument is his\n\nassertion that his lawyer, Dragon, did not effectively assist him.\n\nIneffective assistance of counsel during removal proceedings may\n\ncomprise an exceptional circumstance. See, e.g., Beltre-Véloz, 533\n\nF.3d at 10; Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).                A\n\nmotion    to   reopen    based   on   exceptional    circumstances   is   an\n\nappropriate way for an alien who is subject to an in absentia order\n\nof removal to raise such a claim.           Beltre-Véloz, 533 F.3d at 10.\n\n            Here, however, the petitioner has flatly disclaimed any\n\nreliance on the exceptional circumstances construct.          See Petr.'s\n\nBr. 27.   When a party disavows a particular theory of the case, it\n\nis not an appellate court's proper role to make the disavowed\n\nargument for him.       See, e.g., United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27,\n\n30 & n.3 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that issues not briefed on appeal\n\nare waived); United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (warning that courts should not be expected to \"do counsel's\n\nwork\").\n\n            We hasten to add that, even if the petitioner had not\n\nforegone exceptional circumstances as a ground for reopening, his\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fprospects would not be enhanced.              As we have said, a motion to\n\nreopen based on a claim of exceptional circumstances must be filed\n\nwithin 180 days of the entry of the final order of removal.                  8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).         The petitioner first moved to reopen\n\nnearly eight years after the entry of the removal order — long past\n\nthe 180-day deadline.         Accordingly, he would be time-barred from\n\nseeking to reopen on the basis of exceptional circumstances.3\n\n               This leaves the absence of notice as the only path to\n\nreopening that conceivably might be available to the petitioner.\n\nSeeking to travel this path, he strives to persuade us that his\n\nlawyer's ineffectiveness led to a lack of notice of the scheduled\n\nhearing; that this lack of notice caused his non-appearance (and,\n\nthus,       triggered   the   in   absentia    removal   order);   and   that,\n\ntherefore, the IJ should have allowed him to reopen.               We are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n               We need not tarry.      The petitioner's argument that he\n\nlacked notice assumes that \"notice\" and \"personal knowledge\" are\n\none and the same.       But that assumption is contradicted by the plain\n\n\n        3\n       Even though it is an open question whether the 180-day\nperiod may be extended through equitable tolling, see Guerrero-\nSantana v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 90, 93-94 (1st Cir. 2007), no such\nclaim is advanced here. For the sake of completeness, however, we\nnote that an alien's lack of due diligence ordinarily thwarts any\nattempt to invoke equitable tolling.      See, e.g., Fustaguio do\nNascimento v. Mukasey, 549 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 2008); Beltre-\nVéloz, 533 F.3d at 11. Given that the petitioner took no action\nfor many years after being told about the in absentia removal\norder, this principle would seemingly defeat any claim of equitable\ntolling.\n\n                                       -8-\n\flanguage of the relevant statute and regulation.                 We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n             In order for an alien to be entitled to reopen removal\n\nproceedings based on lack of notice, he must show, at a bare\n\nminimum, that he did not receive notice as provided in 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229(a).      For present purposes, the key provision of the statute\n\nis subparagraph (2), which instructs that, where personal service\n\nis impracticable, notice of any scheduling change should be served\n\nby mail in one of two ways: either on the alien or on his counsel\n\nof record.      Id. § 1229(a)(2)(A).   The plain language of the statute\n\nindicates that notice to an alien's counsel of record constitutes\n\nnotice to the alien.      See id.\n\n             The implementing regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a), drives\n\nthis    point    home.   It   provides    that   notice   of,   inter   alia,\n\nscheduling changes may be effected by service upon the alien's\n\n\"attorney or representative of record.\"          Id.\n\n             Courts have not hesitated to hold that both the statute\n\nand the regulation say what they mean and mean what they say.            See,\n\ne.g., Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488, 490 (7th Cir. 2005);\n\nScorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 412 (6th Cir. 2003); Garcia v. INS,\n\n222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir. 2000) (per curiam); Anin v. Reno, 188\n\nF.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam).             We are of that\n\nview.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f           The petitioner cannot surmount this barrier. He concedes\n\nthat Dragon was both his attorney of record and duly served with\n\nnotice of the hearing.        Given the tenor of the statute and the\n\nregulation, service on Dragon was in contemplation of law the\n\nequivalent   of   service   on   the   petitioner    himself.     Thus,   the\n\npetitioner has not shown a lack of notice sufficient, under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii), to justify reopening his removal\n\nproceedings.\n\n           In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\npetitioner asseverates that notice to his attorney of record did\n\nnot constitute notice to him because his attorney failed to alert\n\nhim to the hearing date.         But with respect to motions to reopen\n\nremoval proceedings, courts typically have treated ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel under the \"exceptional circumstances\" prong\n\nof the statute.    See, e.g., Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d\n\nCir. 2008) (holding that \"a lawyer's inaccurate advice to his\n\nclient   concerning   an    immigration    hearing   date   can   constitute\n\n'exceptional circumstances' excusing the alien's failure to appear\n\nat a deportation hearing\"); Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 937-38\n\n(9th Cir. 2003) (similar).\n\n           The petitioner's asseveration, refined to bare essence,\n\ninvites us to scrap this taxonomy and treat ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel — Dragon's failure to communicate with his client — as\n\nsomething other than an exceptional circumstance.           Accepting this\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\finvitation would require us, without rhyme or reason, to turn a\n\nblind eye to the relevant precedents.4              See, e.g., Fustaguio do\n\nNascimento v. Mukasey, 549 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 2008); Beltre-\n\nVéloz, 533 F.3d at 10.\n\n                 The sort of easy evasion proposed by the petitioner\n\nwould,      if    allowed,   seriously    compromise   the   180-day    deadline\n\nspecified by Congress in 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).                 We see no\n\njustification for taking so unprincipled a step.             Consequently, we\n\nhold that this easy evasion is not available to the petitioner.               An\n\nalien       cannot   skirt   the   statutory    180-day   deadline   simply   by\n\nrelabeling his claim as one based on lack of notice.\n\n                 We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe hold that there was no abuse of discretion involved in either\n\nthe IJ's denial of the petitioner's motion to reopen or the BIA's\n\naffirmance of that ruling.\n\n                 The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n        While the case law consistently treats ineffective\nassistance of counsel as an exceptional circumstance, only a\nhandful of unpublished decisions have dealt with the precise\nsituation in which, as here, notice was served only on an alien's\ncounsel of record and the alien claimed that he did not receive\nnotice because of counsel's failure to relay the information.\nWithout exception, those decisions have rejected the lack of notice\nclaim, concluding that the exceptional circumstances prong\nconstituted the exclusive avenue for recourse vis-à-vis ineffective\nassistance of counsel. See, e.g., Illescas-Pinos v. Holder, 351 F.\nApp'x 954, 957 (5th Cir. 2009); Simtion v. Gonzales, 233 F. App'x\n578, 580-81 (7th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                         -11-\n\f",

Hardy, Trial\nAttorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                            May 21, 2010\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.    The petitioner, Luiz Carlos Vaz\n\ndos Reis, a Brazilian national, seeks judicial review of an order\n\nof the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed the\n\ndenial by an immigration judge (IJ) of his motion to reopen removal\n\nproceedings. The petitioner asserts that he did not receive notice\n\nof a scheduled hearing before the IJ; that the IJ erred by refusing\n\nto rescind the ensuing in absentia removal order and reopen his\n\ncase; and that the BIA compounded the error by improvidently\n\nupholding the IJ's order.      Discerning no misuse of the agency's\n\nconsiderable discretion in such matters, we deny the petition.\n\n            The facts are uncomplicated.       On July 9, 1999, the\n\npetitioner, his wife, and their minor son tried to enter the United\n\nStates using an invalid visa.       They were taken into custody and\n\ndetained.\n\n            A credible fear interview took place on July 15, 1999.\n\nThe interviewer thought the petitioner credible, but nevertheless\n\nissued a notice directing him to appear in the immigration court in\n\nMiami, Florida.    Two days later, immigration officials paroled the\n\npetitioner into the United States.\n\n            The   petitioner   settled   temporarily   in   Framingham,\n\nMassachusetts, and moved successfully to transfer his case to\n\nBoston.     On December 16, 1999, he filed a change-of-address form\n\nwith the immigration court. The form recounted that the petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fhad moved to 10 Locust Avenue, Southampton, New York.      The removal\n\nproceedings remained before the immigration court in Boston.1\n\n            The petitioner, through counsel, filed an application for\n\nasylum and other relief, which became part and parcel of the\n\nremoval proceedings.    On March 27, 2000, the petitioner's lawyer\n\nwithdrew.   The petitioner retained successor counsel in the person\n\nof Attorney James C. Dragon, who filed an appearance on his behalf.\n\nAll   notices   and   correspondence   from   the   immigration   court\n\nthereafter were sent to Dragon at the office address stipulated on\n\nhis entry-of-appearance form.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).\n\n            The IJ scheduled a hearing in the petitioner's case for\n\nJuly 6, 2000.    The immigration court gave written notice of the\n\nhearing to Dragon, as the petitioner's counsel. Because the notice\n\ncontained an incorrect date, the case had to be rescheduled.\n\n            On August 17, 2000, the immigration court mailed a new\n\nnotice to Dragon, informing him that the hearing would take place\n\non September 28, 2000.     The petitioner alleges that Dragon spoke\n\nonly with the petitioner's wife (now his ex-wife) and never told\n\nhim about the newly scheduled hearing.        The petitioner further\n\nalleges that, due to marital discord, his wife misled him, stating\n\nthat the hearing was to take place on October 28, 2000.      No notice\n\n\n\n      1\n       The petitioner's wife and son were parties to these\nproceedings, but their cases were severed from the petitioner's\nafter marital difficulties arose.  The petitioner and his wife\ndivorced on April 24, 2001.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fof the September 28 hearing was sent by the court directly to the\n\npetitioner.\n\n          On the appointed date — September 28, 2000 — Dragon\n\nattended the hearing.     The petitioner did not appear.     The IJ\n\nallowed Dragon to withdraw as counsel for the petitioner and\n\nordered the petitioner removed.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A).\n\nAccording to the petitioner, his wife told him about the in\n\nabsentia removal order no later than October 28, 2000.\n\n          For aught that appears, immigration officials did very\n\nlittle to follow up on the removal order, and almost eight years\n\npassed.   On March 14, 2008, the petitioner moved to reopen the\n\nremoval proceedings and rescind the order. He premised this motion\n\non a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, averring that\n\nDragon had neglected to inform him of the date and time of the\n\npivotal hearing.\n\n          The government opposed the motion.      The IJ deemed the\n\nmotion untimely; the petitioner, by his own admission, had known of\n\nthe removal order since the fall of 2000, yet had not taken any\n\nsteps to vacate it during the intervening years.\n\n          The petitioner appealed to the BIA, positing that the IJ\n\nhad abused her discretion in denying the motion.      The BIA upheld\n\nthe IJ's decision.      It ruled that notice to the petitioner's\n\nattorney of record qualified as notice to the petitioner.      See 8\n\nC.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a). The BIA also observed that the\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fpetitioner's eight-year delay in moving to reopen demonstrated a\n\nlack of due diligence.       This timely petition for judicial review\n\nfollowed.\n\n              We review decisions to grant or deny motions to reopen\n\nfor abuse of discretion.     INS v.

The\n\nimmigration court has a parallel set of obligations.           The basic\n\nnotice requirement for removal proceedings is that \"written notice\n\n. . . shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal\n\nservice is not practicable, through service by mail to the alien or\n\nto the alien's counsel of record).\"      Id. § 1229(a)(1).   The BIA has\n\nheld that personal service is deemed impracticable when the alien\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fis not physically present in the immigration court.             See In re\n\nGrijalva, 21 I. & N. Dec. 27, 35 (BIA 1995).\n\n           If there is any change in either the time or place of a\n\nscheduled hearing, the court must give written notice to the alien\n\neither personally or through service by mail on the alien or his\n\ncounsel of record.     8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2)(A).           An applicable\n\nregulation glosses these basic notice requirements. The regulation\n\ndirects that any time notice to a represented alien is required,\n\nthe notice shall be served on the alien's attorney of record.            8\n\nC.F.R. § 1292.5(a).\n\n           Assuming proper notice, a failure to appear at a removal\n\nhearing can have dire consequences.      In particular, such a failure\n\ncan ground an in absentia removal order against the non-appearing\n\nalien.    8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A).      Once an in absentia removal\n\norder becomes final, it can be rescinded only if the alien can show\n\nthat either (i) his failure to appear was due to exceptional\n\ncircumstances, or (ii) no proper notice was furnished to him.2         Id.\n\n§   1229a(b)(5)(C).   A   motion   to    reopen   based   on   exceptional\n\ncircumstances must be made within 180 days of the entry of the\n\nfinal order of removal.     See id. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); see also\n\nBeltre-Véloz v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st Cir. 2008).                In\n\n\n      2\n       Removal proceedings also can be reopened and an order of\nremoval rescinded if the alien can show that he was in federal or\nstate custody at the critical time, and that his failure to appear\nwas through no fault of his own. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).\nThis potential avenue of relief is not implicated here.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fcontrast, there is no fixed time limit for making a motion to\n\nreopen based on lack of notice. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii);\n\nsee also Shah v.

We discuss\n\nthese two avenues to reopening in sequence.\n\n            The centerpiece of the petitioner's argument is his\n\nassertion that his lawyer, Dragon, did not effectively assist him.\n\nIneffective assistance of counsel during removal proceedings may\n\ncomprise an exceptional circumstance. See, e.g., Beltre-Véloz, 533\n\nF.3d at 10; Saakian v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199426\"><a href=\"/opinion/199426/saakian-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).                A\n\nmotion    to   reopen    based   on   exceptional    circumstances   is   an\n\nappropriate way for an alien who is subject to an in absentia order\n\nof removal to raise such a claim.           Beltre-Véloz, 533 F.3d at 10.\n\n            Here, however, the petitioner has flatly disclaimed any\n\nreliance on the exceptional circumstances construct.          See Petr.'s\n\nBr. 27.   When a party disavows a particular theory of the case, it\n\nis not an appellate court's proper role to make the disavowed\n\nargument for him.       See, e.g., United States v. Slade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n30 & n.3 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that issues not briefed on appeal\n\nare waived); United States v.

As we have said, a motion to\n\nreopen based on a claim of exceptional circumstances must be filed\n\nwithin 180 days of the entry of the final order of removal.                  8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).         The petitioner first moved to reopen\n\nnearly eight years after the entry of the removal order — long past\n\nthe 180-day deadline.         Accordingly, he would be time-barred from\n\nseeking to reopen on the basis of exceptional circumstances.3\n\n               This leaves the absence of notice as the only path to\n\nreopening that conceivably might be available to the petitioner.\n\nSeeking to travel this path, he strives to persuade us that his\n\nlawyer's ineffectiveness led to a lack of notice of the scheduled\n\nhearing; that this lack of notice caused his non-appearance (and,\n\nthus,       triggered   the   in   absentia    removal   order);   and   that,\n\ntherefore, the IJ should have allowed him to reopen.               We are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n               We need not tarry.      The petitioner's argument that he\n\nlacked notice assumes that \"notice\" and \"personal knowledge\" are\n\none and the same.       But that assumption is contradicted by the plain\n\n\n        3\n       Even though it is an open question whether the 180-day\nperiod may be extended through equitable tolling, see Guerrero-\nSantana v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202900\"><a href=\"/opinion/202900/guerrero-santana-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93-94 (1st Cir. 2007), no such\nclaim is advanced here. For the sake of completeness, however, we\nnote that an alien's lack of due diligence ordinarily thwarts any\nattempt to invoke equitable tolling.      See, e.g., Fustaguio do\nNascimento v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203576\"><a href=\"/opinion/203576/fustaguio-do-nascimento-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 2008); Beltre-\nVéloz, 533 F.3d at 11. Given that the petitioner took no action\nfor many years after being told about the in absentia removal\norder, this principle would seemingly defeat any claim of equitable\ntolling.\n\n                                       -8-\n\flanguage of the relevant statute and regulation.                 We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n             In order for an alien to be entitled to reopen removal\n\nproceedings based on lack of notice, he must show, at a bare\n\nminimum, that he did not receive notice as provided in 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229(a).      For present purposes, the key provision of the statute\n\nis subparagraph (2), which instructs that, where personal service\n\nis impracticable, notice of any scheduling change should be served\n\nby mail in one of two ways: either on the alien or on his counsel\n\nof record.      Id. § 1229(a)(2)(A).   The plain language of the statute\n\nindicates that notice to an alien's counsel of record constitutes\n\nnotice to the alien.      See id.\n\n             The implementing regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a), drives\n\nthis    point    home.   It   provides    that   notice   of,   inter   alia,\n\nscheduling changes may be effected by service upon the alien's\n\n\"attorney or representative of record.\"          Id.\n\n             Courts have not hesitated to hold that both the statute\n\nand the regulation say what they mean and mean what they say.

He concedes\n\nthat Dragon was both his attorney of record and duly served with\n\nnotice of the hearing.        Given the tenor of the statute and the\n\nregulation, service on Dragon was in contemplation of law the\n\nequivalent   of   service   on   the   petitioner    himself.     Thus,   the\n\npetitioner has not shown a lack of notice sufficient, under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii), to justify reopening his removal\n\nproceedings.\n\n           In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\npetitioner asseverates that notice to his attorney of record did\n\nnot constitute notice to him because his attorney failed to alert\n\nhim to the hearing date.         But with respect to motions to reopen\n\nremoval proceedings, courts typically have treated ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel under the \"exceptional circumstances\" prong\n\nof the statute.

Accepting this\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\finvitation would require us, without rhyme or reason, to turn a\n\nblind eye to the relevant precedents.4              See, e.g., Fustaguio do\n\nNascimento v.

We see no\n\njustification for taking so unprincipled a step.             Consequently, we\n\nhold that this easy evasion is not available to the petitioner.               An\n\nalien       cannot   skirt   the   statutory    180-day   deadline   simply   by\n\nrelabeling his claim as one based on lack of notice.\n\n                 We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe hold that there was no abuse of discretion involved in either\n\nthe IJ's denial of the petitioner's motion to reopen or the BIA's\n\naffirmance of that ruling.\n\n                 The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n        While the case law consistently treats ineffective\nassistance of counsel as an exceptional circumstance, only a\nhandful of unpublished decisions have dealt with the precise\nsituation in which, as here, notice was served only on an alien's\ncounsel of record and the alien claimed that he did not receive\nnotice because of counsel's failure to relay the information.\nWithout exception, those decisions have rejected the lack of notice\nclaim, concluding that the exceptional circumstances prong\nconstituted the exclusive avenue for recourse vis-à-vis ineffective\nassistance of counsel.
