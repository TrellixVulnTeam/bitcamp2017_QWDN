Morris E. Lasker,* U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                      Boudin, Farris,** and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Emanuel Howard for petitioner.\n     Annette C. Benedetto, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nBureau, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief,\nfor respondents.\n\n\n\n                              May 11, 2009\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n**\n     Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.         Stephen Pina was convicted of\n\nfirst-degree murder by a Massachusetts jury.              After direct and\n\ncollateral review in the state courts, he filed a petition for\n\nhabeas corpus review in federal district court, claiming among\n\nother allegations that his trial counsel was ineffective because he\n\nfailed to call an alibi witness.       The district court denied all of\n\nthe claims presented in Pina's habeas petition, concluding in\n\nparticular that habeas review of the ineffective assistance claim\n\nwas barred because Pina defaulted on the claim in state court\n\npursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule.\n\n           We granted a certificate of appealability on the question\n\nof whether Pina's competency claim is procedurally defaulted.\n\nAlthough we cannot endorse the district court's procedural default\n\nruling,   we   nevertheless   affirm      the   denial   of   Pina's   habeas\n\npetition, as the ineffective assistance of counsel claim plainly\n\nfails on the merits.\n\n                               I.    Facts\n\n           \"We take the facts as recounted by the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court decision affirming [Pina's] conviction,\n\nsupplemented with other record facts consistent with the SJC's\n\nfindings.\"     Yeboah-Sefah v. Ficco, 556 F.3d 53, 62 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(quotation omitted).\n\n           On February 26, 1993, Keith Robinson was murdered.            The\n\nmurder occurred around 9 p.m. and took place in a public area in\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fthe Mission Hill area of Boston, Massachusetts.   Robinson was shot\n\na number of times at close range.\n\n           After an investigation, the police arrested Pina for the\n\nmurder.    At his trial, the state called witnesses who:        (i)\n\ndeveloped Pina's potential motive for the murder, which related to\n\ndrug dealing; (ii) placed him at the murder scene on the day of the\n\nmurder; and (iii) identified Pina as the murderer.        Among the\n\nwitnesses called was police officer James O'Loughlin, who patrolled\n\nthe Mission Hill area and was familiar with Pina.        O'Loughlin\n\ntestified that on the day of the murder, he saw Pina in the area\n\nboth before and after the murder occurred.   He also testified that\n\ntwo days after the murder, Pina told him that although he may have\n\nbeen near the murder scene on the day of the murder, he was not the\n\nshooter.    Also testifying for the state were two persons who\n\nwitnessed the murder --     Tim Hall and Debra Rocher Annas.   Both\n\nidentified Pina as the shooter.    The jury found Pina guilty and he\n\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n                  II.   Post-Conviction Proceedings\n\n           Following Massachusetts state procedure, see Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 278, § 33E, Pina directly appealed his conviction to the\n\nSJC.   In his appeal, represented by new counsel, Pina advanced a\n\nhost of claims.   He did not, however, claim that his trial counsel\n\nprovided him ineffective assistance.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            After the SJC affirmed his conviction, Pina filed, pro\n\nse, a new trial motion.       Later, this time with the assistance of\n\ncounsel, he filed an addendum to this new trial motion.            In the\n\naddendum,    Pina   claimed   that   his   trial   counsel   provided   him\n\nineffective assistance because he failed to present an alibi\n\ndefense.     This defense would have relied on the testimony of\n\nTomorrow Vailes, Pina's fianceé at the time of trial. Pina claimed\n\nthat Vailes informed his counsel that she was willing to testify\n\nthat Pina was with her when Robinson was killed. Although included\n\non the trial witness list by Pina's counsel, Vailes was never\n\ncalled to testify.1\n\n            Although Pina identified Vailes as an alibi witness in\n\nthe addendum to the new trial motion, he failed to attach an\n\naffidavit detailing the substance of her proposed testimony.            The\n\ncourt relied on that omission in denying the motion.         With respect\n\nto the ineffective assistance claim, the court observed that,\n\nwithout an affidavit, \"the court cannot assess whether Vailes would\n\nhave provided an alibi for [Pina] at the time of the Robinson\n\nmurder.\"    The court also denied Pina a new trial based on the other\n\nclaims that he advanced in his new trial motion.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The portions of the state court record that have been provided\nto us do not contain any indication one way or the other whether\nthe prosecutor, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 14, requested that\nthe defendant file a pre-trial notice of alibi.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f              Subsequently, Pina petitioned a single gatekeeper justice\n\nof the SJC for leave to appeal the denial of his new trial motion\n\nto the full SJC.2     In his petition, Pina again argued, inter alia,\n\nthat his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to call\n\nVailes as an alibi witness.          The gatekeeper justice denied Pina's\n\npetition, stating with respect to the ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim:      \"I base my denial specifically on . . . the waiver\n\nof the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n\n              Pina then filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus   in    federal    district   court,   again   claiming   ineffective\n\nassistance based on his counsel's failure to call Vailes.            He also\n\nrequested an evidentiary hearing on this claim. The district court\n\nconcluded that Pina had procedurally defaulted this claim, based on\n\nthe fact that the single gatekeeper justice had ruled that the\n\nclaim was waived.        Consequently, the district court denied Pina's\n\nrequests for an evidentiary hearing and habeas relief, and this\n\nappeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   In a capital case where a new trial motion is denied after the\nSJC has affirmed the conviction on direct appeal, \"the petitioner\nmust apply to a single 'gatekeeper' justice of the SJC for leave to\nappeal to that court, and 'no appeal shall lie . . . unless the\nappeal is allowed by a single justice . . . on the ground that it\npresents a new and substantial question which ought to be\ndetermined by the full court.'\" Currie v. Matesanz, 281 F.3d 261,\n263 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, § 33E).\n\n                                       -5-\n\f                                  III.    Discussion\n\n             We review the district court's denial of habeas relief de\n\nnovo, Yeboah-Sefah, 556 F.3d at 65, and its decision to not hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.                     Teti v. Bender,\n\n507 F.3d 50, 60 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n             \"Habeas review in a federal court is available as to a\n\nclaim adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings, but\n\nonly   in   instances    affecting        or     involving      clearly    established\n\nfederal\" law.     Phoenix v. Matesanz, 189 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(quotations omitted); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).                        It follows\n\nthat where a state court has denied the claim on an independent and\n\nadequate    state-law    ground,         whether    procedural      or    substantive,\n\nfederal habeas review is barred, in the absence of some exceptions\n\nnot relevant here.       See id.; see also Cone v. Bell, No. 07-1114,\n\nslip. op. at 15-16, 556 U.S. ___ (April 28, 2009).\n\n                             A.   Procedural Default\n\n             The gatekeeper justice determined that Pina waived the\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.                     The initial question\n\nposed,    then,   is   whether      the    waiver      ground    relied    on   by   the\n\ngatekeeper constituted a procedural default that established an\n\nadequate and independent ground for the state court decision.                        See\n\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 736 (1991) (\"[F]ederal habeas\n\ncourts must ascertain for themselves if the petitioner is in\n\ncustody     pursuant    to    a    state       court   judgment     that    rests    on\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\findependent and adequate state grounds.\").    The focus here is on\n\nthe \"adequate\" component, as the gatekeeper \"clearly and expressly\"\n\nrelied on Pina's procedural default to dispose of the competency\n\nclaim.   See Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 266 (1989) (applying the\n\nrule that the state court judgment must clearly and expressly rest\n\non the prisoner's failure to comply with the state procedural rule\n\nto be considered sufficiently independent to bar habeas review)\n\n(citing Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1041 (1983)).3\n\n           The gatekeeper justice's summary treatment of Pina's\n\nineffective assistance claim stated only that, \"I base my denial\n\nspecifically on . . . the waiver of the defendant's claim of\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel.\"    The state argues that\n\nthere were two distinct procedural defaults; it contends that\n\neither one is an adequate ground to foreclose habeas review. These\n\nalleged procedural defaults are:   (i) Pina's failure to raise the\n\ncompetency claim in his direct appeal to the SJC and (ii) his\n\nfailure to comply with Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\n30(b) when he filed his new trial motion.4\n\n\n3\n   In addition to the waiver ruling, the single justice noted with\nrespect to the merits that trial counsel's decision not to call the\nalibi witness was a tactical one.\n4\n   Specifically, the state argues that Pina failed to comply with\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30(b) by not attaching to his new trial motion an\naffidavit detailing Vailes's proposed testimony.\n   Rule 30 encompasses all motions for post conviction relief,\nincluding motions for a new trial. Subsection (c)(3) of Rule 30\nprovides:\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f           An objective assessment of the record suggests that is it\n\nis likely that the gatekeeper justice considered Pina's competency\n\nclaim to be waived because he failed to raise it on direct appeal.\n\nThe state had argued waiver to the gatekeeper on that sole ground\n\n-- Pina's failure to file an ineffective assistance claim on direct\n\nappeal. The state never argued to the single justice that Pina had\n\nwaived his claim because he failed to attach an affidavit to his\n\nnew trial motion.       In context, the gatekeeper justice's waiver\n\ndetermination is better viewed as referring to Pina's failure to\n\nraise his competency claim on direct appeal.5\n\n           To be considered an \"adequate\" ground to bar habeas\n\nreview,   the   state   procedural    rule   that   is   the   basis   for   a\n\n\n     Affidavits.   Moving parties shall file and serve and\n     parties opposing a motion may file and serve affidavits\n     where appropriate in support of their respective\n     positions. The judge may rule on the issue or issues\n     presented by such motion on the basis of facts alleged in\n     the affidavits without further hearing if no substantial\n     issue is raised by the motion or affidavits.\n\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30(c)(3).\n5\n     Additionally, in the federal district court, the state\nrepresented that the gatekeeper's \"waiver\" ruling was based on\nPina's failure to pursue his competency claim on direct appeal. In\nits response to Pina's request that the district court hold an\nevidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance claim, the state\nclaimed that any evidentiary hearing would be futile because of\nPina's procedural default in state court.      In identifying the\nrelevant procedural default, the state wrote:        \"[T]he Single\nJustice . . . denied the gatekeeper petition on the ground inter\nalia that the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was\ndeemed 'waived' by the motion judge since it was not presented on\ndirect appeal and in the absence of any showing of ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel.\" (emphasis added).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fprocedural     default     ruling   must   be   regularly   and    consistently\n\nenforced by the state courts.           Gunter v. Maloney, 291 F.3d 74, 79\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); see also Smith v. Texas, 550 U.S. 297, 313 (2007)\n\n(using terms \"regularly applied and well-established\").\n\n              We are not persuaded that the procedural rule apparently\n\nrelied   on    by   the    gatekeeper   justice     has   been   regularly   and\n\nconsistently applied by the Massachusetts courts.                 Even in cases\n\nwhere an ineffective assistance claim may feasibly be raised on\n\ndirect appeal, such as cases in which the claim does not require\n\nadditional factual development, the SJC has declined to adopt an\n\niron-clad rule of waiver. Commonwealth v. Zinser, 847 N.E.2d 1095,\n\n1097 n.2 (Mass. 2006) (\"We do not decide whether a defendant waives\n\neven a claim of ineffective assistance resolvable on the trial\n\nrecord alone by failing to raise it on direct appeal.\").                And the\n\nSJC   has   stated    on   numerous     occasions   its   preference    that   a\n\ndefendant assert a competency claim in a motion for a new trial\n\nrather than on direct appeal.                 See, e.g., id. at 1096 n.1;\n\nCommonwealth v. Peloquin, 770 N.E.2d 440, 446 n.5                 (Mass. 2002);\n\nsee also Commonwealth v. McCormick, 717 N.E.2d 1029, 1031 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1999) (\"Both the Supreme Judicial Court and this court\n\nhave long and consistently observed that claims of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, at least in the first instance, should be\n\nadvanced in the context of a motion for a new trial.\") (citations\n\nomitted); cf. English v. Cody, 146 F.3d 1257 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f          Accordingly, we are not prepared to conclude that Pina\n\nprocedurally defaulted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n\nWe do not foreclose, however, the possibility based on further\n\ninsight into Massachusetts law that there are circumstances under\n\nwhich such claims may be viewed as procedurally defaulted when not\n\nraised on direct appeal.\n\n                            B.   Merits\n\n          Having decided the precise issue on which we allowed the\n\ncertificate of appealability, we could at this point remand this\n\ncase to the district court to permit it to analyze the merits of\n\nPina's competency claim.   See, e.g., Leyva v. Williams, 504 F.3d\n\n357 (3d Cir. 2007); Moormann v. Schriro, 426 F.3d 1044 (9th Cir.\n\n2005); St. Pierre v. Cowan, 217 F.3d 939 (7th Cir. 2000).       Doing\n\nso, however, would be a pointless exercise, given the record in\n\nthis case.\n\n          \"[W]e may affirm the district court's denial of habeas\n\nrelief on any ground made manifest by the record.\"           Pike v.\n\nGuarino, 492 F.3d 61, 71 (1st Cir. 2007) (citations omitted).     The\n\nrecord includes not only the facts necessary to decide this case,\n\nbut also Pina's habeas petition in which he argues the merits of\n\nhis ineffective assistance claim.       There is nothing to be gained\n\nthrough further development of the record or the arguments.\n\n          Although in some instances a claim that counsel was\n\nincompetent cannot be decided without evidence of counsel's own\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthinking, often the reasonableness of counsel's challenged actions\n\nis apparent from the face of the record, and many such claims are\n\nresolved on this basis.        Nor in this court has petitioner argued\n\nthat the district court needed to have an evidentiary hearing, a\n\nchoice that is often up to the district judge although constrained\n\nin some instances by statutory restrictions.             See 28 U.S.C. § 2254\n\n(e) (2);    Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 437 (2000).6\n\n            As we do not believe that the question whether there was\n\nineffective assistance in this case is a close one that would\n\nbenefit from layered judicial scrutiny, we will examine the merits\n\nof Pina's competency claim.        See Judd v. Haley, 250 F.3d 1308,\n\n1318-19 (11th Cir. 2001).         Although the gatekeeper did comment\n\nbriefly on the merits, for the sake of economy we will by-pass the\n\nthreshold question of whether there has been a state court merits\n\nadjudication.   In the absence of a state merits determination, the\n\nmore    deferential   habeas    review     under   the    Antiterrorism   and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act is inapplicable and our review is de\n\nnovo.    Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing\n\nFortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n\n\n\n6\n   Pina speculates that his counsel failed to call Vailes because\nhe had \"completely forgotten about [her].\" But Pina's addendum to\nhis new trial motion in state court effectively conceded that his\ncounsel -- who had in fact listed Vailes as a potential witness and\ncannot conceivably have \"forgotten\" about her -- had made a\nconsidered judgment not to call her.\n\n                                    -11-\n\f            To    establish   ineffective     assistance    of    counsel,     the\n\ndefendant must satisfy both a performance prong and a prejudice\n\nprong.   Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Malone\n\nv. Clarke, 536 F.3d 54, 63-64 (1st Cir. 2008).             Specifically, the\n\ndefendant must prove both (1) that counsel's performance fell below\n\nan objective standard of reasonableness (viz., \"that counsel made\n\nerrors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel'\n\nguaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\"); and (2) that\n\ncounsel's        deficient    performance      prejudiced        the     defense.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687-88.\n\n            In considering counsel's performance, we \"must indulge a\n\nstrong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide\n\nrange of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant\n\nmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the\n\nchallenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy.'\" Id.\n\nat 689 (citing Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101 (1955));\n\nSleeper v. Spencer, 510 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2007) (describing our\n\nreview of counsel's performance as \"highly deferential\").\n\n            Pina claims his counsel was deficient because he failed\n\nto call Vailes as an alibi witness during his trial.                   During the\n\ncollateral state court proceedings, Vailes provided an affidavit\n\ndetailing   the     substance   of   her    proposed   testimony.         In   the\n\naffidavit, she stated that Pina arrived at her apartment the day\n\nbefore the murder.      She also stated that when she left for school\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fon the morning of the day of the murder, Pina was in bed, and that\n\nwhen she returned to her apartment, he was still in bed and\n\nappeared never to have left.          Vailes further stated that Pina was\n\nwith her continuously at her apartment in Dorchester, Massachusetts\n\nfrom 1:30 p.m. on the day of the murder until the afternoon of the\n\nnext day.    The murder occurred in the Mission Hill area of Boston,\n\nMassachusetts during that window of time -- specifically, around\n\n9:00 p.m on February 26.            Pina's counsel met with Vailes before\n\ntrial and was aware both of her willingness to testify and what her\n\ntestimony would have entailed.             Although he placed Vailes on the\n\nwitness list, Pina's counsel chose to not call her.\n\n            \"[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of\n\nlaw   and   facts    relevant   to     plausible    options     are     virtually\n\nunchallengeable.\"         Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.           Because Pina\n\nconcedes    that    his   counsel    was   aware   of   both   Vailes    and   the\n\nsubstance of her proposed testimony, he faces a high hurdle in\n\nchallenging his counsel's performance.\n\n            Given the case put on by the state, Pina's counsel\n\nprovided effective assistance in choosing to forgo an alibi defense\n\nand instead to focus the defense on the issue of identification.\n\nIn its opening statement, the state told the jury that it would put\n\non a witness -- Officer O'Loughlin -- who would testify that on the\n\nday of the murder he saw Pina in the Mission Hill area both before\n\nand after the murder occurred and that Pina admitted to being in\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthe area on that day.       The state also told the jury that two\n\nwitnesses, Hall and Annas, would testify that they had witnessed\n\nthe murder and that Pina was the shooter.\n\n          As   represented,      the   state   called   these   witnesses.\n\nO'Loughlin testified that he observed Pina near the murder scene\n\nmere hours before the murder and that, immediately after the\n\nshooting, he witnessed an individual matching Pina's description\n\nfleeing the murder scene.     He also testified that two days after\n\nthe murder, Pina voluntarily visited him at the police station to\n\ndiscuss the investigation. Although Pina initially denied being in\n\nthe Mission Hill area on the day of the shooting, when O'Loughlin\n\ntold Pina that he had seen him there Pina replied, \"Maybe I was\n\nthere, but I didn't shoot anybody.\"\n\n          Although   the   two    eyewitnesses    called   by   the   state\n\ntestified generally as the state had claimed they would, their\n\naccounts of the murder were slightly varied.               In particular,\n\nalthough Hall testified that he had been standing within hand-shake\n\ndistance of the victim when he was murdered, the other eyewitness,\n\nAnnas, testified that she saw only one person near the victim --\n\nPina.   Additionally, Hall testified that Pina wore a red jacket\n\nwhereas Annas testified that Pina wore black or dark clothing.\n\n          Under these circumstances, counsel's decision to pursue\n\na defense of misidentification, rather than an alibi defense, can\n\nonly be viewed as a reasonable, tactical decision.               An alibi\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fdefense came with inherent risks.            Given that Pina was never\n\nscheduled to testify (nor has he alleged at any point that he was\n\nprepared to), the success or failure of the defense would have\n\nhinged almost solely on the testimony of a plainly interested\n\nwitness -- Vailes, who was Pina's fianceé at the time of trial.\n\nSee Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316 (1974) (\"The partiality of\n\na witness is subject to exploration at trial, and is always\n\nrelevant when discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of\n\nhis testimony.\").      As Vailes's testimony would have contradicted\n\nboth    Officer   O'Loughlin's   testimony   and    Pina's     own   effective\n\nadmission that he was in the Mission Hill area on the day of the\n\nshooting, it was certainly reasonable for trial counsel not to call\n\nVailes for fear she would not be believed.         See Horton, 370 F.3d at\n\n86-87 (concluding that counsel's decision not to call potential\n\nalibi    witnesses   was    \"legitimate   trial    strategy\"       because   the\n\n\"proposed testimony would have conflicted with [the defendant's]\n\nown version of events\").\n\n            A     defense     focused     solely     on      the     potential\n\nmisidentification of Pina as the murderer, on the other hand, was\n\nconsistent with Pina's presence at the scene on the day of the\n\nshooting and avoided potentially damaging contradictions.              It also\n\ncarried an added advantage:        it focused the jury's attention on\n\nweaknesses in the eyewitness testimony.              Both of the state's\n\neyewitnesses viewed the murder from close range yet they gave\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fslightly    varied       descriptions      of   the     shooter    and     arguably\n\nconflicting       accounts   of    the   murder   itself.         Pina's    counsel\n\nemphasized this during his closing argument.                   See Lema v. United\n\nStates, 987 F.2d 48, 54 (1st Cir. 1993) (concluding that where the\n\ngovernment's case was \"relatively weak . . . [r]easonably competent\n\ntrial counsel might well have determined that the best prospect for\n\nacquittal lay in discrediting the government's witnesses\").\n\n            In any event, even if reasonable minds could disagree\n\nabout what defense strategy would have been best in this case --\n\none premised on misidentification, alibi, or some combination\n\nthereof    --     \"the    proper    standard      for    [measuring]       attorney\n\nperformance is that of reasonably effective assistance,\" as guided\n\nby \"prevailing professional norms\" and consideration of \"all the\n\ncircumstances\" relevant to counsel's performance.

All   things    considered,       Pina's    counsel    provided\n\nreasonably effective assistance here.\n\n            The denial of Pina's habeas petition is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f",

Benedetto, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief, for respondents.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, FARRIS,<sup>[*]</sup> and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Stephen Pina was convicted of first-degree murder by a Massachusetts jury. After direct and collateral review in the state courts, he filed a petition for habeas corpus review in federal district court, claiming among other allegations that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to call an alibi witness. The district court denied all of the claims presented in Pina's habeas petition, concluding in particular that habeas review of the ineffective assistance claim was barred because Pina defaulted on the claim in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule.</p>\n<p>We granted a certificate of appealability on the question of whether Pina's competency claim is procedurally defaulted. Although we cannot endorse the district court's procedural default ruling, we nevertheless affirm the denial of Pina's habeas petition, as the ineffective assistance of counsel claim plainly fails on the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts</h2>\n<p>\"We take the facts as recounted by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision affirming [Pina's] conviction, supplemented with other record facts consistent with the SJC's findings.\" <i>Yeboah-Sefah v. Ficco,</i> 556 F.3d 53, 62 (1st Cir.2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>On February 26, 1993, Keith Robinson was murdered. The murder occurred around 9 p.m. and took place in a public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> area in the Mission Hill area of Boston, Massachusetts. Robinson was shot a number of times at close range.</p>\n<p>After an investigation, the police arrested Pina for the murder. At his trial, the state called witnesses who: (i) developed Pina's potential motive for the murder, which related to drug dealing; (ii) placed him at the murder scene on the day of the murder; and (iii) identified Pina as the murderer. Among the witnesses called was police officer James O'Loughlin, who patrolled the Mission Hill area and was familiar with Pina. O'Loughlin testified that on the day of the murder, he saw Pina in the area both before and after the murder occurred. He also testified that two days after the murder, Pina told him that although he may have been near the murder scene on the day of the murder, he was not the shooter. Also testifying for the state were two persons who witnessed the murder  Tim Hall and Debra Rocher Annas. Both identified Pina as the shooter. The jury found Pina guilty and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Post-Conviction Proceedings</h2>\n<p>Following Massachusetts state procedure, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, § 33E, Pina directly appealed his conviction to the SJC. In his appeal, represented by new counsel, Pina advanced a host of claims. He did not, however, claim that his trial counsel provided him ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p>After the SJC affirmed his conviction, Pina filed, pro se, a new trial motion. Later, this time with the assistance of counsel, he filed an addendum to this new trial motion. In the addendum, Pina claimed that his trial counsel provided him ineffective assistance because he failed to present an alibi defense. This defense would have relied on the testimony of Tomorrow Vailes, Pina's fianceé at the time of trial. Pina claimed that Vailes informed his counsel that she was willing to testify that Pina was with her when Robinson was killed. Although included on the trial witness list by Pina's counsel, Vailes was never called to testify.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Although Pina identified Vailes as an alibi witness in the addendum to the new trial motion, he failed to attach an affidavit detailing the substance of her proposed testimony. The court relied on that omission in denying the motion. With respect to the ineffective assistance claim, the court observed that, without an affidavit, \"the court cannot assess whether Vailes would have provided an alibi for [Pina] at the time of the Robinson murder.\" The court also denied Pina a new trial based on the other claims that he advanced in his new trial motion.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Pina petitioned a single gatekeeper justice of the SJC for leave to appeal the denial of his new trial motion to the full SJC.<sup>[2]</sup> In his petition, Pina again argued, inter alia, that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to call Vailes as an alibi witness. The gatekeeper <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> justice denied Pina's petition, stating with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim: \"I base my denial specifically on . . . the waiver of the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"</p>\n<p>Pina then filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, again claiming ineffective assistance based on his counsel's failure to call Vailes. He also requested an evidentiary hearing on this claim. The district court concluded that Pina had procedurally defaulted this claim, based on the fact that the single gatekeeper justice had ruled that the claim was waived. Consequently, the district court denied Pina's requests for an evidentiary hearing and habeas relief, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Discussion</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of habeas relief de novo, <i>Yeboah-Sefah,</i> 556 F.3d at 65, and its decision to not hold an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <i>Teti v. Bender,</i> 507 F.3d 50, 60 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>\"Habeas review in a federal court is available as to a claim adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings, but only in instances affecting or involving clearly established federal\" law. <i>Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> 189 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1999) (quotations omitted); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). It follows that where a state court has denied the claim on an independent and adequate <i>state-law</i> ground, whether procedural or substantive, federal habeas review is barred, in the absence of some exceptions not relevant here. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Cone v. Bell,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1769, 1779-80, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Procedural Default</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The gatekeeper justice determined that Pina waived the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The initial question posed, then, is whether the waiver ground relied on by the gatekeeper constituted a procedural default that established an adequate and independent ground for the state court decision. <i>See </i><i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> 501 U.S. 722, 736, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (\"[F]ederal habeas courts must ascertain for themselves if the petitioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on independent and adequate state grounds.\"). The focus here is on the \"adequate\" component, as the gatekeeper \"clearly and expressly\" relied on Pina's procedural default to dispose of the competency claim. <i>See </i><i>Harris v. Reed,</i> 489 U.S. 255, 266, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989) (applying the rule that the state court judgment must clearly and expressly rest on the prisoner's failure to comply with the state procedural rule to be considered sufficiently independent to bar habeas review) (citing <i>Michigan v. Long,</i> 463 U.S. 1032, 1041, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983)).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The gatekeeper justice's summary treatment of Pina's ineffective assistance claim stated only that, \"I base my denial specifically on . . . the waiver of the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\" The state argues that there were two distinct procedural defaults; it contends that either one is an adequate ground to foreclose habeas review. These alleged procedural defaults are: (i) Pina's failure to raise the competency claim in his direct appeal to the SJC and (ii) his failure to comply with Massachusetts Rule of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> Criminal Procedure 30(b) when he filed his new trial motion.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>An objective assessment of the record suggests that is it is likely that the gatekeeper justice considered Pina's competency claim to be waived because he failed to raise it on direct appeal. The state had argued waiver to the gatekeeper on that sole ground  Pina's failure to file an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal. The state never argued to the single justice that Pina had waived his claim because he failed to attach an affidavit to his new trial motion. In context, the gatekeeper justice's waiver determination is better viewed as referring to Pina's failure to raise his competency claim on direct appeal.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>To be considered an \"adequate\" ground to bar habeas review, the state procedural rule that is the basis for a procedural default ruling must be regularly and consistently enforced by the state courts. <i>Gunter v. Maloney,</i> 291 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also </i><i>Smith v. Texas,</i> 550 U.S. 297, 313, 127 S.Ct. 1686, 167 L.Ed.2d 632 (2007) (using terms \"regularly applied and well-established\").</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded that the procedural rule apparently relied on by the gatekeeper justice has been regularly and consistently applied by the Massachusetts courts. Even in cases where an ineffective assistance claim may feasibly be raised on direct appeal, such as cases in which the claim does not require additional factual development, the SJC has declined to adopt an iron-clad rule of waiver. <i>Commonwealth v. Zinser,</i> 446 Mass. 807, 847 N.E.2d 1095, 1097 n. 2 (2006) (\"We do not decide whether a defendant waives even a claim of ineffective assistance resolvable on the trial record alone by failing to raise it on direct appeal.\"). And the SJC has stated on numerous occasions its preference that a defendant assert a competency claim in a motion for a new trial rather than on direct appeal. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 1096 n. 1; <i>Commonwealth v. Peloquin,</i> 437 Mass. 204, 770 N.E.2d 440, 446 n. 5 (2002); <i>see also </i><i>Commonwealth v. McCormick,</i> 48 Mass.App.Ct. 106, 717 N.E.2d 1029, 1031 (1999) (\"Both the Supreme Judicial Court and this court have long and consistently observed that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, at least in the first instance, should be advanced in the context of a motion for a new trial.\") (citations omitted); <i>cf. </i><i>English v. Cody,</i> 146 F.3d 1257 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> Accordingly, we are not prepared to conclude that Pina procedurally defaulted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We do not foreclose, however, the possibility based on further insight into Massachusetts law that there are circumstances under which such claims may be viewed as procedurally defaulted when not raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Merits</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having decided the precise issue on which we allowed the certificate of appealability, we could at this point remand this case to the district court to permit it to analyze the merits of Pina's competency claim. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Leyva v. Williams,</i> 504 F.3d 357 (3d Cir.2007); <i>Moormann v. Schriro,</i> 426 F.3d 1044 (9th Cir.2005); <i>St. Pierre v. Cowan,</i> 217 F.3d 939 (7th Cir. 2000). Doing so, however, would be a pointless exercise, given the record in this case.</p>\n<p>\"[W]e may affirm the district court's denial of habeas relief on any ground made manifest by the record.\" <i>Pike v. Guarino,</i> 492 F.3d 61, 71 (1st Cir.2007) (citations omitted). The record includes not only the facts necessary to decide this case, but also Pina's habeas petition in which he argues the merits of his ineffective assistance claim. There is nothing to be gained through further development of the record or the arguments.</p>\n<p>Although in some instances a claim that counsel was incompetent cannot be decided without evidence of counsel's own thinking, often the reasonableness of counsel's challenged actions is apparent from the face of the record, and many such claims are resolved on this basis. Nor in this court has petitioner argued that the district court needed to have an evidentiary hearing, a choice that is often up to the district judge although constrained in some instances by statutory restrictions. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2); <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 420, 437, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>As we do not believe that the question whether there was ineffective assistance in this case is a close one that would benefit from layered judicial scrutiny, we will examine the merits of Pina's competency claim. <i>See </i><i>Judd v. Haley,</i> 250 F.3d 1308, 1318-19 (11th Cir.2001). Although the gatekeeper did comment briefly on the merits, for the sake of economy we will by-pass the threshold question of whether there has been a state court merits adjudication. In the absence of a state merits determination, the more deferential habeas review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act is inapplicable and our review is de novo. <i>Horton v. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p>To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must satisfy both a performance prong and a prejudice prong. <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <i>Malone v. Clarke,</i> 536 F.3d 54, 63-64 (1st Cir.2008). Specifically, the defendant must prove both (1) that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness (<i>viz.,</i> \"that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the `counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\"); and (2) that counsel's deficient performance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> prejudiced the defense. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p>In considering counsel's performance, we \"must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action `might be considered sound trial strategy.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (citing <i>Michel v. Louisiana,</i> 350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955)); <i>Sleeper v. Spencer,</i> 510 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2007) (describing our review of counsel's performance as \"highly deferential\").</p>\n<p>Pina claims his counsel was deficient because he failed to call Vailes as an alibi witness during his trial. During the collateral state court proceedings, Vailes provided an affidavit detailing the substance of her proposed testimony. In the affidavit, she stated that Pina arrived at her apartment the day before the murder. She also stated that when she left for school on the morning of the day of the murder, Pina was in bed, and that when she returned to her apartment, he was still in bed and appeared never to have left. Vailes further stated that Pina was with her continuously at her apartment in Dorchester, Massachusetts from 1:30 p.m. on the day of the murder until the afternoon of the next day. The murder occurred in the Mission Hill area of Boston, Massachusetts during that window of time  specifically, around 9:00 p.m. on February 26. Pina's counsel met with Vailes before trial and was aware both of her willingness to testify and what her testimony would have entailed. Although he placed Vailes on the witness list, Pina's counsel chose to not call her.</p>\n<p>\"[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Because Pina concedes that his counsel was aware of both Vailes and the substance of her proposed testimony, he faces a high hurdle in challenging his counsel's performance.</p>\n<p>Given the case put on by the state, Pina's counsel provided effective assistance in choosing to forgo an alibi defense and instead to focus the defense on the issue of identification. In its opening statement, the state told the jury that it would put on a witness  Officer O'Loughlin  who would testify that on the day of the murder he saw Pina in the Mission Hill area both before and after the murder occurred and that Pina admitted to being in the area on that day. The state also told the jury that two witnesses, Hall and Annas, would testify that they had witnessed the murder and that Pina was the shooter.</p>\n<p>As represented, the state called these witnesses. O'Loughlin testified that he observed Pina near the murder scene mere hours before the murder and that, immediately after the shooting, he witnessed an individual matching Pina's description fleeing the murder scene. He also testified that two days after the murder, Pina voluntarily visited him at the police station to discuss the investigation. Although Pina initially denied being in the Mission Hill area on the day of the shooting, when O'Loughlin told Pina that he had seen him there Pina replied, \"Maybe I was there, but I didn't shoot anybody.\"</p>\n<p>Although the two eyewitnesses called by the state testified generally as the state had claimed they would, their accounts of the murder were slightly varied. In particular, although Hall testified that he had been standing within hand-shake distance of the victim when he was murdered, the other eyewitness, Annas, testified that she saw only one person near the victim  Pina. Additionally, Hall testified that Pina wore a red jacket whereas Annas testified that Pina wore black or dark clothing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> Under these circumstances, counsel's decision to pursue a defense of misidentification, rather than an alibi defense, can only be viewed as a reasonable, tactical decision. An alibi defense came with inherent risks. Given that Pina was never scheduled to testify (nor has he alleged at any point that he was prepared to), the success or failure of the defense would have hinged almost solely on the testimony of a plainly interested witness  Vailes, who was Pina's fianceé at the time of trial. <i>See </i><i>Davis v. Alaska,</i> 415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974) (\"The partiality of a witness is subject to exploration at trial, and is always relevant when discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his testimony.\"). As Vailes's testimony would have contradicted both Officer O'Loughlin's testimony and Pina's own effective admission that he was in the Mission Hill area on the day of the shooting, it was certainly reasonable for trial counsel not to call Vailes for fear she would not be believed. <i>See </i><i>Horton,</i> 370 F.3d at 86-87 (concluding that counsel's decision not to call potential alibi witnesses was \"legitimate trial strategy\" because the \"proposed testimony would have conflicted with [the defendant's] own version of events\").</p>\n<p>A defense focused solely on the potential misidentification of Pina as the murderer, on the other hand, was consistent with Pina's presence at the scene on the day of the shooting and avoided potentially damaging contradictions. It also carried an added advantage: it focused the jury's attention on weaknesses in the eyewitness testimony. Both of the state's eyewitnesses viewed the murder from close range yet they gave slightly varied descriptions of the shooter and arguably conflicting accounts of the murder itself. Pina's counsel emphasized this during his closing argument. <i>See </i><i>Lema v. United States,</i> 987 F.2d 48, 54 (1st Cir.1993) (concluding that where the government's case was \"relatively weak . . . [r]easonably competent trial counsel might well have determined that the best prospect for acquittal lay in discrediting the government's witnesses\").</p>\n<p>In any event, even if reasonable minds could disagree about what defense strategy would have been best in this case  one premised on misidentification, alibi, or some combination thereof  \"the proper standard for [measuring] attorney performance is that of reasonably effective assistance,\" as guided by \"prevailing professional norms\" and consideration of \"all the circumstances\" relevant to counsel's performance. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As the Supreme Court has observed, \"[t]here are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. All things considered, Pina's counsel provided reasonably effective assistance here.</p>\n<p>The denial of Pina's habeas petition is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The portions of the state court record that have been provided to us do not contain any indication one way or the other whether the prosecutor, pursuant to Mass.

Laws ch. 278, § 33E).</p>\n<p>[3]  In addition to the waiver ruling, the single justice noted with respect to the merits that trial counsel's decision not to call the alibi witness was a tactical one.</p>\n<p>[4]  Specifically, the state argues that Pina failed to comply with Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(b) by not attaching to his new trial motion an affidavit detailing Vailes's proposed testimony.\n</p>\n<p>Rule 30 encompasses all motions for post conviction relief, including motions for a new trial. Subsection (c)(3) of Rule 30 provides:</p>\n<p>Affidavits. Moving parties shall file and serve and parties opposing a motion may file and serve affidavits where appropriate in support of their respective positions. The judge may rule on the issue or issues presented by such motion on the basis of facts alleged in the affidavits without further hearing if no substantial issue is raised by the motion or affidavits.</p>\n<p>Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(c)(3).</p>\n<p>[5]  Additionally, in the federal district court, the state represented that the gatekeeper's \"waiver\" ruling was based on Pina's failure to pursue his competency claim on direct appeal. In its response to Pina's request that the district court hold an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance claim, the state claimed that any evidentiary hearing would be futile because of Pina's procedural default in state court. In identifying the relevant procedural default, the state wrote: \"[T]he Single Justice . . . denied the gatekeeper petition on the ground <i>inter alia</i> that the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was deemed `waived' by the motion judge since it was <i>not presented on direct appeal</i> and in the absence of any showing of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\" (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[6]  Pina speculates that his counsel failed to call Vailes because he had \"completely forgotten about [her].\" But Pina's addendum to his new trial motion in state court effectively conceded that his counsel  who had in fact listed Vailes as a potential witness and cannot conceivably have \"forgotten\" about her  had made a considered judgment not to call her.</p>\n\n</div>",

Facts</h2>\n<p>\"We take the facts as recounted by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision affirming [Pina's] conviction, supplemented with other record facts consistent with the SJC's findings.\" <i>Yeboah-Sefah v.

The murder occurred around 9 p.m. and took place in a public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> area in the Mission Hill area of Boston, Massachusetts. Robinson was shot a number of times at close range.</p>\n<p>After an investigation, the police arrested Pina for the murder. At his trial, the state called witnesses who: (i) developed Pina's potential motive for the murder, which related to drug dealing; (ii) placed him at the murder scene on the day of the murder; and (iii) identified Pina as the murderer. Among the witnesses called was police officer James O'Loughlin, who patrolled the Mission Hill area and was familiar with Pina. O'Loughlin testified that on the day of the murder, he saw Pina in the area both before and after the murder occurred. He also testified that two days after the murder, Pina told him that although he may have been near the murder scene on the day of the murder, he was not the shooter. Also testifying for the state were two persons who witnessed the murder  Tim Hall and Debra Rocher Annas. Both identified Pina as the shooter. The jury found Pina guilty and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Post-Conviction Proceedings</h2>\n<p>Following Massachusetts state procedure, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, § 33E, Pina directly appealed his conviction to the SJC. In his appeal, represented by new counsel, Pina advanced a host of claims. He did not, however, claim that his trial counsel provided him ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p>After the SJC affirmed his conviction, Pina filed, pro se, a new trial motion. Later, this time with the assistance of counsel, he filed an addendum to this new trial motion. In the addendum, Pina claimed that his trial counsel provided him ineffective assistance because he failed to present an alibi defense. This defense would have relied on the testimony of Tomorrow Vailes, Pina's fianceé at the time of trial. Pina claimed that Vailes informed his counsel that she was willing to testify that Pina was with her when Robinson was killed. Although included on the trial witness list by Pina's counsel, Vailes was never called to testify.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Although Pina identified Vailes as an alibi witness in the addendum to the new trial motion, he failed to attach an affidavit detailing the substance of her proposed testimony. The court relied on that omission in denying the motion. With respect to the ineffective assistance claim, the court observed that, without an affidavit, \"the court cannot assess whether Vailes would have provided an alibi for [Pina] at the time of the Robinson murder.\" The court also denied Pina a new trial based on the other claims that he advanced in his new trial motion.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Pina petitioned a single gatekeeper justice of the SJC for leave to appeal the denial of his new trial motion to the full SJC.<sup>[2]</sup> In his petition, Pina again argued, inter alia, that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to call Vailes as an alibi witness. The gatekeeper <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> justice denied Pina's petition, stating with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim: \"I base my denial specifically on . . . the waiver of the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"</p>\n<p>Pina then filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, again claiming ineffective assistance based on his counsel's failure to call Vailes. He also requested an evidentiary hearing on this claim. The district court concluded that Pina had procedurally defaulted this claim, based on the fact that the single gatekeeper justice had ruled that the claim was waived. Consequently, the district court denied Pina's requests for an evidentiary hearing and habeas relief, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Discussion</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of habeas relief de novo, <i>Yeboah-Sefah,</i> 556 F.3d at 65, and its decision to not hold an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <i>Teti v.

It follows that where a state court has denied the claim on an independent and adequate <i>state-law</i> ground, whether procedural or substantive, federal habeas review is barred, in the absence of some exceptions not relevant here. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Cone v. Bell,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145883\"><a href=\"/opinion/145883/cone-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The initial question posed, then, is whether the waiver ground relied on by the gatekeeper constituted a procedural default that established an adequate and independent ground for the state court decision. <i>See </i><i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 736, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span> (1991) (\"[F]ederal habeas courts must ascertain for themselves if the petitioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on independent and adequate state grounds.\"). The focus here is on the \"adequate\" component, as the gatekeeper \"clearly and expressly\" relied on Pina's procedural default to dispose of the competency claim. <i>See </i><i>Harris v. Reed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112205\"><a href=\"/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 266, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112205\"><a href=\"/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span> (1983)).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The gatekeeper justice's summary treatment of Pina's ineffective assistance claim stated only that, \"I base my denial specifically on . . . the waiver of the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\" The state argues that there were two distinct procedural defaults; it contends that either one is an adequate ground to foreclose habeas review. These alleged procedural defaults are: (i) Pina's failure to raise the competency claim in his direct appeal to the SJC and (ii) his failure to comply with Massachusetts Rule of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> Criminal Procedure 30(b) when he filed his new trial motion.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>An objective assessment of the record suggests that is it is likely that the gatekeeper justice considered Pina's competency claim to be waived because he failed to raise it on direct appeal. The state had argued waiver to the gatekeeper on that sole ground  Pina's failure to file an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal. The state never argued to the single justice that Pina had waived his claim because he failed to attach an affidavit to his new trial motion. In context, the gatekeeper justice's waiver determination is better viewed as referring to Pina's failure to raise his competency claim on direct appeal.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>To be considered an \"adequate\" ground to bar habeas review, the state procedural rule that is the basis for a procedural default ruling must be regularly and consistently enforced by the state courts. <i>Gunter v. Maloney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199936\"><a href=\"/opinion/199936/gunter-v-maloney/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also </i><i>Smith v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span> (2007) (using terms \"regularly applied and well-established\").</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded that the procedural rule apparently relied on by the gatekeeper justice has been regularly and consistently applied by the Massachusetts courts. Even in cases where an ineffective assistance claim may feasibly be raised on direct appeal, such as cases in which the claim does not require additional factual development, the SJC has declined to adopt an iron-clad rule of waiver. <i>Commonwealth v. Zinser,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></span>, 1097 n. 2 (2006) (\"We do not decide whether a defendant waives even a claim of ineffective assistance resolvable on the trial record alone by failing to raise it on direct appeal.\"). And the SJC has stated on numerous occasions its preference that a defendant assert a competency claim in a motion for a new trial rather than on direct appeal. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 1096 n. 1; <i>Commonwealth v. Peloquin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></span>, 446 n. 5 (2002); <i>see also </i><i>Commonwealth v.

We do not foreclose, however, the possibility based on further insight into Massachusetts law that there are circumstances under which such claims may be viewed as procedurally defaulted when not raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Merits</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having decided the precise issue on which we allowed the certificate of appealability, we could at this point remand this case to the district court to permit it to analyze the merits of Pina's competency claim. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Leyva v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1429796\"><a href=\"/opinion/1429796/leyva-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span> (3d Cir.2007); <i>Moormann v.

Doing so, however, would be a pointless exercise, given the record in this case.</p>\n<p>\"[W]e may affirm the district court's denial of habeas relief on any ground made manifest by the record.\" <i>Pike v. Guarino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202832\"><a href=\"/opinion/202832/pike-v-guarino/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.2007) (citations omitted). The record includes not only the facts necessary to decide this case, but also Pina's habeas petition in which he argues the merits of his ineffective assistance claim. There is nothing to be gained through further development of the record or the arguments.</p>\n<p>Although in some instances a claim that counsel was incompetent cannot be decided without evidence of counsel's own thinking, often the reasonableness of counsel's challenged actions is apparent from the face of the record, and many such claims are resolved on this basis. Nor in this court has petitioner argued that the district court needed to have an evidentiary hearing, a choice that is often up to the district judge although constrained in some instances by statutory restrictions. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2); <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>As we do not believe that the question whether there was ineffective assistance in this case is a close one that would benefit from layered judicial scrutiny, we will examine the merits of Pina's competency claim. <i>See </i><i>Judd v. Haley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773378\"><a href=\"/opinion/773378/ernest-randy-judd-v-michael-w-haley-commissioner-alabama-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span>, 1318-19 (11th Cir.2001). Although the gatekeeper did comment briefly on the merits, for the sake of economy we will by-pass the threshold question of whether there has been a state court merits adjudication. In the absence of a state merits determination, the more deferential habeas review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act is inapplicable and our review is de novo. <i>Horton v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201031\"><a href=\"/opinion/201031/horton-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Fortini v.

The murder occurred in the Mission Hill area of Boston, Massachusetts during that window of time  specifically, around 9:00 p.m. on February 26.

Because Pina concedes that his counsel was aware of both Vailes and the substance of her proposed testimony, he faces a high hurdle in challenging his counsel's performance.</p>\n<p>Given the case put on by the state, Pina's counsel provided effective assistance in choosing to forgo an alibi defense and instead to focus the defense on the issue of identification. In its opening statement, the state told the jury that it would put on a witness  Officer O'Loughlin  who would testify that on the day of the murder he saw Pina in the Mission Hill area both before and after the murder occurred and that Pina admitted to being in the area on that day. The state also told the jury that two witnesses, Hall and Annas, would testify that they had witnessed the murder and that Pina was the shooter.</p>\n<p>As represented, the state called these witnesses. O'Loughlin testified that he observed Pina near the murder scene mere hours before the murder and that, immediately after the shooting, he witnessed an individual matching Pina's description fleeing the murder scene. He also testified that two days after the murder, Pina voluntarily visited him at the police station to discuss the investigation. Although Pina initially denied being in the Mission Hill area on the day of the shooting, when O'Loughlin told Pina that he had seen him there Pina replied, \"Maybe I was there, but I didn't shoot anybody.\"</p>\n<p>Although the two eyewitnesses called by the state testified generally as the state had claimed they would, their accounts of the murder were slightly varied. In particular, although Hall testified that he had been standing within hand-shake distance of the victim when he was murdered, the other eyewitness, Annas, testified that she saw only one person near the victim  Pina. Additionally, Hall testified that Pina wore a red jacket whereas Annas testified that Pina wore black or dark clothing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> Under these circumstances, counsel's decision to pursue a defense of misidentification, rather than an alibi defense, can only be viewed as a reasonable, tactical decision. An alibi defense came with inherent risks. Given that Pina was never scheduled to testify (nor has he alleged at any point that he was prepared to), the success or failure of the defense would have hinged almost solely on the testimony of a plainly interested witness  Vailes, who was Pina's fianceé at the time of trial. <i>See </i><i>Davis v. Alaska,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 316, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (1974) (\"The partiality of a witness is subject to exploration at trial, and is always relevant when discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his testimony.\"). As Vailes's testimony would have contradicted both Officer O'Loughlin's testimony and Pina's own effective admission that he was in the Mission Hill area on the day of the shooting, it was certainly reasonable for trial counsel not to call Vailes for fear she would not be believed. <i>See </i><i>Horton,</i> 370 F.3d at 86-87 (concluding that counsel's decision not to call potential alibi witnesses was \"legitimate trial strategy\" because the \"proposed testimony would have conflicted with [the defendant's] own version of events\").</p>\n<p>A defense focused solely on the potential misidentification of Pina as the murderer, on the other hand, was consistent with Pina's presence at the scene on the day of the shooting and avoided potentially damaging contradictions. It also carried an added advantage: it focused the jury's attention on weaknesses in the eyewitness testimony. Both of the state's eyewitnesses viewed the murder from close range yet they gave slightly varied descriptions of the shooter and arguably conflicting accounts of the murder itself. Pina's counsel emphasized this during his closing argument. <i>See </i><i>Lema v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601483\"><a href=\"/opinion/601483/charles-d-lema-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.1993) (concluding that where the government's case was \"relatively weak . . . [r]easonably competent trial counsel might well have determined that the best prospect for acquittal lay in discrediting the government's witnesses\").</p>\n<p>In any event, even if reasonable minds could disagree about what defense strategy would have been best in this case  one premised on misidentification, alibi, or some combination thereof  \"the proper standard for [measuring] attorney performance is that of reasonably effective assistance,\" as guided by \"prevailing professional norms\" and consideration of \"all the circumstances\" relevant to counsel's performance. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 688, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>. As the Supreme Court has observed, \"[t]here are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>. All things considered, Pina's counsel provided reasonably effective assistance here.</p>\n<p>The denial of Pina's habeas petition is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The portions of the state court record that have been provided to us do not contain any indication one way or the other whether the prosecutor, pursuant to Mass. R.Crim. P. 14, requested that the defendant file a pre-trial notice of alibi.</p>\n<p>[2]  In a capital case where a new trial motion is denied after the SJC has affirmed the conviction on direct appeal, \"the petitioner must apply to a single `gatekeeper' justice of the SJC for leave to appeal to that court, and `no appeal shall lie . . . unless the appeal is allowed by a single justice . . . on the ground that it presents a new and substantial question which ought to be determined by the full court.'\" <i>Currie v. Matesanz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199834\"><a href=\"/opinion/199834/currie-v-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2002) (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, § 33E).</p>\n<p>[3]  In addition to the waiver ruling, the single justice noted with respect to the merits that trial counsel's decision not to call the alibi witness was a tactical one.</p>\n<p>[4]  Specifically, the state argues that Pina failed to comply with Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(b) by not attaching to his new trial motion an affidavit detailing Vailes's proposed testimony.\n</p>\n<p>Rule 30 encompasses all motions for post conviction relief, including motions for a new trial. Subsection (c)(3) of Rule 30 provides:</p>\n<p>Affidavits. Moving parties shall file and serve and parties opposing a motion may file and serve affidavits where appropriate in support of their respective positions. The judge may rule on the issue or issues presented by such motion on the basis of facts alleged in the affidavits without further hearing if no substantial issue is raised by the motion or affidavits.</p>\n<p>Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(c)(3).</p>\n<p>[5]  Additionally, in the federal district court, the state represented that the gatekeeper's \"waiver\" ruling was based on Pina's failure to pursue his competency claim on direct appeal. In its response to Pina's request that the district court hold an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance claim, the state claimed that any evidentiary hearing would be futile because of Pina's procedural default in state court. In identifying the relevant procedural default, the state wrote: \"[T]he Single Justice . . . denied the gatekeeper petition on the ground <i>inter alia</i> that the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was deemed `waived' by the motion judge since it was <i>not presented on direct appeal</i> and in the absence of any showing of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\" (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[6]  Pina speculates that his counsel failed to call Vailes because he had \"completely forgotten about [her].\" But Pina's addendum to his new trial motion in state court effectively conceded that his counsel  who had in fact listed Vailes as a potential witness and cannot conceivably have \"forgotten\" about her  had made a considered judgment not to call her.</p>\n\n</div>",
