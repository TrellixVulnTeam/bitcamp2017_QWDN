Ramírez with whom John F. Nevares and John F.\nNevares & Associates, PSC were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                      January 12, 2006\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    Luz Olmeda, who holds degrees in\n\nlaw and economics, has been employed by the Puerto Rico Planning\n\nBoard for over twenty years.   The Board is a legislatively created\n\nagency of the Puerto Rico government, comprising part of the\n\ngovernor's office and endowed with a broad mandate in the field of\n\neconomic and social planning for Puerto Rico.   23 L.P.R.A. §§ 62a,\n\n62c.    Among other things, it is charged with crafting zoning and\n\nland use regulations, preparing long-term social and economic\n\ndevelopment plans, and advising the governor and legislature on\n\ngeneral planning and development issues.    Id. § 62j.\n\n           From 1995 to 2001, Olmeda held the position of Director\n\nof the Economic and Social Planning Program.        In 2000, a new\n\ngovernor representing the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") was\n\nelected, replacing a governor who belonged to the New Progressive\n\nParty (\"NPP\").   Olmeda, who is affiliated with the NPP, requested\n\nand was granted a transfer to the career position of Assistant\n\nPlanning Executive I; her transfer was made effective on July 1,\n\n2001.   Her salary was set at $3,591 per month plus a \"differential\"\n\nof $931 per month, granted because of her expertise.\n\n           According to Olmeda, after the election and upon assuming\n\nher new position, she was subjected to adverse action based on her\n\npolitical affiliation.    She says (in her present complaint) that\n\nshe was largely stripped of her duties, which were reassigned to an\n\nemployee of the Board affiliated with the PDP; that she was subject\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fto verbal abuse from two Board employees; that other officials\n\nfailed        to   respond      to    Olmeda's     complaints;    that     her   salary\n\ndifferential was eliminated after an audit asserted that she was\n\nnot entitled to it; and that in August 2002 she was transferred to\n\na new position as Acting Coordinator of the Office of Federal\n\nProposals of the Economic Analysis Subprogram.\n\n                On August 20, 2002, Olmeda filed this action, seeking\n\nseveral million dollars in actual and punitive damages under both\n\nsection 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000), and Puerto Rico law.                         The\n\nmain        federal    claim    was    for   political    discrimination.1          The\n\ndefendants included two successive heads of the Board who had been\n\nappointed by the new governor and several other employees said to\n\nhave participated in these wrongs either by action or, in failing\n\nto provide relief, by inaction.\n\n                After    initial      discovery,     including    a   deposition    of\n\nOlmeda, the defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that\n\nthey were entitled to qualified immunity (Olmeda also cross-moved\n\nfor    partial        summary     judgment    in   her   favor   on   her   political\n\ndiscrimination claims).               Defendants contended, inter alia, that\n\nunder        the      governing      case    law    on   the     federal     political\n\ndiscrimination claim, Olmeda's position was not one protected\n\n\n        1\n      Though Olmeda's complaint also made a passing reference to a\ndue process claim against the defendants, Olmeda has never\nexplained the nature of the claim, nor did she defend the claim\nwhen it was challenged by defendants in their motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n                                             -4-\n\fagainst politically motivated adverse action.           The district court\n\ndenied the defendants' motion (as well as Olmeda's cross-motion),\n\nsaying only that there were \"contested issues of material fact.\"\n\nThe defendants have now sought review in this court.\n\n           Qualified immunity doctrine protects government officers\n\nand employees from suit on federal claims for damages where, in the\n\ncircumstances,    a    reasonable   official    could   have    believed   his\n\nconduct was lawful.      Rodríguez-Rodríguez v. Ortiz-Vélez, 391 F.3d\n\n36, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).      The immunity is not merely from damages,\n\nbut (with some qualifications) from having to endure a trial. So--\n\nas a court-made exception to the final judgment rule--immediate\n\nappeals are permitted from such denials.          Id. at 39-40.\n\n           One wrinkle is that the Supreme Court has disallowed such\n\nan immediate appeal where the district court's denial of immunity\n\nrested   upon    its   determination--whether      right   or    wrong--that\n\nimmunity turned on a disputed issue of material fact.             Johnson v.\n\nJones, 515 U.S. 304, 319-20 (1995).            Yet, whatever the district\n\ncourt's reasoning, immediate appellate review is still permitted if\n\nimmunity is required as a matter of law regardless of how the\n\nfactual issue is resolved. Rodríguez-Rodríguez, 391 F.3d at 39-40.\n\n           In the present case, there may well be disputed factual\n\nissues as to whether Olmeda suffered significant adverse employment\n\naction and, if so, whether this was motivated at least in part by\n\nhostility to her political affiliation.          However, the defendants'\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fmain claim on appeal--that Olmeda's job is not constitutionally\n\nprotected against political discrimination--does not require that\n\nany disputed factual issue be decided.        To that extent, we have\n\njurisdiction to consider defendants' claim to immunity, regardless\n\nof the district court's own reasons for denying the motion.       Id. at\n\n40.\n\n           There is one more complication.          Although qualified\n\nimmunity requires merely that a reasonable official could believe\n\nthat his conduct was lawful, the Supreme Court has directed that\n\nthe qualified immunity inquiry itself begin by asking whether on\n\nthe facts alleged there is a constitutional violation at all.\n\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). Saucier's inversion has\n\nits own logic, see id., but it has the potential to cause problems\n\nwhere answering this first question in the abstract is difficult.\n\nSee Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't, 315 F.3d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n           A first amendment right to protection against political\n\ndiscrimination was recognized by the Supreme Court about thirty\n\nyears ago in Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), and Branti v.\n\nFinkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980).    See also Rutan v. Republican Party of\n\nIll., 497 U.S. 62 (1990).       Where improper motive is shown, the\n\nemployee   is   protected   against   significant   adverse   employment\n\naction-–this is a loose formulation--but the right exists only\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fwhere the job is one for which political affiliation is an improper\n\ncriterion.\n\n              Elrod     and   Branti     involved      employees     engaged   in\n\ncomparatively routine work, and protection was not extended to jobs\n\nfor   which    \"party    affiliation     is    an    appropriate    requirement.\"\n\nBranti,   445    U.S.    at   518.     Were    the    rule   otherwise,   no   new\n\nadministration would be able effectively to implement its own\n\npolicies.      The federal claim does not turn on whether a state has\n\nchosen    to    afford    civil      service    protection     to   a   job,   see\n\nRuiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127, 133 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), but on Branti's \"appropriateness\" requirement, which is\n\nextensively glossed in the case law in this circuit.\n\n              In a nutshell, protection does not extend to positions\n\nwhich potentially \"involve decision making on issues where there is\n\nroom for political disagreement on goals or their implementation\"\n\nand where the jobholder is a policymaker, confidential assistant,\n\nspokesman, or similar officeholder. Ortiz-Piñero v. Rivera-Arroyo,\n\n84 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted);\n\nsee also Flynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 44-45 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 961 (1998).               Actual functions of the\n\njob, not titles, control, id. at 44, and an official description of\n\njob functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining\n\nthose functions, Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves, 274 F.3d 4, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f           In this instance, there is a detailed official job\n\ndescription     for   Olmeda's      position.           Olmeda   alleged    no   facts\n\ncontradicting the description; indeed, at her deposition, she\n\nseemingly endorsed the description.               Once an understanding of the\n\nfunctions is ascertained, it is a question of law whether they\n\ninvoke constitutional protection.               Flynn, 140 F.3d at 44.         If not,\n\nOlmeda may have civil service or other protection under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw since she converted to a \"career\" position, but the Elrod and\n\nBranti   line   of    cases      does   not     apply    and   the   defendants     are\n\nprotected.\n\n           That the Board has policy involvement at the highest\n\nlevel is beyond dispute.            By statute, the Board is charged with\n\n\"guiding the integral development of Puerto Rico\" in order to best\n\npromote \"health, safety, order, coexistence, prosperity, defense,\n\nculture, economic stability and general welfare,\" in addition to\n\ncrafting     policies      for     \"the       process    of    development,\"       \"the\n\ndistribution     of   population,\"        \"the    use     of   land,\"    and   \"public\n\nimprovements.\"        23   L.P.R.A.       §    62c.      The   statute    spells    out\n\nextensive duties in analysis and coordination of other agencies.\n\nSee, e.g., id. §§ 62j, 62l.\n\n           This merely sets the stage.                   If Olmeda were a staff\n\ntypist or a receptionist, she would still likely be protected. Her\n\nduties are outlined in the official seven-page \"description of\n\nposition,\" which describes the \"essential duties\" of her position\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fas follows (the \"Program\" referred to in this list is \"Economic and\n\nSocial Planning\"; the \"Subprogram\" is \"Economic Analysis\"):\n\n          Plans, coordinates, directs, supervises and\n          evaluates the work of the personnel that\n          performs highly technical and specialized\n          studies related to the activities developed in\n          the Subprogram.\n\n          Gives guidance and advises the Director of the\n          Program and Subprogram on theoretical and\n          technical aspects related to the national\n          accounts and other jobs performed in the\n          subprogram.\n\n          Advises the Director of the Subprogram about\n          the implementation of public policy, law,\n          regulations, norms and procedures that are\n          applicable to the same.\n\n          Conducts meetings with the coordinators and\n          technical assistants of the Subprogram and\n          with its designated consultants, to discuss\n          and coordinate aspects of work planning with\n          amendments received in the Subprogram.\n\n          Participates in the preparation and analysis\n          of   different  special  missions  regarding\n          economic impact, news commentaries, special\n          Bills and others.\n\n          Represents the Board in committees, forums,\n          seminars, conferences and other activities\n          related to their field, as designated.\n\n          Analyzes, evaluates and issues opinions and\n          recommendations regarding reports, projects\n          and proposed laws and other documents that are\n          referred.\n\n          Studies,   analyzes    and  evaluates   norms,\n          regulations,    instructions    and    complex\n          situations related to activity field and\n          submits    reports    or   discusses    action\n          alternatives and specific recommendations with\n          Supervisor.\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f            Participates in the selection, training and\n            evaluation of designated personnel.\n\n            Welcomes visitors and officials from Puerto\n            Rico and other countries whenever required.\n\n            Establishes   contacts   with  public   and/or\n            private entities in order to coordinate issues\n            related to the job.\n\n            Helps prepare the economic Report for the\n            Governor and other publications prepared in\n            the Subprogram.\n\n            Participates in the preparation of the Budget\n            Petition and in the Subprogram work plan.\n\n            Prepares and submits periodic reports on the\n            work done to the Director of the Subprogram.\n\n            Represents   the   Board   in   public   and\n            administrative hearings where issues related\n            to the field of work are discussed, as\n            required.\n\n            Goes to training and development activities\n            and to meetings of orientation or discussion\n            of work plans, as required.\n\n            Does other duties as assigned.\n\n            The cases have not been able to come up with a terse\n\nformula or standard for describing policy-related positions that\n\nare outside the constitutional constraint.         Yet as we observed in\n\nFlynn, our circuit has \"regularly upheld against First Amendment\n\nchallenge the dismissal on political grounds of mid- or upper-level\n\nofficials    or   employees    who    are   significantly   connected   to\n\npolicy-making.\"    140 F.3d at 45.     \"[I]t is enough that the official\n\nbe involved in policy, even if only as an adviser, implementer, or\n\nspokesperson.\"    Id. at 46.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           Olmeda's job description makes clear that she is an\n\nofficial, that she is involved in policymaking at least as an\n\nadviser, and that she is expected on occasion to serve as a\n\nrepresentative     of     the   Board    itself.     Olmeda     emphasizes   her\n\ntechnical training and its utility in her job, and we accept that\n\nthis is so.      But an employee otherwise involved in policy is not\n\nprotected merely because the employee is \"guided in some . . .\n\nfunctions by professional or technical standards.\"               Id.\n\n           Olmeda's job description outlines a number of policy-\n\noriented duties: the occupant \"[a]nalyzes, evaluates and issues\n\nopinions   and    recommendations       regarding    reports,     projects   and\n\nproposed   laws     and    other    documents      that   are   referred\"    and\n\n\"[s]tudies, analyzes and evaluates norms, regulations, instructions\n\nand complex situations related to activity field and submits\n\nreports    or      discusses       action      alternatives     and    specific\n\nrecommendations with Supervisor.\" This is not the work of a typist\n\nor receptionist.\n\n           The best indication of where the cases draw the line is\n\na sampling of unprotected jobs.          E.g., Galloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26,\n\n31-32 (1st Cir. 2004) (regional tax administrator); Flynn, 140 F.3d\n\nat 45-46 (overseers of multiple community centers); Zayas-Rodriguez\n\nv. Hernandez, 830 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1987) (audit director who\n\ncounseled a senior official about policy matters and supervised\n\nemployees).      By contrast, as we pointed out in Flynn, the Supreme\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fCourt cases have tended towards protection for \"a floor supervisor,\n\na   guard,   a   process   server,   an     assistant   public   defender,   a\n\nrehabilitation counselor, a road equipment operator, a garage\n\nworker, and a dietary manager.\"           Id. at 45 (citing the pertinent\n\ncases).\n\n             On such a spectrum, Olmeda's case is not close: she is\n\nnot federally protected against political discrimination and the\n\nfederal damage claims are barred by qualified immunity.               Olmeda\n\nalso seeks injunctive relief, which is not barred by qualified\n\nimmunity, but our ruling on Olmeda's status removes the basis for\n\nfederal-claim injunctive relief as well.            Olmeda's claims under\n\nPuerto Rico law remain open, but can be dismissed without prejudice\n\nif the district court chooses.        28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) (2000).\n\n             The district court's order denying qualified immunity is\n\nvacated and the matter remanded for proceedings consistent with\n\nthis decision.     Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

Among other things, it is charged with crafting zoning and land use regulations, preparing long-term social and economic development plans, and advising the governor and legislature on general planning and development issues. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 62j.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1995 to 2001, Olmeda held the position of Director of the Economic and Social Planning Program. In 2000, a new governor representing the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") was elected, replacing a governor who belonged to the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"). Olmeda, who is affiliated with the NPP, requested and was granted a transfer to the career position of Assistant Planning Executive I; her transfer was made effective on July 1, 2001. Her salary was set at $3,591 per month plus a \"differential\" of $931 per month, granted because of her expertise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Olmeda, after the election and upon assuming her new position, she was subjected to adverse action based on her political affiliation. She says (in her present complaint) that she was largely stripped of her duties, which were reassigned to an employee of the Board affiliated with the PDP; that she was subject to verbal abuse from two Board employees; that other officials failed to respond to Olmeda's complaints; that her salary differential was eliminated after an audit asserted that she was not entitled to it; and that in August 2002 she was transferred to a new position as Acting Coordinator of the Office of Federal Proposals of the Economic Analysis Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 2002, Olmeda filed this action, seeking several million dollars in actual and punitive damages under both section 1983, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), and Puerto Rico law. The main federal claim was for political discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The defendants included two successive heads of the Board who had been appointed by the new governor and several other employees said to have participated in these wrongs either by action or, in failing to provide relief, by inaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After initial discovery, including a deposition of Olmeda, the defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that they were entitled to qualified immunity (Olmeda also cross-moved for partial summary judgment in her favor on her political discrimination claims). Defendants contended, <i>inter alia,</i> that under the governing case law on the federal political discrimination claim, Olmeda's position was not one protected against politically motivated adverse action. The district court denied the defendants' motion (as well as Olmeda's cross-motion), saying only that there were \"contested issues of material fact.\" The defendants have now sought review in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity doctrine protects government officers and employees from suit on federal claims for damages where, in the circumstances, a reasonable official could have believed his conduct was lawful. <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Rodr&#237;guez v. Ortiz-V&#233;lez,</i> 391 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir.2004). The immunity is not merely from damages, but (with some qualifications) from having to endure a trial. So &#8212; as a court-made exception to the final judgment rule &#8212; immediate appeals are permitted from such denials. <i>Id.</i> at 39-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One wrinkle is that the Supreme Court has disallowed such an immediate appeal where the district court's denial of immunity rested upon its determination &#8212; whether right or wrong &#8212; that immunity turned on a disputed issue of material fact. <i>Johnson v. Jones,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995). Yet, whatever the district court's reasoning, immediate appellate review is still permitted if immunity is required as a matter of law regardless of how the factual issue is resolved. <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Rodr&#237;guez</i> 391 F.3d at 39-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, there may well be disputed factual issues as to whether Olmeda suffered significant adverse employment action and, if so, whether this was motivated at least in part by hostility to her political affiliation. However, the defendants' main claim on appeal &#8212; that Olmeda's job is not constitutionally protected against political discrimination &#8212; does not require that any disputed factual issue be decided. To that extent, we have jurisdiction to consider defendants' claim to immunity, regardless of the district court's own reasons for denying the motion. <i>Id.</i> at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one more complication. Although qualified immunity requires merely that a reasonable official could believe that his conduct was lawful, the Supreme Court has directed that the qualified immunity inquiry itself begin by asking whether on <i>the facts alleged</i> there is a constitutional violation at all. <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). <i>Saucier</i>'s inversion has its own logic, <i>see id.,</i> but it has the potential to cause problems where answering this first question in the abstract is difficult. <i>See Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't,</i> 315 F.3d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A first amendment right to protection against political discrimination was recognized by the Supreme Court about thirty years ago in <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), and <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980). <i>See also Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990). Where improper motive is shown, the employee is protected against significant adverse employment action &#8212; this is a loose formulation &#8212; but the right exists only where the job is one for which political affiliation is an improper criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti</i> involved employees engaged in comparatively routine work, and protection was not extended to jobs for which \"party affiliation is an appropriate requirement.\" <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287. Were the rule otherwise, no new administration would be able effectively to implement its own policies. The federal claim does not turn on whether a state has chosen to afford civil service protection to a job, <i>see Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales,</i> 415 F.3d 127, 133 (1st Cir.2005), but on <i>Branti</i>'s \"appropriateness\" requirement, which is extensively glossed in the case law in this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, protection does not extend to positions which potentially \"involve decision making on issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation\" and where the jobholder is a policymaker, confidential assistant, spokesman, or similar officeholder. <i>Ortiz-Pi&#241;ero v. Rivera-Arroyo,</i> 84 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> 140 F.3d 42, 44-45 (1st Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 525 U.S. 961, 119 S.Ct. 403, 142 L.Ed.2d 327 (1998). Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, <i>id.</i> at 44, and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions, <i>Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves,</i> 274 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, there is a detailed official job description for Olmeda's position. Olmeda alleged no facts contradicting the description; indeed, at her deposition, she seemingly endorsed the description. Once an understanding of the functions is ascertained, it is a question of law whether they invoke constitutional protection. <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 44. If not, Olmeda may have civil service or other protection under Puerto Rico law since she converted to a \"career\" position, but the <i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti</i> line of cases does not apply and the defendants are protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Board has policy involvement at the highest level is beyond dispute. By statute, the Board is charged with \"guiding the integral development of Puerto Rico\" in order to best promote \"health, safety, order, coexistence, prosperity, defense, culture, economic stability and general welfare,\" in addition to crafting policies for \"the process of development,\" \"the distribution of population,\" \"the use of land,\" and \"public improvements.\" 23 L.P.R.A. &#167; 62c. The statute spells out extensive duties in analysis and coordination of other agencies. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> &#167;&#167; 62j, 62l.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This merely sets the stage. If Olmeda were a staff typist or a receptionist, she would still likely be protected. Her duties are outlined in the official seven-page \"description of position,\" which describes the \"essential duties\" of her position as follows (the \"Program\" referred to in this list is \"Economic and Social Planning\"; the \"Subprogram\" is \"Economic Analysis\"):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plans, coordinates, directs, supervises and evaluates the work of the personnel that performs highly technical and specialized studies related to the activities developed in the Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gives guidance and advises the Director of the Program and Subprogram on theoretical and technical aspects related to the national accounts and other jobs performed in the subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Advises the Director of the Subprogram about the implementation of public policy, law, regulations, norms and procedures that are applicable to the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conducts meetings with the coordinators and technical assistants of the Subprogram and with its designated consultants, to discuss and coordinate aspects of work planning with amendments received in the Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Participates in the preparation and analysis of different special missions regarding economic impact, news commentaries, special Bills and others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Represents the Board in committees, forums, seminars, conferences and other activities related to their field, as designated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analyzes, evaluates and issues opinions and recommendations regarding reports, projects and proposed laws and other documents that are referred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Studies, analyzes and evaluates norms, regulations, instructions and complex situations related to activity field and submits reports or discusses action alternatives and specific recommendations with Supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Participates in the selection, training and evaluation of designated personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welcomes visitors and officials from Puerto Rico and other countries whenever required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Establishes contacts with public and/or private entities in order to coordinate issues related to the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Helps prepare the economic Report for the Governor and other publications prepared in the Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Participates in the preparation of the Budget Petition and in the Subprogram work plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prepares and submits periodic reports on the work done to the Director of the Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Represents the Board in public and administrative hearings where issues related to the field of work are discussed, as required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goes to training and development activities and to meetings of orientation or discussion of work plans, as required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does other duties as assigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases have not been able to come up with a terse formula or standard for describing policy-related positions that are outside the constitutional constraint. Yet as we observed in <i>Flynn,</i> our circuit has \"regularly upheld against First Amendment challenge the dismissal on political grounds of mid- or upper-level officials or employees who are significantly connected to policy-making.\" 140 F.3d at 45. \"[I]t is enough that the official be <i>involved</i> in policy, even if only as an adviser, implementer, or spokesperson.\" <i>Id.</i> at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olmeda's job description makes clear that she is an official, that she is involved in policymaking at least as an adviser, and that she is expected on occasion to serve as a representative of the Board itself. Olmeda emphasizes her technical training and its utility in her job, and we accept that this is so. But an employee otherwise involved in policy is not protected merely because the employee is \"guided in some ... functions by professional or technical standards.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olmeda's job description outlines a number of policy-oriented duties: the occupant \"[a]nalyzes, evaluates and issues opinions and recommendations regarding reports, projects and proposed laws and other documents that are referred\" and \"[s]tudies, analyzes and evaluates norms, regulations, instructions and complex situations related to activity field and submits reports or discusses action alternatives and specific recommendations with Supervisor.\" This is not the work of a typist or receptionist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The best indication of where the cases draw the line is a sampling of unprotected jobs. <i>E.g., Galloza v. Foy,</i> 389 F.3d 26, 31-32 (1st Cir.2004) (regional tax administrator); <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 45-46 (overseers of multiple community centers); <i>Zayas-Rodriguez v. Hernandez,</i> 830 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1987) (audit director who counseled a senior official about policy matters and supervised employees). By contrast, as we pointed out in <i>Flynn,</i> the Supreme Court cases have tended towards protection for \"a floor supervisor, a guard, a process server, an assistant public defender, a rehabilitation counselor, a road equipment operator, a garage worker, and a dietary manager.\" <i>Id.</i> at 45 (citing the pertinent cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On such a spectrum, Olmeda's case is not close: she is not federally protected against political discrimination and the federal damage claims are barred by qualified immunity. Olmeda also seeks injunctive relief, which is not barred by qualified immunity, but our ruling on Olmeda's status removes the basis for federal-claim injunctive relief as well. Olmeda's claims under Puerto Rico law remain open, but can be dismissed without prejudice if the district court chooses. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order denying qualified immunity is vacated and the matter remanded for proceedings consistent with this decision.

Yet, whatever the district court's reasoning, immediate appellate review is still permitted if immunity is required as a matter of law regardless of how the factual issue is resolved. <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Rodr&#237;guez</i> 391 F.3d at 39-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, there may well be disputed factual issues as to whether Olmeda suffered significant adverse employment action and, if so, whether this was motivated at least in part by hostility to her political affiliation. However, the defendants' main claim on appeal &#8212; that Olmeda's job is not constitutionally protected against political discrimination &#8212; does not require that any disputed factual issue be decided. To that extent, we have jurisdiction to consider defendants' claim to immunity, regardless of the district court's own reasons for denying the motion. <i>Id.</i> at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one more complication. Although qualified immunity requires merely that a reasonable official could believe that his conduct was lawful, the Supreme Court has directed that the qualified immunity inquiry itself begin by asking whether on <i>the facts alleged</i> there is a constitutional violation at all. <i>Saucier v.

Actual functions of the job, not titles, control, <i>id.</i> at 44, and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions, <i>Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199731\"><a href=\"/opinion/199731/duriex-gauthier-v-lopez-nieves/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, there is a detailed official job description for Olmeda's position. Olmeda alleged no facts contradicting the description; indeed, at her deposition, she seemingly endorsed the description. Once an understanding of the functions is ascertained, it is a question of law whether they invoke constitutional protection. <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 44. If not, Olmeda may have civil service or other protection under Puerto Rico law since she converted to a \"career\" position, but the <i>Elrod</i> and <i>Branti</i> line of cases does not apply and the defendants are protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Board has policy involvement at the highest level is beyond dispute. By statute, the Board is charged with \"guiding the integral development of Puerto Rico\" in order to best promote \"health, safety, order, coexistence, prosperity, defense, culture, economic stability and general welfare,\" in addition to crafting policies for \"the process of development,\" \"the distribution of population,\" \"the use of land,\" and \"public improvements.\" 23 L.P.R.A. &#167; 62c. The statute spells out extensive duties in analysis and coordination of other agencies. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> &#167;&#167; 62j, 62l.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This merely sets the stage. If Olmeda were a staff typist or a receptionist, she would still likely be protected. Her duties are outlined in the official seven-page \"description of position,\" which describes the \"essential duties\" of her position as follows (the \"Program\" referred to in this list is \"Economic and Social Planning\"; the \"Subprogram\" is \"Economic Analysis\"):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plans, coordinates, directs, supervises and evaluates the work of the personnel that performs highly technical and specialized studies related to the activities developed in the Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gives guidance and advises the Director of the Program and Subprogram on theoretical and technical aspects related to the national accounts and other jobs performed in the subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Advises the Director of the Subprogram about the implementation of public policy, law, regulations, norms and procedures that are applicable to the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conducts meetings with the coordinators and technical assistants of the Subprogram and with its designated consultants, to discuss and coordinate aspects of work planning with amendments received in the Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Participates in the preparation and analysis of different special missions regarding economic impact, news commentaries, special Bills and others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Represents the Board in committees, forums, seminars, conferences and other activities related to their field, as designated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analyzes, evaluates and issues opinions and recommendations regarding reports, projects and proposed laws and other documents that are referred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Studies, analyzes and evaluates norms, regulations, instructions and complex situations related to activity field and submits reports or discusses action alternatives and specific recommendations with Supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Participates in the selection, training and evaluation of designated personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welcomes visitors and officials from Puerto Rico and other countries whenever required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Establishes contacts with public and/or private entities in order to coordinate issues related to the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Helps prepare the economic Report for the Governor and other publications prepared in the Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Participates in the preparation of the Budget Petition and in the Subprogram work plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prepares and submits periodic reports on the work done to the Director of the Subprogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Represents the Board in public and administrative hearings where issues related to the field of work are discussed, as required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goes to training and development activities and to meetings of orientation or discussion of work plans, as required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does other duties as assigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases have not been able to come up with a terse formula or standard for describing policy-related positions that are outside the constitutional constraint. Yet as we observed in <i>Flynn,</i> our circuit has \"regularly upheld against First Amendment challenge the dismissal on political grounds of mid- or upper-level officials or employees who are significantly connected to policy-making.\" 140 F.3d at 45. \"[I]t is enough that the official be <i>involved</i> in policy, even if only as an adviser, implementer, or spokesperson.\" <i>Id.</i> at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olmeda's job description makes clear that she is an official, that she is involved in policymaking at least as an adviser, and that she is expected on occasion to serve as a representative of the Board itself. Olmeda emphasizes her technical training and its utility in her job, and we accept that this is so. But an employee otherwise involved in policy is not protected merely because the employee is \"guided in some ... functions by professional or technical standards.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Olmeda's job description outlines a number of policy-oriented duties: the occupant \"[a]nalyzes, evaluates and issues opinions and recommendations regarding reports, projects and proposed laws and other documents that are referred\" and \"[s]tudies, analyzes and evaluates norms, regulations, instructions and complex situations related to activity field and submits reports or discusses action alternatives and specific recommendations with Supervisor.\" This is not the work of a typist or receptionist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The best indication of where the cases draw the line is a sampling of unprotected jobs. <i>E.g., Galloza v.
