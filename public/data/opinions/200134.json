D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n               Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jane Elizabeth Lee for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 23, 2002\n\f            CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.     This is an appeal from\n\nthe   judgment    of   conviction    entered   against   Jeremy   Bender\n\n(\"Bender\").      Bender was charged and convicted under the Armed\n\nCareer Criminal Act of possession of four firearms as a convicted\n\nfelon in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(e) (2000).       On\n\nappeal, Bender contends that the district court erred when it\n\ndeclined to exclude the testimony of Smokey Heath (\"Heath\"), a\n\ngovernment witness.      Bender argues that Heath's testimony should\n\nhave been excluded because the government violated its duty under\n\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), when it delayed disclosure\nof impeaching material regarding Heath.          Finding no error, we\n\naffirm.\n\nI.          Background\n\n            We describe briefly the background of this case at this\njuncture and add more detail as it becomes relevant to the legal\nanalysis.   On November 29, 2000, a grand jury returned a four count\n\nindictment against Bender for possession of four firearms - three\nrevolvers identified in counts one, two, and four, and two rifles\n(a semiautomatic and a lever-action) identified in count three - as\na convicted felon.\n\n            Prior to the start of trial, defense counsel made a\n\ntimely request from the government for all Brady material.           The\n\nrequest for Brady material included \"the details or evidence\n\nconcerning any witness, especially any informants, who is or was\n\n[sic] suffering from any mental disability, emotional disturbance,\n\ndrug addiction or alcohol addiction during the past fifteen years.\"\n\n                                    -2-\n\fThe government responded that it \"under[stood] and accept[ed] its\n\nobligations under Brady\" and that it would provide the materials\n\nconsistent with the procedural requirements of case law.\n             Trial began on January 16, 2001. In support of its case,\n\nthe    government     offered     the    testimony   of   27     individuals.     The\n\nevidence undisputedly linked Bender to the four weapons.                    The most\ndamning testimony came from Kevin Lepine and Chuckie Lepage, both\n\ntestifying pursuant to plea agreements.              Kevin Lepine stated that\n\nhe    had   sold   Bender   two    of    the    revolvers    identified      in   the\n\nindictment.        Chuckie Lepage testified that he and Bender had\n\nplanned and executed a number of residential burglaries in which\n\nthey    stole   the   remaining     guns    identified      in    the   indictment,\n\nincluding two semiautomatic .45 pistols, a .357 magnum with a\nscope, a .22 semiautomatic, and two hunting rifles.                      Bender was\n\nfurther linked to the burglaries through pawn receipts indicating\n\nthat he hocked several items stolen on those occasions, and through\nthe seizure, in Bender's basement, pursuant to a search warrant, of\n\npersonal     items    belonging     to    the   victims     of   the    burglaries.\n\nTestimony by the victims of the burglaries identified the items\n\ntaken from their homes and the stolen guns.\n\n             The jury also heard testimony from Heath.                  According to\n\nHeath, in May 1999, while Bender was incarcerated awaiting trial,\n\nhe confessed details of his crime to Heath, himself an inmate in\n\nstate custody, and sought Heath's assistance to discredit Chuckie\n\nLepage.      Instead, Heath contacted the Maine Violent Crime Task\n\nForce and disclosed Bender's admissions.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f            On the Friday of a three-day weekend, just prior to the\n\nstart of trial, Heath told the Assistant United States Attorney\n\nthat, while he was incarcerated in state prison, he had been taken\nto the Augusta Mental Health Institute (\"AMHI\"), a state mental\n\nhospital.    The prosecutor immediately notified defense counsel,\n\nprepared a release for Heath's signature, and arranged to have\ncopies of AMHI's records brought to the federal courthouse the\n\nfollowing Tuesday, the first day of trial.         The medical records\n\nrevealed that Heath may have experienced auditory hallucinations\n\nwhile    incarcerated,   or   in   the   alternative,   that   Heath   was\n\nmalingering to avoid his legal dilemmas.        While the court denied\n\ndefense counsel's request to preclude Heath's testimony, it offered\n\nto delay the testimony for \"another day or so.\"         Defense counsel\nmaintained that such a brief continuance was not an adequate\n\nremedy, and instead elected to use the information in the AMHI\n\nrecords to cross-examine Heath and to argue to the jury.\n            After a two-day trial the jury returned verdicts of\n\nguilty on all four counts.         Bender was sentenced to serve 293\n\nmonths in prison on each count, to be served concurrently, and to\n\nserve concurrent supervised release terms of five years on each\n\ncount.\n\n            This appeal followed.\n\nII.         Discussion\n\n            Bender seeks reversal of his conviction on the grounds\nthat the government failed to timely disclose Heath's medical\n\ntreatment records in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n                                   -4-\n\f(1963), and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), thus\n\nimpairing his ability to defend the case.                      He contends that the\n\ndistrict court erred when it failed to recognize the prejudicial\nimpact and allowed Heath's testimony.                       We do not find these\n\ncontentions persuasive.\n\n            First,        it    is    questionable          whether       the   federal\ngovernment's duty under Brady was triggered given that Heath's\n\nmental health records were never in its possession or under its\n\ncontrol.    United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1179 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); United States v. Aichele, 941 F.2d 761, 764 (9th Cir. 1991).\n\nThis court has stated that \"the rigors of Brady usually do not\n\nattach to material outside the federal government's control.\"\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1179.             Heath, at all relevant times, was a\nprisoner in the custody and control of the State of Maine.                       He was\n\nnot in federal custody.         He testified pursuant to a subpoena.              AMHI\n\nis   a   state-owned      and   operated      mental     health      facility.     The\nprosecution asserts that it was caught unawares - it did not know\n\nof   Heath's     mental    health     records.         When    it   discovered   their\n\nexistence, it acted promptly and appropriately.\n\n            Bender      suggests      that    after    he     requested    information\n\nrelative    to    the     mental     health   of   a    government     witness,    the\n\nprosecutor had a duty, once he knew someone was to be a witness, to\n\nfind and disclose that information if it existed - regardless of\n\nwhere or with whom the information rested.                          To support this\n\nproposition, Bender relies on our decision in United States v.\n\nOsorio, 929 F.2d 753 (1st Cir. 1991), in which we stated that a\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fprosecutor    \"using    a   witness   with    an    impeachable     past    has    a\n\nconstitutionally derived duty to search for and produce impeachment\n\nevidence requested regarding a witness.\"             Id. at 761.\n          Neither the relevant Supreme Court precedent under Brady\n\nnor our decision in Osorio requires a prosecutor to seek out and\n\ndisclose exculpatory or impeaching material not in the government's\npossession.    To comply with Brady the individual prosecutor has a\n\nduty to find any evidence favorable to the defendant that was known\n\nto those acting on the government's behalf.             Strickler v. Greene,\n\n527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999).        Such persons include other members of\n\nthe prosecuting team, including police investigators working for\n\nthe prosecution.       Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995).                In\n\nOsorio, the prosecutor had failed to discover - from colleagues\n\nwithin his own office - that the prosecution's chief witness was a\n\nmajor drug dealer.       929 F.2d at 756.       We held that a \"prosecutor\n\ncharged   with   discovery     cannot       avoid   finding   out    what    'the\ngovernment' knows, simply by declining to make reasonable inquiry\n\nof those in a position to have relevant knowledge.\"                 Id. at 761.\n\nThere is no evidence here that the prosecutor, or anyone acting on\n\nbehalf of the federal government, was aware of Heath's mental\n\nhealth history until Heath disclosed the information on the eve of\n\ntrial.\n\n           Bender's argument that the government had a duty under\n\nBrady is further weakened by evidence that Bender himself was aware\n\nof Heath's mental health history prior to the disclosure of the\n\nAMHI records.     Brady applies to material that was known to the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fprosecution    but   unknown   to   the    defense.    United   States   v.\n\nSoto-Alvarez, 958 F.2d 473, 477 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing United\n\nStates v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 102 (1976)).        Heath testified that he\nhad told Bender, prior to Bender's trial, that he had been taken to\n\nAMHI for a \"nervous breakdown.\"           Prior to trial, defense counsel\n\nhad the opportunity to interview Heath and examine him on the\nstand, under oath, during an evidentiary hearing on Bender's motion\n\nto suppress particular statements, including his confession to\n\nHeath.   During the oral argument to preclude Heath's testimony,\n\ndefense counsel informed the court that Heath had applied for SSI\n\nbenefits \"because of his mental disability.\"          Thus, the defendant\n\nwas on notice that Heath may have had a \"mental disability\" and\n\ndefense counsel had ample opportunity and reason to explore Heath's\ncompetence to testify months prior to the start of trial.\n\n          While the absence of a Brady violation ends the matter,\n\neven if we were to assume, for purposes of argument, the existence\nof a Brady problem, Bender has utterly failed to demonstrate\n\nprejudice arising from the delay.            A defendant must show that\n\n\"learning the information altered the subsequent defense strategy,\n\nand [that] given a more timeous disclosure, a more effective\n\nstrategy would likely have resulted.\"          United States v. Lemmerer,\n\n277 F.3d 579, 588 (1st Cir. 2002) petition for cert. filed, (July\n\n11, 2002) (No. 02-5207) (quoting United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d\n\n280, 290 (1st Cir. 1990)).      It is not enough for Bender merely to\n\nassert that he would have conducted cross-examination somewhat\n\ndifferently.    United States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 103 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f2002).   At the very least, he needs to show that a plausible\n\nstrategic option was foreclosed by the delay.                   Id.     The impact of\n\nthe delayed disclosure on Bender's cross-examination of Heath\nturns, in part, on \"the extent the defendant actually managed to\n\nuse the [disclosed material] despite the delay.\" United States v.\n\nIngraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 412 (1st Cir. 1986).\n             We    find    little    reason    to    believe      that    an    earlier\n\ndisclosure    of    the     AMHI    records    would    have    improved       Bender's\n\ndefense. Bender suggests that his cross-examination of Heath would\n\nhave been more effective.            Had the records been earlier disclosed\n\nhe says he could have \"confronted Heath with the evidence of his\n\nmalingering       and    manipulation    of    his     symptoms    to    avoid     legal\n\ndifficulties;\"          obtained   the   services      of   a   medical    expert     to\ndecipher the medical terminology in the records; and subpoenaed\n\nHeath's additional mental health records.\n\n             Defense counsel, in fact, conducted an effective and\nthorough cross-examination of Heath along these very lines by using\n\nthe   AMHI    records       and    his   criminal      history     to     attack    his\n\ncredibility.       Defense counsel questioned Heath about the \"nervous\n\nbreakdown\" that led to his 30-day commitment to AMHI.                          He asked\n\nwhether Heath reported auditory hallucinations.                         He questioned\n\nHeath about the mental health treatment he received prior to his\n\ncommitment to AMHI.           He pressed Heath about his desperation to\n\navoid incarceration, that included swallowing a metal object, and\n\nsuggested that perhaps it also included fabricating a confession to\n\ngarner favor with law enforcement officials. He elicited testimony\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthat Heath   had   indeed   asked   for   favors   from   law   enforcement\n\nofficials after he disclosed Heath's confession - specifically that\n\nhe be transferred to a different, more congenial facility.              He\nbrought out Heath's prior convictions for burglary, kidnapping and\n\nterrorizing, and gross sexual assault.       We conclude that any delay\n\nin the disclosure of Heath's AMHI records did not impair defense\ncounsel's effective use of the information or hinder a presentation\n\nof the defense.    Devin, 918 F.2d at 289.\n\n          We find no basis for reversing Bender's conviction.           The\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

On November 29, 2000, a grand jury returned a four count indictment against Bender for possession of four firearms &#8212; three revolvers identified in counts one, two, and four, and two rifles (a semiautomatic and a lever-action) identified in count three &#8212; as a convicted felon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the start of trial, defense counsel made a timely request from the government for all <i>Brady</i> material.

In support of its case, the government offered the testimony of 27 individuals. The evidence undisputedly linked Bender to the four weapons. The most damning testimony came from Kevin Lepine and Chuckie Lepage, both testifying pursuant to plea agreements. Kevin Lepine stated that he had sold Bender two of the revolvers identified in the indictment. Chuckie Lepage testified that he and Bender had planned and executed a number of residential burglaries in which they stole the remaining guns identified in the indictment, including two semiautomatic .45 pistols, a .357 magnum with a scope, a .22 semiautomatic, and two hunting rifles. Bender was further linked to the burglaries through pawn receipts indicating that he hocked several items stolen on those occasions, and through the seizure, in Bender's basement, pursuant to a search warrant, of personal items belonging to the victims of the burglaries.

We do not find these contentions persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is questionable whether the federal government's duty under <i>Brady</i> was triggered given that Heath's mental health records were never in its possession or under its control. <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1179 (1st Cir.1993); <i>United States v. Aichele,</i> 941 F.2d 761, 764 (9th Cir.1991). This court has stated that \"the rigors of <i>Brady</i> usually do not attach to material outside the federal government's control.\" <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1179. Heath, at all relevant times, was a prisoner in the custody and control of the State of Maine. He was not in federal custody. He testified pursuant to a subpoena. AMHI is a state-owned and operated mental health facility. The prosecution asserts that it was caught unawares &#8212; it did not know of Heath's mental health records. When it discovered their existence, it acted promptly and appropriately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bender suggests that after he requested information relative to the mental health of a government witness, the prosecutor had a duty, once he knew someone was to be a witness, to find and disclose that information if it existed &#8212; regardless of where or with whom the information rested. To support this proposition, Bender relies on our decision in <i>United States v. Osorio,</i> 929 F.2d 753 (1st Cir.1991), in which we stated that a prosecutor \"using a witness with an impeachable past has a constitutionally derived duty to search for and produce impeachment evidence requested regarding a witness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 761.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the relevant Supreme Court precedent under <i>Brady</i> nor our decision in <i>Osorio</i> requires a prosecutor to seek out and disclose exculpatory or impeaching material not in the government's possession. To comply with <i>Brady</i> the individual prosecutor has a duty to find any evidence favorable to the defendant that was known to those acting on the government's behalf. <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Such persons include other members of the prosecuting team, including police investigators working for the prosecution. <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). In <i>Osorio,</i> the prosecutor had failed to discover &#8212; <i>from colleagues within his own office</i> &#8212; that the prosecution's chief witness was a major drug dealer. 929 F.2d at 756. We held that a \"prosecutor charged with discovery cannot avoid finding out what `the government' knows, simply by declining to make reasonable inquiry of those in a position to have relevant knowledge.\" <i>Id.</i> at 761. There is no evidence here that the prosecutor, or anyone acting on behalf of the federal government, was aware of Heath's mental health history until Heath disclosed the information on the eve of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bender's argument that the government had a duty under <i>Brady</i> is further weakened by evidence that Bender himself was aware of Heath's mental health history prior to the disclosure of the AMHI records. <i>Brady</i> applies to material that was known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense. <i>United States v. Soto-Alvarez,</i> 958 F.2d 473, 477 (1st Cir.1992) (citing <i>United States v. Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. 97, 102, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976)). Heath testified that he had told Bender, prior to Bender's trial, that he had been taken to AMHI for a \"nervous breakdown.\" Prior to trial, defense counsel had the opportunity to interview Heath and examine him on the stand, under oath, during an evidentiary hearing on Bender's motion to suppress particular statements, including his confession to Heath. During the oral argument to preclude Heath's testimony, defense counsel informed the court that Heath had applied for SSI benefits \"because of his mental disability.\" Thus, the defendant was on notice that Heath may have had a \"mental disability\" and defense counsel had ample opportunity and reason to explore Heath's competence to testify months prior to the start of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the absence of a <i>Brady</i> violation ends the matter, even if we were to assume, for purposes of argument, the existence of a <i>Brady</i> problem, Bender has utterly failed to demonstrate prejudice arising from the delay. A defendant must show that \"learning the information altered the subsequent defense strategy, and [that] given a more timeous disclosure, a more effective strategy would likely have resulted.\" <i>United States v.

It is not enough for Bender merely to assert that he would have conducted cross-examination somewhat differently. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 103 (1st Cir.2002). At the very least, he needs to show that a plausible strategic option was foreclosed by the delay. <i>Id.</i> The impact of the delayed disclosure on Bender's cross-examination of Heath turns, in part, on \"the extent the defendant actually managed to use the [disclosed material] despite the delay.\" <i>United States v.

Bender suggests that his cross-examination of Heath would have been more effective. Had the records been earlier disclosed he says he could have \"confronted Heath with the evidence of his malingering and manipulation of his symptoms to avoid legal difficulties;\" obtained the services of a medical expert to decipher the medical terminology in the records; and subpoenaed Heath's additional mental health records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel, in fact, conducted an effective and thorough cross-examination of Heath along these very lines by using the AMHI records and his criminal history to attack his credibility.

Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe briefly the background of this case at this juncture and add more detail as it becomes relevant to the legal analysis. On November 29, 2000, a grand jury returned a four count indictment against Bender for possession of four firearms &#8212; three revolvers identified in counts one, two, and four, and two rifles (a semiautomatic and a lever-action) identified in count three &#8212; as a convicted felon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the start of trial, defense counsel made a timely request from the government for all <i>Brady</i> material. The request for <i>Brady</i> material included \"the details or evidence concerning any witness, especially any informants, who is or was [sic] suffering from any mental disability, emotional disturbance, drug addiction or alcohol addiction during the past fifteen years.\" The government responded that it \"under[stood] and accept[ed] its obligations under <i>Brady</i>\" and that it would provide the materials consistent with the procedural requirements of case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began on January 16, 2001. In support of its case, the government offered the testimony of 27 individuals. The evidence undisputedly linked Bender to the four weapons. The most damning testimony came from Kevin Lepine and Chuckie Lepage, both testifying pursuant to plea agreements. Kevin Lepine stated that he had sold Bender two of the revolvers identified in the indictment. Chuckie Lepage testified that he and Bender had planned and executed a number of residential burglaries in which they stole the remaining guns identified in the indictment, including two semiautomatic .45 pistols, a .357 magnum with a scope, a .22 semiautomatic, and two hunting rifles. Bender was further linked to the burglaries through pawn receipts indicating that he hocked several items stolen on those occasions, and through the seizure, in Bender's basement, pursuant to a search warrant, of personal items belonging to the victims of the burglaries. Testimony by the victims of the burglaries identified the items taken from their homes and the stolen guns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also heard testimony from Heath. According to Heath, in May 1999, while Bender was incarcerated awaiting trial, he confessed details of his crime to Heath, himself an inmate in state custody, and sought Heath's assistance to discredit Chuckie Lepage. Instead, Heath contacted the Maine Violent Crime Task Force and disclosed Bender's admissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the Friday of a three-day weekend, just prior to the start of trial, Heath told the Assistant United States Attorney that, while he was incarcerated in state prison, he had been taken to the Augusta Mental Health Institute (\"AMHI\"), a state mental hospital. The prosecutor immediately notified defense counsel, prepared a release for Heath's signature, and arranged to have copies of AMHI's records brought to the federal courthouse the following Tuesday, the first day of trial. The medical records revealed that Heath may have experienced auditory hallucinations while incarcerated, or in the alternative, that Heath was malingering to avoid his legal dilemmas. While the court denied defense counsel's request to preclude Heath's testimony, it offered to delay the testimony for \"another day or so.\" Defense counsel maintained that such a brief continuance was not an adequate remedy, and instead elected to use the information in the AMHI records to cross-examine Heath and to argue to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a two-day trial the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all four counts. Bender was sentenced to serve 293 months in prison on each count, to be served concurrently, and to serve concurrent supervised release terms of five years on each count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

This court has stated that \"the rigors of <i>Brady</i> usually do not attach to material outside the federal government's control.\" <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1179. Heath, at all relevant times, was a prisoner in the custody and control of the State of Maine. He was not in federal custody. He testified pursuant to a subpoena.
