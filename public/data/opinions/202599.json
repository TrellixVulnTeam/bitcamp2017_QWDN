George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Michael R. Schneider, with whom Salsberg & Schneider was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         January 19, 2007\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.      This appeal calls upon us to\n\nconfront a question explicitly reserved in United States v. Diaz,\n\n285 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2002), concerning the allocation of the\n\nburden of proof when a criminal defendant in a federal felon-in-\n\npossession case attempts to exonerate himself by claiming that he\n\ntook possession of the firearm purely in self-defense.1     We hold\n\nthat there is a justification defense available in felon-in-\n\npossession cases, which typically encompasses duress, necessity,\n\nand self-defense. Relatedly, we hold that where, as here, proof of\n\nthe justification defense does not negate an element of the charged\n\ncrime, the burden of proof in connection with that defense rests\n\nwith the defendant.   These holdings, coupled with our rejection of\n\na variety of other proffered assignments of error, lead us to\n\naffirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           While the factual scenario portrayed at trial is littered\n\nwith testimonial conflicts and is at some points shrouded in\n\nambiguity, the facts relevant to this appeal are comparatively\n\nstraightforward.\n\n           On July 27, 2003, defendant-appellant Jesse Leahy, a\n\nconvicted felon, had an altercation with a group of teenagers near\n\n\n\n      1\n      The case at hand does not involve a claim of self-defense\nvia-à-vis a law enforcement officer.    Such cases may present\nspecial considerations and, thus, are beyond the scope of this\nopinion.\n\n                                -2-\n\fhis mother's home in Kezar Falls, Maine.                According to Leahy, he\n\nwithdrew from the scene, but the youths followed him and attempted\n\nforcibly to enter his mother's house.                   Ostensibly fearing the\n\nmaddened crowd, Leahy grabbed an Astra 9mm pistol that he knew his\n\nmother kept in a kitchen drawer.              He emerged from the residence\n\narmed and confronted his tormentors.\n\n          During the ensuing imbroglio, Leahy admittedly fired the\n\nweapon.      The    protagonists'      versions    of    what   happened   differ\n\nmaterially.       Leahy asserts that he did no more than fire warning\n\nshots into the ground to scare away attackers who were attempting\n\nto inflict serious bodily injury on him.            Other witnesses describe\n\nLeahy as the aggressor and assert that he chased after the youths,\n\nshot towards them, and pistol-whipped two of their number.\n\n          In all events, the youths fled.                  Once that occurred,\n\nLeahy went back into the dwelling and hid the gun.                  Police soon\n\narrived at the scene.        After a twelve-hour standoff, they entered\n\nthe premises and arrested Leahy.              A search revealed not only the\n\nhidden pistol but also a Marlin rifle stashed in a pantry closet.\n\nMale DNA profiles found on the rifle were consistent with those\n\nfound on the pistol (although no DNA was specifically matched to\n\nLeahy).      In    due   season,   a   federal    grand    jury   handed   up   an\n\nindictment that charged Leahy with being a felon in possession of\n\na firearm.    See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).           The indictment referenced\n\nboth the pistol and the rifle.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f           Leahy's criminal record included felony convictions for\n\nassault and carrying a dangerous weapon.      At trial, his then-\n\ncounsel did not press for a stipulation that Leahy was a previously\n\nconvicted felon (one exchange with the judge suggests that counsel\n\nmay not have realized that he could compel the government to\n\nstipulate to this point).   In the absence of a stipulation, the\n\nprosecutor was able to introduce independent evidence of the prior\n\nconvictions.\n\n           Once both sides had rested, Leahy proffered a proposed\n\ninstruction on self-defense — one that placed the burden of proof\n\non the prosecution to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   The government rejoined that the facts did not warrant a\n\nself-defense instruction.   The district court took a middle path:\n\nover Leahy's objection, it gave an instruction on \"justification\"\n\n(defined so as to encompass self-defense), in which it told the\n\njury, in effect, that Leahy's possession of a firearm would be\n\njustified (and, therefore, a guilty verdict would be unwarranted)\n\nif (i) Leahy was under an unlawful and present threat of death or\n\nserious bodily injury; (ii) he did not recklessly place himself in\n\na situation in which he would be forced to engage in criminal\n\nconduct; (iii) he had no reasonable legal alternative but to engage\n\nin that conduct; and (iv) there was a direct causal relationship\n\nbetween his criminal conduct and the need to avoid the threatened\n\nharm.    This instruction treated justification as an affirmative\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fdefense, see United States v. Willis, 38 F.3d 170, 179 (5th Cir.\n\n1994), and placed the burden on Leahy to prove that affirmative\n\ndefense by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n            Following deliberations, the jury found Leahy guilty. At\n\nthe disposition hearing, the district court, finding that in the\n\npast    Leahy    had   thrice   been    convicted     of   violent   felonies,\n\nclassified him as an armed career criminal. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).\n\nThe court also determined that Leahy was subject to two separate\n\nsentencing      enhancements,    one    for    possessing    the   firearm   in\n\nconnection with an uncharged crime of violence and the other for\n\nobstruction of justice arising out of perjurious trial testimony.\n\nAfter making a series of other findings and computations, the court\n\nimposed a 262-month incarcerative sentence.                This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.    BURDEN OF PROOF\n\n            Leahy's flagship claim is that, once he had made a\n\nthreshold showing of self-defense, the district court erred in\n\nrequiring him to prove self-defense rather than requiring the\n\ngovernment to negate his colorable claim. The proper allocation of\n\nthe burden of proof on such a defense, however denominated, is an\n\nopen question in this circuit with respect to felon-in-possession\n\ncases.    See Diaz, 285 F.3d at 97.          The Constitution permits us to\n\nanswer   this    question   either     way;   there   is    no   constitutional\n\nrequirement that the burden of disproving self-defense reside with\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe prosecution.   See Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210-211\n\n(1977) (upholding murder statute that placed burden of proving\n\naffirmative defense on defendant when proof of that defense did not\n\nnegate an element of the offense).    Because the question turns on\n\nwhat is essentially a matter of statutory interpretation — what\n\nCongress intended — we afford de novo review. See United States v.\n\nHartsock, 347 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           We introduce our analysis in case-specific terms.    The\n\nprincipal issue at trial was whether Leahy, as a convicted felon,\n\nwas legally justified in taking possession of the handgun.      The\n\ngovernment argued that Leahy was not so justified because he was\n\nthe aggressor and, moreover, he was never under any realistic\n\nthreat of imminent harm.   Leahy, in contrast, argued that his bona\n\nfide fear of imminent harm justified him in taking possession of\n\nthe handgun and defensively using it to repel his attackers.    Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Holliday, 457 F.3d 121, 127 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(explaining that a felon possessing a gun to \"avoid the imminent\n\ndanger of his own death\" is \"the classic scenario in a self-defense\n\ncase\").   This issue calls into question whether justification is a\n\ndefense to a felon-in-possession charge and if so, which party\n\nbears the burden of proof.\n\n           The federal felon-in-possession statute itself, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g), makes no express provision for any affirmative defenses.\n\nThus, the logical starting place is the Supreme Court's recent\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fdecision in Dixon v. United States, 126 S. Ct. 2437 (2006).   There,\n\nthe Court assumed arguendo that duress would be a viable defense to\n\na section 922 charge2 and, on that assumption, ruled that the\n\ndefendant should bear the burden of proving duress.     Id. at 2447.\n\nThe Court noted that the court of appeals had distilled the defense\n\ninto four elements.     See id. at 2440 n.2.    With one exception,\n\ndiscussed infra note 8, those four elements were nearly identical\n\nto the elements of \"justification\" delineated by the trial court in\n\nthis case.\n\n          Although the Dixon Court, for this purpose, used the term\n\n\"duress,\" that usage appears to have been a carry-over of the usage\n\nemployed below.    See United States v. Dixon, 413 F.3d 520, 525 (5th\n\nCir. 2005) (using \"duress\" and \"justification\" interchangeably).\n\nThis imprecision is understandable.     Since the federal felon-in-\n\npossession statute does not explicitly admit of any affirmative\n\ndefenses, courts have been able only to infer the availability of\n\nsuch defenses, though in appropriate circumstances they have not\n\nhesitated to do so.     See, e.g., United States v. Deleveaux, 205\n\nF.3d 1292, 1297 & n.7 (11th Cir. 2000) (collecting cases from six\n\nother circuits).    We ourselves have intimated that, in appropriate\n\n\n\n     2\n      In Dixon, the charges were receiving a firearm while under\nindictment, 18 U.S.C. § 922(n), and making false statements in\nconnection with the acquisition of a firearm, id. § 922(a). The\nCourt did not discuss these charges separately, and the decision\nwould appear to be fully applicable to violations of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(g).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcircumstances, we would recognize a justification defense to a\n\nfederal felon-in-possession charge. See United States v. Holt, 464\n\nF.3d 101, 107 & n.4 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Holliday, 457 F.3d at\n\n127   (assuming,   arguendo,   the   availability   of   a   justification\n\ndefense of self-defense in a § 922(g) case).\n\n           This inferential process, which requires courts to draw\n\non common law doctrines, has produced confusion over nomenclature.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Panter, 688 F.2d 268, 272 n.7 (5th Cir.\n\n1982) (discussing whether \"necessity\" or \"self-defense\" is the\n\nappropriate label for a defense to a federal felon-in-possession\n\ncharge).    Many courts have sought to avoid this confusion by\n\ntreating a compendium of common law defenses — duress, necessity,\n\nand self-defense — as interchangeable in this context (that is, in\n\na felon-in-possession case in which proof of the affirmative\n\ndefense will not negate any element of the charged crime) and\n\nlumping them under the rubric of \"justification.\"3             See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Beasley, 346 F.3d 930, 934-35 (9th Cir. 2003); see\n\nalso Deleveaux, 205 F.3d at 1295 n.2 (collecting cases).              Our\n\ncanvass of the authorities elsewhere discloses that although some\n\ncourts have performed separate self-defense and necessity analyses,\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. Elder, 16 F.3d 733, 738-39 (7th Cir.\n\n\n\n      3\n      One court has crafted an affirmative defense of \"innocent\npossession,\" independent of any justification defense. See United\nStates v. Mason, 233 F.3d 619 (D.C. Cir. 2000). We have rejected\nthat taxonomy. See Holt, 464 F.3d at 107.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f1994); see also Holliday, 457 F.3d at 127-28 & n.8 (discussing\n\nself-defense and necessity separately, but taking no position on\n\nwhether those defenses could be viewed as interchangeable), no case\n\nholds that the burden of proof will vary automatically depending on\n\nwhether   duress,    necessity,   or    self-defense   is    asserted.4   We\n\nconclude, therefore, that ease in administration favors treating\n\nthese three defenses, in a federal felon-in-possession case, under\n\na single, unitary rubric: justification.               This conclusion is\n\nimportant because it strongly suggests that Dixon — which, as we\n\nhave said, placed the burden of proving duress on the defendant —\n\nbars Leahy's path.\n\n           In hopes of distinguishing Dixon, Leahy beseeches us to\n\ndisambiguate     self-defense     from       the   broader     category   of\n\njustification.      He emphasizes that the Dixon Court looked at the\n\nstate of the law in 1968 (when Congress first conceived the federal\n\nfelon-in-possession statute)5 to help determine what allocation of\n\n\n     4\n      In a post-argument letter, see Fed. R. App. P. 28(j), Leahy\nhas directed us to a terse exchange between government counsel and\nthe Supreme Court during oral argument in Dixon. That exchange\nraised the possibility of establishing different burden-of-proof\nallocations for duress and self-defense.       Transcript of Oral\nArgument, Dixon v. United States, 126 S. Ct. 2437, 2006 WL 1194533,\nat *28-30 (2006).    In our view, the mere fact that government\ncounsel answered a hypothetical question in a manner advantageous\nto the government's position in Dixon has no precedential value for\npresent purposes.\n     5\n      The origin of section 922 can be found in the Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-351, § 922, 82\nStat. 197, 228.    That statute included an early precursor to\nsection 922(g)(1). See id. at § 922(f), 82 Stat. at 231.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe burden of proof Congress most likely would have chosen had it\n\ninserted a duress defense into the statutory text.                      See Dixon, 126\n\nS. Ct. at 2445-47. He then asseverates, citing Mullaney v. Wilbur,\n\n421 U.S. 684, 702 n.30 (1975), that the same methodology, if\n\napplied in this case, would favor placing the burden of proof on\n\nthe prosecution because, in 1968, that was the majority rule in\n\nself-defense cases.\n\n           Leahy's premise is incorrect.                 Although seven Justices\n\njoined the opinion of the Dixon Court, Justice Kennedy wrote a\n\nconcurring      opinion    that    distanced   him       from     the    date-centric\n\nmethodology employed in that opinion and wrote that, as a general\n\nmatter, \"we can assume that Congress would not want to foreclose\n\nthe courts from consulting . . . newer sources and considering\n\ninnovative arguments.\"        Dixon, 126 S. Ct. at 2448 (Kennedy, J.,\n\nconcurring).      Justice Alito, joined by Justice Scalia, also wrote\n\na separate concurrence rejecting reliance on the date-centric\n\nmethodology and stressing the value of looking to the state of the\n\nlaw \"when Congress began enacting federal criminal statues.\"                        Id.\n\nat 2449 (Alito, J., concurring).           Finally, Justice Breyer, joined\n\nby   Justice    Souter,    wrote    a   dissent     in    which    he     argued    that\n\ndetermination of the appropriate burden of proof allocation was a\n\nquestion   of    federal    common      law.      Id.    at     2450     (Breyer,   J.,\n\ndissenting)     (explicitly       declining    to    follow       the    date-centric\n\napproach).      Thus, the most that we can glean from the several\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fopinions in Dixon is that the state of the law in 1968 is one\n\npossible source of enlightenment as to how Congress would have\n\nwanted to allocate the burden of proof had it explicitly created a\n\njustification    defense   to     a    felon-in-possession      charge;   other\n\npossible sources of enlightenment (such as the nature of the\n\noffense, the evolution of the defense and its accouterments when\n\nthe Constitution was ratified, and generic policy considerations)\n\nmust also be factored into the mix.\n\n           It can also be argued that, as an historical matter,\n\nself-defense circa 1968 was generally limited to assaultive crimes.\n\nSee 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 10.4(a), at 143\n\n(2d ed. 2003); George E. Dix & M. Michael Sharlot, Criminal Law:\n\nCases and Materials 776 (5th ed. 2002).6             This strong correlation\n\nbetween self-defense and assaultive crimes is evident from Leahy's\n\ncitation to Mullaney.      See Mullaney, 421 U.S. at 702 (indicating\n\nthat the discussion contained therein is intrinsically tied to\n\ncases involving the \"commission of [a] homicide\").                 We think a\n\npowerful argument can be made that, had Congress meant to weave the\n\ncommon law of self-defense into the fabric of a non-assaultive\n\noffense   like   that   created       by   the   federal   felon-in-possession\n\n\n     6\n      While some modern innovation has expanded the breadth of\nself-defense, see, e.g., Boget v. State, 74 S.W.3d 23, 29-30 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2002); see also Holliday, 457 F.3d at 127 (noting, in\nthe present tense, that \"self-defense is not limited to 'assaultive\ncrimes'\"), this relatively recent development is irrelevant to\nLeahy's argument about what the Congress that enacted section\n922(g) in 1968 intended.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fstatute, it would have represented a radical departure from the\n\nmainstream of jurisprudential thought circa 1968 and, thus, would\n\nhave       warranted   some   explicit    statement.      To    impute    such   an\n\nintention to Congress on the basis of the Dixon methodology alone\n\nwould, therefore, make very little sense.\n\n               We need not dwell on the distinction between assaultive\n\nand non-assaultive crimes, for there is a more fundamental flaw in\n\nLeahy's thesis.           The crimes historically associated with self-\n\ndefense (homicide, for example) all carry substantial mens rea\n\nrequirements.          The federal felon-in-possession statute requires\n\nproof that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm.7                         See\n\nUnited States v. Carpenter, 403 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir. 2005).                Beyond\n\nthat, however, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) is a strict liability statute,\n\nwhich contains no specific mens rea element at all.               See Dixon, 126\n\nS. Ct. at 2447; Diaz, 285 F.3d at 97.             Literally, the felon-in-\n\npossession statute encompasses both the felon who intentionally\n\narms himself to rob a bank and the felon who frustrates the robbery\n\nby snatching the gun out of the robber's hand.                 This is a salient\n\ndistinction: while an individual who kills another in self-defense\n\nlacks the malice required to support, say, a conviction for first-\n\ndegree murder, a felon who knowingly takes possession of a firearm\n\nthereby       satisfies    every   statutory    element    of     the    felon-in-\n\n\n       7\n      The justification defense asserted by Leahy in this case does\nnot go to knowledge; Leahy readily concedes that he knowingly\nseized the handgun.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fpossession offense regardless of whether he was motivated by\n\nconcern for his own safety.\n\n          The    absence   of   a   mens    rea    requirement   has   obvious\n\nimplications.    In a felon-in-possession case (unlike in, say, an\n\nassaultive   crime),   evidence     of     facts   concerning    self-defense\n\nneither contradicts nor tends to disprove any element of the\n\ncharged crime.    Cf. Dixon, 126 S. Ct. at 2444 (reaching the same\n\nconclusion as to duress vis-à-vis similar section 922 violations).\n\nThis means that disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nis not inherent in the prosecution's burden of proving every\n\nelement of the offense charged.          See generally In re Winship, 397\n\nU.S. 358, 364 (1970).       So viewed, there is no good reason to\n\neschew, in the felon-in-possession context, the burden allocation\n\nthat affirmative defenses normally carry.\n\n          Most of the other courts that have considered this\n\nquestion have come to the same conclusion.              Four of our sister\n\ncircuits have squarely confronted the issue of allocating the\n\nburden of proof on a justification defense other than duress to\n\nfederal felon-in-possession charges, where proof of the defense\n\nwould not negate any of the elements of the charged crime. Three of\n\nthe four have assigned the burden of proving such a defense to the\n\ndefendant.   See Beasley, 346 F.3d at 935; United States v. Dodd,\n\n225 F.3d 340, 350 (3d Cir. 2000); Deleveaux, 205 F.3d at 1301.\n\nAlthough one respected court of appeals has held to the contrary,\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fsee United States v. Talbott, 78 F.3d 1183, 1186 (7th Cir. 1996)\n\n(per curiam), we find the reasoning of Beasley, Dodd, and Deleveaux\n\nmore persuasive.\n\n             Leahy argues that pragmatic considerations counsel in\n\nfavor of assigning the burden of proof to the government.               We think\n\nthat these considerations tilt the other way. When self-defense is\n\nan issue in a felon-in-possession case, the defendant is likely to\n\nhave greater access to the relevant facts than the government. See\n\nDeleveaux, 205 F.3d at 1300.          While there always will be a witness\n\nwhen a defendant claims self-defense — the source of the alleged\n\nthreat   —   that   witness    may    or   may   not   be   available   and,    if\n\navailable, may or may not be cooperative.               For that reason, the\n\ndefendant, himself a witness to the threat, is better positioned\n\nthan the government to depict the circumstances under which he came\n\ninto possession of the gun.\n\n             To sum up, we confirm the suggestion previously made in\n\nHolt and Holliday, and add our voice to the weight of authority by\n\nholding that, in some circumstances, justification — a term that we\n\ndefine to include, inter alia, self-defense — can comprise an\n\naffirmative     defense   to   a     federal     felon-in-possession    charge.\n\nFurthermore, we think it highly unlikely that Congress, in enacting\n\nthe   federal   felon-in-possession        law,    intended    to   require    the\n\ngovernment to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a\n\nfact that it did not specify as an element of the offense.\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fConsequently,      we    hold     that    in    a   federal     felon-in-possession\n\nprosecution, there is no sound basis for treating that defense\n\ndifferently from other justification defenses.                     It follows that a\n\ndefendant who asserts self-defense in such a case must carry the\n\ndevoir of persuasion on that defense by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\n\n            In that regard, we adopt the four-part framework for\n\njustification discussed by the Supreme Court in Dixon, 126 S. Ct.\n\nat 2440 n.2.      That framework has been embraced by a number of other\n\ncourts. See Deleveaux, 205 F.3d at 1297 (collecting cases). Here,\n\nthe lower court used a version of that four-part framework and\n\n(apart from questioning the allocation of the burden of proof)\n\nLeahy has not challenged either the wording of the pertinent jury\n\ninstruction or the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the\n\njury's apparent rejection of justification as a defense.8\n\n            It    is    evident    from    what     we   have   said     that   Leahy's\n\nprincipal claim of error fails.                We think it is prudent, however,\n\nto   add    two   caveats.         First,        this    holding    is    limited   to\n\n\n\n     8\n      As to the second element of the framework, the court charged\nthe jury that Leahy had to prove that he did not \"recklessly\" place\nhimself in a situation in which he would be forced to engage in\ncriminal conduct. The authorities are divided on the question of\nwhether the second element extends to negligence as well as\nrecklessness. Compare, e.g., Dixon, 413 F.3d at 523 (including\nnegligence along with recklessness), with, e.g., Beasley, 346 F.3d\nat 933 n.2 (limiting the second element to reckless conduct). The\ncase at hand does not require us to take sides in this debate.\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fjustification defenses that do not go to the elements of the felon-\n\nin-possession offense.       We leave open the possibility that a\n\ndefense within the rubric of justification might negate an element\n\nof the felon-in-possession offense.      In that event, the burden of\n\ndisproving the defense would rest on the prosecution.         Second,\n\nalthough we believe it is useful to speak of a single justification\n\ndefense, we caution that different factual scenarios may require\n\nvariations in the phrasing of the four-factor test.     For example,\n\nthe first factor, which requires that the defendant be under a\n\npresent and unlawful threat of death or serious bodily injury, will\n\nrequire modification in cases in which the defendant allegedly acts\n\nin defense of a third party.    Those nuances remain to be developed\n\nin future cases.\n\nIII.   UNANIMITY\n\n           The indictment in this case contained only a single\n\ncount.   That count mentioned two guns — the pistol and the rifle —\n\nand the government adduced evidence at trial about both weapons.\n\nThe jury returned a general verdict.     Based on this collocation of\n\ncircumstances, Leahy suggests that he may have been convicted\n\nbecause some jurors believed that he possessed the rifle while\n\nothers believed that he possessed the pistol but did not act in\n\nself-defense.      To safeguard against this possibility, his thesis\n\nruns, the district court should have instructed the jury that\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\funanimity as to the identity of the weapon unlawfully possessed was\n\nrequired.\n\n            Leahy's concern for unanimity is of recent vintage: he\n\ndid not request such an instruction below. The issue is, therefore,\n\nforfeited.    See, e.g., United States v. Gomez, 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).       As a forfeited issue, it may be reviewed on appeal\n\nonly for plain error.       See id.\n\n            The    plain   error   hurdle    is   high.   United   States   v.\n\nHunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir. 1989).             To surmount it, an\n\nobjector must make four showings: \"(1) that an error occurred (2)\n\nwhich was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the\n\ndefendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).               Leahy\n\ncannot clear this four-tiered hurdle.\n\n            It is settled law that \"Congress did not intend the\n\npossession of a particular firearm to be an element of a §\n\n922(g)(1) violation.\"       United States v. Verrecchia, 196 F.3d 294,\n\n301 (1st Cir. 1999).       Consequently, there is no need for unanimity\n\nwithin the relevant unit of prosecution, that is, with respect to\n\nweapons possessed \"in one place at one time.\"             Id. at 298.\n\n            Were this objection preserved, we would be forced to\n\ndelve into the geography of the relevant unit of prosecution and\n\ndetermine whether the pistol (taken from a kitchen drawer one\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fevening) and the rifle (stowed in the pantry but perhaps handled at\n\nsome indeterminate point) were sufficiently related in \"time\" and\n\n\"place\".       But the objection was not preserved, and Verrecchia is\n\ntenebrous as to the temporal and spatial contours of the \"relevant\n\nunit of prosecution.\"           That combination defeats a claim that an\n\nobvious error occurred. Hence, Leahy cannot satisfy the strictures\n\nof plain error review.\n\nIV.    INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE\n\n               Leahy next complains that his trial counsel did not offer\n\nto stipulate to the fact the he was a previously convicted felon —\n\nan omission that opened the door for the government to introduce\n\nevidence of the unattractive particulars of Leahy's prior misdeeds.\n\nSince the government would have had no choice but to enter into\n\nsuch a stipulation upon a timely request, see Old Chief v. United\n\nStates, 519 U.S. 172, 174 (1997), this strategy does seem puzzling.\n\nThe problem, however, is that this claim is newly advanced.                  \"We\n\nhave held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-\n\nspecific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut\n\non    direct    review   of    criminal     convictions,   but,   rather,   must\n\noriginally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\"\n\nUnited States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n               To be sure, there is a narrow exception to this rule for\n\ncases   in     which   the    record   is   adequately   developed   to   permit\n\nreasoned consideration of the claim.             See, e.g., United States v.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fNatanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).         Here, however, that\n\nexception does not pertain.       The record below contains nothing\n\napproaching an adequate elaboration of why counsel adopted the\n\ncourse that he followed (Leahy suggests that his lawyer did not\n\nknow of the Old Chief decision, but that fact is not pellucid from\n\nthe record), nor does it provide the district court's first-hand\n\ninsights as to what (if any) quantum of prejudice might have\n\nattended this strategy. Given the need for further factfinding, we\n\ndecline Leahy's invitation to address the ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim for the first time on direct appeal.         Instead, we\n\nremit him, should he desire to pursue the matter, to his remedies\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255.     We intimate no view of the likely outcome\n\nof such a proceeding.\n\nV.   SENTENCING\n\n           As a tail-end matter, Leahy raises three objections to\n\nhis sentence.     We address them sequentially.\n\n                      A.   Armed Career Criminal.\n\n           As said, the district court sentenced Leahy under the\n\nArmed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).        The court\n\nadopted this taxonomy after having found that Leahy's record\n\nincluded the necessary predicate: three prior convictions for\n\nviolent felonies.     See id.    As a result of this determination,\n\nLeahy faced a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence, see id., and\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fautomatically incurred elevated criminal history and offense level\n\nplacements, see USSG §4B1.4.\n\n             Pertinently, ACCA defines a \"violent felony\" as a crime\n\npunishable by \"imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that\n\n\"involves     conduct    that   presents         a   serious   potential    risk   of\n\nphysical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). Three such\n\nfelony convictions are required to trigger the statute, and Leahy\n\nasserts that one of his three prior convictions — namely, a\n\nMassachusetts conviction for indecent assault and battery, see\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13H9 — does not qualify and, therefore,\n\nACCA does not apply.\n\n             The determination of whether a particular crime is a\n\nviolent felony is a question of law and, thus, engenders de novo\n\nreview.     See United States v. Bishop, 453 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     The question here is whether Leahy's indecent assault and\n\nbattery     conviction    is    for   a    crime     that   \"presents   a   serious\n\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\"                  We agree with the\n\nsentencing court that the conviction meets this definition.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n         The provision reads in relevant part:\n\n             Whoever commits an indecent assault and\n             battery on a person who has attained age\n             fourteen shall be punished by imprisonment in\n             the state prison for not more than five years,\n             or by imprisonment for not more than two and\n             one-half years in a jail or house of\n             correction.\n\n                                          -20-\n\f          The methodology for deducing whether a given offense\n\nconstitutes a violent felony derives from Taylor v. United States,\n\n495 U.S. 575 (1990).   We take a categorical approach, looking to\n\nthe fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the offense.\n\nId. at 602.   If a statute encompasses acts that could constitute\n\nboth violent and non-violent felonies, we may also look to certain\n\nmaterials particular to a given case (such as the charging document\n\nand jury instructions).       See id.; see also Shepard v. United\n\nStates, 544 U.S. 13, 26 (2005).\n\n          The district court concluded that, under this approach,\n\nall section 13H convictions were convictions for violent felonies.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the court relied heavily on Sutherland\n\nv. Reno, 228 F.3d 171, 177 (2d Cir. 2000), in which the Second\n\nCircuit found, in an immigration proceeding, that a conviction\n\nunder section 13H was a conviction for a \"crime of violence.\"   For\n\nthe Sutherland court, the pivotal fact was that \"lack of consent is\n\n. . . a requisite element of a § 13H violation.\"        Id. at 176\n\n(citing Maghsoudi v. INS, 181 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1999)).   Since\n\n\"the crime involves a non-consensual act upon another person, there\n\nis a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course\n\nof committing the offense.\"    Id. (quoting United States v. Reyes-\n\nCastro, 13 F.3d 377, 379 (10th Cir. 1993)).\n\n          Leahy attempts to distinguish Sutherland by noting that\n\nthe opinion deals with the definition of \"crime of violence\" found\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fin 8 U.S.C. § 16(b).      Building on that foundation, he points out\n\nthat while ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" has been deemed\n\nsubstantively identical to the definition of \"crime of violence\"\n\nused in the federal sentencing guidelines, see United States v.\n\nJackson, 409 F.3d 479, 480 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005), both the Supreme\n\nCourt and this court have distinguished section 16(b) from the\n\npertinent guidelines provision, USSG §4B1.2, on the ground that the\n\nformer is concerned with a risk of force whereas the latter is\n\nconcerned with risk of injury.      See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1,\n\n10 n.7 (2004); Aguiar v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 86, 88 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nLeahy deploys the transitive property to reach the conclusion that\n\nACCA must also be distinguishable from section 16(b).               He then\n\nargues   that   while   indecent   assault   and   battery   may   entail   a\n\nsubstantial risk of force, offensive touching does not entail a\n\nserious risk of physical injury.\n\n           Leahy's argument does not withstand scrutiny.           To begin,\n\nboth Leocal and Aguiar treat section 4B1.2 as reaching conduct\n\nbeyond the scope of section 16(b).        See Leocal, 543 U.S. at 10 n.7;\n\nAguiar, 438 F.3d at 88.     Neither decision in any way suggests that\n\nthe reverse is true.     Moreover, even if one can conceive of a risk\n\nof force bereft of a corresponding risk of injury, the logic of\n\nSutherland still would compel the result reached by the district\n\ncourt.   After all, just as there is \"a substantial risk that force\n\nmay be used in order to overcome the victim's lack of consent,\"\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fSutherland, 228 F.3d at 176, so too is there a substantial risk of\n\nphysical injury from the unwanted touching.10\n\n          This conclusion is buttressed by our decision in United\n\nStates v. McVicar, 907 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1990).    There, we held that\n\na statute encompassing the crime of pickpocketing satisfied section\n\n4B1.2 because \"[t]aking property directly from a person seems to us\n\nto run a 'substantial' or 'serious' risk that 'physical force' or\n\n'physical injury' will follow.\"     Id. at 2.   If the risk of injury\n\npresented by pickpocketing — a crime in which the perpetrator's\n\ngoal is to leave his victim unaware of the contact — satisfies\n\nsection 4B1.2 (and, by extension, ACCA), it seems inescapable that\n\nthe risk of physical injury posed by a crime in which the touching\n\nis the end, not merely the means, would likewise entail the\n\nnecessary degree of risk.\n\n          Leahy makes much of the fact that Massachusetts does not\n\ninclude indecent assault and battery in its own list of \"sexually\n\nviolent offenses.\"     See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, § 178C.   That fact\n\nis of little moment.    \"Because a state's classification of a crime\n\ngenerally reflects different policy considerations than the federal\n\nclassification, it is simply not relevant to the determination of\n\n\n     10\n      Both sides debate the significance to this issue of our\ndecision in United States v. Sherwood, 156 F.3d 219 (1st Cir.\n1998). However, that case involved a child molestation statute and\nthe opinion is largely focused on the special vulnerability of\nyoung children. See id. at 221-22. With respect to the case at\nhand, we think that the logic used in Sutherland hits closer to\nhome.\n\n                                 -23-\n\fwhether a crime is a 'violent felony,' which, under federal law, is\n\nbased on an assessment of the risk of physical injury associated\n\nwith the typical conduct underlying that crime.\"                    United States v.\n\nSacko, 247 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            The   short   of    it    is     that   the   lower     court    correctly\n\nsentenced Leahy as an armed career criminal.\n\n                        B.     Judicial Factfinding.\n\n            When a defendant is found to be an armed career criminal,\n\nUSSG §4B1.4 applies to his case.              By reason of that paradigm, the\n\ndefendant   faces     increases      in    both     his   offense    level    and   his\n\ncriminal history category if he is found to have used or possessed\n\nthe firearm in connection with a crime of violence (whether charged\n\nor uncharged). See Holliday, 457 F.3d at 130.                         Applying this\n\nguideline, the district court found, under a preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard, that Leahy, during his interactions with the\n\ngaggle of teenagers on July 27, 2003, had committed the uncharged\n\nstate crimes of aggravated assault and reckless conduct.                      See Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, §§ 208, 211.                      The court upwardly\n\nadjusted    Leahy's    offense       level    and    criminal     history    category\n\naccordingly.\n\n            Leahy argues that, under the Sixth Amendment, he was\n\nentitled to have these determinations made by a jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.         He frankly acknowledges that this argument\n\ncontradicts the combined holding of United States v. Watts, 519\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\fU.S. 148, 157 (1997) (per curiam), and Almendarez-Torres v. United\n\nStates, 523 U.S. 224, 226-27 (1998).                He nonetheless posits that\n\nthey have not survived the decision in United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005).\n\n           This argument need not detain us.              We have recently held\n\nin precisely analogous circumstances (involving a USSG §4B1.4\n\nenhancement predicated upon an uncharged crime of violence) that\n\n\"even after Booker, [there is no need that] the facts underlying\n\nthe enhancement be found by a jury.           Under the advisory guidelines\n\nregime,   the   district     court   can     use    the   preponderance   of   the\n\nevidence standard to determine whether an enhancement applies.\"\n\nHolliday, 457 at 130.        This holding obliterates Leahy's objection.\n\n                      C.    Obstruction of Justice.\n\n           Finally,        Leahy   objects     to    a    two-level   sentencing\n\nenhancement for obstruction of justice.               See USSG §3C1.1.    In his\n\nview, the enhancement rests on shaky ground because the sentencing\n\ncourt did not make findings that identified perjurious statements\n\nwith particularity. See United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 98\n\n(1993).\n\n           Our review of the record indicates that the district\n\ncourt in fact identified some aspects of Leahy's testimony that it\n\nfound incredible.      Still, it is unnecessary to probe that point;\n\nthe short, dispositive rejoinder to Leahy's plaint is that any\n\nerror was harmless.        We explain briefly.\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\f            On   the    basis    of    its   determination    that   Leahy   had\n\nobstructed justice, the district court adjusted his offense level\n\nfrom 28 to 30.     This adjustment became irrelevant, however, when\n\nthe court found Leahy to have been an armed career criminal who\n\npossessed a firearm in connection with an uncharged crime of\n\nviolence.    See supra Parts V(A)-(B).            That finding triggered an\n\noverriding offense level of 34, which came into play without regard\n\nto other enhancements. See USSG §4B1.4(b). The superimposition of\n\nthis enhancement rendered the putative enhancement for obstruction\n\nof justice moot.        See United States v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22, 29-30\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\nVI.

Diaz,</i> 285 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2002), concerning the allocation of the burden of proof when a criminal defendant in a federal felon-in-possession case attempts to exonerate himself by claiming that he took possession of the firearm purely in self-defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We hold that there is a justification defense available in felon-in-possession cases, which typically encompasses duress, necessity, and self-defense. Relatedly, we hold that where, as here, proof of the justification defense does not negate an element of the charged crime, the burden of proof in connection with that defense rests with the defendant. These holdings, coupled with our rejection of a variety of other proffered assignments of error, lead us to affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the factual scenario portrayed at trial is littered with testimonial conflicts and is at some points shrouded in ambiguity, the facts relevant to this appeal are comparatively straightforward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 2003, defendant-appellant Jesse Leahy, a convicted felon, had an altercation with a group of teenagers near his mother's home in Kezar Falls, Maine. According to Leahy, he withdrew from the scene, but the youths followed him and attempted forcibly to enter his mother's house. Ostensibly fearing the maddened crowd, Leahy grabbed an Astra 9mm pistol that he knew his mother kept in a kitchen drawer. He emerged from the residence armed and confronted his tormentors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the ensuing imbroglio, Leahy admittedly fired the weapon. The protagonists' versions of what happened differ materially. Leahy asserts that he did no more than fire warning shots into the ground to scare away attackers who were attempting to inflict serious bodily injury on him. Other witnesses describe Leahy as the aggressor and assert that he chased after the youths, shot towards them, and pistol-whipped two of their number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the youths fled. Once that occurred, Leahy went back into the dwelling and hid the gun. Police soon arrived at the scene. After a twelve-hour standoff, they entered the premises and arrested Leahy. A search revealed not only the hidden pistol but also a Marlin rifle stashed in a pantry closet. Male DNA profiles found on the rifle were consistent with those found on the pistol (although no DNA was specifically matched to Leahy). In due season, a federal grand jury handed up an indictment that charged Leahy with being a felon in possession of a firearm. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). The indictment referenced both the pistol and the rifle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's criminal record included felony convictions for assault and carrying a dangerous weapon. At trial, his then-counsel did not press for a stipulation that Leahy was a previously convicted felon (one exchange with the judge suggests that counsel may not have realized that he could compel the government to stipulate to this point). In the absence of a stipulation, the prosecutor was able to introduce independent evidence of the prior convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once both sides had rested, Leahy proffered a proposed instruction on self-defense &#8212; one that placed the burden of proof on the prosecution to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The government rejoined that the facts did not warrant a self-defense instruction. The district court took a middle path: over Leahy's objection, it gave an instruction on \"justification\" (defined so as to encompass self-defense), in which it told the jury, in effect, that Leahy's possession of a firearm would be justified (and, therefore, a guilty verdict would be unwarranted) if (i) Leahy was under an unlawful and present threat of death or serious bodily injury; (ii) he did not recklessly place himself in a situation in which he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct; (iii) he had no reasonable legal alternative but to engage in that conduct; and (iv) there was a direct causal relationship between his criminal conduct and the need to avoid the threatened harm. This instruction treated justification as an affirmative defense, <i>see United States v. Willis,</i> 38 F.3d 170, 179 (5th Cir.1994), and placed the burden on Leahy to prove that affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following deliberations, the jury found Leahy guilty. At the disposition hearing, the district court, finding that in the past Leahy had thrice been convicted of violent felonies, classified him as an armed career criminal. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). The court also determined that Leahy was subject to two separate sentencing enhancements, one for possessing the firearm in connection with an uncharged crime of violence and the other for obstruction of justice arising out of perjurious trial testimony. After making a series of other findings and computations, the court imposed a 262-month incarcerative sentence. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. BURDEN OF PROOF</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's flagship claim is that, once he had made a threshold showing of self-defense, the district court erred in requiring him to prove self-defense rather than requiring the government to negate his colorable claim. The proper allocation of the burden of proof on such a defense, however denominated, is an open question in this circuit with respect to felon-in-possession cases. <i>See Diaz,</i> 285 F.3d at 97. The Constitution permits us to answer this question either way; there is no constitutional requirement that the burden of disproving self-defense reside with the prosecution. <i>See Patterson v. New York,</i> 432 U.S. 197, 210-211, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977) (upholding murder statute that placed burden of proving affirmative defense on defendant when proof of that defense did not negate an element of the offense). Because the question turns on what is essentially a matter of statutory interpretation &#8212; what Congress intended &#8212; we afford de novo review. <i>See United States v. Hartsock,</i> 347 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We introduce our analysis in case-specific terms. The principal issue at trial was whether Leahy, as a convicted felon, was legally justified in taking possession of the handgun. The government argued that Leahy was not so justified because he was the aggressor and, moreover, he was never under any realistic threat of imminent harm. Leahy, in contrast, argued that his bona fide fear of imminent harm justified him in taking possession of the handgun and defensively using it to repel his attackers. <i>Cf. United States v. Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d 121, 127 (1st Cir.2006) (explaining that a felon possessing a gun to \"avoid the imminent danger of his own death\" is \"the classic scenario in a self-defense case\"). This issue calls into question whether justification is a defense to a felon-in-possession charge and if so, which party bears the burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal felon-in-possession statute itself, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), makes no express provision for any affirmative defenses. Thus, the logical starting place is the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Dixon v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2437, 165 L.Ed.2d 299 (2006). There, the Court assumed arguendo that duress would be a viable defense to a section 922 charge<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and, on that assumption, ruled that the defendant should bear the burden of proving duress. <i>Id.</i> at 2447. The Court noted that the court of appeals had distilled the defense into four elements. <i>See id.</i> at 2440 n. 2. With one exception, discussed <i>infra</i> note 8, those four elements were nearly identical to the elements of \"justification\" delineated by the trial court in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the <i>Dixon</i> Court, for this purpose, used the term \"duress,\" that usage appears to have been a carry-over of the usage employed below. <i>See United States v. Dixon,</i> 413 F.3d 520, 525 (5th Cir.2005) (using \"duress\" and \"justification\" interchangeably). This imprecision is understandable. Since the federal felon-in-possession statute does not explicitly admit of any affirmative defenses, courts have been able only to infer the availability of such defenses, though in appropriate circumstances they have not hesitated to do so. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d 1292, 1297 &amp; n. 7 (11th Cir.2000) (collecting cases from six other circuits). We ourselves have intimated that, in appropriate circumstances, we would recognize a justification defense to a federal felon-in-possession charge. <i>See United States v. Holt,</i> 464 F.3d 101, 107 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 127 (assuming, arguendo, the availability of a justification defense of self-defense in a &#167; 922(g) case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This inferential process, which requires courts to draw on common law doctrines, has produced confusion over nomenclature. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Panter,</i> 688 F.2d 268, 272 n. 7 (5th Cir. 1982) (discussing whether \"necessity\" or \"self-defense\" is the appropriate label for a defense to a federal felon-in-possession charge). Many courts have sought to avoid this confusion by treating a compendium of common law defenses &#8212; duress, necessity, and self-defense &#8212; as interchangeable in this context (that is, in a felon-in-possession case in which proof of the affirmative defense will not negate any element of the charged crime) and lumping them under the rubric of \"justification.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See, e.g., United States v. Beasley,</i> 346 F.3d 930, 934-35 (9th Cir.2003); <i>see also Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1295 n. 2 (collecting cases). Our canvass of the authorities elsewhere discloses that although some courts have performed separate self-defense and necessity analyses, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Elder,</i> 16 F.3d 733, 738-39 (7th Cir.1994); <i>see also Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 127-28 &amp; n. 8 (discussing self-defense and necessity separately, but taking no position on whether those defenses could be viewed as interchangeable), no case holds that the burden of proof will vary automatically depending on whether duress, necessity, or self-defense is asserted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We conclude, therefore, that ease in administration favors treating these three defenses, in a federal felon-in-possession case, under a single, unitary rubric: justification. This conclusion is important because it strongly suggests that <i>Dixon</i> &#8212; which, as we have said, placed the burden of proving duress on the defendant &#8212; bars Leahy's path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In hopes of distinguishing <i>Dixon,</i> Leahy beseeches us to disambiguate self-defense from the broader category of justification. He emphasizes that the <i>Dixon</i> Court looked at the state of the law in 1968 (when Congress first conceived the federal felon-in-possession statute)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> to help determine what allocation of the burden of proof Congress most likely would have chosen had it inserted a duress defense into the statutory text. <i>See Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2445-47. He then asseverates, citing <i>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</i> 421 U.S. 684, 702 n. 30, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), that the same methodology, if applied in this case, would favor placing the burden of proof on the prosecution because, in 1968, that was the majority rule in self-defense cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's premise is incorrect. Although seven Justices joined the opinion of the <i>Dixon</i> Court, Justice Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion that distanced him from the date-centric methodology employed in that opinion and wrote that, as a general matter, \"we can assume that Congress would not want to foreclose the courts from consulting . . . newer sources and considering innovative arguments.\" <i>Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2448 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Alito, joined by Justice Scalia, also wrote a separate concurrence rejecting reliance on the date-centric methodology and stressing the value of looking to the state of the law \"when Congress began enacting federal criminal statutes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2449 (Alito, J., concurring). Finally, Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Souter, wrote a dissent in which he argued that determination of the appropriate burden of proof allocation was a question of federal common law. <i>Id.</i> at 2450 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (explicitly declining to follow the date-centric approach). Thus, the most that we can glean from the several opinions in <i>Dixon</i> is that the state of the law in 1968 is one possible source of enlightenment as to how Congress would have wanted to allocate the burden of proof had it explicitly created a justification defense to a felon-in-possession charge; other possible sources of enlightenment (such as the nature of the offense, the evolution of the defense and its accouterments when the Constitution was ratified, and generic policy considerations) must also be factored into the mix.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It can also be argued that, as an historical matter, self-defense circa 1968 was generally limited to assaultive crimes. <i>See</i> 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 10.4(a), at 143 (2d ed.2003); George E. Dix &amp; M. Michael Sharlot, Criminal Law: Cases and Materials 776 (5th ed.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> This strong correlation between self-defense and assaultive crimes is evident from Leahy's citation to <i>Mullaney. See Mullaney,</i> 421 U.S. at 702, 95 S.Ct. 1881 (indicating that the discussion contained therein is intrinsically tied to cases involving the \"commission of [a] homicide\"). We think a powerful argument can be made that, had Congress meant to weave the common law of self-defense into the fabric of a non-assaultive offense like that created by the federal felon-in-possession statute, it would have represented a radical departure from the mainstream of jurisprudential thought circa 1968 and, thus, would have warranted some explicit statement. To impute such an intention to Congress on the basis of the <i>Dixon</i> methodology alone would, therefore, make very little sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell on the distinction between assaultive and non-assaultive crimes, for there is a more fundamental flaw in Leahy's thesis. The crimes historically associated with self-defense (homicide, for example) all carry substantial mens rea requirements. The federal felon-in-possession statute requires proof that the defendant <i>knowingly</i> possessed a firearm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See United States v. Carpenter,</i> 403 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir.2005). Beyond that, however, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) is a strict liability statute, which contains no specific mens rea element at all. <i>See Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2447; <i>Diaz,</i> 285 F.3d at 97. Literally, the felon-in-possession statute encompasses both the felon who intentionally arms himself to rob a bank and the felon who frustrates the robbery by snatching the gun out of the robber's hand. This is a salient distinction: while an individual who kills another in self-defense lacks the malice required to support, say, a conviction for first-degree murder, a felon who knowingly takes possession of a firearm thereby satisfies every statutory element of the felon-in-possession offense regardless of whether he was motivated by concern for his own safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of a mens rea requirement has obvious implications. In a felon-in-possession case (unlike in, say, an assaultive crime), evidence of facts concerning self-defense neither contradicts nor tends to disprove any element of the charged crime. <i>Cf. Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2444 (reaching the same conclusion as to duress vis-&#224;-vis similar section 922 violations). This means that disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt is not inherent in the prosecution's burden of proving every element of the offense charged. <i>See generally In re Winship,</i> 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). So viewed, there is no good reason to eschew, in the felon-in-possession context, the burden allocation that affirmative defenses normally carry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the other courts that have considered this question have come to the same conclusion. Four of our sister circuits have squarely confronted the issue of allocating the burden of proof on a justification defense other than duress to federal felon-in-possession charges, where proof of the defense would not negate any of the elements of the charged crime. Three of the four have assigned the burden of proving such a defense to the defendant. <i>See Beasley,</i> 346 F.3d at 935; <i>United States v. Dodd,</i> 225 F.3d 340, 350 (3d Cir.2000); <i>Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1301. Although one respected court of appeals has held to the contrary, <i>see United States v. Talbott,</i> 78 F.3d 1183, 1186 (7th Cir.1996) (per curiam), we find the reasoning of <i>Beasley, Dodd,</i> and <i>Deleveaux</i> more persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy argues that pragmatic considerations counsel in favor of assigning the burden of proof to the government. We think that these considerations tilt the other way. When self-defense is an issue in a felon-in-possession case, the defendant is likely to have greater access to the relevant facts than the government. <i>See Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1300. While there always will be a witness when a defendant claims self-defense &#8212; the source of the alleged threat &#8212; that witness may or may not be available and, if available, may or may not be cooperative. For that reason, the defendant, himself a witness to the threat, is better positioned than the government to depict the circumstances under which he came into possession of the gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we confirm the suggestion previously made in <i>Holt</i> and <i>Holliday,</i> and add our voice to the weight of authority by holding that, in some circumstances, justification &#8212; a term that we define to include, inter alia, self-defense &#8212; can comprise an affirmative defense to a federal felon-in-possession charge. Furthermore, we think it highly unlikely that Congress, in enacting the federal felon-in-possession law, intended to require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a fact that it did not specify as an element of the offense. Consequently, we hold that in a federal felon-in-possession prosecution, there is no sound basis for treating that defense differently from other justification defenses. It follows that a defendant who asserts self-defense in such a case must carry the devoir of persuasion on that defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that regard, we adopt the four-part framework for justification discussed by the Supreme Court in <i>Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2440 n. 2. That framework has been embraced by a number of other courts. <i>See Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1297 (collecting cases). Here, the lower court used a version of that four-part framework and (apart from questioning the allocation of the burden of proof) Leahy has not challenged either the wording of the pertinent jury instruction or the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the jury's apparent rejection of justification as a defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from what we have said that Leahy's principal claim of error fails. We think it is prudent, however, to add two caveats. First, this holding is limited to justification defenses that do not go to the elements of the felon-in-possession offense. We leave open the possibility that a defense within the rubric of justification might negate an element of the felon-in-possession offense. In that event, the burden of disproving the defense would rest on the prosecution. Second, although we believe it is useful to speak of a single justification defense, we caution that different factual scenarios may require variations in the phrasing of the four-factor test. For example, the first factor, which requires that the defendant be under a present and unlawful threat of death or serious bodily injury, will require modification in cases in which the defendant allegedly acts in defense of a third party. Those nuances remain to be developed in future cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. UNANIMITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment in this case contained only a single count. That count mentioned two guns &#8212; the pistol and the rifle &#8212; and the government adduced evidence at trial about both weapons. The jury returned a general verdict. Based on this collocation of circumstances, Leahy suggests that he may have been convicted because some jurors believed that he possessed the rifle while others believed that he possessed the pistol but did not act in self-defense. To safeguard against this possibility, his thesis runs, the district court should have instructed the jury that unanimity <i>as to the identity of the weapon unlawfully possessed</i> was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's concern for unanimity is of recent vintage: he did not request such an instruction below. The issue is, therefore, forfeited. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2001). As a forfeited issue, it may be reviewed on appeal only for plain error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain error hurdle is high. <i>United States v. Hunnewell,</i> 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir.1989). To surmount it, an objector must make four showings: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Leahy cannot clear this four-tiered hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled law that \"Congress did not intend the possession of a particular firearm to be an element of a &#167; 922(g)(1) violation.\" <i>United States v. Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d 294, 301 (1st Cir.1999). Consequently, there is no need for unanimity within the relevant unit of prosecution, that is, with respect to weapons possessed \"in one place at one time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 298.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were this objection preserved, we would be forced to delve into the geography of the relevant unit of prosecution and determine whether the pistol (taken from a kitchen drawer one evening) and the rifle (stowed in the pantry but perhaps handled at some indeterminate point) were sufficiently related in \"time\" and \"place\". But the objection was not preserved, and <i>Verrecchia</i> is tenebrous as to the temporal and spatial contours of the \"relevant unit of prosecution.\" That combination defeats a claim that an <i>obvious</i> error occurred. Hence, Leahy cannot satisfy the strictures of plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy next complains that his trial counsel did not offer to stipulate to the fact the he was a previously convicted felon &#8212; an omission that opened the door for the government to introduce evidence of the unattractive particulars of Leahy's prior misdeeds. Since the government would have had no choice but to enter into such a stipulation upon a timely request, <i>see Old Chief v. United States,</i> 519 U.S. 172, 174, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), this strategy does seem puzzling. The problem, however, is that this claim is newly advanced. \"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there is a narrow exception to this rule for cases in which the record is adequately developed to permit reasoned consideration of the claim. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Natanel,</i> 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.1991). Here, however, that exception does not pertain. The record below contains nothing approaching an adequate elaboration of why counsel adopted the course that he followed (Leahy suggests that his lawyer did not know of the <i>Old Chief</i> decision, but that fact is not pellucid from the record), nor does it provide the district court's first-hand insights as to what (if any) quantum of prejudice might have attended this strategy. Given the need for further factfinding, we decline Leahy's invitation to address the ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the first time on direct appeal. Instead, we remit him, should he desire to pursue the matter, to his remedies under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. We intimate no view of the likely outcome of such a proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a tail-end matter, Leahy raises three objections to his sentence. We address them sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Armed Career Criminal.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the district court sentenced Leahy under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). The court adopted this taxonomy after having found that Leahy's record included the necessary predicate: three prior convictions for violent felonies. <i>See id.</i> As a result of this determination, Leahy faced a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence, <i>see id.,</i> and automatically incurred elevated criminal history and offense level placements, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 4B1.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pertinently, ACCA defines a \"violent felony\" as a crime punishable by \"imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B). Three such felony convictions are required to trigger the statute, and Leahy asserts that one of his three prior convictions &#8212; namely, a Massachusetts conviction for indecent assault and battery, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167; 13H<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> &#8212; does not qualify and, therefore, ACCA does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination of whether a particular crime is a violent felony is a question of law and, thus, engenders de novo review. <i>See United States v. Bishop,</i> 453 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir.2006). The question here is whether Leahy's indecent assault and battery conviction is for a crime that \"presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" We agree with the sentencing court that the conviction meets this definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The methodology for deducing whether a given offense constitutes a violent felony derives from <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). We take a categorical approach, looking to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the offense. <i>Id.</i> at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. If a statute encompasses acts that could constitute both violent and non-violent felonies, we may also look to certain materials particular to a given case (such as the charging document and jury instructions). <i>See id.; see also Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that, under this approach, all section 13H convictions were convictions for violent felonies. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied heavily on <i>Sutherland v. Reno,</i> 228 F.3d 171, 177 (2d Cir.2000), in which the Second Circuit found, in an immigration proceeding, that a conviction under section 13H was a conviction for a \"crime of violence.\" For the <i>Sutherland</i> court, the pivotal fact was that \"lack of consent is . . . a requisite element of a &#167; 13H violation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 176 (citing <i>Maghsoudi v. INS,</i> 181 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.1999)). Since \"the crime involves a non-consensual act upon another person, there is a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Reyes-Castro,</i> 13 F.3d 377, 379 (10th Cir.1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy attempts to distinguish <i>Sutherland</i> by noting that the opinion deals with the definition of \"crime of violence\" found in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16(b). Building on that foundation, he points out that while ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" has been deemed substantively identical to the definition of \"crime of violence\" used in the federal sentencing guidelines, <i>see United</i> <i>States v. Jackson,</i> 409 F.3d 479, 480 n. 1 (1st Cir.2005), both the Supreme Court and this court have distinguished section 16(b) from the pertinent guidelines provision, USSG &#167; 4B1.2, on the ground that the former is concerned with a risk of force whereas the latter is concerned with risk of injury. <i>See Leocal v. Ashcroft,</i> 543 U.S. 1, 10 n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004); <i>Aguiar v. Gonzales,</i> 438 F.3d 86, 88 (1st Cir.2006). Leahy deploys the transitive property to reach the conclusion that ACCA must also be distinguishable from section 16(b). He then argues that while indecent assault and battery may entail a substantial risk of force, offensive touching does not entail a serious risk of physical injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's argument does not withstand scrutiny. To begin, both <i>Leocal</i> and <i>Aguiar</i> treat section 4B1.2 as reaching conduct <i>beyond</i> the scope of section 16(b). <i>See Leocal,</i> 543 U.S. at 10 n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 377; <i>Aguiar,</i> 438 F.3d at 88. Neither decision in any way suggests that the reverse is true. Moreover, even if one can conceive of a risk of force bereft of a corresponding risk of injury, the logic of <i>Sutherland</i> still would compel the result reached by the district court. After all, just as there is \"a substantial risk that force <i>may</i> be used in order to overcome the victim's lack of consent,\" <i>Sutherland,</i> 228 F.3d at 176, so too is there a substantial risk of physical injury from the unwanted touching.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is buttressed by our decision in <i>United States v. McVicar,</i> 907 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1990). There, we held that a statute encompassing the crime of pickpocketing satisfied section 4B1.2 because \"[t]aking property directly from a person seems to us to run a `substantial' or `serious' risk that `physical force' or `physical injury' will follow.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2. If the risk of injury presented by pickpocketing &#8212; a crime in which the perpetrator's goal is to leave his victim unaware of the contact &#8212; satisfies section 4B1.2 (and, by extension, ACCA), it seems inescapable that the risk of physical injury posed by a crime in which the touching is the end, not merely the means, would likewise entail the necessary degree of risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy makes much of the fact that Massachusetts does not include indecent assault and battery in its own list of \"sexually violent offenses.\" <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &#167; 178C. That fact is of little moment. \"Because a state's classification of a crime generally reflects different policy considerations than the federal classification, it is simply not relevant to the determination of whether a crime is a `violent felony,' which, under federal law, is based on an assessment of the risk of physical injury associated with the typical conduct underlying that crime.\" <i>United States v. Sacko,</i> 247 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the lower court correctly sentenced Leahy as an armed career criminal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Judicial Factfinding.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant is found to be an armed career criminal, USSG &#167; 4B1.4 applies to his case. By reason of that paradigm, the defendant faces increases in both his offense level and his criminal history category if he is found to have used or possessed the firearm in connection with a crime of violence (whether charged or uncharged). <i>See Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 130. Applying this guideline, the district court found, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that Leahy, during his interactions with the gaggle of teenagers on July 27, 2003, had committed the uncharged state crimes of aggravated assault and reckless conduct. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167;&#167; 208, 211. The court upwardly adjusted Leahy's offense level and criminal history category accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy argues that, under the Sixth Amendment, he was entitled to have these determinations made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He frankly acknowledges that this argument contradicts the combined holding of <i>United States v. Watts,</i> 519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (per curiam), and <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). He nonetheless posits that they have not survived the decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument need not detain us. We have recently held in precisely analogous circumstances (involving a USSG &#167; 4B1.4 enhancement predicated upon an uncharged crime of violence) that \"even after <i>Booker,</i> [there is no need that] the facts underlying the enhancement be found by a jury. Under the advisory guidelines regime, the district court can use the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether an enhancement applies.\" <i>Holiday,</i> 457 at 130. This holding obliterates Leahy's objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Obstruction of Justice.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Leahy objects to a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3C1.1. In his view, the enhancement rests on shaky ground because the sentencing court did not make findings that identified perjurious statements with particularity. <i>See United States v. Dunnigan,</i> 507 U.S. 87, 98, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record indicates that the district court in fact identified some aspects of Leahy's testimony that it found incredible. Still, it is unnecessary to probe that point; the short, dispositive rejoinder to Leahy's plaint is that any error was harmless. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of its determination that Leahy had obstructed justice, the district court adjusted his offense level from 28 to 30. This adjustment became irrelevant, however, when the court found Leahy to have been an armed career criminal who possessed a firearm in connection with an uncharged crime of violence. <i>See supra</i> Parts V(A)-(B). That finding triggered an overriding offense level of 34, which came into play without regard to other enhancements. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 4B1.4(b). The superimposition of this enhancement rendered the putative enhancement for obstruction of justice moot. <i>See United States v. Cruz,</i> 156 F.3d 22, 29-30 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For aught that appears, Leahy was fairly tried, justly convicted, and lawfully sentenced.

Transcript of Oral Argument, <i>Dixon v. United States,</i> 126 S.Ct. 2437, 2440 (2006).

That statute included an early precursor to section 922(g)(1)<i>See id.</i> at &#167; 922(f), 82 Stat. at 231.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> While some modern innovation has expanded the breadth of self-defense,<i>see, e.g., Boget v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the factual scenario portrayed at trial is littered with testimonial conflicts and is at some points shrouded in ambiguity, the facts relevant to this appeal are comparatively straightforward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 2003, defendant-appellant Jesse Leahy, a convicted felon, had an altercation with a group of teenagers near his mother's home in Kezar Falls, Maine. According to Leahy, he withdrew from the scene, but the youths followed him and attempted forcibly to enter his mother's house. Ostensibly fearing the maddened crowd, Leahy grabbed an Astra 9mm pistol that he knew his mother kept in a kitchen drawer. He emerged from the residence armed and confronted his tormentors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the ensuing imbroglio, Leahy admittedly fired the weapon. The protagonists' versions of what happened differ materially. Leahy asserts that he did no more than fire warning shots into the ground to scare away attackers who were attempting to inflict serious bodily injury on him. Other witnesses describe Leahy as the aggressor and assert that he chased after the youths, shot towards them, and pistol-whipped two of their number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the youths fled. Once that occurred, Leahy went back into the dwelling and hid the gun. Police soon arrived at the scene. After a twelve-hour standoff, they entered the premises and arrested Leahy. A search revealed not only the hidden pistol but also a Marlin rifle stashed in a pantry closet. Male DNA profiles found on the rifle were consistent with those found on the pistol (although no DNA was specifically matched to Leahy). In due season, a federal grand jury handed up an indictment that charged Leahy with being a felon in possession of a firearm. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). The indictment referenced both the pistol and the rifle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's criminal record included felony convictions for assault and carrying a dangerous weapon. At trial, his then-counsel did not press for a stipulation that Leahy was a previously convicted felon (one exchange with the judge suggests that counsel may not have realized that he could compel the government to stipulate to this point). In the absence of a stipulation, the prosecutor was able to introduce independent evidence of the prior convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once both sides had rested, Leahy proffered a proposed instruction on self-defense &#8212; one that placed the burden of proof on the prosecution to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The government rejoined that the facts did not warrant a self-defense instruction. The district court took a middle path: over Leahy's objection, it gave an instruction on \"justification\" (defined so as to encompass self-defense), in which it told the jury, in effect, that Leahy's possession of a firearm would be justified (and, therefore, a guilty verdict would be unwarranted) if (i) Leahy was under an unlawful and present threat of death or serious bodily injury; (ii) he did not recklessly place himself in a situation in which he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct; (iii) he had no reasonable legal alternative but to engage in that conduct; and (iv) there was a direct causal relationship between his criminal conduct and the need to avoid the threatened harm. This instruction treated justification as an affirmative defense, <i>see United States v. Willis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680723\"><a href=\"/opinion/680723/united-states-v-kathy-evelyn-willis/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 179 (5th Cir.1994), and placed the burden on Leahy to prove that affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following deliberations, the jury found Leahy guilty. At the disposition hearing, the district court, finding that in the past Leahy had thrice been convicted of violent felonies, classified him as an armed career criminal. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). The court also determined that Leahy was subject to two separate sentencing enhancements, one for possessing the firearm in connection with an uncharged crime of violence and the other for obstruction of justice arising out of perjurious trial testimony. After making a series of other findings and computations, the court imposed a 262-month incarcerative sentence. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. BURDEN OF PROOF</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's flagship claim is that, once he had made a threshold showing of self-defense, the district court erred in requiring him to prove self-defense rather than requiring the government to negate his colorable claim. The proper allocation of the burden of proof on such a defense, however denominated, is an open question in this circuit with respect to felon-in-possession cases. <i>See Diaz,</i> 285 F.3d at 97. The Constitution permits us to answer this question either way; there is no constitutional requirement that the burden of disproving self-defense reside with the prosecution. <i>See Patterson v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109698\"><a href=\"/opinion/109698/patterson-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 210-211, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109698\"><a href=\"/opinion/109698/patterson-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span> (1977) (upholding murder statute that placed burden of proving affirmative defense on defendant when proof of that defense did not negate an element of the offense). Because the question turns on what is essentially a matter of statutory interpretation &#8212; what Congress intended &#8212; we afford de novo review. <i>See United States v. Hartsock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783915\"><a href=\"/opinion/783915/united-states-v-willard-hartsock/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We introduce our analysis in case-specific terms. The principal issue at trial was whether Leahy, as a convicted felon, was legally justified in taking possession of the handgun. The government argued that Leahy was not so justified because he was the aggressor and, moreover, he was never under any realistic threat of imminent harm. Leahy, in contrast, argued that his bona fide fear of imminent harm justified him in taking possession of the handgun and defensively using it to repel his attackers. <i>Cf. United States v. Holliday,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></span>, 127 (1st Cir.2006) (explaining that a felon possessing a gun to \"avoid the imminent danger of his own death\" is \"the classic scenario in a self-defense case\"). This issue calls into question whether justification is a defense to a felon-in-possession charge and if so, which party bears the burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal felon-in-possession statute itself, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), makes no express provision for any affirmative defenses. Thus, the logical starting place is the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Dixon v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145638\"><a href=\"/opinion/145638/dixon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span> (2006). There, the Court assumed arguendo that duress would be a viable defense to a section 922 charge<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and, on that assumption, ruled that the defendant should bear the burden of proving duress. <i>Id.</i> at 2447. The Court noted that the court of appeals had distilled the defense into four elements. <i>See id.</i> at 2440 n. 2. With one exception, discussed <i>infra</i> note 8, those four elements were nearly identical to the elements of \"justification\" delineated by the trial court in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the <i>Dixon</i> Court, for this purpose, used the term \"duress,\" that usage appears to have been a carry-over of the usage employed below. <i>See United States v. Dixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"38582\"><a href=\"/opinion/38582/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 525 (5th Cir.2005) (using \"duress\" and \"justification\" interchangeably). This imprecision is understandable. Since the federal felon-in-possession statute does not explicitly admit of any affirmative defenses, courts have been able only to infer the availability of such defenses, though in appropriate circumstances they have not hesitated to do so. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Deleveaux,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74429\"><a href=\"/opinion/74429/united-states-v-deleveaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1292</span></a></span>, 1297 &amp; n. 7 (11th Cir.2000) (collecting cases from six other circuits). We ourselves have intimated that, in appropriate circumstances, we would recognize a justification defense to a federal felon-in-possession charge. <i>See United States v. Holt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202439\"><a href=\"/opinion/202439/united-states-v-holt/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 107 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 127 (assuming, arguendo, the availability of a justification defense of self-defense in a &#167; 922(g) case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This inferential process, which requires courts to draw on common law doctrines, has produced confusion over nomenclature. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Many courts have sought to avoid this confusion by treating a compendium of common law defenses &#8212; duress, necessity, and self-defense &#8212; as interchangeable in this context (that is, in a felon-in-possession case in which proof of the affirmative defense will not negate any element of the charged crime) and lumping them under the rubric of \"justification.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See, e.g., United States v. Beasley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783885\"><a href=\"/opinion/783885/united-states-v-willie-beasley/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span>, 934-35 (9th Cir.2003); <i>see also Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1295 n. 2 (collecting cases). Our canvass of the authorities elsewhere discloses that although some courts have performed separate self-defense and necessity analyses, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Elder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663111\"><a href=\"/opinion/663111/united-states-v-john-c-elder-iv/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, 738-39 (7th Cir.1994); <i>see also Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 127-28 &amp; n. 8 (discussing self-defense and necessity separately, but taking no position on whether those defenses could be viewed as interchangeable), no case holds that the burden of proof will vary automatically depending on whether duress, necessity, or self-defense is asserted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We conclude, therefore, that ease in administration favors treating these three defenses, in a federal felon-in-possession case, under a single, unitary rubric: justification. This conclusion is important because it strongly suggests that <i>Dixon</i> &#8212; which, as we have said, placed the burden of proving duress on the defendant &#8212; bars Leahy's path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In hopes of distinguishing <i>Dixon,</i> Leahy beseeches us to disambiguate self-defense from the broader category of justification. He emphasizes that the <i>Dixon</i> Court looked at the state of the law in 1968 (when Congress first conceived the federal felon-in-possession statute)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> to help determine what allocation of the burden of proof Congress most likely would have chosen had it inserted a duress defense into the statutory text. <i>See Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2445-47. He then asseverates, citing <i>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109265\"><a href=\"/opinion/109265/mullaney-v-wilbur/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 702 n. 30, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109265\"><a href=\"/opinion/109265/mullaney-v-wilbur/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1975), that the same methodology, if applied in this case, would favor placing the burden of proof on the prosecution because, in 1968, that was the majority rule in self-defense cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's premise is incorrect. Although seven Justices joined the opinion of the <i>Dixon</i> Court, Justice Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion that distanced him from the date-centric methodology employed in that opinion and wrote that, as a general matter, \"we can assume that Congress would not want to foreclose the courts from consulting . . . newer sources and considering innovative arguments.\" <i>Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2448 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Alito, joined by Justice Scalia, also wrote a separate concurrence rejecting reliance on the date-centric methodology and stressing the value of looking to the state of the law \"when Congress began enacting federal criminal statutes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2449 (Alito, J., concurring). Finally, Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Souter, wrote a dissent in which he argued that determination of the appropriate burden of proof allocation was a question of federal common law. <i>Id.</i> at 2450 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (explicitly declining to follow the date-centric approach). Thus, the most that we can glean from the several opinions in <i>Dixon</i> is that the state of the law in 1968 is one possible source of enlightenment as to how Congress would have wanted to allocate the burden of proof had it explicitly created a justification defense to a felon-in-possession charge; other possible sources of enlightenment (such as the nature of the offense, the evolution of the defense and its accouterments when the Constitution was ratified, and generic policy considerations) must also be factored into the mix.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It can also be argued that, as an historical matter, self-defense circa 1968 was generally limited to assaultive crimes. <i>See</i> 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 10.4(a), at 143 (2d ed.2003); George E. Dix &amp; M. Michael Sharlot, Criminal Law: Cases and Materials 776 (5th ed.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> This strong correlation between self-defense and assaultive crimes is evident from Leahy's citation to <i>Mullaney. See Mullaney,</i> 421 U.S. at 702, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109265\"><a href=\"/opinion/109265/mullaney-v-wilbur/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1881</span></a></span> (indicating that the discussion contained therein is intrinsically tied to cases involving the \"commission of [a] homicide\"). We think a powerful argument can be made that, had Congress meant to weave the common law of self-defense into the fabric of a non-assaultive offense like that created by the federal felon-in-possession statute, it would have represented a radical departure from the mainstream of jurisprudential thought circa 1968 and, thus, would have warranted some explicit statement. To impute such an intention to Congress on the basis of the <i>Dixon</i> methodology alone would, therefore, make very little sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell on the distinction between assaultive and non-assaultive crimes, for there is a more fundamental flaw in Leahy's thesis. The crimes historically associated with self-defense (homicide, for example) all carry substantial mens rea requirements. The federal felon-in-possession statute requires proof that the defendant <i>knowingly</i> possessed a firearm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See United States v. Carpenter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201505\"><a href=\"/opinion/201505/united-states-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2005). Beyond that, however, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) is a strict liability statute, which contains no specific mens rea element at all. <i>See Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2447; <i>Diaz,</i> 285 F.3d at 97. Literally, the felon-in-possession statute encompasses both the felon who intentionally arms himself to rob a bank and the felon who frustrates the robbery by snatching the gun out of the robber's hand. This is a salient distinction: while an individual who kills another in self-defense lacks the malice required to support, say, a conviction for first-degree murder, a felon who knowingly takes possession of a firearm thereby satisfies every statutory element of the felon-in-possession offense regardless of whether he was motivated by concern for his own safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of a mens rea requirement has obvious implications. In a felon-in-possession case (unlike in, say, an assaultive crime), evidence of facts concerning self-defense neither contradicts nor tends to disprove any element of the charged crime. <i>Cf. Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2444 (reaching the same conclusion as to duress vis-&#224;-vis similar section 922 violations). This means that disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt is not inherent in the prosecution's burden of proving every element of the offense charged. <i>See generally In re Winship,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 364, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span> (1970). So viewed, there is no good reason to eschew, in the felon-in-possession context, the burden allocation that affirmative defenses normally carry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the other courts that have considered this question have come to the same conclusion. Four of our sister circuits have squarely confronted the issue of allocating the burden of proof on a justification defense other than duress to federal felon-in-possession charges, where proof of the defense would not negate any of the elements of the charged crime. Three of the four have assigned the burden of proving such a defense to the defendant. <i>See Beasley,</i> 346 F.3d at 935; <i>United States v. Dodd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770267\"><a href=\"/opinion/770267/united-states-v-reginald-dodd/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, 350 (3d Cir.2000); <i>Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1301. Although one respected court of appeals has held to the contrary, <i>see United States v. Talbott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714834\"><a href=\"/opinion/714834/united-states-v-richard-dale-talbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></a></span>, 1186 (7th Cir.1996) (per curiam), we find the reasoning of <i>Beasley, Dodd,</i> and <i>Deleveaux</i> more persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy argues that pragmatic considerations counsel in favor of assigning the burden of proof to the government. We think that these considerations tilt the other way. When self-defense is an issue in a felon-in-possession case, the defendant is likely to have greater access to the relevant facts than the government. <i>See Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1300. While there always will be a witness when a defendant claims self-defense &#8212; the source of the alleged threat &#8212; that witness may or may not be available and, if available, may or may not be cooperative. For that reason, the defendant, himself a witness to the threat, is better positioned than the government to depict the circumstances under which he came into possession of the gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we confirm the suggestion previously made in <i>Holt</i> and <i>Holliday,</i> and add our voice to the weight of authority by holding that, in some circumstances, justification &#8212; a term that we define to include, inter alia, self-defense &#8212; can comprise an affirmative defense to a federal felon-in-possession charge. Furthermore, we think it highly unlikely that Congress, in enacting the federal felon-in-possession law, intended to require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a fact that it did not specify as an element of the offense. Consequently, we hold that in a federal felon-in-possession prosecution, there is no sound basis for treating that defense differently from other justification defenses. It follows that a defendant who asserts self-defense in such a case must carry the devoir of persuasion on that defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that regard, we adopt the four-part framework for justification discussed by the Supreme Court in <i>Dixon,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2440 n. 2. That framework has been embraced by a number of other courts. <i>See Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1297 (collecting cases). Here, the lower court used a version of that four-part framework and (apart from questioning the allocation of the burden of proof) Leahy has not challenged either the wording of the pertinent jury instruction or the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the jury's apparent rejection of justification as a defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from what we have said that Leahy's principal claim of error fails. We think it is prudent, however, to add two caveats. First, this holding is limited to justification defenses that do not go to the elements of the felon-in-possession offense. We leave open the possibility that a defense within the rubric of justification might negate an element of the felon-in-possession offense. In that event, the burden of disproving the defense would rest on the prosecution. Second, although we believe it is useful to speak of a single justification defense, we caution that different factual scenarios may require variations in the phrasing of the four-factor test. For example, the first factor, which requires that the defendant be under a present and unlawful threat of death or serious bodily injury, will require modification in cases in which the defendant allegedly acts in defense of a third party. Those nuances remain to be developed in future cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. UNANIMITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment in this case contained only a single count. That count mentioned two guns &#8212; the pistol and the rifle &#8212; and the government adduced evidence at trial about both weapons. The jury returned a general verdict. Based on this collocation of circumstances, Leahy suggests that he may have been convicted because some jurors believed that he possessed the rifle while others believed that he possessed the pistol but did not act in self-defense. To safeguard against this possibility, his thesis runs, the district court should have instructed the jury that unanimity <i>as to the identity of the weapon unlawfully possessed</i> was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy's concern for unanimity is of recent vintage: he did not request such an instruction below. The issue is, therefore, forfeited. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gomez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199484\"><a href=\"/opinion/199484/united-states-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2001). As a forfeited issue, it may be reviewed on appeal only for plain error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain error hurdle is high. <i>United States v.

To surmount it, an objector must make four showings: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v.

Here, however, that exception does not pertain. The record below contains nothing approaching an adequate elaboration of why counsel adopted the course that he followed (Leahy suggests that his lawyer did not know of the <i>Old Chief</i> decision, but that fact is not pellucid from the record), nor does it provide the district court's first-hand insights as to what (if any) quantum of prejudice might have attended this strategy. Given the need for further factfinding, we decline Leahy's invitation to address the ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the first time on direct appeal.

The court adopted this taxonomy after having found that Leahy's record included the necessary predicate: three prior convictions for violent felonies. <i>See id.</i> As a result of this determination, Leahy faced a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence, <i>see id.,</i> and automatically incurred elevated criminal history and offense level placements, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 4B1.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pertinently, ACCA defines a \"violent felony\" as a crime punishable by \"imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B). Three such felony convictions are required to trigger the statute, and Leahy asserts that one of his three prior convictions &#8212; namely, a Massachusetts conviction for indecent assault and battery, <i>see</i> Mass.

Building on that foundation, he points out that while ACCA's definition of \"violent felony\" has been deemed substantively identical to the definition of \"crime of violence\" used in the federal sentencing guidelines, <i>see United</i> <i>States v.

Leahy deploys the transitive property to reach the conclusion that ACCA must also be distinguishable from section 16(b).

Moreover, even if one can conceive of a risk of force bereft of a corresponding risk of injury, the logic of <i>Sutherland</i> still would compel the result reached by the district court. After all, just as there is \"a substantial risk that force <i>may</i> be used in order to overcome the victim's lack of consent,\" <i>Sutherland,</i> 228 F.3d at 176, so too is there a substantial risk of physical injury from the unwanted touching.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is buttressed by our decision in <i>United States v.

There, we held that a statute encompassing the crime of pickpocketing satisfied section 4B1.2 because \"[t]aking property directly from a person seems to us to run a `substantial' or `serious' risk that `physical force' or `physical injury' will follow.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2. If the risk of injury presented by pickpocketing &#8212; a crime in which the perpetrator's goal is to leave his victim unaware of the contact &#8212; satisfies section 4B1.2 (and, by extension, ACCA), it seems inescapable that the risk of physical injury posed by a crime in which the touching is the end, not merely the means, would likewise entail the necessary degree of risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leahy makes much of the fact that Massachusetts does not include indecent assault and battery in its own list of \"sexually violent offenses.\" <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &#167; 178C. That fact is of little moment. \"Because a state's classification of a crime generally reflects different policy considerations than the federal classification, it is simply not relevant to the determination of whether a crime is a `violent felony,' which, under federal law, is based on an assessment of the risk of physical injury associated with the typical conduct underlying that crime.\" <i>United States v.

Applying this guideline, the district court found, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that Leahy, during his interactions with the gaggle of teenagers on July 27, 2003, had committed the uncharged state crimes of aggravated assault and reckless conduct. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat.

That finding triggered an overriding offense level of 34, which came into play without regard to other enhancements. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 4B1.4(b).

We have rejected that taxonomy. <i>See Holt,</i> 464 F.3d at 107.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In a post-argument letter,<i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), Leahy has directed us to a terse exchange between government counsel and the Supreme Court during oral argument in <i>Dixon.</i> That exchange raised the possibility of establishing different burden-of-proof allocations for duress and self-defense.

United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145638\"><a href=\"/opinion/145638/dixon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2437</span></a></span>, 2440 (2006). In our view, the mere fact that government counsel answered a hypothetical question in a manner advantageous to the government's position in <i>Dixon</i> has no precedential value for present purposes.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The origin of section 922 can be found in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub.L. No. 90-351, &#167; 922, 82 Stat. 197, 228. That statute included an early precursor to section 922(g)(1)<i>See id.</i> at &#167; 922(f), 82 Stat. at 231.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> While some modern innovation has expanded the breadth of self-defense,<i>see, e.g., Boget v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1383927\"><a href=\"/opinion/1383927/boget-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 29-30 (Tex.Crim.App. 2002); <i>see also Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 127 (noting, in the present tense, that \"self-defense is not limited to `assaultive crimes'\"), this relatively recent development is irrelevant to Leahy's argument about what the Congress that enacted section 922(g) in 1968 intended.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The justification defense asserted by Leahy in this case does not go to knowledge; Leahy readily concedes that he knowingly seized the handgun</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> As to the second element of the framework, the court charged the jury that Leahy had to prove that he did not \"recklessly\" place himself in a situation in which he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct. The authorities are divided on the question of whether the second element extends to negligence as well as recklessness<i>Compare, e.g., Dixon,</i> 413 F.3d at 523 (including negligence along with recklessness), <i>with, e.g., Beasley,</i> 346 F.3d at 933 n. 2 (limiting the second element to reckless conduct). The case at hand does not require us to take sides in this debate.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The provision reads in relevant part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Whoever commits an indecent assault and battery on a person who has attained age fourteen shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years, or by imprisonment for not more than two and one-half years in a jail or house of correction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Both sides debate the significance to this issue of our decision in<i>United States v.

However, that case involved a child molestation statute and the opinion is largely focused on the special vulnerability of young children. <i>See id.</i> at 221-22. With respect to the case at hand, we think that the logic used in <i>Sutherland</i> hits closer to home.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
