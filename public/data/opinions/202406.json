Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lipez, Circuit Judge\n                   Cyr and Stahl, Senior Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jane Elizabeth Lee for the appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor the United States.\n\n\n\n                         September 8, 2006\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Marcel Henderson was the passenger\n\nin a car stopped by Michael Kominsky, a patrol officer for the West\n\nBridgewater, Massachusetts Police.        After demanding Henderson's\n\nsocial security number and date of birth, Kominsky found that a\n\npolice database listed an old warrant for Henderson's arrest.\n\nActing on the database, which turned out to be wrong about the\n\nwarrant, Kominsky searched Henderson and found a gun.                Before\n\ntrial, Henderson moved to suppress the gun, arguing that it had\n\nbeen the product of an illegal stop and that Kominsky had no basis\n\nfor investigating the passenger in a stopped car. The district\n\ncourt denied Henderson's motion to suppress the gun and held a\n\ntrial.   After the government belatedly produced evidence relevant\n\nto Henderson's motion to suppress, the district court declared a\n\nmistrial and held a second suppression hearing. After the district\n\ncourt again denied Henderson's motion and held a second trial, a\n\njury convicted Henderson of being a felon in possession of a\n\nhandgun.\n\n           Henderson   now   appeals    his    conviction   and   sentence,\n\nfocusing on the district court's finding that he was not wearing\n\nhis seatbelt in the stopped car.              Henderson argues that the\n\ndistrict court clearly erred in believing Kominsky's testimony that\n\nhe was not wearing a seatbelt.          In support of this assertion,\n\nHenderson emphasizes that Kominsky's testimony was riddled with\n\nproven inaccuracies and contradictions and that the district court\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fexplicitly disbelieved important portions of Kominsky's testimony.\n\nWe agree with Henderson.      After a careful review of this unusual\n\nrecord, we are convinced that this is one of those rare cases in\n\nwhich a district court's credibility determination is clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n           Anticipating     the    possibility     of   this     result,   the\n\ngovernment offers \"officer safety\" as an alternative basis for\n\ninvestigating Henderson and affirming the conviction.                However,\n\nKominsky admitted that he did not have any particularized reason to\n\nsuspect Henderson of dangerousness or wrongdoing, nor any specific\n\nbasis apart from a purported seatbelt violation for prolonging the\n\nstop in order to investigate Henderson.          On these facts, we reject\n\nthe government's alternative argument as well.                Accordingly, we\n\nvacate the conviction.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           We review here some of the background facts and the\n\nprocedural   history   of   this   case,   leaving      the   details   for   a\n\ndiscussion of Kominsky's credibility.\n\nA.   Background\n\n           At about ten P.M. on a May evening in 2001, Henderson and\n\nhis girlfriend, Patrice Alford, were in Brockton, Massachusetts,\n\nattempting to get back to Boston, where they lived, after visiting\n\nrelatives.   The couple -- who had stopped dating by the time of the\n\ntrial -- were in a blue Nissan sedan.      Henderson was sitting in the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\ffront passenger seat.        Alford, who was driving, was lost.          Looking\n\nfor the expressway, Alford proceeded down Plain Street in Brockton.\n\n           As   it    turned    out,   Alford    was    going    in    the    wrong\n\ndirection.   Rather than towards the expressway to Boston, which is\n\njust west of downtown Brockton, Plain Street goes southeast from\n\ndowntown Brockton to the town of East Bridgewater, where it becomes\n\nPleasant Street. Alford observed a police car pull behind her and,\n\nbecause she was being followed, she drove especially carefully.\n\nBetween Brockton and East Bridgewater, Plain Street cuts through\n\nthe extreme northeast corner of the town of West Bridgewater.                    A\n\ncar driving from Brockton to East Bridgewater on Plain Street\n\ntravels through West Bridgewater for approximately three tenths of\n\na mile (about 500 yards).       At the 35 mile-per-hour speed limit, the\n\ntransit takes about 30 seconds.         Plain Street cuts a straight line\n\nthrough West Bridgewater, without substantial curves.\n\n           Kominsky,     assigned      to    patrol    that   corner    of    West\n\nBridgewater, stopped Alford's car. He later gave three reasons for\n\nthe stop, saying that the car was driving slowly, had crossed over\n\nthe center line of the short stretch of Plain Street in West\n\nBridgewater between two and five times, and was registered to a\n\nwoman, Alford, who had a suspended driver's license.                  During the\n\nstop,   Kominsky     asked   for   Henderson's    license       and   then,   when\n\nHenderson said he did not have a license, demanded Henderson's\n\nname, date of birth, and social security number.                 Kominsky later\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\ftestified that he wanted Handerson's identification in order to\n\ncite Henderson for not wearing a seatbelt. By entering Henderson's\n\ninformation   into   a   database      he    could    access      from   his   laptop\n\ncomputer,    Kominsky    discovered     that    there       was   a   five-year-old\n\nwarrant for Henderson's arrest.         Kominsky acted on the information\n\nin the database to arrest Henderson. As he was searching Henderson\n\npursuant to the arrest, Kominsky found some ammunition.                    Henderson\n\nthen told Kominsky that he was carrying a handgun as well.                       That\n\ngun was the basis for this prosecution.\n\n            A second police officer, Carlos Oliveira of the East\n\nBridgewater Police, arrived on the scene in time to see and hear\n\nthe end of Kominsky's initial encounter with Alford and Henderson.\n\nHowever,    Alford and Kominsky both testified that Oliveira did not\n\napproach the car until Henderson was arrested.\n\n            As it turned out, the warrant Kominsky relied on in\n\narresting    Henderson    had   long    since        been   revoked.        However,\n\nHenderson accepts for the purpose of this appeal that Kominsky\n\ncould rely in \"good faith\" on the computer system.                       Henderson's\n\ntheory throughout this case has been that Kominsky never should\n\nhave obtained from him the personal identification information that\n\nled to the computer error and then to his arrest.\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n            In October 2002, the district court held a two-day\n\nevidentiary hearing on Henderson's motion to suppress.                    Henderson\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcontested both the legality of the vehicle stop and the legality of\n\nKominsky's demand for his identifying information.                    Kominsky,\n\nAlford,    and   an   investigator     for    Henderson   testified     for   the\n\ndefense.       Concerned   about     the    discrepancy   between    Kominsky's\n\ntestimony that Alford's car did not have automatic seatbelts and\n\nAlford's testimony that it did, the district court took a view of\n\nAlford's car and determined that it did indeed have automatic\n\nseatbelts.       Nonetheless, the district court denied Henderson's\n\nmotion in a published opinion.         United States v. Henderson, 229 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 35 (D. Mass. 2002) (Henderson I).\n\n              The case then proceeded to trial. Kominsky was the first\n\nwitness.      After his direct examination, the government belatedly\n\nproduced documents indicating that Kominsky had been the subject of\n\ncomplaints for subjecting drivers to baseless and harassing stops,\n\nalong   the    same   stretch   of   road    where   he   stopped    Alford   and\n\nHenderson. Henderson asked that the trial be stayed and the motion\n\nto suppress reopened.      The district court conducted a voir dire of\n\nKominsky and then allowed the trial to continue while it considered\n\nHenderson's motion.\n\n              During a break in Alford's testimony, an Assistant United\n\nStates Attorney told defense counsel, while Alford was sitting\n\nnearby, that Alford was \"going to jail for perjury.\"                Alford heard\n\nthe remark and, according to the defense, became nervous about\n\nreturning to the stand.         The district court examined Alford and\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdetermined that there was no impediment to her continued testimony.\n\nThe next day, however, citing the government's delayed disclosure\n\nand the other \"appellate issues\" that had arisen, the district\n\ncourt declared a mistrial and announced that it would consider\n\nwhether   to    dismiss   the   case    with    prejudice,   in   light   of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct.\n\n          Ultimately, the district court decided not to dismiss the\n\nindictment.    It did, however, reopen the suppression hearing.           At\n\nthe reopened hearing, the district court heard testimony from\n\nKominsky, Oliveira, other officers who worked with Kominsky, and a\n\nyoung man, Christopher Bellas, who previously had complained of\n\nimproper vehicle stops by Kominsky.            The district court credited\n\nBellas's testimony that Kominsky had twice stopped his car without\n\ncause and had acted improperly during the stops.             (Kominsky had\n\ndenied any such misconduct.) Nonetheless, the district court again\n\ndenied Henderson's motion to suppress in another published order.\n\nUnited States v. Henderson, 265 F. Supp. 2d 115 (D. Mass. 2002)\n\n(Henderson II).     The district court acknowledged that its decision\n\nto credit Bellas's testimony over Kominsky's \"lends weight to the\n\ncontention that Kominsky's testimony relating to Henderson should\n\nnot be believed.\"       Id. at 116.     The district court then stated:\n\n\"Other credible evidence, however, tends to support Kominsky's\n\ntestimony\" that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the\n\nvehicle stop.     Id.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          The   district    court   briefly    reopened   the    suppression\n\nhearing a third time shortly before the second trial, when the\n\ngovernment produced two recent complaints about vehicle stops by\n\nKominsky and a statement by Oliveira that contradicted Kominsky's\n\nprevious testimony about the language he used while arresting\n\nHenderson. The district court declined to reconsider its ruling on\n\nthe motion to suppress, reasoning that the additional evidence was\n\n\"cumulative\" and that \"I don't need to hear any more to have a low\n\nregard for Officer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\"\n\n          Henderson   was    convicted    at    a   second      trial.    At\n\nsentencing, the district court stated:\n\n          I two times found by a preponderance of the\n          credible evidence that Mr. Henderson was not\n          wearing a seat belt.    That much of Officer\n          Kominsky I credited. But, in candor, I'm not\n          close to sure about that.1\n\n                                    II.\n\n          The government argues that Kominsky could demand that\n\n\n\n     1\n       Henderson's conviction carried a statutory mandatory minimum\nsentence of fifteen years. Given his criminal history level of VI,\nthe guideline sentence range was 235-264 months.      The district\ncourt found at sentencing that Henderson's criminal history level\nsubstantially overstated \"the likelihood that he'll commit further\ncrimes,\" and that in Henderson \"I also saw a kind of intelligence\nand maturity that caused me to think that a slightly lower sentence\n. . . is the most appropriate sentence.\"        The district court\nimposed a sentence of sixteen years, or 192 months, based on a\ndownward departure of two criminal history levels.       The court\nadded: \"I've been listening for months and months and months and\nwondering whether I would find in the presentence report that you\nwere dealing drugs or that you were involved in some gang. And I\ndon't have any evidence of that.\"\n                                    -8-\n\fHenderson write down his identifying information because Henderson\n\nwas    not    wearing    his   seatbelt.   It   is   a   civil    infraction    in\n\nMassachusetts, carrying as its maximum consequence a fine of $25,\n\nfor an adult passenger not to wear a seatbelt while \"riding\" in a\n\ncar.       See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, § 13A.         Henderson responds that\n\nthe court clearly erred when it accepted Kominsky's testimony that\n\nHenderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the stop.\n\nA.    Two unaddressed legal issues\n\n               Before   addressing     these   arguments,   we    note,    without\n\nresolving, two legal issues alluded to in the district court but\n\nnever pursued or resolved.         We identify these issues only to avoid\n\nany suggestion that we are resolving them by implication.\n\n               First, Kominsky did not believe that he had the power to\n\ndemand a passenger's identification in order to write a citation\n\nfor a seatbelt violation.          In fact, no witness testified that it\n\nwould be reasonable for a police officer to demand a passenger's\n\nidentification      in    order   to   write    a   citation     for   a   seatbelt\n\nviolation.       To the contrary, Kominsky testified that \"there's no\n\nlegal way for me to force [a passenger who is not wearing his\n\nseatbelt] to give me the information . . . he's entitled to get a\n\ncitation [] but if he doesn't give me his information I know of no\n\nother way [to issue a ticket] other than citing the driver for the\n\nviolation.\"2       Kominsky had testified that he asked Henderson to\n\n\n       2\n           The Massachusetts seatbelt law makes a driver liable for\n                                        -9-\n\fwrite     down   his   identifying    information   and   that    Henderson\n\nvoluntarily complied.        But the district court never credited this\n\naccount     of   voluntary    compliance,   finding   after      the   first\n\nsuppression hearing that \"Henderson asked Kominsky why he had to\n\nprovide that information.        Kominsky did not answer the question,\n\nbut insisted that Henderson give him the requested information.\"\n\nHenderson I, 229 F. Supp. 2d at 37 (emphasis added).             Kominsky's\n\nsupervisor, Lieutenant Ray Rogers, also testified that a passenger\n\ncould be asked but could not be required to produce identifying\n\ninformation unless there was suspicion that he had committed or was\n\ncommitting a crime.      In Massachusetts, a seatbelt violation is not\n\na crime.    We have found no Massachusetts case that permits a police\n\nofficer to demand a passenger's social security number and date of\n\nbirth in order to write a citation for a seatbelt violation.\n\n            The second legal issue relates to the absence of any\n\nevidence that Henderson failed to wear a seatbelt while the car was\n\nmoving. Kominsky did not say that he observed any such infraction.\n\nRather, he said that he did not see inside the car until after it\n\nstopped.    The district court did not say that it had inferred that\n\nHenderson was wearing his seatbelt while the car was moving.           It is\n\nuncontested that some time passed between the stop and Kominsky's\n\n\npermitting a passenger to ride without a seatbelt. See Mass. Gen.\nLaws ch. 90 § 13A (2006), \"[a]ny person sixteen years of age or\nover who rides as a passenger in a motor vehicle without wearing a\nsafety belt in violation of this section, shall be subject to a\nfine of twenty-five dollars.\"\n                                     -10-\n\fapproach to the car because Kominsky first made a radio call.           The\n\none relevant Massachusetts case that we found concluded that a\n\npassenger in a vehicle is not obligated to wear a seatbelt after\n\nthe vehicle has been stopped by a police officer and cannot be\n\ncited on the basis of not wearing a seatbelt during a vehicle stop.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Nuñez, 15 Mass. L. Rptr. 536, 2002 WL 31973248\n\nat *3 (Mass. Super. 2002).\n\n             However, we need not decide the legal question of whether\n\nKominsky could demand Henderson's social security number and date\n\nof   birth   for   the   purpose   of   a   passenger   seatbelt   violation\n\ncitation.     Similarly, we need not decide whether Henderson could\n\neven be cited for failing to wear his seatbelt on the facts\n\npresented.     The premise for both of these legal issues would be a\n\nfinding that Kominsky credibly testified that Henderson was not\n\nwearing his seatbelt during the stop.         As we now explain, we cannot\n\naccept that premise.\n\nB.   Standard of review\n\n             We recognize that \"a district court's choice between two\n\nplausible competing interpretations of the facts cannot be clearly\n\nerroneous.\"     United States v. Weidul, 325 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). Moreover, our inability to see witnesses face-to-face or to\n\nappraise in person their \"demeanor and inflection,\" Anderson v.\n\nCity of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985), makes us \"especially\n\ndeferential\" to the district court's credibility judgments, United\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fStates v. Ivery, 427 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2005).    Still, as the\n\nSupreme Court stated in its seminal case on clear error review:\n\n           [F]actors other than demeanor and inflection\n           go into the decision whether or not to believe\n           a witness.   Documents or objective evidence\n           may contradict the witness' story; or the\n           story may be so internally inconsistent or\n           implausible on its face that a reasonable\n           fact-finder would not credit it. Where such\n           factors are present, the court of appeals may\n           well find clear error even in a finding\n           purportedly    based    on    a    credibility\n           determination.\n\nAnderson, 470 U.S. at 575.   See also United States v. Forbes, 181\n\nF.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1999) (vacating after clear error review\n\nfactual findings based on a police officer's testimony as to a\n\nvehicle stop, where the officer's testimony was \"improbable\" and\n\n\"call[ed] into question\" by \"extrinsic evidence,\" and the district\n\ncourt \"did not explain why it found [the police officer] to be\n\ncredible\").   The basic standard is familiar: we will overturn a\n\ndistrict court's factual findings after a suppression hearing \"only\n\nif, after reviewing all of the evidence, we have a 'definite and\n\nfirm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'\"    Ivery, 427\n\nF.3d at 72, quoting Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573.   Such instances are\n\nrare, especially when the factual findings at issue are made by\n\nsuch a careful and able judge.    But this is such an instance.\n\nC.   Kominsky's testimony\n\n           To explain the clear error in the district court's\n\nfinding about the seatbelt, we discuss Kominsky's testimony topic\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fby    topic,      focusing     on    its    documented      inaccuracies,    internal\n\ninconsistencies, and implausibilities.                    We also note the district\n\ncourt's rejection of Kominsky's credibility on important issues,\n\nand    the      district      court's      stated   impressions      of    Kominsky's\n\ncharacter, demeanor, and professionalism.\n\n                1.   Testimony empirically disproved\n\n                On several points, Kominsky gave testimony that was later\n\nshown to be simply wrong.\n\n                        a.    The automatic seatbelts\n\n                Alford's car had automatic seatbelts, a point obviously\n\npertinent to Henderson's appeal. Alford testified that the car had\n\nautomatic seatbelts.           The district court confirmed, after taking a\n\nview of the car, that \"[t]he automobile in which Mr. Henderson was\n\nriding on the evening in question does, as Ms. Alford testified,\n\nhave       an   automatic     seat   belt    for    the    front   seat   passenger.\"\n\nKominsky, however, testified repeatedly and with certainty that the\n\ncar had non-automatic seatbelts.\n\n                Not surprisingly, the district court probed this seatbelt\n\nissue carefully.             At the first suppression hearing, the court\n\nquestioned Kominsky about the seatbelt itself.3 The district court\n\n\n       3\n           We quote the colloquy between the court and Kominsky:\n\n       THE COURT:       Did you observe whether . . . the car had seat\n       belts?\n\n       KOMINSKY:      Yes, your Honor, the car had seat belts.\n\n                                            -13-\n\ftook a view of Alford's car the next day.   These were its findings:\n\n                 The automobile in which Mr. Henderson\n          was riding on the evening in question does, as\n          Ms. Alford testified, have an automatic seat\n          belt for the front seat passenger.      It's a\n          belt that attaches to the frame and, when\n          connected, pushes away from the seat toward\n          the windshield when the door, passenger side\n          door, is open. If a passenger got in and sat\n          down and closed the door, the seatbelt would\n          automatically come back and go diagonally\n          across his chest from his right shoulder to\n          his left waist. There is also a lap belt that\n          needs to be connected manually.      The seat\n          belts are black or dark gray.\n                 The automatic belt can be disconnected\n          from the door frame and will then roll down\n          into the left-hand side of the passenger seat\n          by the place that the lap belt, I believe,\n          connects or starts from.\n\n          The district court's observations contradicted Kominsky's\n\ntestimony in two important ways.   First, Kominsky simply was wrong\n\nabout there being a non-automatic-type seatbelt in Alford's car.\n\n\n     THE COURT:   Do you have a memory of where the front seat\n     passenger seat belt was?\n\n     KOMINSKY: You'd see the straps, your Honor on the door that\n     it's a lap -- the kind that comes across the shoulder, buckles\n     on the seat, your Honor.\n\n     THE COURT: And so where was the passenger side seat belt when\n     Mr. Henderson was arrested?\n\n     KOMINSKY: You'd see, on the door, sir, when he gets out of\n     the car, you can clearly see the seat belt is on the side of\n     the door frame. You can see that clearly . . ..\n\n     THE COURT: Was this the kind of seat belt that rolls back up\n     into the frame and you pull it down?\n\n     KOMINSKY: It's the strap kind, your Honor, the kind that you\n     do pull out.\n                               -14-\n\fSecond -- and even more important -- Kominsky's emphatic testimony\n\nabout seeing Henderson's \"seat belt [] on the side of the door\n\nframe,\" could not have been true.        If the seatbelt had been\n\nconnected, it would have been attached to the frame of the car, as\n\ndescribed by the court.    If it were disconnected, it would have\n\nrolled down into the left hand side of the passenger seat, also as\n\ndescribed by the court.    It was a physical impossibility for the\n\nstrap to be in the position Kominsky described.     As the district\n\ncourt itself immediately recognized:\n\n          I think [Kominsky] testified, and I'll have to\n          refresh my recollection -- that it wasn't an\n          automatic seat belt. He remembered it hanging\n          there after Mr. Henderson got out of the car.\n          And whether it was connected or disconnected,\n          it wouldn't have been hanging in the place\n          that a non-automatic seatbelt hangs, in my\n          experience. It either would have been pushed\n          forward if it was connected or it would have\n          been down by the left-hand waist if it was\n          disconnected.\n\n          The government argues that Kominsky's testimony was not\n\ninaccurate because Alford's car had manual lap belts in addition to\n\nautomatic seatbelts.   This argument is unpersuasive because it\n\nparses Kominsky's testimony too finely. While Kominsky did testify\n\nthat Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt across his lap, he also\n\ntestified emphatically that Henderson \"did not\" have \"a seat belt\n\ngoing diagonally across his chest.\"    Kominsky never testified that\n\nhe would give a seatbelt citation to someone wearing a shoulder\n\nbelt but not a lap belt.\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f                   b.   Number of citations\n\n           Kominsky testified at the first suppression hearing that\n\nhe had issued \"over a hundred\" seatbelt citations \"just in this\n\nlast year.\"     To the government, and conceivably to the district\n\ncourt, this was important testimony.         The government placed great\n\nemphasis on the frequency of Kominsky's seatbelt citations as an\n\nexplanation for the inaccuracy of his recollection about Alford's\n\ncar.   In light of further questioning, however, neither Kominsky's\n\ntabulation nor the government's excuse held up.             Asked the same\n\nquestion at trial, Kominsky said that he averaged 25 citations,\n\nadmitted the inconsistency, and said that he had misunderstood the\n\nquestion \"how many seat belt violations have you written in the\n\nlast year?\"\n\n           As   Henderson   points    out,   the   record   plainly   belies\n\nKominsky's statement -- and the government's argument on appeal --\n\nthat he misunderstood the question before stating that he issued\n\n100 seatbelt citations a year.       In response to follow-up questions\n\nat the first suppression hearing, Kominsky reiterated that he had\n\nwritten 100 seatbelt citations \"just in the last year,\" and that he\n\nissued a seatbelt citation \"every three days.\"               There was no\n\nconfusion by Kominsky.\n\n           At the second suppression hearing, defense counsel again\n\nimpeached Kominsky on this point -- with documentary evidence that\n\nKominsky had averaged only fifteen seatbelt citations per year.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fKominsky again had an excuse: he had issued more citations but they\n\nwere missing from computer records because of his bad handwriting.\n\n                   c.   Henderson's attire\n\n           Kominsky testified that Henderson was wearing a dark-\n\ncolored shirt on the night of the arrest.           However, documentary\n\nevidence -- the inventory list from the jail where Henderson would\n\nspend the night -- proved that Henderson was wearing a white shirt.\n\nThe government argues that the issue is immaterial and points out\n\nthat   Kominsky   expressed      no   certainty   when   testifying   about\n\nHenderson's attire.     Still, the inaccuracy about the shirt, like\n\nthe inaccuracy about the automatic seatbelts and the number of\n\nseatbelt citations he had written, provides a further ground for\n\nquestioning Kominsky's credibility.\n\n           2. Inconsistent testimony: his motivations for demanding\n\nHenderson's identifying information\n\n           Henderson    points    out   that   Kominsky's   testimony   was\n\ninconsistent on the obviously pertinent matter of why Kominsky\n\neither asked for (in Kominsky's view) or demanded (in Henderson's\n\nview) his identifying information.           At a detention hearing that\n\noccurred shortly after Henderson's arrest, Kominsky said that he\n\nsecured the identifying information for two reasons: to see if\n\nHenderson could drive Alford's car and because Henderson was not\n\nwearing his seatbelt.     At the first suppression hearing, Kominsky\n\nadded a third reason:     he said that he sometimes asked passengers\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fin stopped cars for their identification because: \"If I feel like\n\nasking everybody in the car for their license, I will.\"                     Kominsky\n\nalso indicated for the first time at the suppression hearing that\n\nhe could request Henderson's identifying information in order to\n\nsee whether he could drive even after Henderson denied having a\n\nlicense in his possession.       At the second suppression hearing, the\n\nother officer on the scene, Oliveira, rejected this purported\n\njustification,      saying   that    \"naturally,         he   couldn't    drive   the\n\nvehicle\" without presenting a valid license.\n\n            At the second trial, after the denial of the suppression\n\nmotion, Kominsky reversed course twice more, first explicitly\n\ndenying on direct examination that he had any reason to ask for\n\nHenderson's   identification         apart       from   the   purported     seatbelt\n\nviolation, and then stating on cross examination that the seatbelt\n\nviolation was his \"primary\" motivation, but that \"[t]here's a\n\nnumber of reasons [] that I could ask him for his identification.\"\n\nThe government rightly notes that this testimony at the second\n\ntrial came in after the court ruled on the suppression motion, and\n\nhence cannot contribute to the clear error analysis.                        But the\n\ngovernment    says    nothing    to        explain      Kominsky's   inconsistent\n\ntestimony about his motivations before the district court made its\n\nfindings.      In    any     case,    Kominsky's        inability    to     remember\n\nconsistently -- at any point in the proceedings -- why he demanded\n\nHenderson's   identification         is    another      negative   factor    in   the\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fevaluation of his credibility.\n\n          3.   Implausible testimony: observations leading to the\n\nvehicle stop\n\n          As Henderson argued at length before the district court\n\nand repeats here, even if Kominsky had a legal basis for pulling\n\nAlford over, it is implausible that the events before the stop\n\nunfolded as he testified.   According to his testimony, Kominsky\n\npulled behind a blue Nissan at the intersection of Plain Street and\n\nWaverly Park Avenue, which Kominsky testified was in Brockton, \"40,\n\n50 yards\" from the West Bridgewater town line.    He said that the\n\nNissan was going slower than the speed limit allowed, between 20\n\nand 25 miles per hour.   Kominsky further testified at the first\n\nsuppression hearing that while driving through West Bridgewater he\n\nsaw the Nissan stray across the yellow center line at least twice\n\n-- and maybe as many as five times; typed the Nissan's license\n\nplate into his laptop computer (looking at the keyboard as he did);\n\nused the license plate number to search the Massachusetts Registry\n\nof Motor Vehicles database, which required the laptop to initiate\n\na cellular phone call; waited \"at a minimum, 20 seconds\" for the\n\ncomputer to process the search (a search that he said often took\n\nseveral minutes to produce results); and, while still in West\n\nBridgewater, received a computer report indicating that Alford, the\n\nregistered driver of the car, had a suspended license.    Kominsky\n\ntestified that he decided to stop the Nissan while he was still in\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fWest Bridgewater, at the intersection of Plain Street and Belmont\n\nStreet,    but   that   he    actually     initiated   the   stop   in   East\n\nBridgewater, because he was waiting for a moment when he would have\n\na tactical advantage.4        According to the undisputed testimony of\n\nHenderson's investigator, it takes no more than 49 seconds to\n\ntravel at 20-25 miles per hour from the intersection of Plain\n\nStreet and Waverly Park Avenue in Brockton, where Kominsky said he\n\nfirst saw Alford's car, to the intersection of Plain and Belmont\n\nStreets.\n\n           Everyone agrees that Alford was perfectly sober at the\n\ntime of the stop.   The uncontested evidence is that she was driving\n\nespecially carefully because she knew that she was being followed\n\nby a police officer.         Yet, according to Kominsky's testimony, he\n\nobserved Alford drive the two left tires of her car across the\n\ncenter line of a straight street between two and five times -- over\n\na distance of three tenths of a mile.          At the same time, Kominsky\n\nsaid, he was conducting a computer search that often took several\n\nminutes to complete.     All of this, according to Kominsky, happened\n\nin no more than 49 seconds.        The idea that Kominsky could observe\n\nall of this in such a short time verges on physical impossibility.\n\n             Attempting to blunt Henderson's demonstration of this\n\n\n\n     4\n      The transcript of the October 22, 2002 proceedings quotes\nKominsky as saying: \"I like to stop motor vehicles where I feel\nsafe, where it's tactfully to my advantage.\" The court reporter\napparently reproduced the word \"tactically\" as \"tactfully.\"\n                                    -20-\n\fimplausibility, the government argues that Alford's testimony about\n\nthe minutes leading to the stop was equally implausible.                 Alford\n\nsaid that at some point while she and Henderson were still in\n\nBrockton, Kominsky began following her.              Alford testified that\n\nKominsky was sitting at an intersection.           When her car approached,\n\nhe activated his cruiser's flashing lights.           She stopped to allow\n\nKominsky to pull out ahead of her, but Kominsky flashed his bright\n\nlights and then signaled for her to go ahead of him.               After she\n\npassed by, she testified, Kominsky began following her.             Kominsky\n\nfollowed for several minutes -- she thought it could have been as\n\nlong as twenty minutes, but stated that she was not keeping track\n\nof the time and did not know -- and then pulled her to the side of\n\nthe road.\n\n            In   the    government's     view,    Alford's   statement    that\n\nKominsky may have been following her for as long as twenty minutes\n\nsomehow shows Kominsky to be reliable about the minutes before the\n\nvehicle stop.     This argument fails.         Alford's testimony about the\n\nnumber of minutes Kominsky was following her was self-consciously\n\nuncertain.       She only professed to be sure that Kominsky was\n\nfollowing her for a fairly long time.              Alford's testimony that\n\nKominsky was following her for longer than he said relates a more\n\nplausible    sequence    of   events    than   Kominsky's    testimony.     If\n\nKominsky actually saw what he professed to see, it is virtually\n\ncertain that he was following Alford for significantly longer than\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f49 seconds, which would mean that Alford's statement that Kominsky\n\nbegan following her while she was still some distance from West\n\nBridgewater may have been correct.       Indeed, the district court\n\nnoted as an aside at sentencing that Kominsky \"might have been off\n\non the times\" in his testimony about the minutes before the vehicle\n\nstop.\n\n           4.   Testimony disbelieved by the district court\n\n           The district court disbelieved Kominsky on at least two\n\nimportant points relating to his initial encounter with Henderson,\n\nand on another matter relating to Kominsky's ability to testify\n\naccurately about his conduct and motivations during vehicle stops.\n\n                   a.   A demand or a request\n\n           The district court disbelieved Kominsky on the question\n\nof whether he requested or demanded that Henderson write down his\n\nidentifying information.    Kominsky testified that \"I observed that\n\nthe passenger, who turned out to be Mr. Henderson, wasn't wearing\n\na seat belt, and asked him if he had any identification on him . .\n\n. .   He said 'no, I don't have any ID on me' . . . .   I then asked\n\nhim if he would mind writing down [his] name, date of birth, and\n\nSocial Security number on a piece of paper . . . [which] he did.\"\n\nKominsky said that when Henderson asked why he had to write down\n\nhis identifying information, he said: \"You're not wearing your seat\n\nbelt, sir.\"     At that point, Kominsky said, Henderson voluntarily\n\n\"complied . . . He picked up a piece of paper.   He used my pen.   He\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fwrote down his information.\"              Kominsky later clarified that he did\n\nnot even think that there was a \"legal way for me to force\" a\n\npassenger     in     a    stopped       car    to    write    down        his    identifying\n\ninformation in order to be cited for a seatbelt violation.\n\n             Alford       contradicted        Kominsky       both    as     to    whether      he\n\nmentioned anything about a seatbelt violation to Henderson and as\n\nto whether Kominsky merely requested -- rather than demanded --\n\nHenderson's information.               She testified that when Henderson asked\n\nKominsky why he needed to write down his social security number and\n\ndate   of    birth,      Kominsky       responded:     \"Just        write       your    fucking\n\ninformation on the paper before I snatch you up.\"                                      Alford's\n\ntestimony on this point was consistent.                      However, Alford related\n\nKominsky's profanity only reluctantly, after the district court\n\ntold   her    that       she    was    \"required\"     to     state    Kominsky's            words\n\naccurately, \"even if it's language we wouldn't ordinarily use.\" In\n\nits written findings, the district court said that after \"Henderson\n\ntold   Kominsky          that     he    did     not    have     a     license          or     any\n\nidentification,\"\n\n             Kominsky instructed Henderson to write his\n             name, date of birth, and social security\n             number on a piece of paper. Henderson asked\n             Kominsky   why   he  had   to   provide   that\n             information. Kominsky did not answer the\n             question, but insisted that Henderson give him\n             the requested information.\n\nHenderson I, 229 F. Supp. 2d at 37 (emphasis added).                             The district\n\ncourt indicated that this finding was significant.                           In talking to\n\n\n                                              -23-\n\fcounsel after the second suppression hearing, the district court\n\nnoted its findings on these points before saying: \"back on [sic]\n\nOctober, I didn't believe everything that Mr. Kominsky said and I\n\nstill don't.\"\n\n                      b. Any statement by Kominsky at the scene about\n                      a seatbelt\n\n           On   the    important    question       of   whether   Kominsky   said\n\nanything about a seatbelt violation while speaking with Henderson\n\nand   Alford,   the    district    court    also    specifically    sided    with\n\nAlford's testimony over Kominsky's.            Kominsky testified that he\n\ntold Henderson, after he asked why he had to write down his\n\ninformation, \"You're not wearing your seatbelt, sir.\"\n\n           The district court found, to the contrary, that when\n\n\"Henderson asked Kominsky why he had to provide that information[,]\n\nKominsky did not answer the question.\" Later, speaking to counsel,\n\nthe district court summarized the testimony on this issue and its\n\nfinding:   \"Mr. Henderson says: 'Why do I need to give you that?'\n\nAnd according to Kominsky he says 'because you're not wearing a\n\nseat belt.'     You don't find that in my [first decision on the\n\nmotion to suppress].\"       On an issue directly relevant to Kominsky's\n\ninsistence that Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt, the district\n\ncourt's finding was contrary to Kominsky's testimony.\n\n                      c.   Profanity during the demand\n\n           The government avers that the district court made no\n\nfinding as to whether Kominsky actually used the profanity Alford\n\n                                     -24-\n\fascribed to him. However, the district court orally indicated that\n\nit found Alford's testimony more credible than Kominsky's on this\n\npoint as well, stating after hearing Bellas's account of Kominsky's\n\nlanguage at the second suppression hearing that \"my sense [is] that\n\nOfficer Kominsky, you know, was not, well, was not likely to have\n\nbeen, you know, quite as polite in talking to Mr. Henderson as he\n\n[] described in his testimony.\"              Whether or not the district court\n\ncredited    every    word    of    Alford's     quotation      of    Kominsky,   the\n\nimportant    point    is    that       the   district   court       again   rejected\n\nKominsky's    credibility         on    an   issue   closely    related     to   his\n\ninsistence that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt.\n\n                     d.     The Bellas stop\n\n            The district court also disbelieved Kominsky's account of\n\nhis interactions with Bellas, the high school student who testified\n\nthat he had twice been stopped by Kominsky while driving on Plain\n\nStreet from his school in Brockton to his home in East Bridgewater.\n\nAccording to Bellas, the first time he was stopped, Kominsky\n\napproached the car and said: \"I smell marijuana.                    And he asked me\n\nhow much marijuana had I smoked in the nighttime.\"                   Bellas denied\n\nhaving smoked marijuana.               There is no indication that he had.\n\nKominsky did not even perform any kind of sobriety check.                    Bellas\n\ntestified that Kominsky then ordered him out of the car, told him\n\nthat he \"was going to jail\" if he did not say where he was hiding\n\nmarijuana, and then searched him in a \"very physical manner.\"\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fKominsky took off Bellas's shoes and unbuckled his pants, and did\n\nthe same to Bellas's friend, a young man named Carlos Gomes\n\nPereira, who was riding as a passenger.                Then, Bellas said,\n\nKominsky \"ransacked\" the car, throwing his schoolbooks and homework\n\ninto the street, and pulling up the carpet. Lieutenant Rogers, the\n\nsecond-ranking officer on the West Bridgewater Police (subordinate\n\nonly   to   Kominsky's   father,    the    Chief),   later   confirmed      that\n\nBellas's belongings had been thrown into disarray and that the\n\ncarpet had been dislodged. After completing his search and finding\n\nno contraband, Kominsky left Bellas's belongings in the street and\n\ntold him he could go.       Bellas went home, and the next day his\n\nparents took him to the police station and filed a complaint.\n\nRogers, who investigated, told Bellas and his family that he had\n\nbeen the victim of a \"profile\" stop.          Noting Rogers's comment and\n\ndocuments in evidence indicating that Kominsky stopped minority\n\ndrivers at a higher rate than their proportion of the local\n\npopulation,    Henderson   argued    to    the   district    court   that    the\n\n\"profile\" remark suggested Kominsky's possible motive in stopping\n\ntheir vehicle and in investigating Henderson. Henderson and Alford\n\nare African-American.\n\n            Kominsky also pulled Bellas over a second time in the\n\nsame area, purportedly to cite him for having a muffler that was\n\ntoo loud.     The car was towed for unrelated reasons.           Rather than\n\ngiving Bellas a ride home, Kominsky made Bellas walk.                       When\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fBellas's father complained again to Rogers, Rogers went to the tow\n\nyard with Bellas, found that the car's muffler was not loud, and\n\nvoided the citation that Kominsky had issued.     Kominsky admitted\n\nthat he had stopped Bellas and searched him, and that he had not\n\ngiven Bellas any citation pursuant to the first stop. But Kominsky\n\ndenied that he had been unduly aggressive during that stop or that\n\nhe had asked about marijuana instead of asking Bellas for his\n\nlicense and registration.\n\n           The district court found Bellas's testimony more credible\n\nthan Kominsky's.   In its oral remarks after the second suppression\n\nhearing, after calling attention to the fact that it \"didn't\n\nbelieve everything that Mr. Kominsky said,\" the district court\n\nstated: \"in fact, I'm not inclined to believe his rendition of\n\nevents with Bellas either.   If I had the Bellas case in front of me\n\nit wouldn't be that hard.\"    In its written findings, the district\n\ncourt stated that: \"the court finds Christopher Bellas's testimony\n\nconcerning Kominsky's conduct when Bellas was stopped to be more\n\naccurate than Kominsky's version of events.\"   Henderson II, 265 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 116. Again, the district court discredited Kominsky on\n\nan important issue even though the only evidence contrary to\n\nKominsky's testimony was the testimony of a driver whom he had\n\nstopped.\n\n           5.   Testimony contradicted by other police officers\n\n           In at least two ways relevant to the question of whether\n\n\n                                -27-\n\fKominsky's   testimony    about   Henderson's     seatbelt   was   accurate,\n\nKominsky's testimony was contradicted by other police officers. As\n\nthe government points out, the district court did not explicitly\n\nresolve these contradictions.       However, these contradictions are\n\nrelevant to our inquiry, and, with respect to at least one of them,\n\nthe district court did, in effect, reject Kominsky's account.\n\n                   a.    Kominsky's language during the arrest\n\n           Oliveira contradicted Kominsky as to whether Kominsky\n\nused profanity while arresting Henderson.            When the suppression\n\nhearing was opened for the final time, the parties informed the\n\ndistrict court that Oliveira would testify that Kominsky used\n\nprofanity during Henderson's arrest.            (He did so testify at the\n\nsecond trial.)    Kominsky, on the other hand, testified that he was\n\npolite throughout the encounter.        The government now argues that\n\nthis matter is immaterial because Oliveira's testimony did not\n\noccur until after the final decision on the motion to suppress.\n\nThis argument is misleading. The district court knew that Oliveira\n\nwould contradict Kominsky before it finally denied the motion.             In\n\nfact,   defense   counsel   presented     the   district   court   with   the\n\ngovernment's e-mailed statement that: \"Oliveira stated [in a pre-\n\ntrial conversation with the government] that he recalls in essence\n\nthat Officer Kominsky used some form of the f--- word when asking\n\nMr. Henderson to get out of the vehicle.\"\n\n           The district court declined to hear Oliveira's testimony\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fin person before reconsidering the suppression motion for the final\n\ntime because \"I don't need to hear any more to have a low regard\n\nfor Officer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\"\n\n                   b.    The conversation at the station\n\n           Kominsky also was contradicted on the important question\n\nof whether his shift supervisor on the night of Henderson's arrest,\n\nwho considered himself Kominsky's mentor, provided Kominsky with an\n\nopportunity to fabricate his recollection that Henderson was not\n\nwearing a seatbelt. As we discussed above, Kominsky testified that\n\nhe made a statement about the purported seatbelt violation while\n\ntalking to Henderson at the scene.        As already noted, the district\n\ncourt rejected this account.         No other witness testified that\n\nKominsky said anything about a seatbelt violation before returning\n\nto the police station.        Oliveira testified that Kominsky said\n\nnothing about a seatbelt to him at the scene.             Kominsky did not\n\nactually   write   a   seatbelt   citation   until   he   returned   to   the\n\nstation.   The district court expressed interest in this sequence,\n\ntelling defense counsel: \"I told you that I'm interested in knowing\n\nwhat happened back at the station and whether there was any\n\ndiscussion about the ticket.       Ordinarily, I don't call witnesses.\n\nBut don't you want to ask [his shift supervisor] that?\"\n\n           Philip Tuck, who was Kominsky's direct supervisor on the\n\nnight of Henderson's arrest, testified at the second suppression\n\nhearing, largely at the district court's urging.           Defense counsel\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fsaid: \"I do not have any intention of calling Sergeant Tuck,\"\n\nimmediately before the remarks by the district court above.         After\n\nthe district court again asked: \"do you want to call Sergeant\n\nTuck?\" defense counsel agreed to call the witness, responding: \"I'm\n\nhappy -- yes, your Honor, I'll put him up on the stand.\"           In the\n\nend, after some questioning by both counsel, the district court\n\nexamined Tuck itself, at some length.5\n\n          Tuck said that he \"felt a certain fondness for\" Kominsky\n\nand watched out for him.         Tuck testified that when Kominsky\n\nreturned to the station with Henderson, he asked him why he had\n\nstopped Alford's vehicle and why he had asked Henderson to get out\n\nof the car.   We reproduce that testimony in part:\n\n          THE COURT: When Mr. Henderson was arrested,\n          did you have some discussion with Mr. Kominsky\n          about the law with regard to when you could\n          properly ask a passenger for identification?\n\n          TUCK: I believe I asked him his reason for\n          having Mr. Henderson get out of the vehicle.\n\n                                 * * *\n\n          THE COURT: So is it fair to say you didn't\n          hear about a seat belt before, or no seat belt\n          before, Officer Kominsky came in with Mr.\n          Henderson?\n\n          TUCK:    I   believe   that's   probably   a    fair\n          statement\n\n          THE COURT: Then I think you told me a moment\n          ago, you asked Officer Kominsky why he took\n\n\n     5\n       Indeed, the district court questioned             several   of   the\nwitnesses, including Kominsky, at length.\n                          -30-\n\fMr. Henderson out of the car or something to\nthat effect?\n\nTUCK:   Yes, I did.\n\nTHE COURT: In connection with that, did you\ndiscuss what was necessary for that to have\nbeen lawful, as you understood the law?\n\nTUCK:   It would be a violation of some sort.\n\nTHE COURT:     That there had to be a violation?\n\nTUCK:   Yes.\n\nTHE COURT:   Was that discussed with Officer\nKominsky on that evening?\n\nTUCK:   At some point, yes.\n\n                      * * *\n\nTHE COURT: . . . I'm asking you to tell me\nwhat to the best of your memory was said in\nthe conversation between you and Officer\nKominsky?   Apparently, if I understand your\ntestimony right, you said, you know, what\ncaused you to order him to go out of the car?\nWhat caused --\n\nTUCK:   How did this happen, or something like\nthis.\n\nTHE COURT: And someplace in that conversation\nthere was some discussion about what's\nnecessary for that to have been lawful, right?\n\nTUCK:   That's correct, sir.\n\nTHE COURT: And now I'm asking you -- I guess\nI should ask you as a threshold matter, do you\nremember the chronology?\n\nTUCK: Okay, I've got a vague recollection of\nthe conversation that went along the lines of,\nyou know, how did this come down or how did\nyou end up with him out of the car or\nsomething along that line? And he indicated\n\n                  -31-\n\f          that he had not [seen] a seat belt on.\n\n          Tuck    also    said   that,      while   Alford's   citation    and\n\nHenderson's arrest on the old warrant were listed in the \"daily\n\nlog\" kept by the police, nothing was listed there about a seatbelt\n\nviolation (he also stated that this was not unusual).              Tuck said\n\nthat he knew, while talking to Kominsky on the night of Henderson's\n\narrest, that it was \"a big deal\" for the police department to make\n\na federal felon in possession case and agreed that \"whether there\n\nwas a seatbelt violation or some other violation was important to\n\nthe future of the case against Mr. Henderson.\"\n\n          The    district    court    asked     Kominsky   about   the    same\n\nconversation.    To illustrate how markedly Kominsky's testimony\n\ndiffered from Tuck's, we reproduce the relevant exchange:\n\n          THE COURT:        Did Sergeant Tuck ask you any\n          questions?\n\n          KOMINSKY: Not really, that I can recall, your\n          Honor.    Other than the basic information\n          pertaining to Mr. Henderson.\n\n          THE COURT: Do you recall Sergeant Tuck asking\n          you why you asked Mr. Henderson for his date\n          of birth and identity?\n\n          KOMINSKY:      No, sir.\n\n          THE COURT: Do you recall Sergeant Tuck\n          discussing with you whether it was lawful to\n          insist that a passenger provide identifying\n          information so it could be run through the\n          computer?\n\n          KOMINSKY: I did it again, sir, because Mr.\n          Henderson wasn't wearing his seat belt. It's\n          a civil violation.\n\n                                     -32-\n\f          THE COURT:    Right now I'm asking you about\n          your conversation with Sergeant Tuck. I'm not\n          asking you --\n\n          KOMINSKY:    Okay.\n\n          THE COURT: -- what happened on the spot.         Do\n          you understand that?\n\n          KOMINSKY:    Okay, your Honor, I'm sorry.\n          Pertaining to Sergeant Tuck, no, he did not\n          ask me about the identification process with\n          Mr. Henderson pertaining to the seat belt.\n\n          The government argued before the district court that\n\nTuck's testimony \"evol[ved]\" and that, after repeated questioning,\n\nTuck was not sure what he specifically asked Kominsky, but only\n\nthat there was an \"understanding\" reached in the conversation that\n\n\"there had to be a violation.\"          That argument prompted this\n\nresponse from the district court: \"But why shouldn't I find his\n\nfirst answer to be more accurate than the evolving answer?\"\n\n          Orally,     the   district   court   indicated   that   Tuck's\n\ntestimony gave the court further pause about Kominsky's account of\n\nthe events on the night of Henderson's arrest.        Speaking on the\n\nrecord with counsel after the second suppression hearing, the\n\ndistrict court articulated its concern:\n\n          Then [Kominsky] got back to the station, he\n          had a conversation with Sergeant Tuck who\n          knows that if there's no seat belt violation\n          or something similar that [Kominsky's] conduct\n          [] is very problematic . . .. [C]onceivably\n          back at the station Tuck and Kominsky talk.\n          Tuck says why, why did you ask for his\n          identifying information? Kominsky says, well,\n          I always do that, or I do it whenever I feel\n          like it. Then Tuck says you got a problem,\n\n                             -33-\n\f            they might     have   contrived      the     seat    belt\n            excuse.\n\n            6.   The district court's general impressions of Kominsky\n\n            Obviously, a court of appeals is not in as good a\n\nposition as the district court to assess a witness's \"demeanor and\n\ninflection.\"       Anderson 470 U.S. at 575.             That reality is an\n\nimportant   impediment    to   the     rejection   of    a   district   court's\n\ncredibility      determinations   on    appeal.         Here,    however,    that\n\nimpediment has little force.         Every time the district court spoke\n\ngenerally   about    matters   relating     to   Kominsky's      \"demeanor   and\n\ninflection,\" it cast doubt on his reliability as a witness.                   We\n\nrelate some notable examples and their contexts.\n\n            In response to a question by the government at the first\n\ntrial, Kominsky stated that he had testified at the motion to\n\nsuppress \"about four days ago.\"         In reality, Kominsky's testimony\n\nhad been 22 days earlier.      On recross examination, defense counsel\n\nfollowed up on this misstatement.         When defense counsel raised the\n\nissue, Kominsky confirmed his belief that the suppression hearing\n\nhad taken place \"four to six days\" earlier.             Defense counsel asked\n\nKominsky what day it was.      He said: \"Wednesday.\"            It was actually\n\nThursday.    Defense counsel then asked: \"Do you know what the date\n\nis today?\" Kominsky responded: \"No, I don't sir.                I don't know the\n\nday or the month today.           I'm sorry.       I've lost it.\"             The\n\ngovernment later explained this testimony by telling the district\n\ncourt that Kominsky was sick.\n\n                                     -34-\n\f            Despite this excuse, the district court clearly was\n\nconcerned   about   Kominsky's    performance    on    the   stand.      After\n\nagreeing to grant Henderson a mistrial, the district court urged\n\nthe government to \"reconsider whether this federal case ought to be\n\nvoluntarily dismissed. . ..      [W]hether he's ill or not, we now have\n\na federal case where the government's prime witness testified\n\nyesterday that he didn't know what month it was.\"\n\n            Kominsky was scheduled to testify on the first day of the\n\nsecond   suppression   hearing.       However,        Kominsky     missed   his\n\nscheduled appearance, again because he was sick.                  The district\n\ncourt refused to take Kominsky's word on this excuse. The district\n\ncourt also refused to believe that Kominsky's poor performance on\n\nthe witness stand was a result of illness.       In the district court's\n\nwords:\n\n            I'll tell you, you know, my law clerk said to\n            me several days ago, it will be interesting to\n            see Officer Kominsky on the stand when he's\n            not sick. Because you may recall on Thursday,\n            November 14, he thought it was Wednesday, he\n            didn't know it was November, and he didn't\n            know it was the 14th.    And I said, I don't\n            think he's going to be any better. And I'll\n            leave it there for now. . . . But, you know,\n            a police officer shouldn't be unnaturally\n            anxious about coming to court and testifying.\n\n(Emphasis    added.)    The   court    then   insisted       on    questioning\n\nKominsky's doctor about the new illness, which the doctor confirmed\n\nwas a gastrointestinal infection.\n\n            Kominsky's subsequent performance did not improve the\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fdistrict court's impression of him.        As noted above, the district\n\ncourt stated before the second trial that it had \"a low regard for\n\nOfficer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\"             Similarly, at\n\nsentencing, the district court said: \"I'll candidly state that, in\n\na general sense, I have disquiet about Officer Kominsky and the\n\nWest Bridgewater police . . . .            And the idea that the U.S.\n\nAttorney's office is bringing cases which in effect have 20-year\n\nmandatory sentences when there's no parole in federal court based\n\non that kind of police work and that kind of testimony disturbs\n\nme.\"\n\n           The   district   court   also   was   blunt   about   Kominsky's\n\ncapacity to testify accurately.        At sentencing, looking back at\n\nKominsky's entire testimony during the proceedings, the district\n\ncourt summed up its impression: \"Officer Kominsky, even if he were\n\ntrying to tell the truth, is perhaps the worst law enforcement\n\nwitness, who was trying to be candid, assuming he was trying to be\n\ncandid, that I've ever encountered.\"\n\nD.   The evidence on the seatbelt issue\n\n           The only evidence that Henderson was not wearing his\n\nseatbelt before Kominsky demanded his identifying information was\n\nthe uncorroborated testimony of Kominsky.        In his testimony before\n\nthe district court, Kominsky was empirically wrong on three points,\n\nmarkedly inconsistent on at least one highly relevant point,\n\nimplausible on another point, expressly disbelieved by the district\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\fcourt on at least three and probably four points, and contradicted\n\nby other police officers on two important points (as to at least\n\none of which the district court indicated orally that it was\n\ndisinclined to accept Kominsky's story).      In addition, Kominsky\n\nforgot the day of the week and month of the year while testifying\n\nin front of a jury in federal court.   This performance prompted the\n\ndistrict court to say that it had \"disquiet\" and was \"disturb[ed]\"\n\nabout the case's very prosecution in federal court.\n\n           Yet Kominsky unwaveringly testified that Henderson was\n\nnot wearing any seatbelt in the stopped car.     On this ultimately\n\ncrucial point, despite its serious reservations about Kominsky's\n\ncredibility and his capacities as a law enforcement officer, the\n\ndistrict court believed Kominsky because \"other credible evidence\"\n\nbolstered Kominsky's story.    The district court did not explain\n\nwhat that \"other credible evidence\" was.    The government does not\n\ncontend that there was any \"other credible evidence,\" apart from\n\nKominsky's own testimony, to bolster the district court's finding.\n\nWe cannot find that \"other credible evidence\" in the record.\n\n          Kominsky said that he told Henderson and Alford that\n\nHenderson was not wearing his seatbelt, as a justification for\n\nasking for his license.   As we discussed above, the district court\n\ndid not believe this story.      No other witness indicated that\n\nKominsky said anything about a seatbelt until he returned to the\n\npolice station where, according to Tuck's testimony, Tuck advised\n\n\n                                -37-\n\fhim that he would need to articulate a reason for investigating the\n\npassenger in a stopped car.        As the district court observed to\n\ncounsel: \"He didn't write the seatbelt thing . . . [until] he went\n\nback and spoke to somebody.\"      Kominsky also did not say anything to\n\nhis supervisor on the radio about a seatbelt violation -- even\n\nthough he did discuss the citation that he would give Alford for\n\ndriving with a suspended license.\n\n            The government does not argue that Oliveira's testimony\n\ncorroborates Kominsky's report that Henderson was not wearing his\n\nseatbelt.   Indeed, the government does not argue that Oliveira was\n\neven on the scene of the vehicle stop in time to see whether\n\nHenderson was wearing his seatbelt during the stop.        To do so, it\n\nwould have to disbelieve Kominsky on the question whether Oliveira\n\neven arrived at the side of the car in time to see whether\n\nHenderson   was   wearing   his   seatbelt   before   Kominsky   demanded\n\nHenderson's identifying information.         At the first suppression\n\nhearing, Kominsky testified that \"Officer Oliveira was arriving at\n\nthe time that I was speaking to Mr. Henderson.        He was pulling up\n\nbehind us.\"   At the second hearing, Kominsky said: \"no, sir\" when\n\nasked whether Oliveira was at the side of the car during his\n\ninitial encounter with Alford and Henderson.           It is true that\n\nOliveira testified that he was at the car earlier than Kominsky and\n\nAlford said, and that he thought he would have remembered if\n\nHenderson was wearing a seatbelt and that he did not remember that\n\n\n                                   -38-\n\fhe was. However, Oliveira also testified that he did not \"remember\n\nlooking      in   [Alford's   car]   and   making   a   mental     note\"   whether\n\nHenderson was wearing his seatbelt.            And Oliveira said that he had\n\ntalked about the incident with Kominsky after the first trial ended\n\nin a mistrial, and that the issue of the seatbelt \"may have come\n\nup.\"        Finally,   Oliveira    testified   that     Kominsky    did    not   say\n\nanything to him about a seatbelt while they were at the scene.                   For\n\nall    of    these   reasons,     Oliveira's   testimony    does    not    bolster\n\nKominsky's account about Henderson's seatbelt.\n\n              Finally, the district court heard ample evidence that\n\nKominsky had a tendency to exceed the proper bounds of a vehicle\n\nstop and to make unwarranted demands on drivers and passengers.\n\nThis was the unmistakable import of the evidence about the Bellas\n\nstops, which the court credited.           Tuck testified that Kominsky had\n\namassed \"more than the average\" number of complaints about his\n\nconduct. Rogers testified that he had had to review proper vehicle\n\nstop procedures with Kominsky after concluding that Kominsky was\n\noverstepping the proper bounds of vehicle stops. Even as this case\n\nwas ongoing, citizens were complaining about Kominsky's performance\n\nof his duties during vehicle stops.             Kominsky himself testified:\n\n\"If I feel like asking everybody in the car for their license, I\n\nwill,\" even though, as the other officers testified, such conduct\n\nby a police officer was a violation of Massachusetts state law.\n\nAll of these factors leave little doubt that Kominsky would have no\n\n\n                                       -39-\n\fcompunction about demanding Henderson's social security number and\n\ndate of birth even if Henderson had not violated some law.\n\n          This is not a case in which a witness's inaccuracies were\n\ncollateral.   The most inaccurate parts of Kominsky's testimony --\n\nthe topics on which he testified with certainty but was clearly\n\nproven wrong -- relate directly to the officer's account of the\n\nvehicle stop of Alford and Henderson and to the short period during\n\nwhich he professed to observe Henderson not wearing his seatbelt.\n\nOn every point relating to the stop where empirical evidence could\n\ncontradict Kominsky, it did.     Kominsky repeatedly insisted that\n\nAlford's car had standard manual seatbelts.   The car itself proved\n\notherwise.     Kominsky recalled that Henderson was wearing a dark\n\nsweatshirt.   The documentary evidence showed that he was wearing a\n\nlight-colored one. Kominsky testified that he was perfectly polite\n\nduring the vehicle stop.       Both Alford and Oliveira testified\n\notherwise, and the district court indicated orally that it believed\n\nthem. Kominsky testified that Henderson voluntarily wrote down his\n\nidentifying information.   The district court concluded that he did\n\nnot.   Kominsky said that he had Henderson's purported seatbelt\n\nviolation in mind from the moment he demanded his identification\n\nand said so.      No other witness testified that Kominsky said\n\nanything about a seatbelt until after returning to the police\n\nstation and being reminded that he could not investigate a vehicle\n\npassenger without cause.   The district court said that it did not\n\n\n                                -40-\n\fbelieve Kominsky's statement to the contrary.                      On each of these\n\npoints save the color of Henderson's shirt, Kominsky's testimony,\n\nthough inaccurate, contradicted, or inconsistent, was just as\n\nemphatic as his testimony about Henderson's seatbelt. All told, in\n\na record that runs well into the thousands of pages, there is\n\nnothing apart from Kominsky's own testimony to indicate that\n\nKominsky was telling the truth about Henderson's seatbelt -- even\n\nthough he was lying or mistaken about so many related facts.\n\n           In    the     end,     the       district    court      acknowledged      the\n\ndifficulty of believing Kominsky about the seatbelt.                        Considering\n\nonly the information in the record after the first suppression\n\nhearing,   the       district    court      termed     the   issue    of    Henderson's\n\nseatbelt a \"close\" one.            After hearing more information at the\n\nsecond suppression hearing that challenged Kominsky's account and\n\ncredibility,     the     district       court,     although     again      denying   the\n\nsuppression motion, observed that: \"the question whether Henderson\n\nwas   wearing    a    seatbelt    .     .   .   continues     to     be    close.\"    At\n\nsentencing, the district court said: \"I two times found . . . that\n\nMr. Henderson was not wearing a seat belt.                    That much of Officer\n\nKominsky I credited.        But, in candor, I'm not close to sure about\n\nthat.\"   Later, in the same hearing, the district court stated: \"I\n\nmight only be 55 percent sure of the facts.\"\n\n           What apparently tipped the balance for the court on the\n\nseatbelt issue was \"other credible evidence\" that somehow salvaged\n\n\n                                            -41-\n\fKominsky's badly damaged credibility.                 Yet neither the district\n\ncourt   nor    the    government     has    specified     what   \"other       credible\n\nevidence\" might bolster Kominsky's story.                 As indicated, we have\n\nnot found that \"other credible evidence\" anywhere in the record.\n\n              We    can   understand       the   district     court's        continued\n\nuncertainty about its seatbelt finding.                    In light of all the\n\nfactors we have discussed, and after a careful review of the\n\nrecord, we are left, respectfully, with \"a definite and firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\"                Anderson, 470 U.S.\n\nat 575.   Wholly dependent as it was on the credibility of Kominsky,\n\nthe court's finding that the government met its burden of proving\n\nthat Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the stop was\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n                                       III.\n\n              Anticipating     the   possible     rejection      of   its     seatbelt\n\nargument, the government asks us to conclude that Kominsky could\n\ndemand Henderson's identifying information and conduct a computer\n\nsearch of his records \"for reasons of officer safety.\"                       There may\n\nbe cases where an officer is warranted in demanding a passenger's\n\nidentification for safety reasons, but this is not one of them.\n\n              The    scope   and   duration      of   a   vehicle     stop    must   be\n\n\"'reasonably related [] to the circumstances that justified the\n\n[stop] in the first place'\" unless the police have a basis for\n\nexpanding their investigation. See United States v. Cook, 277 F.3d\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\f82, 85 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20\n\n(1968); see also United States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   It is also well established that a police officer cannot\n\nstop a citizen and demand identification \"without any specific\n\nbasis for believing he is involved in criminal activity.\" Brown v.\n\nTexas, 443 U.S. 47, 52 (1979).            Attempting to establish that\n\nKominsky's investigation of Henderson was not proscribed by these\n\nprinciples,    the   government   cites   cases   in   which   certain   \"de\n\nminimis\" intrusions on privacy have been allowed as a matter of\n\ncourse during vehicle stops.\n\n          The government emphasizes the Eleventh Circuit's holding\n\nin United States v. Purcell, 236 F.3d 1274, 1277-80 (11th Cir.\n\n2001).   In Purcell, the question was not whether a police officer\n\ncould demand a passenger's identification.         Instead, the question\n\nwas whether a police officer could extend a vehicle stop by at most\n\nthree minutes -- a period the same court later characterized as \"de\n\nminimis\" -- to run a criminal history check on identification he\n\nalready had.   United States v. Boyce, 351 F.3d 1102, 1107 n.4 (11th\n\nCir. 2003).    Furthermore, in Purcell, there were circumstances not\n\npresent here that could have helped legitimate the police officer's\n\nparticularized suspicions of the subject in that case. The car was\n\nstopped in \"a very high crime corridor,\" and it was rented, but not\n\nto the driver of the car.     See Purcell, 236 F.3d at 1280.\n\n          The Eleventh Circuit has clarified that Purcell should\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fnot be read to legitimate extending vehicle stops in order to\n\nconduct investigations that are not related to the reason for the\n\nstop.   See Boyce, 351 F.3d at 1107 (concluding that it was not\n\nreasonable for a police officer to prolong a vehicle stop for 12\n\nminutes, to investigate the car for narcotics without reasonable\n\nsuspicion for doing so).\n\n           The government relies also on three Supreme Court cases.\n\nThe first two establish that the Fourth Amendment does not require\n\nthat a police officer have cause to order the occupants of a\n\nvehicle to exit during a stop.       See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S.\n\n106, 111 n.6 (1977) (\"[O]nce a motor vehicle has been lawfully\n\ndetained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the\n\ndriver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth\n\nAmendment's proscription of unreasonable seizures.\"); Maryland v.\n\nWilson, 519 U.S. 408 (1997) (same for passengers).            The premise of\n\nboth of these cases is that ordering a person out of a car for the\n\nduration of a traffic stop, without more, is a minimal imposition\n\non persons already detained.         Such an order does not extend the\n\nduration   of   a   traffic   stop   and    represents    only   a   \"minimal\"\n\nintrusion on privacy.     See Wilson, 519 U.S. at 414-15.\n\n           In Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, 542\n\nU.S. 177 (2004), the final Supreme Court case the government cites,\n\nthe Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a Nevada law requiring\n\nsubjects of Terry stops to state their name.             The Court held that\n\n\n                                     -44-\n\fthe Terry line of cases \"permit a State to require a suspect to\n\ndisclose his name in the course of a Terry stop.\"                          Id. at 187\n\n(emphasis added).          The demand in Hiibel survived Fourth Amendment\n\nscrutiny because it \"does not alter the nature of the stop itself:\n\nit does not change its duration.\" Id. at 188.\n\n               The facts here are markedly different than the facts in\n\nany   of      these      cases.     Most    notably,    Kominsky's        demand   for\n\nHenderson's           identifying     information           and    his     subsequent\n\ninvestigation of Henderson expanded the scope of the stop, changed\n\nthe target of the stop, and prolonged the stop.                          Alford, not\n\nHenderson, was the subject of the initial stop.                          According to\n\nKominsky, Henderson was not detained at all prior to the demand for\n\nhis identification; rather \"he could have just walked away.\"\n\nAccording to Oliveira, it took Kominsky between ten and fifteen\n\nminutes to run a criminal history check on Henderson and longer,\n\nafter       that,   to    confirm   the    results     of    the   check    with   the\n\ndispatcher.           Oliveira's time line is consistent with Alford's\n\ntestimony that twenty minutes elapsed between Kominsky's demand for\n\nHenderson's information and his return to the car.6                           As the\n\nofficers testified, apart from the records check on Henderson,\n\nthere was no other reason to prolong the stop.                     Kominsky already\n\n\n\n\n        6\n       Kominsky testified that he did not remember how long the\nrecords check took to process, but that it was \"fairly quick.\"\n                                           -45-\n\fknew everything that he wanted to know about Alford.7       The standard\n\nprocedure in the circumstances, the officers testified, would have\n\nbeen to issue a citation to Alford, arrange to have the car towed,\n\nand let the driver and passenger leave the scene (either by foot or\n\nby a ride in a police cruiser to a place from which they could call\n\na taxi).    Presumably, if Kominsky had not demanded Henderson's\n\nidentifying information and investigated him, Henderson would have\n\n\"just walked away.\"\n\n           There   was   no   particularized   reason,   discounting   the\n\ndiscredited seatbelt violation, for Kominsky to launch into an\n\ninvestigation of Henderson.      Kominsky might reasonably have asked\n\nHenderson for his license to see if he could drive the car back to\n\nBoston.    But when Henderson responded that he did not have his\n\nlicense, there was, as the district court found, no further reason\n\nto inquire about his ability to drive Alford's car back to Boston.\n\nHenderson, of course, could not drive the car without producing a\n\nlicense. Nor was there any other remotely particularized rationale\n\nfor investigating Henderson.      Kominsky did not perceive any danger\n\nfrom Henderson, nor did Kominsky have any reason to suspect that\n\nHenderson was engaged in any kind of illegal activity.          The stop\n\nwas not made in a dangerous location.      Alford's underlying traffic\n\nviolation -- driving with a suspended license -- did not raise the\n\n\n     7\n       Kominsky emphatically reiterated that there was \"no need in\n[his] mind to reenter [Alford's] name\" into the computer database\nfor a records check.\n                                   -46-\n\fspecter of criminal activity involving Henderson.                Henderson was\n\nnot acting suspiciously.         Indeed, the government conceded to the\n\ndistrict court that \"the government is not contending in this case\n\nthat   Mr.   Henderson   at    the    time    Officer     Kominsky     asked   for\n\nidentification was engaged in other suspicious conduct or that the\n\nevidence supports that.\" In light of these facts, the government's\n\n\"officer safety\" argument fails.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n             The district court handled this difficult case with skill\n\nand care.      Troubled by the government's belated disclosure of\n\nevidence pertinent to Kominsky's conduct at vehicle stops and other\n\nissues, the court declared a mistrial of Henderson's first trial\n\nand reopened the suppression issue.             The court said that it was\n\n\"disturb[ed]\" about the government's reliance on the person it\n\ncalled \"perhaps the worst law enforcement witness, who was trying\n\nto be candid, assuming he was trying to be candid, that I've ever\n\nencountered.\"      The   court      stated:    \"I    am   concerned    about   the\n\ncompetence and practices of . . . Kominsky.\"                    Still, on the\n\ncritical     factual   issue   in    this     case   --   whether     to   believe\n\nKominsky's testimony that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt --\n\nthe district court accepted Kominsky's account on the basis of\n\n\"other credible evidence\" not specified by the court or by the\n\ngovernment.\n\n             In reviewing the record, we have found no such evidence.\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fInstead, we have found that Kominsky's testimony was riddled with\n\nimplausibilities and inconsistencies, and that it was disbelieved\n\nby the district court in important respects and contradicted by law\n\nenforcement witnesses in others. Under these circumstances, we are\n\nleft with a firm and definite conviction that the district court's\n\ncritical finding that Kominsky credibly testified that Henderson\n\nwas not wearing a seatbelt was clearly erroneous.   The government\n\nestablished no other justification for Kominsky's investigation of\n\nHenderson's identifying information.   Therefore, we must reverse\n\nthe order denying the motion to suppress and vacate the judgment of\n\nconviction.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -48-\n\f",

After demanding Henderson's social security number and date of birth, Kominsky found that a police database listed an old warrant for Henderson's arrest. Acting on the database, which turned out to be wrong about the warrant, Kominsky searched Henderson and found a gun. Before trial, Henderson moved to suppress the gun, arguing that it had been the product of an illegal stop and that Kominsky had no basis for investigating the passenger in a stopped car. The district court denied Henderson's motion to suppress the gun and held a trial. After the government belatedly produced evidence relevant to Henderson's motion to suppress, the district court declared a mistrial and held a second suppression hearing. After the district court again denied Henderson's motion and held a second trial, a jury convicted Henderson of being a felon in possession of a handgun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson now appeals his conviction and sentence, focusing on the district court's finding that he was not wearing his seatbelt in the stopped car. Henderson argues that the district court clearly erred in believing Kominsky's testimony that he was not wearing a seatbelt. In support of this assertion, Henderson emphasizes that Kominsky's testimony was riddled with proven inaccuracies and contradictions and that the district court explicitly disbelieved important portions of Kominsky's testimony. We agree with Henderson. After a careful review of this unusual record, we are convinced that this is one of those rare cases in which a district court's credibility determination is clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anticipating the possibility of this result, the government offers \"officer safety\" as an alternative basis for investigating Henderson and affirming the conviction. However, Kominsky admitted that he did not have any particularized reason to suspect Henderson of dangerousness or wrongdoing, nor any specific basis apart from a purported seatbelt violation for prolonging the stop in order to investigate Henderson. On these facts, we reject the government's alternative argument as well. Accordingly, we vacate the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review here some of the background facts and the procedural history of this case, leaving the details for a discussion of Kominsky's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about ten P.M. on a May evening in 2001, Henderson and his girlfriend, Patrice Alford, were in Brockton, Massachusetts, attempting to get back to Boston, where they lived, after visiting relatives. The couple &#8212; who had stopped dating by the time of the trial &#8212; were in a blue Nissan sedan. Henderson was sitting in the front passenger seat. Alford, who was driving, was lost. Looking for the expressway, Alford proceeded down Plain Street in Brockton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it turned out, Alford was going in the wrong direction. Rather than towards the expressway to Boston, which is just west of downtown Brockton, Plain Street goes southeast from downtown Brockton to the town of East Bridgewater, where it becomes Pleasant Street. Alford observed a police car pull behind her and, because she was being followed, she drove especially carefully. Between Brockton and East Bridgewater, Plain Street cuts through the extreme northeast corner of the town of West Bridgewater. A car driving from Brockton to East Bridgewater on Plain Street travels through West Bridgewater for approximately three tenths of a mile (about 500 yards). At the 35 mile-per-hour speed limit, the transit takes about 30 seconds. Plain Street cuts a straight line through West Bridgewater, without substantial curves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky, assigned to patrol that corner of West Bridgewater, stopped Alford's car. He later gave three reasons for the stop, saying that the car was driving slowly, had crossed over the center line of the short stretch of Plain Street in West Bridgewater between two and five times, and was registered to a woman, Alford, who had a suspended driver's license. During the stop, Kominsky asked for Henderson's license and then, when Henderson said he did not have a license, demanded Henderson's name, date of birth, and social security number. Kominsky later testified that he wanted Handerson's identification in order to cite Henderson for not wearing a seatbelt. By entering Henderson's information into a database he could access from his laptop computer, Kominsky discovered that there was a five-year-old warrant for Henderson's arrest. Kominsky acted on the information in the database to arrest Henderson. As he was searching Henderson pursuant to the arrest, Kominsky found some ammunition. Henderson then told Kominsky that he was carrying a handgun as well. That gun was the basis for this prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second police officer, Carlos Oliveira of the East Bridgewater Police, arrived on the scene in time to see and hear the end of Kominsky's initial encounter with Alford and Henderson. However, Alford and Kominsky both testified that Oliveira did not approach the car until Henderson was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it turned out, the warrant Kominsky relied on in arresting Henderson had long since been revoked. However, Henderson accepts for the purpose of this appeal that Kominsky could rely in \"good faith\" on the computer system. Henderson's theory throughout this case has been that Kominsky never should have obtained from him the personal identification information that led to the computer error and then to his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2002, the district court held a two-day evidentiary hearing on Henderson's motion to suppress. Henderson contested both the legality of the vehicle stop and the legality of Kominsky's demand for his identifying information. Kominsky, Alford, and an investigator for Henderson testified for the defense. Concerned about the discrepancy between Kominsky's testimony that Alford's car did not have automatic seatbelts and Alford's testimony that it did, the district court took a view of Alford's car and determined that it did indeed have automatic seatbelts. Nonetheless, the district court denied Henderson's motion in a published opinion. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d 35 (D.Mass.2002) (<i>Henderson I</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case then proceeded to trial. Kominsky was the first witness. After his direct examination, the government belatedly produced documents indicating that Kominsky had been the subject of complaints for subjecting drivers to baseless and harassing stops, along the same stretch of road where he stopped Alford and Henderson. Henderson asked that the trial be stayed and the motion to suppress reopened. The district court conducted a voir dire of Kominsky and then allowed the trial to continue while it considered Henderson's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a break in Alford's testimony, an Assistant United States Attorney told defense counsel, while Alford was sitting nearby, that Alford was \"going to jail for perjury.\" Alford heard the remark and, according to the defense, became nervous about returning to the stand. The district court examined Alford and determined that there was no impediment to her continued testimony. The next day, however, citing the government's delayed disclosure and the other \"appellate issues\" that had arisen, the district court declared a mistrial and announced that it would consider whether to dismiss the case with prejudice, in light of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the district court decided not to dismiss the indictment. It did, however, reopen the suppression hearing. At the reopened hearing, the district court heard testimony from Kominsky, Oliveira, other officers who worked with Kominsky, and a young man, Christopher Bellas, who previously had complained of improper vehicle stops by Kominsky. The district court credited Bellas's testimony that Kominsky had twice stopped his car without cause and had acted improperly during the stops. (Kominsky had denied any such misconduct.) Nonetheless, the district court again denied Henderson's motion to suppress in another published order. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 265 F.Supp.2d 115 (D.Mass.2002) (<i>Henderson II</i>). The district court acknowledged that its decision to credit Bellas's testimony over Kominsky's \"lends weight to the contention that Kominsky's testimony relating to Henderson should not be believed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 116. The district court then stated: \"Other credible evidence, however, tends to support Kominsky's testimony\" that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the vehicle stop. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court briefly reopened the suppression hearing a third time shortly before the second trial, when the government produced two recent complaints about vehicle stops by Kominsky and a statement by Oliveira that contradicted Kominsky's previous testimony about the language he used while arresting Henderson. The district court declined to reconsider its ruling on the motion to suppress, reasoning that the additional evidence was \"cumulative\" and that \"I don't need to hear any more to have a low regard for Officer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\"'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson was convicted at a second trial. At sentencing, the district court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I two times found by a preponderance of the credible evidence that Mr. Henderson was not wearing a seat belt. That much of Officer Kominsky I credited. But, in candor, I'm not close to sure about that.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Kominsky could demand that Henderson write down his identifying information because Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt. It is a civil infraction in Massachusetts, carrying as its maximum consequence a fine of $25, for an adult passenger not to wear a seatbelt while \"riding\" in a car. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &#167; 13A. Henderson responds that the court clearly erred when it accepted Kominsky's testimony that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Two unaddressed legal issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing these arguments, we note, without resolving, two legal issues alluded to in the district court but never pursued or resolved. We identify these issues only to avoid any suggestion that we are resolving them by implication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Kominsky did not believe that he had the power to <i>demand</i> a passenger's identification in order to write a citation for a seatbelt violation. In fact, no witness testified that it would be reasonable for a police officer to demand a passenger's identification in order to write a citation for a seatbelt violation. To the contrary, Kominsky testified that \"there's no legal way for me to force [a passenger who is not wearing his seatbelt] to give me the information ... he's entitled to get a citation [] but if he doesn't give me his information I know of no other way [to issue a ticket] other than citing the driver for the violation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Kominsky had testified that he asked Henderson to write down his identifying information and that Henderson voluntarily complied. But the district court never credited this account of voluntary compliance, finding after the first suppression hearing that \"Henderson asked Kominsky why he had to provide that information. Kominsky did not answer the question, but <i>insisted</i> that Henderson give him the requested information.\" <i>Henderson I,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 37 (emphasis added). Kominsky's supervisor, Lieutenant Ray Rogers, also testified that a passenger could be asked but could not be required to produce identifying information unless there was suspicion that he had committed or was committing a crime. In Massachusetts, a seatbelt violation is not a crime. We have found no Massachusetts case that permits a police officer to <i>demand</i> a passenger's social security number and date of birth in order to write a citation for a seatbelt violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second legal issue relates to the absence of any evidence that Henderson failed to wear a seatbelt while the car was moving. Kominsky did not say that he observed any such infraction. Rather, he said that he did not see inside the car until after it stopped. The district court did not say that it had inferred that Henderson was wearing his seatbelt while the car was moving. It is uncontested that some time passed between the stop and Kominsky's approach to the car because Kominsky first made a radio call. The one relevant Massachusetts case that we found concluded that a passenger in a vehicle is not obligated to wear a seatbelt after the vehicle has been stopped by a police officer and cannot be cited on the basis of not wearing a seatbelt during a vehicle stop. <i>See Commonwealth v. Nu&#241;nez,</i> 15 Mass. L. Rptr. 536, 2002 WL 31973248 at *3 (Mass. Super.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we need not decide the legal question of whether Kominsky could demand Henderson's social security number and date of birth for the purpose of a passenger seatbelt violation citation. Similarly, we need not decide whether Henderson could even be cited for failing to wear his seatbelt on the facts presented. The premise for both of these legal issues would be a finding that Kominsky credibly testified that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the stop. As we now explain, we cannot accept that premise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard of review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that \"a district court's choice between two plausible competing interpretations of the facts cannot be clearly erroneous.\" <i>United States v. Weidul,</i> 325 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.2003). Moreover, our inability to see witnesses face-to-face or to appraise in person their \"demeanor and inflection,\" <i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985), makes us \"especially deferential\" to the district court's credibility judgments, <i>United States v. Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2005). Still, as the Supreme Court stated in its seminal case on clear error review:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[F]actors other than demeanor and inflection go into the decision whether or not to believe a witness. Documents or objective evidence may contradict the witness' story; or the story may be so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable fact-finder would not credit it. Where such factors are present, the court of appeals may well find clear error even in a finding purportedly based on a credibility determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504. <i>See also United States v. Forbes,</i> 181 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.1999) (vacating after clear error review factual findings based on a police officer's testimony as to a vehicle stop, where the officer's testimony was \"improbable\" and \"call[ed] into question\" by \"extrinsic evidence,\" and the district court \"did not explain why it found [the police officer] to be credible\"). The basic standard is familiar: we will overturn a district court's factual findings after a suppression hearing \"only if, after reviewing all of the evidence, we have a `definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'\" <i>Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d at 72, quoting <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504. Such instances are rare, especially when the factual findings at issue are made by such a careful and able judge. But this is such an instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Kominsky's testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To explain the clear error in the district court's finding about the seatbelt, we discuss Kominsky's testimony topic by topic, focusing on its documented inaccuracies, internal inconsistencies, and implausibilities. We also note the district court's rejection of Kominsky's credibility on important issues, and the district court's stated impressions of Kominsky's character, demeanor, and professionalism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Testimony empirically disproved</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On several points, Kominsky gave testimony that was later shown to be simply wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The automatic seatbelts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alford's car had automatic seatbelts, a point obviously pertinent to Henderson's appeal. Alford testified that the car had automatic seatbelts. The district court confirmed, after taking a view of the car, that \"[t]he automobile in which Mr. Henderson was riding on the evening in question does, as Ms. Alford testified, have an automatic seat belt for the front seat passenger.\" Kominsky, however, testified repeatedly and with certainty that the car had non-automatic seatbelts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, the district court probed this seatbelt issue carefully. At the first suppression hearing, the court questioned Kominsky about the seatbelt itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The district court took a view of Alford's car the next day. These were its findings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The automobile in which Mr. Henderson was riding on the evening in question does, as Ms. Alford testified, have an automatic seat belt for the front seat passenger. It's a belt that attaches to the frame and, when connected, pushes away from the seat toward the windshield when the door, passenger side door, is open. If a passenger got in and sat down and closed the door, the seatbelt would automatically come back and go diagonally across his chest from his right shoulder to his left waist. There is also a lap belt that needs to be connected manually. The seat belts are black or dark gray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The automatic belt can be disconnected from the door frame and will then roll down into the left-hand side of the passenger seat by the place that the lap belt, I believe, connects or starts from.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's observations contradicted Kominsky's testimony in two important ways. First, Kominsky simply was wrong about there being a non-automatic-type seatbelt in Alford's car. Second &#8212; and even more important &#8212; Kominsky's emphatic testimony about seeing Henderson's \"seat belt [] on the side of the door frame,\" could not have been true. If the seatbelt had been connected, it would have been attached to the frame of the car, as described by the court. If it were disconnected, it would have rolled down into the left hand side of the passenger seat, also as described by the court. It was a physical impossibility for the strap to be in the position Kominsky described. As the district court itself immediately recognized:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think [Kominsky] testified, and I'll have to refresh my recollection &#8212; that it wasn't an automatic seat belt. He remembered it hanging there after Mr. Henderson got out of the car. And whether it was connected or disconnected, it wouldn't have been hanging in the place that a non-automatic seatbelt hangs, in my experience. It either would have been pushed forward if it was connected or it would have been down by the left-hand waist if it was disconnected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Kominsky's testimony was not inaccurate because Alford's car had manual lap belts in addition to automatic seatbelts. This argument is unpersuasive because it parses Kominsky's testimony too finely. While Kominsky did testify that Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt across his lap, he also testified emphatically that Henderson \"did not\" have \"a seat belt going diagonally across his chest.\" Kominsky never testified that he would give a seatbelt citation to someone wearing a shoulder belt but not a lap belt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Number of citations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky testified at the first suppression hearing that he had issued \"over a hundred\" seatbelt citations \"just in this last year.\" To the government, and conceivably to the district court, this was important testimony. The government placed great emphasis on the frequency of Kominsky's seatbelt citations as an explanation for the inaccuracy of his recollection about Alford's car. In light of further questioning, however, neither Kominsky's tabulation nor the government's excuse held up. Asked the same question at trial, Kominsky said that he averaged 25 citations, admitted the inconsistency, and said that he had misunderstood the question \"how many seat belt violations have you written in the last year?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Henderson points out, the record plainly belies Kominsky's statement &#8212; and the government's argument on appeal &#8212; that he misunderstood the question before stating that he issued 100 seatbelt citations a year. In response to follow-up questions at the first suppression hearing, Kominsky reiterated that he had written 100 seatbelt citations \"just in the last year,\" and that he issued a seatbelt citation \"every three days.\" There was no confusion by Kominsky.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second suppression hearing, defense counsel again impeached Kominsky on this point &#8212; with documentary evidence that Kominsky had averaged only fifteen seatbelt citations per year. Kominsky again had an excuse: he had issued more citations but they were missing from computer records because of his bad handwriting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Henderson's attire</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky testified that Henderson was wearing a dark-colored shirt on the night of the arrest. However, documentary evidence &#8212; the inventory list from the jail where Henderson would spend the night &#8212; proved that Henderson was wearing a white shirt. The government argues that the issue is immaterial and points out that Kominsky expressed no certainty when testifying about Henderson's attire. Still, the inaccuracy about the shirt, like the inaccuracy about the automatic seatbelts and the number of seatbelt citations he had written, provides a further ground for questioning Kominsky's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Inconsistent testimony: his motivations for demanding Henderson's identifying information</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson points out that Kominsky's testimony was inconsistent on the obviously pertinent matter of why Kominsky either asked for (in Kominsky's view) or demanded (in Henderson's view) his identifying information. At a detention hearing that occurred shortly after Henderson's arrest, Kominsky said that he secured the identifying information for two reasons: to see if Henderson could drive Alford's car and because Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt. At the first suppression hearing, Kominsky added a third reason: he said that he sometimes asked passengers in stopped cars for their identification because: \"If I feel like asking everybody in the car for their license, I will.\" Kominsky also indicated for the first time at the suppression hearing that he could request Henderson's identifying information in order to see whether he could drive even <i>after</i> Henderson denied having a license in his possession. At the second suppression hearing, the other officer on the scene, Oliveira, rejected this purported justification, saying that \"naturally, he couldn't drive the vehicle\" without presenting a valid license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second trial, after the denial of the suppression motion, Kominsky reversed course twice more, first explicitly denying on direct examination that he had any reason to ask for Henderson's identification apart from the purported seatbelt violation, and then stating on cross examination that the seatbelt violation was his \"primary\" motivation, but that \"[t]here's a number of reasons [] that I could ask him for his identification.\" The government rightly notes that this testimony at the second trial came in after the court ruled on the suppression motion, and hence cannot contribute to the clear error analysis. But the government says nothing to explain Kominsky's inconsistent testimony about his motivations before the district court made its findings. In any case, Kominsky's inability to remember consistently &#8212; at any point in the proceedings &#8212; why he demanded Henderson's identification is another negative factor in the evaluation of his credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Implausible testimony: observations leading to the vehicle stop</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Henderson argued at length before the district court and repeats here, even if Kominsky had a legal basis for pulling Alford over, it is implausible that the events before the stop unfolded as he testified. According to his testimony, Kominsky pulled behind a blue Nissan at the intersection of Plain Street and Waverly Park Avenue, which Kominsky testified was in Brockton, \"40, 50 yards\" from the West Bridgewater town line. He said that the Nissan was going slower than the speed limit allowed, between 20 and 25 miles per hour. Kominsky further testified at the first suppression hearing that while driving through West Bridgewater he saw the Nissan stray across the yellow center line at least twice &#8212; and maybe as many as five times; typed the Nissan's license plate into his laptop computer (looking at the keyboard as he did); used the license plate number to search the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles database, which required the laptop to initiate a cellular phone call; waited \"at a minimum, 20 seconds\" for the computer to process the search (a search that he said often took several minutes to produce results); and, while still in West Bridgewater, received a computer report indicating that Alford, the registered driver of the car, had a suspended license. Kominsky testified that he decided to stop the Nissan while he was still in West Bridgewater, at the intersection of Plain Street and Belmont Street, but that he actually initiated the stop in East Bridgewater, because he was waiting for a moment when he would have a tactical advantage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> According to the undisputed testimony of Henderson's investigator, it takes no more than 49 seconds to travel at 20-25 miles per hour from the intersection of Plain Street and Waverly Park Avenue in Brockton, where Kominsky said he first saw Alford's car, to the intersection of Plain and Belmont Streets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Everyone agrees that Alford was perfectly sober at the time of the stop. The uncontested evidence is that she was driving especially carefully because she knew that she was being followed by a police officer. Yet, according to Kominsky's testimony, he observed Alford drive the two left tires of her car across the center line of a straight street between two and five times &#8212; over a distance of three tenths of a mile. At the same time, Kominsky said, he was conducting a computer search that often took several minutes to complete. All of this, according to Kominsky, happened in no more than 49 seconds. The idea that Kominsky could observe all of this in such a short time verges on physical impossibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to blunt Henderson's demonstration of this implausibility, the government argues that Alford's testimony about the minutes leading to the stop was equally implausible. Alford said that at some point while she and Henderson were still in Brockton, Kominsky began following her. Alford testified that Kominsky was sitting at an intersection. When her car approached, he activated his cruiser's flashing lights. She stopped to allow Kominsky to pull out ahead of her, but Kominsky flashed his bright lights and then signaled for her to go ahead of him. After she passed by, she testified, Kominsky began following her. Kominsky followed for several minutes &#8212; she thought it could have been as long as twenty minutes, but stated that she was not keeping track of the time and did not know &#8212; and then pulled her to the side of the road.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the government's view, Alford's statement that Kominsky may have been following her for as long as twenty minutes somehow shows Kominsky to be reliable about the minutes before the vehicle stop. This argument fails. Alford's testimony about the number of minutes Kominsky was following her was self-consciously uncertain. She only professed to be sure that Kominsky was following her for a fairly long time. Alford's testimony that Kominsky was following her for longer than he said relates a more plausible sequence of events than Kominsky's testimony. If Kominsky actually saw what he professed to see, it is virtually certain that he was following Alford for significantly longer than 49 seconds, which would mean that Alford's statement that Kominsky began following her while she was still some distance from West Bridgewater may have been correct. Indeed, the district court noted as an aside at sentencing that Kominsky \"might have been off on the times\" in his testimony about the minutes before the vehicle stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Testimony disbelieved by the district court</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court disbelieved Kominsky on at least two important points-relating to his initial encounter with Henderson, and on another matter relating to Kominsky's ability to testify accurately about his conduct and motivations during vehicle stops.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. A demand or a request</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court disbelieved Kominsky on the question of whether he requested or demanded that Henderson write down his identifying information. Kominsky testified that \"I observed that the passenger, who turned out to be Mr. Henderson, wasn't wearing a seat belt, and asked him if he had any identification on him .... He said `no, I don't have any ID on me' . . . . I then asked him if he would mind writing down [his] name, date of birth, and Social Security number on a piece of paper ... [which] he did.\" Kominsky said that when Henderson asked why he had to write down his identifying information, he said: \"You're not wearing your seat belt, sir.\" At that point, Kominsky said, Henderson voluntarily \"complied ... He picked up a piece of paper. He used my pen. He wrote down his information.\" Kominsky later clarified that he did not even think that there was a \"legal way for me to force\" a passenger in a stopped car to write down his identifying information in order to be cited for a seatbelt violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alford contradicted Kominsky both as to whether he mentioned anything about a seatbelt violation to Henderson and as to whether Kominsky merely requested &#8212; rather than demanded &#8212; Henderson's information. She testified that when Henderson asked Kominsky why he needed to write down his social security number and date of birth, Kominsky responded: \"Just write your fucking information on the paper before I snatch you up.\" Alford's testimony on this point was consistent. However, Alford related Kominsky's profanity only reluctantly, after the district court told her that she was \"required\" to state Kominsky's words accurately, \"even if it's language we wouldn't ordinarily use.\" In its written findings, the district court said that after \"Henderson `told Kominsky that he did not have a license or any identification,\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky <i>instructed</i> Henderson to write his name, date of birth, and social security number on a piece of paper. Henderson asked Kominsky why he had to provide that information. Kominsky did not answer the question, but <i>insisted</i> that Henderson give him the requested information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Henderson I,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 37 (emphasis added). The district court indicated that this finding was significant. In talking to counsel after the second suppression hearing, the district court noted its findings on these points before saying: \"back on [sic] October, I didn't believe everything that Mr. Kominsky said and I still don't.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Kominsky testified that he told Henderson, after he asked why he had to write down his information, \"You're not wearing your seatbelt, sir.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, to the contrary, that when \"Henderson asked Kominsky why he had to provide that information[,] Kominsky did not answer the question.\" Later, speaking to counsel, the district court summarized the testimony on this issue and its finding: \"Mr. Henderson says: `Why do I need to give you that?' And according to Kominsky he says `because you're not wearing a seat belt.' You don't find that in my [first decision on the motion to suppress].\" On an issue directly relevant to Kominsky's insistence that Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt, the district court's finding was contrary to Kominsky's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

However, the district court orally indicated that it found Alford's testimony more credible than Kominsky's on this point as well, stating after hearing Bellas's account of Kominsky's language at the second suppression hearing that \"my sense [is] that Officer Kominsky, you know, was not, well, was not likely to have been, you know, quite as polite in talking to Mr. Henderson as he [] described in his testimony.\" Whether or not the district court credited every word of Alford's quotation of Kominsky, the important point is that the district court again rejected Kominsky's credibility on an issue closely related to his insistence that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. The Bellas stop</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also disbelieved Kominsky's account of his interactions with Bellas, the high school student who testified that he had twice been stopped by Kominsky while driving on Plain Street from his school in Brockton to his home in East Bridgewater. According to Bellas, the first time he was stopped, Kominsky approached the car and said: \"I smell marijuana. And he asked me how much marijuana had I smoked in the nighttime.\" Bellas denied having smoked marijuana. There is no indication that he had. Kominsky did not even perform any kind of sobriety check. Bellas testified that Kominsky then ordered him out of the car, told him that he \"was going to jail\" if he did not say where he was hiding marijuana, and then searched him in a \"very physical manner.\" Kominsky took off Bellas's shoes and unbuckled his pants, and did the same to Bellas's friend, a young man named Carlos Gomes Pereira, who was riding as a passenger. Then, Bellas said, Kominsky \"ransacked\" the car, throwing his schoolbooks and homework into the street, and pulling up the carpet. Lieutenant Rogers, the second-ranking officer on the West Bridgewater Police (subordinate only to Kominsky's father, the Chief), later confirmed that Bellas's belongings had been thrown into disarray and that the carpet had been dislodged. After completing his search and finding no contraband, Kominsky left Bellas's belongings in the street and told him he could go. Bellas went home, and the next day his parents took him to the police station and filed a complaint. Rogers, who investigated, told Bellas and his family that he had been the victim of a \"profile\" stop. Noting Rogers's comment and documents in evidence indicating that Kominsky stopped minority drivers at a higher rate than their proportion of the local population, Henderson argued to the district court that the \"profile\" remark suggested Kominsky's possible motive in stopping their vehicle and in investigating Henderson. Henderson and Alford are African-American.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky also pulled Bellas over a second time in the same area, purportedly to cite him for having a muffler that was too loud. The car was towed for unrelated reasons. Rather than giving Bellas a ride home, Kominsky made Bellas walk. When Bellas's father complained again to Rogers, Rogers went to the tow yard with Bellas, found that the car's muffler was not loud, and voided the citation that Kominsky had issued. Kominsky admitted that he had stopped Bellas and searched him, and that he had not given Bellas any citation pursuant to the first stop. But Kominsky denied that he had been unduly aggressive during that stop or that he had asked about marijuana instead of asking Bellas for his license and registration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found Bellas's testimony more credible than Kominsky's. In its oral remarks after the second suppression hearing, after calling attention to the fact that it \"didn't believe everything that Mr. Kominsky said,\" the district court stated: \"in fact, I'm not inclined to believe his rendition of events with Bellas either. If I had the Bellas case in front of me it wouldn't be that hard.\" In its written findings, the district court stated that: \"the court finds Christopher Bellas's testimony concerning Kominsky's conduct when Bellas was stopped to be more accurate than Kominsky's version of events.\" <i>Henderson II,</i> 265 F.Supp.2d at 116. Again, the district court discredited Kominsky on an important issue even though the only evidence contrary to Kominsky's testimony was the testimony of a driver whom he had stopped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.

As the government points out, the district court did not explicitly resolve these contradictions. However, these contradictions are relevant to our inquiry, and, with respect to at least one of them, the district court did, in effect, reject Kominsky's account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

When the suppression hearing was opened for the final time, the parties informed the district court that Oliveira would testify that Kominsky used profanity during Henderson's arrest. (He did so testify at the second trial.) Kominsky, on the other hand, testified that he was polite throughout the encounter. The government now argues that this matter is immaterial because Oliveira's testimony did not occur until after the final decision on the motion to suppress. This argument is misleading. The district court knew that Oliveira would contradict Kominsky before it finally denied the motion. In fact, defense counsel presented the district court with the government's e-mailed statement that: \"Oliveira stated [in a pretrial conversation with the government] that he recalls in essence that Officer Kominsky used some form of the f___ word when asking Mr. Henderson to get out of the vehicle.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to hear Oliveira's testimony in person before reconsidering the suppression motion for the final time because \"I don't need to hear any more to have a low regard for Officer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

As we discussed above, Kominsky testified that he made a statement about the purported seatbelt violation while talking to Henderson at the scene. As already noted, the district court rejected this account. No other witness testified that Kominsky said anything about a seatbelt violation before returning to the police station. Oliveira testified that Kominsky said nothing about a seatbelt to him at the scene. Kominsky did not actually write a seatbelt citation until he returned to the station. The district court expressed interest in this sequence, telling defense counsel: \"I told you that I'm interested in knowing what happened back at the station and whether there was any discussion about the ticket. Ordinarily, I don't call witnesses. But don't you want to ask [his shift supervisor] that?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Philip Tuck, who was Kominsky's direct supervisor on the night of Henderson's arrest, testified at the second suppression hearing, largely at the district court's urging. Defense counsel said: \"I do not have any intention of calling Sergeant Tuck,\" immediately before the remarks by the district court above. After the district court again asked: \"do you want to call Sergeant Tuck?\" defense counsel agreed to call the witness, responding: \"I'm happy &#8212; yes, your Honor, I'll put him up on the stand.\" In the end, after some questioning by both counsel, the district court examined Tuck itself, at some length.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tuck said that he \"felt a certain fondness for\" Kominsky and watched out for him.

And he indicated that he had not [seen] a seat belt on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tuck also said that, while Alford's citation and Henderson's arrest on the old warrant were listed in the \"daily log\" kept by the police, nothing was listed there about a seatbelt violation (he also stated that this was not unusual). Tuck said that he knew, while talking to Kominsky on the night of Henderson's arrest, that it was \"a big deal\" for the police department to make a federal felon in possession case and agreed that \"whether there was a seatbelt violation or some other violation was important to the future of the case against Mr. Henderson.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court asked Kominsky about the same conversation. To illustrate how markedly Kominsky's testimony differed from Tuck's, we reproduce the relevant exchange:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Did Sergeant Tuck ask you any questions?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KOMINSKY: Not really, that I can recall, your Honor.

Speaking on the record with counsel after the second suppression hearing, the district court articulated its concern:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then [Kominsky] got back to the station, he had a conversation with Sergeant Tuck who knows that if there's no seat belt violation or something similar that [Kominsky's] conduct [] is very problematic . . . . [C]onceivably back at the station Tuck and Kominsky talk. Tuck says why, why did you ask for his identifying information? Kominsky says, well, I always do that, or I do it whenever I feel like it. Then Tuck says you got a problem, they might have contrived the seat belt excuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The district court's general impressions of Kominsky</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, a court of appeals is not in as good a position as the district court to assess a witness's \"demeanor and inflection.\" <i>Anderson</i> 470 U.S. at 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504. That reality is an important impediment to the rejection of a district court's credibility determinations on appeal. Here, however, that impediment has little force. Every time the district court spoke generally about matters relating to Kominsky's \"demeanor and inflection,\" it cast doubt on his reliability as a witness. We relate some notable examples and their contexts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to a question by the government at the first trial, Kominsky stated that he had testified at the motion to suppress \"about four days ago.\" In reality, Kominsky's testimony had been 22 days earlier. On recross examination, defense counsel followed up on this misstatement. When defense counsel raised the issue, Kominsky confirmed his belief that the suppression hearing had taken place \"four to six days\" earlier. Defense counsel asked Kominsky what day it was. He said: \"Wednesday.\" It was actually Thursday. Defense counsel then asked: \"Do you know what the date is today?\" Kominsky responded: \"No, I don't sir. I don't know the day or the month today. I'm sorry. I've lost it.\" The government later explained this testimony by telling the district court that Kominsky was sick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this excuse, the district court clearly was concerned about Kominsky's performance on the stand. After agreeing to grant Henderson a mistrial, the district court urged the government to \"reconsider whether this federal case ought to be voluntarily dismissed. . . . [W]hether he's ill or not, we now have a federal case where the government's prime witness testified yesterday that he didn't know what month it was.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky was scheduled to testify on the first day of the second suppression hearing. However, Kominsky missed his scheduled appearance, again because he was sick. The district court refused to take Kominsky's word on this excuse. The district court also refused to believe that Kominsky's poor performance on the witness stand was a result of illness. In the district court's words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'll tell you, you know, my law clerk said to me several days ago, it will be interesting to see Officer Kominsky on the stand when he's not sick. Because you may recall on Thursday, November 14, he thought it was Wednesday, he didn't know it was November, and he didn't know it was the 14th. <i>And I said, I don't think he's going to be any better.</i> And I'll leave it there for now . . . . But, you know, <i>a police officer shouldn't be unnaturally anxious about coming to court and testifying.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) The court then insisted on questioning Kominsky's doctor about the new illness, which the doctor confirmed was a gastrointestinal infection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky's subsequent performance did not improve the district court's impression of him. As noted above, the district court stated before the second trial that it had \"a low regard for Officer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\" Similarly, at sentencing, the district court said: \"I'll candidly state that, in a general sense, I have disquiet about Officer Kominsky and the West Bridgewater police . . . . And the idea that the U.S. Attorney's office is bringing cases which in effect have 20-year mandatory sentences when there's no parole in federal court based on that kind of police work and that kind of testimony disturbs me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also was blunt about Kominsky's capacity to testify accurately. At sentencing, looking back at Kominsky's entire testimony during the proceedings, the district court summed up its impression: \"Officer Kominsky, even if he were trying to tell the truth, is perhaps the worst law enforcement witness, who was trying to be candid, assuming he was trying to be candid, that I've ever encountered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The evidence on the seatbelt issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only evidence that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt before Kominsky demanded his identifying information was the uncorroborated testimony of Kominsky. In his testimony before the district court, Kominsky was empirically wrong on three points, markedly inconsistent on at least one highly relevant point, implausible on another point, expressly disbelieved by the district court on at least three and probably four points, and contradicted by other police officers on two important points (as to at least one of which the district court indicated orally that it was disinclined to accept Kominsky's story). In addition, Kominsky forgot the day of the week and month of the year while testifying in front of a jury in federal court. This performance prompted the district court to say that it had \"disquiet\" and was \"disturb[ed]\" about the case's very prosecution in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet Kominsky unwaveringly testified that Henderson was not wearing any seatbelt in the stopped car. On this ultimately crucial point, despite its serious reservations about Kominsky's credibility and his capacities as a law enforcement officer, the district court believed Kominsky because \"other credible evidence\" bolstered Kominsky's story. The district court did not explain what that \"other credible evidence\" was. The government does not contend that there was any \"other credible evidence,\" apart from Kominsky's own testimony, to bolster the district court's finding. We cannot find that \"other credible evidence\" in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky said that he told Henderson and Alford that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt, as a justification for asking for his license. As we discussed above, the district court did not believe this story. No other witness indicated that Kominsky said anything about a seatbelt until he returned to the police station where, according to Tuck's testimony, Tuck advised him that he would need to articulate a reason for investigating the passenger in a stopped car. As the district court observed to counsel: \"He didn't write the seatbelt thing . . . [until] he went back and spoke to somebody.\" Kominsky also did not say anything to his supervisor on the radio about a seatbelt violation &#8212; even though he did discuss the citation that he would give Alford for driving with a suspended license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government does not argue that Oliveira's testimony corroborates Kominsky's report that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt. Indeed, the government does not argue that Oliveira was even on the scene of the vehicle stop in time to see whether Henderson was wearing his seatbelt during the stop. To do so, it would have to disbelieve Kominsky on the question whether Oliveira even arrived at the side of the car in time to see whether Henderson was wearing his seatbelt before Kominsky demanded Henderson's identifying information. At the first suppression hearing, Kominsky testified that \"Officer Oliveira was arriving at the time that I was speaking to Mr. Henderson. He was pulling up behind us.\" At the second hearing, Kominsky said: \"no, sir\" when asked whether Oliveira was at the side of the car during his initial encounter with Alford and Henderson. It is true that Oliveira testified that he was at the car earlier than Kominsky and Alford said, and that he thought he would have remembered if Henderson was wearing a seatbelt and that he did not remember that he was. However, Oliveira also testified that he did not \"remember looking in [Alford's car] and making a mental note\" whether Henderson was wearing his seatbelt. And Oliveira said that he had talked about the incident with Kominsky after the first trial ended in a mistrial, and that the issue of the seatbelt \"may have come up.\" Finally, Oliveira testified that Kominsky did not say anything to him about a seatbelt while they were at the scene. For all of these reasons, Oliveira's testimony does not bolster Kominsky's account about Henderson's seatbelt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court heard ample evidence that Kominsky had a tendency to exceed the proper bounds of a vehicle stop and to make unwarranted demands on drivers and passengers. This was the unmistakable import of the evidence about the Bellas stops, which the court credited. Tuck testified that Kominsky had amassed \"more than the average\" number of complaints about his conduct. Rogers testified that he had had to review proper vehicle stop procedures with Kominsky after concluding that Kominsky was overstepping the proper bounds of vehicle stops. Even as this case was ongoing, citizens were complaining about Kominsky's performance of his duties during vehicle stops. Kominsky himself testified: \"If I feel like asking everybody in the car for their license, I will,\" even though, as the other officers testified, such conduct by a police officer was a violation of Massachusetts state law. All of these factors leave little doubt that Kominsky would have no compunction about demanding Henderson's social security number and date of birth even if Henderson had not violated some law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case in which a witness's inaccuracies were collateral. The most inaccurate parts of Kominsky's testimony &#8212; the topics on which he testified with certainty but was clearly proven wrong &#8212; relate directly to the officer's account of the vehicle stop of Alford and Henderson and to the short period during which he professed to observe Henderson not wearing his seatbelt. On every point relating to the stop where empirical evidence could contradict Kominsky, it did. Kominsky repeatedly insisted that Alford's car had standard manual seatbelts. The car itself proved otherwise. Kominsky recalled that Henderson was wearing a dark sweatshirt. The documentary evidence showed that he was wearing a light-colored one. Kominsky testified that he was perfectly polite during the vehicle stop. Both Alford and Oliveira testified otherwise, and the district court indicated orally that it believed them. Kominsky testified that Henderson voluntarily wrote down his identifying information. The district court concluded that he did not. Kominsky said that he had Henderson's purported seatbelt violation in mind from the moment he demanded his identification and said so. No other witness testified that Kominsky said anything about a seatbelt until after returning to the police station and being reminded that he could not investigate a vehicle passenger without cause. The district court said that it did not believe Kominsky's statement to the contrary. On each of these points save the color of Henderson's shirt, Kominsky's testimony, though inaccurate, contradicted, or inconsistent, was just as emphatic as his testimony about Henderson's seatbelt. All told, in a record that runs well into the thousands of pages, there is nothing apart from Kominsky's own testimony to indicate that Kominsky was telling the truth about Henderson's seatbelt &#8212; even though he was lying or mistaken about so many related facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the district court acknowledged the difficulty of believing Kominsky about the seatbelt. Considering only the information in the record after the first suppression hearing, the district court termed the issue of Henderson's seatbelt a \"close\" one. After hearing more information at the second suppression hearing that challenged Kominsky's account and credibility, the district court, although again denying the suppression motion, observed that: \"the question whether Henderson was wearing a seatbelt . . . continues to be close.\" At sentencing, the district court said: \"I two times found . . . that Mr. Henderson was not wearing a seat belt. That much of Officer Kominsky I credited. But, in candor, I'm not close to sure about that.\" Later, in the same hearing, the district court stated: \"I might only be 55 percent sure of the facts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What apparently tipped the balance for the court on the seatbelt issue was \"other credible evidence\" that somehow salvaged Kominsky's badly damaged credibility. Yet neither the district court nor the government has specified what \"other credible evidence\" might bolster Kominsky's story. As indicated, we have not found that \"other credible evidence\" anywhere in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can understand the district court's continued uncertainty about its seatbelt finding. In light of all the factors we have discussed, and after a careful review of the record, we are left, respectfully, with \"a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504. Wholly dependent as it was on the credibility of Kominsky, the court's finding that the government met its burden of proving that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the stop was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anticipating the possible rejection of its seatbelt argument, the government asks us to conclude that Kominsky could demand Henderson's identifying information and conduct a computer search of his records \"for reasons of officer safety.\" There may be cases where an officer is warranted in demanding a passenger's identification for safety reasons, but this is not one of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope and duration of a vehicle stop must be \"`reasonably related [ ] to the circumstances that justified the [stop] in the first place'\" unless the police have a basis for expanding their investigation. <i>See United States v. Cook,</i> 277 F.3d 82, 85 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <i>see also United States v. Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001)). It is also well established that a police officer cannot stop a citizen and demand identification \"without any specific basis for believing he is involved in criminal activity.\" <i>Brown v. Texas,</i> 443 U.S. 47, 52, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979). Attempting to establish that Kominsky's investigation of Henderson was not proscribed by these principles, the government cites cases in which certain \"de minimis\" intrusions on privacy have been allowed as a matter of course during vehicle stops.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government emphasizes the Eleventh Circuit's holding in <i>United States v. Purcell,</i> 236 F.3d 1274, 1277-80 (11th Cir. 2001). In <i>Purcell,</i> the question was not whether a police officer could demand a passenger's identification. Instead, the question was whether a police officer could extend a vehicle stop by at most three minutes &#8212; a period the same court later characterized as \"de minimis\" &#8212; to run a criminal history check on identification he already had. <i>United States v. Boyce,</i> 351 F.3d 1102, 1107 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). Furthermore, in <i>Purcell,</i> there were circumstances not present here that could have helped legitimate the police officer's particularized suspicions of the subject in that case. The car was stopped in \"a very high crime corridor,\" and it was rented, but not to the driver of the car. <i>See Purcell,</i> 236 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit has clarified that <i>Purcell</i> should not be read to legitimate extending vehicle stops in order to conduct investigations that are not related to the reason for the stop. <i>See Boyce,</i> 351 F.3d at 1107 (concluding that it was not reasonable for a police officer to prolong a vehicle stop for 12 minutes, to investigate the car for narcotics without reasonable suspicion for doing so).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government relies also on three Supreme Court cases. The first two establish that the Fourth Amendment does not require that a police officer have cause to order the occupants of a vehicle to exit during a stop. <i>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms,</i> 434 U.S. 106, 111 n. 6, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (\"[O]nce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment's proscription of unreasonable seizures.\"); <i>Maryland v. Wilson,</i> 519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997) (same for passengers). The premise of both of these cases is that ordering a person out of a car for the duration of a traffic stop, without more, is a minimal imposition on persons already detained. Such an order does not extend the duration of a traffic stop and represents only a \"minimal\" intrusion on privacy. <i>See Wilson,</i> 519 U.S. at 414-15, 117 S.Ct. 882.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada,</i> 542 U.S. 177, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 159 L.Ed.2d 292 (2004), the final Supreme Court case the government cites, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a Nevada law requiring subjects of <i>Terry</i> stops to state their name. The Court held that the <i>Terry</i> line of cases \"permit a State to require a <i>suspect</i> to disclose his <i>name</i> in the course of a Terry stop.\" <i>Id.</i> at 187, 124 S.Ct. 2451 (emphasis added). The demand in <i>Hiibel</i> survived Fourth Amendment scrutiny because it \"does not alter the nature of the stop itself: it does not change its duration.\" <i>Id.</i> at 188, 124 S.Ct. 2451.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts here are markedly different than the facts in any of these cases. Most notably, Kominsky's demand for Henderson's identifying information and his subsequent investigation of Henderson expanded the scope of the stop, changed the target of the stop, and prolonged the stop. Alford, not Henderson, was the subject of the initial stop. According to Kominsky, Henderson was not detained at all prior to the demand for his identification; rather \"he could have just walked away.\" According to Oliveira, it took Kominsky between ten and fifteen minutes to run a criminal history check on Henderson and longer, after that, to confirm the results of the check with the dispatcher. Oliveira's time line is consistent with Alford's testimony that twenty minutes elapsed between Kominsky's demand for Henderson's information and his return to the car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> As the officers testified, apart from the records check on Henderson, there was no other reason to prolong the stop. Kominsky already knew everything that he wanted to know about Alford.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The standard procedure in the circumstances, the officers testified, would have been to issue a citation to Alford, arrange to have the car towed, and let the driver and passenger leave the scene (either by foot or by a ride in a police cruiser to a place from which they could call a taxi). Presumably, if Kominsky had not demanded Henderson's identifying information and investigated him, Henderson would have \"just walked away.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no particularized reason, discounting the discredited seatbelt violation, for Kominsky to launch into an investigation of Henderson. Kominsky might reasonably have asked Henderson for his license to see if he could drive the car back to Boston. But when Henderson responded that he did not have his license, there was, as the district court found, no further reason to inquire about his ability to drive Alford's car back to Boston. Henderson, of course, could not drive the car without producing a license. Nor was there any other remotely particularized rationale for investigating Henderson. Kominsky did not perceive any danger from Henderson, nor did Kominsky have any reason to suspect that Henderson was engaged in any kind of illegal activity. The stop was not made in a dangerous location. Alford's underlying traffic violation &#8212; driving with a suspended license &#8212; did not raise the specter of criminal activity involving Henderson. Henderson was not acting suspiciously. Indeed, the government conceded to the district court that \"the government is not contending in this case that Mr. Henderson at the time Officer Kominsky asked for identification was engaged in other suspicious conduct or that the evidence supports that.\" In light of these facts, the government's \"officer safety\" argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court handled this difficult case with skill and care. Troubled by the government's belated disclosure of evidence pertinent to Kominsky's conduct at vehicle stops and other issues, the court declared a mistrial of Henderson's first trial and reopened the suppression issue. The court said that it was \"disturb[ed]\" about the government's reliance on the person it called \"perhaps the worst law enforcement witness, who was trying to be candid, assuming he was trying to be candid, that I've ever encountered.\" The court stated: \"I am concerned about the competence and practices of . . . Kominsky.\" Still, on the critical factual issue in this case &#8212; whether to believe Kominsky's testimony that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt &#8212; the district court accepted Kominsky's account on the basis of \"other credible evidence\" not specified by the court or by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the record, we have found no such evidence. Instead, we have found that Kominsky's testimony was riddled with implausibilities and inconsistencies, and that it was disbelieved by the district court in important respects and contradicted by law enforcement witnesses in others. Under these circumstances, we are left with a firm and definite conviction that the district court's critical finding that Kominsky credibly testified that Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt was clearly erroneous. The government established no other justification for Kominsky's investigation of Henderson's identifying information. Therefore, we must reverse the order denying the motion to suppress and vacate the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Henderson's conviction carried a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years.

After demanding Henderson's social security number and date of birth, Kominsky found that a police database listed an old warrant for Henderson's arrest. Acting on the database, which turned out to be wrong about the warrant, Kominsky searched Henderson and found a gun. Before trial, Henderson moved to suppress the gun, arguing that it had been the product of an illegal stop and that Kominsky had no basis for investigating the passenger in a stopped car. The district court denied Henderson's motion to suppress the gun and held a trial. After the government belatedly produced evidence relevant to Henderson's motion to suppress, the district court declared a mistrial and held a second suppression hearing. After the district court again denied Henderson's motion and held a second trial, a jury convicted Henderson of being a felon in possession of a handgun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson now appeals his conviction and sentence, focusing on the district court's finding that he was not wearing his seatbelt in the stopped car. Henderson argues that the district court clearly erred in believing Kominsky's testimony that he was not wearing a seatbelt. In support of this assertion, Henderson emphasizes that Kominsky's testimony was riddled with proven inaccuracies and contradictions and that the district court explicitly disbelieved important portions of Kominsky's testimony.

However, Kominsky admitted that he did not have any particularized reason to suspect Henderson of dangerousness or wrongdoing, nor any specific basis apart from a purported seatbelt violation for prolonging the stop in order to investigate Henderson. On these facts, we reject the government's alternative argument as well. Accordingly, we vacate the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review here some of the background facts and the procedural history of this case, leaving the details for a discussion of Kominsky's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about ten P.M. on a May evening in 2001, Henderson and his girlfriend, Patrice Alford, were in Brockton, Massachusetts, attempting to get back to Boston, where they lived, after visiting relatives. The couple &#8212; who had stopped dating by the time of the trial &#8212; were in a blue Nissan sedan. Henderson was sitting in the front passenger seat. Alford, who was driving, was lost. Looking for the expressway, Alford proceeded down Plain Street in Brockton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it turned out, Alford was going in the wrong direction. Rather than towards the expressway to Boston, which is just west of downtown Brockton, Plain Street goes southeast from downtown Brockton to the town of East Bridgewater, where it becomes Pleasant Street. Alford observed a police car pull behind her and, because she was being followed, she drove especially carefully. Between Brockton and East Bridgewater, Plain Street cuts through the extreme northeast corner of the town of West Bridgewater. A car driving from Brockton to East Bridgewater on Plain Street travels through West Bridgewater for approximately three tenths of a mile (about 500 yards). At the 35 mile-per-hour speed limit, the transit takes about 30 seconds. Plain Street cuts a straight line through West Bridgewater, without substantial curves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky, assigned to patrol that corner of West Bridgewater, stopped Alford's car. He later gave three reasons for the stop, saying that the car was driving slowly, had crossed over the center line of the short stretch of Plain Street in West Bridgewater between two and five times, and was registered to a woman, Alford, who had a suspended driver's license. During the stop, Kominsky asked for Henderson's license and then, when Henderson said he did not have a license, demanded Henderson's name, date of birth, and social security number. Kominsky later testified that he wanted Handerson's identification in order to cite Henderson for not wearing a seatbelt. By entering Henderson's information into a database he could access from his laptop computer, Kominsky discovered that there was a five-year-old warrant for Henderson's arrest. Kominsky acted on the information in the database to arrest Henderson. As he was searching Henderson pursuant to the arrest, Kominsky found some ammunition. Henderson then told Kominsky that he was carrying a handgun as well. That gun was the basis for this prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second police officer, Carlos Oliveira of the East Bridgewater Police, arrived on the scene in time to see and hear the end of Kominsky's initial encounter with Alford and Henderson. However, Alford and Kominsky both testified that Oliveira did not approach the car until Henderson was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it turned out, the warrant Kominsky relied on in arresting Henderson had long since been revoked. However, Henderson accepts for the purpose of this appeal that Kominsky could rely in \"good faith\" on the computer system. Henderson's theory throughout this case has been that Kominsky never should have obtained from him the personal identification information that led to the computer error and then to his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2002, the district court held a two-day evidentiary hearing on Henderson's motion to suppress. Henderson contested both the legality of the vehicle stop and the legality of Kominsky's demand for his identifying information. Kominsky, Alford, and an investigator for Henderson testified for the defense. Concerned about the discrepancy between Kominsky's testimony that Alford's car did not have automatic seatbelts and Alford's testimony that it did, the district court took a view of Alford's car and determined that it did indeed have automatic seatbelts. Nonetheless, the district court denied Henderson's motion in a published opinion. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2396845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2396845/united-states-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Kominsky was the first witness. After his direct examination, the government belatedly produced documents indicating that Kominsky had been the subject of complaints for subjecting drivers to baseless and harassing stops, along the same stretch of road where he stopped Alford and Henderson. Henderson asked that the trial be stayed and the motion to suppress reopened. The district court conducted a voir dire of Kominsky and then allowed the trial to continue while it considered Henderson's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a break in Alford's testimony, an Assistant United States Attorney told defense counsel, while Alford was sitting nearby, that Alford was \"going to jail for perjury.\" Alford heard the remark and, according to the defense, became nervous about returning to the stand. The district court examined Alford and determined that there was no impediment to her continued testimony. The next day, however, citing the government's delayed disclosure and the other \"appellate issues\" that had arisen, the district court declared a mistrial and announced that it would consider whether to dismiss the case with prejudice, in light of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the district court decided not to dismiss the indictment. It did, however, reopen the suppression hearing. At the reopened hearing, the district court heard testimony from Kominsky, Oliveira, other officers who worked with Kominsky, and a young man, Christopher Bellas, who previously had complained of improper vehicle stops by Kominsky. The district court credited Bellas's testimony that Kominsky had twice stopped his car without cause and had acted improperly during the stops. (Kominsky had denied any such misconduct.) Nonetheless, the district court again denied Henderson's motion to suppress in another published order. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459421\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459421/united-states-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court acknowledged that its decision to credit Bellas's testimony over Kominsky's \"lends weight to the contention that Kominsky's testimony relating to Henderson should not be believed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 116. The district court then stated: \"Other credible evidence, however, tends to support Kominsky's testimony\" that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the vehicle stop. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court briefly reopened the suppression hearing a third time shortly before the second trial, when the government produced two recent complaints about vehicle stops by Kominsky and a statement by Oliveira that contradicted Kominsky's previous testimony about the language he used while arresting Henderson. The district court declined to reconsider its ruling on the motion to suppress, reasoning that the additional evidence was \"cumulative\" and that \"I don't need to hear any more to have a low regard for Officer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\"'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson was convicted at a second trial.

It is a civil infraction in Massachusetts, carrying as its maximum consequence a fine of $25, for an adult passenger not to wear a seatbelt while \"riding\" in a car. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &#167; 13A. Henderson responds that the court clearly erred when it accepted Kominsky's testimony that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Two unaddressed legal issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing these arguments, we note, without resolving, two legal issues alluded to in the district court but never pursued or resolved. We identify these issues only to avoid any suggestion that we are resolving them by implication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Kominsky did not believe that he had the power to <i>demand</i> a passenger's identification in order to write a citation for a seatbelt violation. In fact, no witness testified that it would be reasonable for a police officer to demand a passenger's identification in order to write a citation for a seatbelt violation. To the contrary, Kominsky testified that \"there's no legal way for me to force [a passenger who is not wearing his seatbelt] to give me the information ... he's entitled to get a citation [] but if he doesn't give me his information I know of no other way [to issue a ticket] other than citing the driver for the violation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Kominsky had testified that he asked Henderson to write down his identifying information and that Henderson voluntarily complied. But the district court never credited this account of voluntary compliance, finding after the first suppression hearing that \"Henderson asked Kominsky why he had to provide that information. Kominsky did not answer the question, but <i>insisted</i> that Henderson give him the requested information.\" <i>Henderson I,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 37 (emphasis added). Kominsky's supervisor, Lieutenant Ray Rogers, also testified that a passenger could be asked but could not be required to produce identifying information unless there was suspicion that he had committed or was committing a crime. In Massachusetts, a seatbelt violation is not a crime. We have found no Massachusetts case that permits a police officer to <i>demand</i> a passenger's social security number and date of birth in order to write a citation for a seatbelt violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second legal issue relates to the absence of any evidence that Henderson failed to wear a seatbelt while the car was moving. Kominsky did not say that he observed any such infraction. Rather, he said that he did not see inside the car until after it stopped. The district court did not say that it had inferred that Henderson was wearing his seatbelt while the car was moving. It is uncontested that some time passed between the stop and Kominsky's approach to the car because Kominsky first made a radio call. The one relevant Massachusetts case that we found concluded that a passenger in a vehicle is not obligated to wear a seatbelt after the vehicle has been stopped by a police officer and cannot be cited on the basis of not wearing a seatbelt during a vehicle stop. <i>See Commonwealth v. Nu&#241;nez,</i> 15 Mass. L. Rptr. 536, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31973248</span></span> at *3 (Mass.

Similarly, we need not decide whether Henderson could even be cited for failing to wear his seatbelt on the facts presented. The premise for both of these legal issues would be a finding that Kominsky credibly testified that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt during the stop.

Kominsky's testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To explain the clear error in the district court's finding about the seatbelt, we discuss Kominsky's testimony topic by topic, focusing on its documented inaccuracies, internal inconsistencies, and implausibilities. We also note the district court's rejection of Kominsky's credibility on important issues, and the district court's stated impressions of Kominsky's character, demeanor, and professionalism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Testimony empirically disproved</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On several points, Kominsky gave testimony that was later shown to be simply wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The automatic seatbelts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alford's car had automatic seatbelts, a point obviously pertinent to Henderson's appeal. Alford testified that the car had automatic seatbelts. The district court confirmed, after taking a view of the car, that \"[t]he automobile in which Mr. Henderson was riding on the evening in question does, as Ms. Alford testified, have an automatic seat belt for the front seat passenger.\" Kominsky, however, testified repeatedly and with certainty that the car had non-automatic seatbelts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, the district court probed this seatbelt issue carefully. At the first suppression hearing, the court questioned Kominsky about the seatbelt itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The district court took a view of Alford's car the next day. These were its findings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The automobile in which Mr. Henderson was riding on the evening in question does, as Ms. Alford testified, have an automatic seat belt for the front seat passenger. It's a belt that attaches to the frame and, when connected, pushes away from the seat toward the windshield when the door, passenger side door, is open. If a passenger got in and sat down and closed the door, the seatbelt would automatically come back and go diagonally across his chest from his right shoulder to his left waist. There is also a lap belt that needs to be connected manually. The seat belts are black or dark gray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The automatic belt can be disconnected from the door frame and will then roll down into the left-hand side of the passenger seat by the place that the lap belt, I believe, connects or starts from.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's observations contradicted Kominsky's testimony in two important ways. First, Kominsky simply was wrong about there being a non-automatic-type seatbelt in Alford's car. Second &#8212; and even more important &#8212; Kominsky's emphatic testimony about seeing Henderson's \"seat belt [] on the side of the door frame,\" could not have been true. If the seatbelt had been connected, it would have been attached to the frame of the car, as described by the court. If it were disconnected, it would have rolled down into the left hand side of the passenger seat, also as described by the court. It was a physical impossibility for the strap to be in the position Kominsky described. As the district court itself immediately recognized:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think [Kominsky] testified, and I'll have to refresh my recollection &#8212; that it wasn't an automatic seat belt. He remembered it hanging there after Mr. Henderson got out of the car. And whether it was connected or disconnected, it wouldn't have been hanging in the place that a non-automatic seatbelt hangs, in my experience. It either would have been pushed forward if it was connected or it would have been down by the left-hand waist if it was disconnected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Kominsky's testimony was not inaccurate because Alford's car had manual lap belts in addition to automatic seatbelts. This argument is unpersuasive because it parses Kominsky's testimony too finely. While Kominsky did testify that Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt across his lap, he also testified emphatically that Henderson \"did not\" have \"a seat belt going diagonally across his chest.\" Kominsky never testified that he would give a seatbelt citation to someone wearing a shoulder belt but not a lap belt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Number of citations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky testified at the first suppression hearing that he had issued \"over a hundred\" seatbelt citations \"just in this last year.\" To the government, and conceivably to the district court, this was important testimony. The government placed great emphasis on the frequency of Kominsky's seatbelt citations as an explanation for the inaccuracy of his recollection about Alford's car. In light of further questioning, however, neither Kominsky's tabulation nor the government's excuse held up. Asked the same question at trial, Kominsky said that he averaged 25 citations, admitted the inconsistency, and said that he had misunderstood the question \"how many seat belt violations have you written in the last year?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Henderson points out, the record plainly belies Kominsky's statement &#8212; and the government's argument on appeal &#8212; that he misunderstood the question before stating that he issued 100 seatbelt citations a year. In response to follow-up questions at the first suppression hearing, Kominsky reiterated that he had written 100 seatbelt citations \"just in the last year,\" and that he issued a seatbelt citation \"every three days.\" There was no confusion by Kominsky.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second suppression hearing, defense counsel again impeached Kominsky on this point &#8212; with documentary evidence that Kominsky had averaged only fifteen seatbelt citations per year. Kominsky again had an excuse: he had issued more citations but they were missing from computer records because of his bad handwriting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Henderson's attire</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky testified that Henderson was wearing a dark-colored shirt on the night of the arrest. However, documentary evidence &#8212; the inventory list from the jail where Henderson would spend the night &#8212; proved that Henderson was wearing a white shirt. The government argues that the issue is immaterial and points out that Kominsky expressed no certainty when testifying about Henderson's attire. Still, the inaccuracy about the shirt, like the inaccuracy about the automatic seatbelts and the number of seatbelt citations he had written, provides a further ground for questioning Kominsky's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Inconsistent testimony: his motivations for demanding Henderson's identifying information</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson points out that Kominsky's testimony was inconsistent on the obviously pertinent matter of why Kominsky either asked for (in Kominsky's view) or demanded (in Henderson's view) his identifying information. At a detention hearing that occurred shortly after Henderson's arrest, Kominsky said that he secured the identifying information for two reasons: to see if Henderson could drive Alford's car and because Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt. At the first suppression hearing, Kominsky added a third reason: he said that he sometimes asked passengers in stopped cars for their identification because: \"If I feel like asking everybody in the car for their license, I will.\" Kominsky also indicated for the first time at the suppression hearing that he could request Henderson's identifying information in order to see whether he could drive even <i>after</i> Henderson denied having a license in his possession. At the second suppression hearing, the other officer on the scene, Oliveira, rejected this purported justification, saying that \"naturally, he couldn't drive the vehicle\" without presenting a valid license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second trial, after the denial of the suppression motion, Kominsky reversed course twice more, first explicitly denying on direct examination that he had any reason to ask for Henderson's identification apart from the purported seatbelt violation, and then stating on cross examination that the seatbelt violation was his \"primary\" motivation, but that \"[t]here's a number of reasons [] that I could ask him for his identification.\" The government rightly notes that this testimony at the second trial came in after the court ruled on the suppression motion, and hence cannot contribute to the clear error analysis. But the government says nothing to explain Kominsky's inconsistent testimony about his motivations before the district court made its findings. In any case, Kominsky's inability to remember consistently &#8212; at any point in the proceedings &#8212; why he demanded Henderson's identification is another negative factor in the evaluation of his credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Implausible testimony: observations leading to the vehicle stop</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Henderson argued at length before the district court and repeats here, even if Kominsky had a legal basis for pulling Alford over, it is implausible that the events before the stop unfolded as he testified. According to his testimony, Kominsky pulled behind a blue Nissan at the intersection of Plain Street and Waverly Park Avenue, which Kominsky testified was in Brockton, \"40, 50 yards\" from the West Bridgewater town line. He said that the Nissan was going slower than the speed limit allowed, between 20 and 25 miles per hour. Kominsky further testified at the first suppression hearing that while driving through West Bridgewater he saw the Nissan stray across the yellow center line at least twice &#8212; and maybe as many as five times; typed the Nissan's license plate into his laptop computer (looking at the keyboard as he did); used the license plate number to search the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles database, which required the laptop to initiate a cellular phone call; waited \"at a minimum, 20 seconds\" for the computer to process the search (a search that he said often took several minutes to produce results); and, while still in West Bridgewater, received a computer report indicating that Alford, the registered driver of the car, had a suspended license. Kominsky testified that he decided to stop the Nissan while he was still in West Bridgewater, at the intersection of Plain Street and Belmont Street, but that he actually initiated the stop in East Bridgewater, because he was waiting for a moment when he would have a tactical advantage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> According to the undisputed testimony of Henderson's investigator, it takes no more than 49 seconds to travel at 20-25 miles per hour from the intersection of Plain Street and Waverly Park Avenue in Brockton, where Kominsky said he first saw Alford's car, to the intersection of Plain and Belmont Streets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Everyone agrees that Alford was perfectly sober at the time of the stop. The uncontested evidence is that she was driving especially carefully because she knew that she was being followed by a police officer. Yet, according to Kominsky's testimony, he observed Alford drive the two left tires of her car across the center line of a straight street between two and five times &#8212; over a distance of three tenths of a mile. At the same time, Kominsky said, he was conducting a computer search that often took several minutes to complete. All of this, according to Kominsky, happened in no more than 49 seconds. The idea that Kominsky could observe all of this in such a short time verges on physical impossibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to blunt Henderson's demonstration of this implausibility, the government argues that Alford's testimony about the minutes leading to the stop was equally implausible. Alford said that at some point while she and Henderson were still in Brockton, Kominsky began following her. Alford testified that Kominsky was sitting at an intersection. When her car approached, he activated his cruiser's flashing lights. She stopped to allow Kominsky to pull out ahead of her, but Kominsky flashed his bright lights and then signaled for her to go ahead of him. After she passed by, she testified, Kominsky began following her. Kominsky followed for several minutes &#8212; she thought it could have been as long as twenty minutes, but stated that she was not keeping track of the time and did not know &#8212; and then pulled her to the side of the road.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the government's view, Alford's statement that Kominsky may have been following her for as long as twenty minutes somehow shows Kominsky to be reliable about the minutes before the vehicle stop. This argument fails. Alford's testimony about the number of minutes Kominsky was following her was self-consciously uncertain. She only professed to be sure that Kominsky was following her for a fairly long time. Alford's testimony that Kominsky was following her for longer than he said relates a more plausible sequence of events than Kominsky's testimony. If Kominsky actually saw what he professed to see, it is virtually certain that he was following Alford for significantly longer than 49 seconds, which would mean that Alford's statement that Kominsky began following her while she was still some distance from West Bridgewater may have been correct. Indeed, the district court noted as an aside at sentencing that Kominsky \"might have been off on the times\" in his testimony about the minutes before the vehicle stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.

Kominsky testified that \"I observed that the passenger, who turned out to be Mr. Henderson, wasn't wearing a seat belt, and asked him if he had any identification on him .... He said `no, I don't have any ID on me' . . . . I then asked him if he would mind writing down [his] name, date of birth, and Social Security number on a piece of paper ...

He picked up a piece of paper. He used my pen. He wrote down his information.\" Kominsky later clarified that he did not even think that there was a \"legal way for me to force\" a passenger in a stopped car to write down his identifying information in order to be cited for a seatbelt violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alford contradicted Kominsky both as to whether he mentioned anything about a seatbelt violation to Henderson and as to whether Kominsky merely requested &#8212; rather than demanded &#8212; Henderson's information. She testified that when Henderson asked Kominsky why he needed to write down his social security number and date of birth, Kominsky responded: \"Just write your fucking information on the paper before I snatch you up.\" Alford's testimony on this point was consistent. However, Alford related Kominsky's profanity only reluctantly, after the district court told her that she was \"required\" to state Kominsky's words accurately, \"even if it's language we wouldn't ordinarily use.\" In its written findings, the district court said that after \"Henderson `told Kominsky that he did not have a license or any identification,\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky <i>instructed</i> Henderson to write his name, date of birth, and social security number on a piece of paper.

The district court indicated that this finding was significant. In talking to counsel after the second suppression hearing, the district court noted its findings on these points before saying: \"back on [sic] October, I didn't believe everything that Mr. Kominsky said and I still don't.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Kominsky testified that he told Henderson, after he asked why he had to write down his information, \"You're not wearing your seatbelt, sir.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, to the contrary, that when \"Henderson asked Kominsky why he had to provide that information[,] Kominsky did not answer the question.\" Later, speaking to counsel, the district court summarized the testimony on this issue and its finding: \"Mr. Henderson says: `Why do I need to give you that?' And according to Kominsky he says `because you're not wearing a seat belt.' You don't find that in my [first decision on the motion to suppress].\" On an issue directly relevant to Kominsky's insistence that Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt, the district court's finding was contrary to Kominsky's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Profanity during the demand</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government avers that the district court made no finding as to whether Kominsky actually used the profanity Alford ascribed to him. However, the district court orally indicated that it found Alford's testimony more credible than Kominsky's on this point as well, stating after hearing Bellas's account of Kominsky's language at the second suppression hearing that \"my sense [is] that Officer Kominsky, you know, was not, well, was not likely to have been, you know, quite as polite in talking to Mr. Henderson as he [] described in his testimony.\" Whether or not the district court credited every word of Alford's quotation of Kominsky, the important point is that the district court again rejected Kominsky's credibility on an issue closely related to his insistence that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. The Bellas stop</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also disbelieved Kominsky's account of his interactions with Bellas, the high school student who testified that he had twice been stopped by Kominsky while driving on Plain Street from his school in Brockton to his home in East Bridgewater. According to Bellas, the first time he was stopped, Kominsky approached the car and said: \"I smell marijuana. And he asked me how much marijuana had I smoked in the nighttime.\" Bellas denied having smoked marijuana. There is no indication that he had. Kominsky did not even perform any kind of sobriety check. Bellas testified that Kominsky then ordered him out of the car, told him that he \"was going to jail\" if he did not say where he was hiding marijuana, and then searched him in a \"very physical manner.\" Kominsky took off Bellas's shoes and unbuckled his pants, and did the same to Bellas's friend, a young man named Carlos Gomes Pereira, who was riding as a passenger. Then, Bellas said, Kominsky \"ransacked\" the car, throwing his schoolbooks and homework into the street, and pulling up the carpet. Lieutenant Rogers, the second-ranking officer on the West Bridgewater Police (subordinate only to Kominsky's father, the Chief), later confirmed that Bellas's belongings had been thrown into disarray and that the carpet had been dislodged. After completing his search and finding no contraband, Kominsky left Bellas's belongings in the street and told him he could go. Bellas went home, and the next day his parents took him to the police station and filed a complaint. Rogers, who investigated, told Bellas and his family that he had been the victim of a \"profile\" stop. Noting Rogers's comment and documents in evidence indicating that Kominsky stopped minority drivers at a higher rate than their proportion of the local population, Henderson argued to the district court that the \"profile\" remark suggested Kominsky's possible motive in stopping their vehicle and in investigating Henderson. Henderson and Alford are African-American.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky also pulled Bellas over a second time in the same area, purportedly to cite him for having a muffler that was too loud. The car was towed for unrelated reasons. Rather than giving Bellas a ride home, Kominsky made Bellas walk. When Bellas's father complained again to Rogers, Rogers went to the tow yard with Bellas, found that the car's muffler was not loud, and voided the citation that Kominsky had issued. Kominsky admitted that he had stopped Bellas and searched him, and that he had not given Bellas any citation pursuant to the first stop. But Kominsky denied that he had been unduly aggressive during that stop or that he had asked about marijuana instead of asking Bellas for his license and registration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found Bellas's testimony more credible than Kominsky's. In its oral remarks after the second suppression hearing, after calling attention to the fact that it \"didn't believe everything that Mr. Kominsky said,\" the district court stated: \"in fact, I'm not inclined to believe his rendition of events with Bellas either. If I had the Bellas case in front of me it wouldn't be that hard.\" In its written findings, the district court stated that: \"the court finds Christopher Bellas's testimony concerning Kominsky's conduct when Bellas was stopped to be more accurate than Kominsky's version of events.\" <i>Henderson II,</i> 265 F.Supp.2d at 116. Again, the district court discredited Kominsky on an important issue even though the only evidence contrary to Kominsky's testimony was the testimony of a driver whom he had stopped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.

As the government points out, the district court did not explicitly resolve these contradictions. However, these contradictions are relevant to our inquiry, and, with respect to at least one of them, the district court did, in effect, reject Kominsky's account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

When the suppression hearing was opened for the final time, the parties informed the district court that Oliveira would testify that Kominsky used profanity during Henderson's arrest. (He did so testify at the second trial.) Kominsky, on the other hand, testified that he was polite throughout the encounter. The government now argues that this matter is immaterial because Oliveira's testimony did not occur until after the final decision on the motion to suppress. This argument is misleading. The district court knew that Oliveira would contradict Kominsky before it finally denied the motion. In fact, defense counsel presented the district court with the government's e-mailed statement that: \"Oliveira stated [in a pretrial conversation with the government] that he recalls in essence that Officer Kominsky used some form of the f___ word when asking Mr. Henderson to get out of the vehicle.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to hear Oliveira's testimony in person before reconsidering the suppression motion for the final time because \"I don't need to hear any more to have a low regard for Officer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The conversation at the station</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky also was contradicted on the important question of whether his shift supervisor on the night of Henderson's arrest, who considered himself Kominsky's mentor, provided Kominsky with an opportunity to fabricate his recollection that Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt. As we discussed above, Kominsky testified that he made a statement about the purported seatbelt violation while talking to Henderson at the scene. As already noted, the district court rejected this account. No other witness testified that Kominsky said anything about a seatbelt violation before returning to the police station. Oliveira testified that Kominsky said nothing about a seatbelt to him at the scene. Kominsky did not actually write a seatbelt citation until he returned to the station. The district court expressed interest in this sequence, telling defense counsel: \"I told you that I'm interested in knowing what happened back at the station and whether there was any discussion about the ticket. Ordinarily, I don't call witnesses. But don't you want to ask [his shift supervisor] that?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Philip Tuck, who was Kominsky's direct supervisor on the night of Henderson's arrest, testified at the second suppression hearing, largely at the district court's urging. Defense counsel said: \"I do not have any intention of calling Sergeant Tuck,\" immediately before the remarks by the district court above. After the district court again asked: \"do you want to call Sergeant Tuck?\" defense counsel agreed to call the witness, responding: \"I'm happy &#8212; yes, your Honor, I'll put him up on the stand.\" In the end, after some questioning by both counsel, the district court examined Tuck itself, at some length.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tuck said that he \"felt a certain fondness for\" Kominsky and watched out for him. Tuck testified that when Kominsky returned to the station with Henderson, he asked him why he had stopped Alford's vehicle and why he had asked Henderson to get out of the car.

Tuck said that he knew, while talking to Kominsky on the night of Henderson's arrest, that it was \"a big deal\" for the police department to make a federal felon in possession case and agreed that \"whether there was a seatbelt violation or some other violation was important to the future of the case against Mr. Henderson.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court asked Kominsky about the same conversation.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1504</span></a></span>. That reality is an important impediment to the rejection of a district court's credibility determinations on appeal. Here, however, that impediment has little force. Every time the district court spoke generally about matters relating to Kominsky's \"demeanor and inflection,\" it cast doubt on his reliability as a witness. We relate some notable examples and their contexts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to a question by the government at the first trial, Kominsky stated that he had testified at the motion to suppress \"about four days ago.\" In reality, Kominsky's testimony had been 22 days earlier. On recross examination, defense counsel followed up on this misstatement. When defense counsel raised the issue, Kominsky confirmed his belief that the suppression hearing had taken place \"four to six days\" earlier. Defense counsel asked Kominsky what day it was. He said: \"Wednesday.\" It was actually Thursday. Defense counsel then asked: \"Do you know what the date is today?\" Kominsky responded: \"No, I don't sir. I don't know the day or the month today. I'm sorry. I've lost it.\" The government later explained this testimony by telling the district court that Kominsky was sick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this excuse, the district court clearly was concerned about Kominsky's performance on the stand. After agreeing to grant Henderson a mistrial, the district court urged the government to \"reconsider whether this federal case ought to be voluntarily dismissed. . . . [W]hether he's ill or not, we now have a federal case where the government's prime witness testified yesterday that he didn't know what month it was.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky was scheduled to testify on the first day of the second suppression hearing. However, Kominsky missed his scheduled appearance, again because he was sick. The district court refused to take Kominsky's word on this excuse. The district court also refused to believe that Kominsky's poor performance on the witness stand was a result of illness. In the district court's words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'll tell you, you know, my law clerk said to me several days ago, it will be interesting to see Officer Kominsky on the stand when he's not sick. Because you may recall on Thursday, November 14, he thought it was Wednesday, he didn't know it was November, and he didn't know it was the 14th. <i>And I said, I don't think he's going to be any better.</i> And I'll leave it there for now . . . . But, you know, <i>a police officer shouldn't be unnaturally anxious about coming to court and testifying.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) The court then insisted on questioning Kominsky's doctor about the new illness, which the doctor confirmed was a gastrointestinal infection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky's subsequent performance did not improve the district court's impression of him. As noted above, the district court stated before the second trial that it had \"a low regard for Officer Kominsky as a law enforcement officer.\" Similarly, at sentencing, the district court said: \"I'll candidly state that, in a general sense, I have disquiet about Officer Kominsky and the West Bridgewater police . . . . And the idea that the U.S. Attorney's office is bringing cases which in effect have 20-year mandatory sentences when there's no parole in federal court based on that kind of police work and that kind of testimony disturbs me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also was blunt about Kominsky's capacity to testify accurately. At sentencing, looking back at Kominsky's entire testimony during the proceedings, the district court summed up its impression: \"Officer Kominsky, even if he were trying to tell the truth, is perhaps the worst law enforcement witness, who was trying to be candid, assuming he was trying to be candid, that I've ever encountered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The evidence on the seatbelt issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only evidence that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt before Kominsky demanded his identifying information was the uncorroborated testimony of Kominsky. In his testimony before the district court, Kominsky was empirically wrong on three points, markedly inconsistent on at least one highly relevant point, implausible on another point, expressly disbelieved by the district court on at least three and probably four points, and contradicted by other police officers on two important points (as to at least one of which the district court indicated orally that it was disinclined to accept Kominsky's story). In addition, Kominsky forgot the day of the week and month of the year while testifying in front of a jury in federal court. This performance prompted the district court to say that it had \"disquiet\" and was \"disturb[ed]\" about the case's very prosecution in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet Kominsky unwaveringly testified that Henderson was not wearing any seatbelt in the stopped car. On this ultimately crucial point, despite its serious reservations about Kominsky's credibility and his capacities as a law enforcement officer, the district court believed Kominsky because \"other credible evidence\" bolstered Kominsky's story. The district court did not explain what that \"other credible evidence\" was. The government does not contend that there was any \"other credible evidence,\" apart from Kominsky's own testimony, to bolster the district court's finding. We cannot find that \"other credible evidence\" in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kominsky said that he told Henderson and Alford that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt, as a justification for asking for his license. As we discussed above, the district court did not believe this story. No other witness indicated that Kominsky said anything about a seatbelt until he returned to the police station where, according to Tuck's testimony, Tuck advised him that he would need to articulate a reason for investigating the passenger in a stopped car. As the district court observed to counsel: \"He didn't write the seatbelt thing . . . [until] he went back and spoke to somebody.\" Kominsky also did not say anything to his supervisor on the radio about a seatbelt violation &#8212; even though he did discuss the citation that he would give Alford for driving with a suspended license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government does not argue that Oliveira's testimony corroborates Kominsky's report that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt. Indeed, the government does not argue that Oliveira was even on the scene of the vehicle stop in time to see whether Henderson was wearing his seatbelt during the stop. To do so, it would have to disbelieve Kominsky on the question whether Oliveira even arrived at the side of the car in time to see whether Henderson was wearing his seatbelt before Kominsky demanded Henderson's identifying information. At the first suppression hearing, Kominsky testified that \"Officer Oliveira was arriving at the time that I was speaking to Mr. Henderson. He was pulling up behind us.\" At the second hearing, Kominsky said: \"no, sir\" when asked whether Oliveira was at the side of the car during his initial encounter with Alford and Henderson. It is true that Oliveira testified that he was at the car earlier than Kominsky and Alford said, and that he thought he would have remembered if Henderson was wearing a seatbelt and that he did not remember that he was. However, Oliveira also testified that he did not \"remember looking in [Alford's car] and making a mental note\" whether Henderson was wearing his seatbelt. And Oliveira said that he had talked about the incident with Kominsky after the first trial ended in a mistrial, and that the issue of the seatbelt \"may have come up.\" Finally, Oliveira testified that Kominsky did not say anything to him about a seatbelt while they were at the scene. For all of these reasons, Oliveira's testimony does not bolster Kominsky's account about Henderson's seatbelt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court heard ample evidence that Kominsky had a tendency to exceed the proper bounds of a vehicle stop and to make unwarranted demands on drivers and passengers. This was the unmistakable import of the evidence about the Bellas stops, which the court credited. Tuck testified that Kominsky had amassed \"more than the average\" number of complaints about his conduct. Rogers testified that he had had to review proper vehicle stop procedures with Kominsky after concluding that Kominsky was overstepping the proper bounds of vehicle stops. Even as this case was ongoing, citizens were complaining about Kominsky's performance of his duties during vehicle stops. Kominsky himself testified: \"If I feel like asking everybody in the car for their license, I will,\" even though, as the other officers testified, such conduct by a police officer was a violation of Massachusetts state law. All of these factors leave little doubt that Kominsky would have no compunction about demanding Henderson's social security number and date of birth even if Henderson had not violated some law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case in which a witness's inaccuracies were collateral. The most inaccurate parts of Kominsky's testimony &#8212; the topics on which he testified with certainty but was clearly proven wrong &#8212; relate directly to the officer's account of the vehicle stop of Alford and Henderson and to the short period during which he professed to observe Henderson not wearing his seatbelt. On every point relating to the stop where empirical evidence could contradict Kominsky, it did. Kominsky repeatedly insisted that Alford's car had standard manual seatbelts. The car itself proved otherwise. Kominsky recalled that Henderson was wearing a dark sweatshirt. The documentary evidence showed that he was wearing a light-colored one. Kominsky testified that he was perfectly polite during the vehicle stop. Both Alford and Oliveira testified otherwise, and the district court indicated orally that it believed them. Kominsky testified that Henderson voluntarily wrote down his identifying information. The district court concluded that he did not. Kominsky said that he had Henderson's purported seatbelt violation in mind from the moment he demanded his identification and said so. No other witness testified that Kominsky said anything about a seatbelt until after returning to the police station and being reminded that he could not investigate a vehicle passenger without cause. The district court said that it did not believe Kominsky's statement to the contrary. On each of these points save the color of Henderson's shirt, Kominsky's testimony, though inaccurate, contradicted, or inconsistent, was just as emphatic as his testimony about Henderson's seatbelt. All told, in a record that runs well into the thousands of pages, there is nothing apart from Kominsky's own testimony to indicate that Kominsky was telling the truth about Henderson's seatbelt &#8212; even though he was lying or mistaken about so many related facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the district court acknowledged the difficulty of believing Kominsky about the seatbelt. Considering only the information in the record after the first suppression hearing, the district court termed the issue of Henderson's seatbelt a \"close\" one. After hearing more information at the second suppression hearing that challenged Kominsky's account and credibility, the district court, although again denying the suppression motion, observed that: \"the question whether Henderson was wearing a seatbelt . . . continues to be close.\" At sentencing, the district court said: \"I two times found . . . that Mr. Henderson was not wearing a seat belt. That much of Officer Kominsky I credited. But, in candor, I'm not close to sure about that.\" Later, in the same hearing, the district court stated: \"I might only be 55 percent sure of the facts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What apparently tipped the balance for the court on the seatbelt issue was \"other credible evidence\" that somehow salvaged Kominsky's badly damaged credibility. Yet neither the district court nor the government has specified what \"other credible evidence\" might bolster Kominsky's story. As indicated, we have not found that \"other credible evidence\" anywhere in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can understand the district court's continued uncertainty about its seatbelt finding.

Most notably, Kominsky's demand for Henderson's identifying information and his subsequent investigation of Henderson expanded the scope of the stop, changed the target of the stop, and prolonged the stop. Alford, not Henderson, was the subject of the initial stop. According to Kominsky, Henderson was not detained at all prior to the demand for his identification; rather \"he could have just walked away.\" According to Oliveira, it took Kominsky between ten and fifteen minutes to run a criminal history check on Henderson and longer, after that, to confirm the results of the check with the dispatcher. Oliveira's time line is consistent with Alford's testimony that twenty minutes elapsed between Kominsky's demand for Henderson's information and his return to the car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> As the officers testified, apart from the records check on Henderson, there was no other reason to prolong the stop. Kominsky already knew everything that he wanted to know about Alford.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The standard procedure in the circumstances, the officers testified, would have been to issue a citation to Alford, arrange to have the car towed, and let the driver and passenger leave the scene (either by foot or by a ride in a police cruiser to a place from which they could call a taxi). Presumably, if Kominsky had not demanded Henderson's identifying information and investigated him, Henderson would have \"just walked away.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no particularized reason, discounting the discredited seatbelt violation, for Kominsky to launch into an investigation of Henderson. Kominsky might reasonably have asked Henderson for his license to see if he could drive the car back to Boston. But when Henderson responded that he did not have his license, there was, as the district court found, no further reason to inquire about his ability to drive Alford's car back to Boston. Henderson, of course, could not drive the car without producing a license. Nor was there any other remotely particularized rationale for investigating Henderson. Kominsky did not perceive any danger from Henderson, nor did Kominsky have any reason to suspect that Henderson was engaged in any kind of illegal activity. The stop was not made in a dangerous location. Alford's underlying traffic violation &#8212; driving with a suspended license &#8212; did not raise the specter of criminal activity involving Henderson. Henderson was not acting suspiciously. Indeed, the government conceded to the district court that \"the government is not contending in this case that Mr. Henderson at the time Officer Kominsky asked for identification was engaged in other suspicious conduct or that the evidence supports that.\" In light of these facts, the government's \"officer safety\" argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court handled this difficult case with skill and care. Troubled by the government's belated disclosure of evidence pertinent to Kominsky's conduct at vehicle stops and other issues, the court declared a mistrial of Henderson's first trial and reopened the suppression issue. The court said that it was \"disturb[ed]\" about the government's reliance on the person it called \"perhaps the worst law enforcement witness, who was trying to be candid, assuming he was trying to be candid, that I've ever encountered.\" The court stated: \"I am concerned about the competence and practices of . . . Kominsky.\" Still, on the critical factual issue in this case &#8212; whether to believe Kominsky's testimony that Henderson was not wearing his seatbelt &#8212; the district court accepted Kominsky's account on the basis of \"other credible evidence\" not specified by the court or by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the record, we have found no such evidence. Instead, we have found that Kominsky's testimony was riddled with implausibilities and inconsistencies, and that it was disbelieved by the district court in important respects and contradicted by law enforcement witnesses in others. Under these circumstances, we are left with a firm and definite conviction that the district court's critical finding that Kominsky credibly testified that Henderson was not wearing a seatbelt was clearly erroneous. The government established no other justification for Kominsky's investigation of Henderson's identifying information. Therefore, we must reverse the order denying the motion to suppress and vacate the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Henderson's conviction carried a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years.
