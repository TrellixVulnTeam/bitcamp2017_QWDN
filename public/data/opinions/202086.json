Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n               Selya, Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     R. Bradford Fawley, with whom Downs Rachlin Martin PLLC,\nHoward J. Susser, Michael P. Murphy, Burns & Levinson LLP, Leonard\nJ. Santisi, and Frommer Lawrence & Haug LLP were on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Andrew D. Epstein, with whom Barker, Epstein & Loscocco was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 3, 2006\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.      In the case underlying this\n\nchameleon-like appeal, a jury found defendant-appellant Mikasa,\n\nInc. liable for copyright infringement and awarded damages of\n\n$665,000 to the copyright holder, plaintiff-appellee Joel Cipes.\n\nMikasa, shifting theories at every turn, asks us to intercede.\n\nFinding Mikasa's evanescent arguments unpersuasive, we affirm the\n\njudgment below.\n\n            The facts are straightforward. Mikasa is a national\n\npurveyor of dinnerware, glassware, and the like.        For several\n\nyears, Cipes (an independent contractor) served as Mikasa's primary\n\nadvertising photographer.   Cipes copyrighted the photographs.   See\n\n17 U.S.C. § 201.\n\n            Initially, the parties operated under an oral agreement.\n\nThe terms of that agreement provided that Mikasa would pay Cipes a\n\nflat fee for each commissioned photograph.    The amount of the fee\n\nvaried based on complexity and intended use.     While Mikasa could\n\nthereafter reuse the photographs in its own publications (e.g.,\n\ncompany catalogs, brochures, and mailings) without any incremental\n\npayment, it had to pay Cipes a further stipend if it wished to\n\nreuse a photograph in an advertisement placed in, say, a national\n\nmagazine.\n\n            Mikasa eventually developed an antipathy to the payment\n\nof national advertising reuse fees.        In December of 1998, it\n\ninformed Cipes that his relationship with Mikasa would be at risk\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fif he continued to insist on the supplemental payments.             Cipes\n\nresponded with a letter that proposed a more munificent price list\n\nfor photographs taken in 1999 and eliminated any reuse fees.\n\nMikasa did not respond to the letter but it continued to avail\n\nitself of Cipes's services.\n\n           The parties' relationship endured, without any further\n\nnegotiations, throughout 2000 and into 2001.               That created a\n\nproblem because Cipes's letter was ambiguous. He testified that it\n\nonly applied to 1999 and that, thereafter, the parties were once\n\nagain operating under their original fee arrangement.            Mikasa's\n\nrepresentatives alleged that the 1999 prices and terms remained in\n\neffect for subsequent years.\n\n           Matters came to a head when Cipes demanded reuse fees for\n\n2000 and 2001.    Mikasa demurred, asserting that Cipes's letter\n\nconstituted a perpetual waiver of such fees.          Unable to resolve\n\nthis dispute amicably, the parties went their separate ways.\n\nMikasa   nonetheless   continued   to    reuse   Cipes's   photographs   in\n\nnational advertising media even after Cipes's attorney sent a\n\ncease-and-desist letter.\n\n           On December 10, 2002, Cipes sued Mikasa in federal\n\ndistrict court.   His complaint alleged that Mikasa (i) infringed\n\nhis copyrights when it republished his photographs without a valid\n\nlicense and (ii) breached the parties' contract when it refused to\n\npay the required fees for photographs reused in and after 2000.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fMikasa denied these allegations.        A jury was empaneled and trial\n\ncommenced on February 14, 2005.\n\n          At the close of all the evidence, the district court\n\nproposed a special verdict form (to which the parties unreservedly\n\nassented) and addressed the parties' proffered jury instructions.\n\nWith respect to each suggested instruction, the court indicated\n\nwhether it would include the substance of the proposition in its\n\nfinal charge. It then entertained comments and warned counsel that\n\nthey should be sure to register any objections after the court read\n\nthe final version of the instructions to the jury.        See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 51(c).   The court declined Mikasa's request to furnish the\n\nparties with an advance written copy of the charge on the ground\n\nthat the instructions were subject to linguistic polishing and\n\nother minor adjustments until the moment of delivery.\n\n          Before instructing the jurors, the court assured them\n\nthat they would receive a written copy of the instructions for\n\ntheir reference during deliberations.        Neither party objected to\n\nthis anticipated course of action.           The court then read the\n\ninstructions, afforded the parties an opportunity to object at\n\nsidebar, and sent the jury off to commence deliberations.\n\n          What occurred next was quixotic: the deputy clerk was en\n\nroute to deliver a copy of the instructions to the jurors when the\n\njury foreman sent a note to the judge requesting the promised\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\finstructions.      The court allowed the deputy clerk to complete his\n\nmission but did not inform counsel of the note at that juncture.\n\n           Responding to the special verdict form, the jury found\n\nMikasa guilty of infringing Cipes's copyrights and awarded Cipes\n\n$665,000 in damages.      However, the jury also found that while the\n\nparties had entered an enforceable contract — presumably evidenced\n\nby Cipes's letter — Mikasa had not breached that contract. Neither\n\nparty   objected    to   the   taking    of   the   verdict,   and   the   court\n\ndischarged the jury.\n\n           Next, the court informed counsel of the note requesting\n\nthe written jury instructions. The court asked the lawyers whether\n\nthey had anything to say.        Silence reigned.\n\n           After the court entered judgment on the verdict, Mikasa\n\nfiled a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or,\n\nalternatively, for a new trial.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 59.         It\n\nargued, among other things, that the copyright infringement award\n\nwas inconsistent with the finding that Mikasa had not committed a\n\nbreach of contract.       The district court rejected this argument,\n\nplausibly explaining that there was no necessary inconsistency;\n\nalthough the jury explicitly found that the parties had entered\n\ninto an enforceable contract, it did not specify the terms or\n\nduration of the contract and may have found, for example, that the\n\ncontract covered only the year 1999. The court proceeded to reject\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fMikasa's other arguments as well and denied its post-trial motion.\n\nThis timeous appeal ensued.\n\n           In its opening brief on appeal, Mikasa reiterated its\n\ninconsistent       verdict     claim;     asserted     that     the      copyright\n\ninfringement       award   should   not       stand   because     the     evidence\n\nestablished, as a matter of law, that Mikasa had a continuing\n\nlicense to use the photographs; and posited, in the alternative,\n\nthat Cipes, through his conduct, had granted Mikasa an implied\n\nlicense.      In   response,    Cipes    maintained    that     Mikasa    had   not\n\nadequately preserved any of these arguments and that, in all\n\nevents, none of them had the slightest merit.\n\n           Without abandoning the points pressed in its opening\n\nbrief, Mikasa advanced two new theories in its reply brief.                     It\n\ncontended for the first time that the trial court erred when it (i)\n\nfailed to honor defense counsel's request for a written copy of the\n\njury instructions before delivering the charge and (ii) neglected\n\ncontemporaneously to apprise counsel of the jury note.                    At oral\n\nargument, Mikasa again switched gears; it waived all the issues it\n\nhad briefed, save only for its claim of error with respect to the\n\njury note.1\n\n\n     1\n      Despite this express waiver, Mikasa's appellate counsel\nnevertheless proceeded at oral argument to calumnize the district\ncourt for its unwillingness to supply an advance written copy of\nthe jury instructions. This criticism is unjustified. Although\nthe Civil Rules require the court to inform the parties about the\ncontent of its anticipated jury instructions prior to summations\nand charge, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(b)(1), there is no requirement\n\n                                        -6-\n\f           While an appellate court is not compelled to accept a\n\nparty's   concession      on    an   issue,    see,    e.g.,    United   States   v.\n\nSánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 81 (1st Cir. 2005) (disregarding\n\nconcession of error), the issues conceded by Mikasa are both\n\nprocedurally defaulted and substantively weak.                   Consequently, we\n\naccept the waiver and address only the claim of error anent the\n\njury note.\n\n           Procedurally, Mikasa is barred on at least three levels\n\nfrom advancing its jury note claim.             First, Mikasa did not object\n\nafter the court told the jurors that it would furnish them with a\n\nwritten copy of the charge.          Second, Mikasa did not object when the\n\ncourt belatedly informed counsel both of the jury note and of its\n\nactions with respect thereto.                 Such lost opportunities count\n\nagainst an appellant.          See United States v. Sutton, 970 F.2d 1001,\n\n1006 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"When a trial judge announces a proposed\n\ncourse of action which a party believes to be erroneous, that party\n\nmust act expeditiously to call the perceived error to the judge's\n\nattention,   on    pain    of    forfeiting      the    right    subsequently     to\n\ncomplain.\").      Third, Mikasa did not raise the jury note claim in\n\nits opening brief in this court.              That omission runs afoul of the\n\nwell-settled principle that issues advanced for the first time in\n\n\n\nthat a trial court give counsel a written copy of the instructions\nbefore charging the jury. Here, the court painstakingly addressed\neach of the parties' proposed instructions at the charge conference\nand, thus, fully satisfied the strictures of Rule 51(b)(1).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fan appellant's reply brief are deemed by the boards.              See, e.g.,\n\nWaste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n           In many instances, procedural defaults work forfeitures\n\nrather than waivers, see generally United States v. Rodriguez, 311\n\nF.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002) (distinguishing between waivers and\n\nforfeitures), and it is therefore arguable that the jury note\n\nclaim,   though     manifestly    unpreserved,   might    nonetheless      be\n\nreviewable for plain error. Even so, Mikasa would not be assisted.\n\nThe test for plain error is familiar.       Relief under that standard\n\nrequires the appellant to make the following showings: \"(1) that an\n\nerror occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only\n\n(3) affected the [appellant's] substantial rights, but also (4)\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"      United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).     Mikasa cannot satisfy that standard here.\n\n           Mikasa    is   undeniably   correct   in   asserting    that    the\n\nappropriate course of action when a trial court receives a note\n\nfrom a deliberating jury involves sharing the note with counsel at\n\nthe   earliest    practicable    opportunity.    See   United     States   v.\n\nHernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v.\n\nParent, 954 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1992).         A trial court's failure\n\nto follow that course, however, does not automatically constitute\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\freversible error; instead, it engenders harmless-error review. See\n\nParent, 954 F.2d at 25; United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 526\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          In this instance, the error was merely a technical one,\n\nwhich had no practical effect on the proceedings.    The purpose of\n\nthe rule is to ensure that counsel are allowed an opportunity to\n\ncomment on or object to the court's proposed response to a jury\n\nnote before that response is given.   See Hernandez, 146 F.3d at 35.\n\nThe instant note, however, was not one that required the court to\n\nrespond substantively; the written copy of the jury instructions\n\nhad been promised in the court's charge — a promise to which Mikasa\n\nhad not objected — and the deputy clerk was en route to fulfill\n\nthat promise when the judge received the note.    Because the judge\n\nsimply decided to let the delivery proceed, he had no occasion to\n\nrespond substantively.    Thus, any error in neglecting to tell\n\ncounsel promptly about the note was manifestly harmless.\n\n          In a variation on this theme, Mikasa's appellate counsel\n\ninsinuates that the copy of the instructions delivered to the jury\n\ndid not faithfully replicate the charge as given and that this\n\ndiscrepancy injected an element of reversible error. Cf. Rogers v.\n\nUnited States, 422 U.S. 35, 39-41 (1975) (finding court's failure\n\nto apprise counsel of jury note not harmless where question was\n\n\"tantamount to a request for further instructions\" beyond scope of\n\noriginal charge).   We have compared the copy of the instructions\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fsent to the jury (which the district court prudently inserted into\n\nthe record) and the transcript of the charge as delivered from the\n\nbench.     This comparison offers no hint of prejudicial error.\n\nDespite some trivial semantic alterations, we are satisfied that\n\nthe written copy was the functional equivalent of the oral charge.\n\n            Straining at gnats while asking us to swallow a camel,\n\nMikasa's appellate counsel also hypothesizes that the court's\n\nactions    might     not    have   been       harmless    if,     for    example,   the\n\nunrecorded note had indicated something other than the district\n\njudge    recounted    (say,      that    the    jury     was    confused    about   the\n\nimbricated nature of the copyright and contract claims).                            The\n\ndistrict court could, of course, have avoided any such innuendo by\n\nfollowing our prescribed procedure and marking the jury note as an\n\nexhibit for identification.              See Maraj, 947 F.2d at 525.                Once\n\nagain, however, the error in failing to mark the note was entirely\n\nbenign.\n\n            These are our reasons.             First, the jury note came at the\n\nvery start of deliberations.              It is extremely doubtful that the\n\njurors had time, prior to submitting the note, to discuss the case\n\nin any detail.       Second, it is wildly implausible that the judge,\n\nhaving    determined       to   tell    the    lawyers    about    the    note,   would\n\nfictionalize its contents.              There is a presumption of regularity\n\nthat attends certain judicial proceedings, see, e.g., Ouellette v.\n\nUnited States, 862 F.2d 371, 374 (1st Cir. 1988), and we are\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fcomfortable applying that presumption here. Third, and finally, if\n\nMikasa had any legitimate question about the wording of the jury\n\nnote, it could have asked the district court to produce the note\n\nand make it part of the record.      Having spurned this opportunity\n\nwhen the court advised the parties of the note, Mikasa cannot now\n\nbe heard to speculate about unsubstantiated worst-case scenarios.\n\nOur review is limited to the record below, see Fed. R. App. P. 10,\n\nand there is nothing in the record to suggest that the note was\n\nanything other than a simple request that the district court follow\n\nthrough on its promise to furnish a copy of the charge.\n\n            We need go no further.     A party, dissatisfied with the\n\ndistrict court's handling of a trial yet persuaded that the points\n\nit raised below lack merit, cannot blithely switch horses mid-\n\nstream in hopes of locating a swifter steed.       Without exception,\n\nMikasa's claims have been waived or forfeited, and there is no\n\nbasis for disturbing the district court's judgment.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

The court then read the instructions, afforded the parties an opportunity to object at sidebar, and sent the jury off to commence deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What occurred next was quixotic: the deputy clerk was en route to deliver a copy of the instructions to the jurors when the jury foreman sent a note to the judge requesting the promised instructions. The court allowed the deputy clerk to complete his mission but did not inform counsel of the note at that juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Responding to the special verdict form, the jury found Mikasa guilty of infringing Cipes's copyrights and awarded Cipes $665,000 in damages. However, the jury also found that while the parties had entered an enforceable contract &#8212; presumably evidenced by Cipes's letter &#8212; Mikasa had not breached that contract. Neither party objected to the taking of the verdict, and the court discharged the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the court informed counsel of the note requesting the written jury instructions. The court asked the lawyers whether they had anything to say. Silence reigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court entered judgment on the verdict, Mikasa filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, for a new trial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50, 59. It argued, among other things, that the copyright infringement award was inconsistent with the finding that Mikasa had not committed a breach of contract. The district court rejected this argument, plausibly explaining that there was no necessary inconsistency; although the jury explicitly found that the parties had entered into an enforceable contract, it did not specify the terms or duration of the contract and may have found, for example, that the contract covered only the year 1999. The court proceeded to reject Mikasa's other arguments as well and denied its post-trial motion. This timeous appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opening brief on appeal, Mikasa reiterated its inconsistent verdict claim; asserted that the copyright infringement award should not stand because the evidence established, as a matter of law, that Mikasa had a continuing license to use the photographs; and posited, in the alternative, that Cipes, through his conduct, had granted Mikasa an implied license. In response, Cipes maintained that Mikasa had not adequately preserved any of these arguments and that, in all events, none of them had the slightest merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without abandoning the points pressed in its opening brief, Mikasa advanced two new theories in its reply brief. It contended for the first time that the trial court erred when it (i) failed to honor defense counsel's request for a written copy of the jury instructions before delivering the charge and (ii) neglected contemporaneously to apprise counsel of the jury note. At oral argument, Mikasa again switched gears; it waived all the issues it had briefed, save only for its claim of error with respect to the jury note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an appellate court is not compelled to accept a party's concession on an issue, <i>see, e.g., United States v. S&#225;nchez-Berr&#237;os,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 81 (1st Cir. 2005) (disregarding concession of error), the issues conceded by Mikasa are both procedurally defaulted and substantively weak. Consequently, we accept the waiver and address only the claim of error anent the jury note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Procedurally, Mikasa is barred on at least three levels from advancing its jury note claim. First, Mikasa did not object after the court told the jurors that it would furnish them with a written copy of the charge. Second, Mikasa did not object when the court belatedly informed counsel both of the jury note and of its actions with respect thereto. Such lost opportunities count against an appellant. <i>See United States v. Sutton,</i> 970 F.2d 1001, 1006 (1st Cir.1992) (\"When a trial judge announces a proposed course of action which a party believes to be erroneous, that party must act expeditiously to call the perceived error to the judge's attention, on pain of forfeiting the right subsequently to complain.\"). Third, Mikasa did not raise the jury note claim in its opening brief in this court. That omission runs afoul of the well-settled principle that issues advanced for the first time in an appellant's reply brief are deemed by the boards. <i>See, e.g., Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many instances, procedural defaults work forfeitures rather than waivers, <i>see generally United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002) (distinguishing between waivers and forfeitures), and it is therefore arguable that the jury note claim, though manifestly unpreserved, might nonetheless be reviewable for plain error. Even so, Mikasa would not be assisted. The test for plain error is familiar. Relief under that standard requires the appellant to make the following showings: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the [appellant's] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Mikasa cannot satisfy that standard here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mikasa is undeniably correct in asserting that the appropriate course of action when a trial court receives a note from a deliberating jury involves sharing the note with counsel at the earliest practicable opportunity. <i>See United States v. Hernandez,</i> 146 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Parent,</i> 954 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1992). A trial court's failure to follow that course, however, does not automatically constitute reversible error; instead, it engenders harmless-error review. <i>See Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 25; <i>United States v. Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d 520, 526 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the error was merely a technical one, which had no practical effect on the proceedings. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that counsel are allowed an opportunity to comment on or object to the court's proposed response to a jury note before that response is given. <i>See Hernandez,</i> 146 F.3d at 35. The instant note, however, was not one that required the court to respond substantively; the written copy of the jury instructions had been promised in the court's charge &#8212; a promise to which Mikasa had not objected &#8212; and the deputy clerk was en route to fulfill that promise when the judge received the note. Because the judge simply decided to let the delivery proceed, he had no occasion to respond substantively. Thus, any error in neglecting to tell counsel promptly about the note was manifestly harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a variation on this theme, Mikasa's appellate counsel insinuates that the copy of the instructions delivered to the jury did not faithfully replicate the charge as given and that this discrepancy injected an element of reversible error. <i>Cf. Rogers v. United States,</i> 422 U.S. 35, 39-41, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975) (finding court's failure to apprise counsel of jury note not harmless where question was \"tantamount to a request for further instructions\" beyond scope of original charge). We have compared the copy of the instructions sent to the jury (which the district court prudently inserted into the record) and the transcript of the charge as delivered from the bench. This comparison offers no hint of prejudicial error. Despite some trivial semantic alterations, we are satisfied that the written copy was the functional equivalent of the oral charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Straining at gnats while asking us to swallow a camel, Mikasa's appellate counsel also hypothesizes that the court's actions might not have been harmless if, for example, the unrecorded note had indicated something other than the district judge recounted (say, that the jury was confused about the imbricated nature of the copyright and contract claims). The district court could, of course, have avoided any such innuendo by following our prescribed procedure and marking the jury note as an exhibit for identification. <i>See Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d at 525. Once again, however, the error in failing to mark the note was entirely benign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are our reasons. First, the jury note came at the very start of deliberations. It is extremely doubtful that the jurors had time, prior to submitting the note, to discuss the case in any detail. Second, it is wildly implausible that the judge, having determined to tell the lawyers about the note, would fictionalize its contents. There is a presumption of regularity that attends certain judicial proceedings, <i>see, e.g., Ouellette v. United States,</i> 862 F.2d 371, 374 (1st Cir.1988), and we are comfortable applying that presumption here. Third, and finally, if Mikasa had any legitimate question about the wording of the jury note, it could have asked the district court to produce the note and make it part of the record. Having spurned this opportunity when the court advised the parties of the note, Mikasa cannot now be heard to speculate about unsubstantiated worst-case scenarios. Our review is limited to the record below, <i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 10, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the note was anything other than a simple request that the district court follow through on its promise to furnish a copy of the charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. A party, dissatisfied with the district court's handling of a trial yet persuaded that the points it raised below lack merit, cannot blithely switch horses mid-stream in hopes of locating a swifter steed. Without exception, Mikasa's claims have been waived or forfeited, and there is no basis for disturbing the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Despite this express waiver, Mikasa's appellate counsel nevertheless proceeded at oral argument to calumnize the district court for its unwillingness to supply an advance written copy of the jury instructions. This criticism is unjustified. Although the Civil Rules require the court to inform the parties about the content of its anticipated jury instructions prior to summations and charge,<i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(b)(1), there is no requirement that a trial court give counsel a written copy of the instructions before charging the jury. Here, the court painstakingly addressed each of the parties' proposed instructions at the charge conference and, thus, fully satisfied the strictures of Rule 51(b)(1).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Mikasa, shifting theories at every turn, asks us to intercede. Finding Mikasa's evanescent arguments unpersuasive, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are straightforward. Mikasa is a national purveyor of dinnerware, glassware, and the like. For several years, Cipes (an independent contractor) served as Mikasa's primary advertising photographer. Cipes copyrighted the photographs. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 201.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the parties operated under an oral agreement. The terms of that agreement provided that Mikasa would pay Cipes a flat fee for each commissioned photograph. The amount of the fee varied based on complexity and intended use. While Mikasa could thereafter reuse the photographs in its own publications (e.g., company catalogs, brochures, and mailings) without any incremental payment, it had to pay Cipes a further stipend if it wished to reuse a photograph in an advertisement placed in, say, a national magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mikasa eventually developed an antipathy to the payment of national advertising reuse fees. In December of 1998, it informed Cipes that his relationship with Mikasa would be at risk if he continued to insist on the supplemental payments. Cipes responded with a letter that proposed a more munificent price list for photographs taken in 1999 and eliminated any reuse fees. Mikasa did not respond to the letter but it continued to avail itself of Cipes's services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties' relationship endured, without any further negotiations, throughout 2000 and into 2001. That created a problem because Cipes's letter was ambiguous. He testified that it only applied to 1999 and that, thereafter, the parties were once again operating under their original fee arrangement. Mikasa's representatives alleged that the 1999 prices and terms remained in effect for subsequent years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matters came to a head when Cipes demanded reuse fees for 2000 and 2001. Mikasa demurred, asserting that Cipes's letter constituted a perpetual waiver of such fees. Unable to resolve this dispute amicably, the parties went their separate ways. Mikasa nonetheless continued to reuse Cipes's photographs in national advertising media even after Cipes's attorney sent a cease-and-desist letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, 2002, Cipes sued Mikasa in federal district court. His complaint alleged that Mikasa (i) infringed his copyrights when it republished his photographs without a valid license and (ii) breached the parties' contract when it refused to pay the required fees for photographs reused in and after 2000. Mikasa denied these allegations. A jury was empaneled and trial commenced on February 14, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of all the evidence, the district court proposed a special verdict form (to which the parties unreservedly assented) and addressed the parties' proffered jury instructions. With respect to each suggested instruction, the court indicated whether it would include the substance of the proposition in its final charge. It then entertained comments and warned counsel that they should be sure to register any objections after the court read the final version of the instructions to the jury. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c). The court declined Mikasa's request to furnish the parties with an advance written copy of the charge on the ground that the instructions were subject to linguistic polishing and other minor adjustments until the moment of delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before instructing the jurors, the court assured them that they would receive a written copy of the instructions for their reference during deliberations.

The purpose of the rule is to ensure that counsel are allowed an opportunity to comment on or object to the court's proposed response to a jury note before that response is given. <i>See Hernandez,</i> 146 F.3d at 35. The instant note, however, was not one that required the court to respond substantively; the written copy of the jury instructions had been promised in the court's charge &#8212; a promise to which Mikasa had not objected &#8212; and the deputy clerk was en route to fulfill that promise when the judge received the note. Because the judge simply decided to let the delivery proceed, he had no occasion to respond substantively. Thus, any error in neglecting to tell counsel promptly about the note was manifestly harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a variation on this theme, Mikasa's appellate counsel insinuates that the copy of the instructions delivered to the jury did not faithfully replicate the charge as given and that this discrepancy injected an element of reversible error. <i>Cf. Rogers v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109284\"><a href=\"/opinion/109284/rogers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 39-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109284\"><a href=\"/opinion/109284/rogers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2091</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109284\"><a href=\"/opinion/109284/rogers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1975) (finding court's failure to apprise counsel of jury note not harmless where question was \"tantamount to a request for further instructions\" beyond scope of original charge). We have compared the copy of the instructions sent to the jury (which the district court prudently inserted into the record) and the transcript of the charge as delivered from the bench. This comparison offers no hint of prejudicial error. Despite some trivial semantic alterations, we are satisfied that the written copy was the functional equivalent of the oral charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Straining at gnats while asking us to swallow a camel, Mikasa's appellate counsel also hypothesizes that the court's actions might not have been harmless if, for example, the unrecorded note had indicated something other than the district judge recounted (say, that the jury was confused about the imbricated nature of the copyright and contract claims). The district court could, of course, have avoided any such innuendo by following our prescribed procedure and marking the jury note as an exhibit for identification. <i>See Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d at 525. Once again, however, the error in failing to mark the note was entirely benign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are our reasons. First, the jury note came at the very start of deliberations. It is extremely doubtful that the jurors had time, prior to submitting the note, to discuss the case in any detail. Second, it is wildly implausible that the judge, having determined to tell the lawyers about the note, would fictionalize its contents. There is a presumption of regularity that attends certain judicial proceedings, <i>see, e.g., Ouellette v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515172\"><a href=\"/opinion/515172/john-james-ouellette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 374 (1st Cir.1988), and we are comfortable applying that presumption here. Third, and finally, if Mikasa had any legitimate question about the wording of the jury note, it could have asked the district court to produce the note and make it part of the record. Having spurned this opportunity when the court advised the parties of the note, Mikasa cannot now be heard to speculate about unsubstantiated worst-case scenarios. Our review is limited to the record below, <i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 10, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the note was anything other than a simple request that the district court follow through on its promise to furnish a copy of the charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. A party, dissatisfied with the district court's handling of a trial yet persuaded that the points it raised below lack merit, cannot blithely switch horses mid-stream in hopes of locating a swifter steed. Without exception, Mikasa's claims have been waived or forfeited, and there is no basis for disturbing the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Despite this express waiver, Mikasa's appellate counsel nevertheless proceeded at oral argument to calumnize the district court for its unwillingness to supply an advance written copy of the jury instructions. This criticism is unjustified. Although the Civil Rules require the court to inform the parties about the content of its anticipated jury instructions prior to summations and charge,<i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(b)(1), there is no requirement that a trial court give counsel a written copy of the instructions before charging the jury. Here, the court painstakingly addressed each of the parties' proposed instructions at the charge conference and, thus, fully satisfied the strictures of Rule 51(b)(1).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
