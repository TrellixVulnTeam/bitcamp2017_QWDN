The Houlton Band of Maliseet\n\nIndians (\"Houlton Band\") is an Indian tribe based in northern Maine\n\nand the plaintiff in this lawsuit.            According to the tribe's\n\ncomplaint, in August 2005 the Houlton Band ended its employment\n\nrelationship with Connie Zetts, an employee who had worked in the\n\ntribe's health clinic since November 2004. Zetts proceeded to file\n\ncharges of employment discrimination with the Maine Human Rights\n\nCommission (\"the Commission\"), a state agency that investigates\n\ndiscrimination charges.       She alleged that the Houlton Band had\n\nviolated the Maine Human Rights Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,\n\n§§ 4551-4634, a state employment discrimination statute.\n\n            In response, the Houlton Band filed the instant lawsuit\n\nin federal district court. The suit named as defendants Zetts, the\n\nCommission's members and executive director, and Maine's Attorney\n\nGeneral.    The Houlton Band's two-count claim was that either as a\n\nresult of its inherent tribal sovereignty and its alleged statutory\n\nright to self-governance, or as a result of tribal sovereign\n\nimmunity,    Maine   was   precluded       from   enforcing        its     anti-\n\ndiscrimination laws against the Houlton Band.          The Houlton Band\n\nsought   both   declaratory   and   injunctive     relief     to    stop    the\n\nCommission from proceeding with Zetts' complaint, and with any\n\nfuture discrimination complaints filed by employees and former\n\nemployees of the Houlton Band.\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            The federal proceedings were originally held before a\n\nmagistrate judge, and the defendants each moved to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint.     The magistrate judge recommended that, as to the\n\nCommission members and the state individual defendants, the court\n\nshould dismiss both counts under the doctrine of claim preclusion.\n\nThis ruling was based on the fact that the Houlton Band had\n\npreviously litigated similar issues in a 1996 lawsuit it filed\n\nagainst the Commission, a case that led to a final judgment against\n\nthe Houlton Band.       See Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians v. Me.\n\nHuman Rights Comm'n, 960 F. Supp. 449 (D. Me. 1997).         That earlier\n\ncase had never been appealed.       As to defendant Zetts, who had not\n\nbeen   a   party   to   the   earlier   lawsuit,   the   magistrate   judge\n\nrecommended that the tribe's claims be dismissed on the basis of\n\nissue preclusion.        The district court adopted the magistrate\n\njudge's recommendations, and it dismissed the complaint.\n\n            On appeal, we need not resolve the contested issues\n\nsurrounding the preclusion doctrines.        That is because even if the\n\nHoulton Band is not precluded from bringing this lawsuit, it is\n\nclear that the tribe would lose on the merits.            Our decision in\n\nAroostook Band of Micmacs v. Ryan, Nos. 06-1127 and 06-1358, issued\n\nthis same day, forecloses both of the Houlton Band's claims.\n\nAroostook holds that a federal statute, the Maine Indian Claims\n\nSettlement Act of 1980, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1721-1735, allows Maine to\n\nenforce its employment discrimination laws against Maine tribes,\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fincluding the Houlton Band (and other than the Passamaquoddy Tribe\n\nand the Penobscot Nation).   See Aroostook, slip. op. at 16-31, 33-\n\n40, 47-49; see also 25 U.S.C. § 1725(a).\n\n          The judgment of the district court dismissing the action\n\nis affirmed.   Costs are awarded to the defendants-appellees.\n\n\n\n                   -Concurring opinion follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring.      I concur with the\n\njudgment of the majority affirming the judgment of the district\n\ncourt dismissing the action against all defendants, but reach that\n\noutcome on the basis of preclusion principles.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
