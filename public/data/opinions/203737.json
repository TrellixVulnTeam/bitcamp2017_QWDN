Evans,\nAssistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n                          March 24, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric\nH. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey as respondent.\n\f          Per Curiam.    Lye Fong Shia is a citizen of Malaysia and\n\nentered the United States in June 2002 on a six-month visitor visa,\n\nwhich she overstayed.     In December 2005, Shia was arrested in\n\nMassachusetts on a criminal charge, gave the police a Massachusetts\n\naddress, and (as an overstaying alien subject to removal under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) (2006)) was placed in the custody of the\n\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") of the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (\"DHS\").\n\n          ICE released Shia on her own recognizance and, according\n\nto a document in the record, personally served her on December 20,\n\n2005, with a notice to appear form; the form warned that she had to\n\ncome to court when notified of a hearing date and to keep her\n\naddress up to date and that a removal order could be entered if she\n\nfailed to appear when notified.       In January 2006, DHS mailed a\n\nnotice to her given address that her hearing had been set in Boston\n\non a specific date in August.      When she failed to appear, the\n\nimmigration judge entered a removal order in absentia. 8 U.S.C. §§\n\n1227(a)(1)(B), 1229(b)(5)(A).\n\n          In February 2007, Shia asked the IJ to reopen the case,\n\nto rescind the removal order for lack of notice of the hearing and\n\nto allow her to apply for relief from removal.       A removal order\n\nentered in absentia \"may be rescinded only . . . if the alien\n\ndemonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance\n\nwith\" the statute.   8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).   Shia was obliged to\n\n\n                                -2-\n\ffurnish adequate grounds for reopening supported by affidavits or\n\nother evidence. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(B) (2006); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.23(b)(3) (2009).\n\n          Shia's request to reopen said that she had moved to New\n\nYork and had not received the notice of the August hearing but she\n\ndid not claim to have notified DHS of her change of address.      As\n\nfor the original notice to appear when notified, Shia admitted\n\nreceiving some documents from the immigration officer on December\n\n20, 2005 in her affidavit, but alleged in her motion that the\n\nsignature on the notice did not match her other signatures in the\n\nrecord.   Thereafter, the IJ entered a decision rejecting the\n\nrequest to reopen.\n\n          In his decision, the IJ noted that Shia had questioned\n\nthe signature on the notice to appear but had not explicitly denied\n\nreceiving the notice.    Lack of written notice can provide a basis\n\nfor reopening an in absentia order, In re M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349,\n\n352-53 (BIA 1998), but (the IJ said in his decision) Shia's\n\naffidavit said only that it was \"uncertain\" whether proper notice\n\nhad been given.      In light of the record showing service of the\n\nnotice, the IJ found the affidavit insufficient.    On review, the\n\nBIA upheld the IJ.\n\n          Shia now challenges the BIA's dismissal of her appeal of\n\nthe IJ's denial of the motion to reopen her removal proceeding.   We\n\nreview the denial to \"determine only whether it was arbitrary,\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fcapricious, or an abuse of discretion.\" Thomas v. I.N.S., 976 F.2d\n\n786, 789 (1st Cir. 1992).        As for the IJ's findings of fact, we\n\ntreat them as    \"conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would\n\nbe   compelled   to   conclude    to   the   contrary.\"   8    U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n           Shia argues on appeal that there is no affirmative proof\n\nthat the original notice to appear when summoned was in fact served\n\nupon her; but the record includes such a DHS document showing\n\npersonal service on her on the day of Shia's release from ICE\n\ncustody and was signed by the officer who served it.           She admits\n\nreceiving some DHS documents on that day and did not flatly deny in\n\nher affidavit that this was one of them.            Simply to point to\n\nconfusing signatures was not enough to require the IJ to reopen the\n\nhearing.\n\n           The notice to appear contains a blank space, which was\n\nnot filled in, designed to confirm that the recipient also received\n\noral notice in a language the recipient understood.           Leaving the\n\nspace blank, the government concedes, was a mistake by the officer\n\nwho completed the form. But the regulations say that this omission\n\ndoes not give the notified party rights, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(c)\n\n(2009), nor does Shia's affidavit explicitly deny receiving oral\n\nnotice or understanding it.\n\n           Shia claims that when she was originally released, she\n\ntold one of the ICE officers that she might be moving to New York.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fBut the notice is clear that she was expected to furnish a new\n\naddress if she moved from the one recorded by ICE, and informal\n\nnotice   of    an   intended   move   with   no   specified   address   hardly\n\nsatisfies the requirement. Shia does not claim that either then or\n\nthereafter did she furnish DHS with a new address.\n\n              The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
