William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Ralph J. Perrotta on brief for appellant.\n     Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart and Zechariah Chafee, Assistant United States Attorneys,\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             August 4, 2005\n\f      Per Curiam.      After his arrest along with a co-defendant in a\n\nguns-for-drugs sting operation, appellant Luis Olivera pled guilty\n\nto being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 924(g)(1) and (2).        On appeal, Olivera seeks to vacate\n\nhis sentence and requests remand for resentencing with new counsel.\n\n\n\n      In his opening brief, Olivera argues that his sentence was\n\ninvalid under Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), because\n\nthe   facts    that   supported   the    increase   in   his   sentence   under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(5) had not been submitted to a jury and proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.          While his appeal was pending, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).          Olivera declined our invitation\n\nto provide supplemental briefing in light of Booker.              Olivera has\n\nnot, therefore, sought resentencing under advisory guidelines.               We\n\nare left to consider his cursory argument that the district court\n\nengaged in impermissible judicial fact-finding, but, as we made\n\nclear in United States v. Antonakopolous, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), \"the Sixth Amendment is not violated simply because a judge\n\nfinds sentencing facts under the guidelines; rather, the error is\n\nonly that the judge did so pursuant to a mandatory guidelines\n\nsystem.\"      United States v. Martins, 2005 WL 1502939, *9 (1st Cir.\n\nJun. 27, 2005).       Therefore, we proceed directly to Olivera's other\n\narguments.     We review de novo the district court's interpretation\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fof the guidelines and find no error.       United States v. Whooten, 279\n\nF.3d 58, 60 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 913 (2002).\n\n     Olivera's   argument    that   a    guns-for-drugs   trade   does   not\n\nconstitute a \"use\" of a firearm was rejected by the United States\n\nSupreme Court in Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223 (1993)\n\n(construing 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)).        Similarly, Olivera's argument\n\nthat there was no \"connection\" between the firearms and the cocaine\n\nand that he never \"possessed\" the firearms* traded during the sting\n\noperation,   fights    the   tide   of    our   decisions   construing     §\n\n2K2.1(b)(5) and analogous guidelines.           E.g., United States v.\n\nPeterson, 223 F.3d 101, 111 (1st Cir. 2000)(\"in connection with\" in\n\n§ 2K2.1(b)(5) to be construed broadly and requires only \"causal or\n\nlogical sequence between possession and the related offense,\"\n\nquoting United States v. Ellis, 168 F.3d 558, 563 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nand citing United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (construing phrase \"in connection with\" in § 2K2.1(c)(2), we\n\nheld that \"[t]he guideline does not require that the defendant use\n\nthe firearm himself, or use the firearm in any particular way ...\n\nThe combination of firearms and drugs is common, and the guideline\n\nencompasses the many logical links which exist between the use of\n\nfirearms and drugs.\")).\n\n\n*Olivera argues for    the first time on appeal that he intended to\naccept just two, not   four guns in the trade that led to his arrest.\nWhatever his intent,   Olivera does not dispute that his co-defendant\nin fact traded the      cocaine for the four guns offered by the\ninformant.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f     \"Possession\" requires only that \"a certain nexus between the\n\nweapon and the offense must be shown ... [but] any possession –\n\nactual or constructive – can trigger the two-level increase.\"\n\nUnited   States   v.   McDonald,   121    F.3d   7,   10   (1st   Cir.   1997)\n\n(construing § 2D1.1(b)(1)).        See also United States v. Peterson,\n\n233 F.3d 101, 111 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"firearm has been used 'in\n\nconnection with' an offense 'if the possession has \"the potential\n\nto aid or facilitate\" the other crime,'\" quoting United States v.\n\nThompson, 32 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994), and United States v. Ellis,\n\n168 F.3d 558, 563 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n     On the present record and based on the facts admitted by\n\nOlivera, the district court was correct in attributing to Olivera\n\nboth the cocaine and the firearms possessed by his co-defendant in\n\nthis guns-for-drugs deal.     United States v. Bianco, 922 F.2d 910,\n\n913-14 (1st Cir. 1991) (reasonably foreseeable that co-defendant\n\nwould possess firearm); United States v. Aguilera-Zapata, 901 F.2d\n\n1209, 1215 (5th Cir. 1990) (same).\n\n     Finally, Olivera claims ineffective assistance of counsel at\n\nhis sentencing hearing in not vigorously challenging the number of\n\nfirearms.   As a general rule, we decline to consider ineffective\n\nassistance claims on direct appellate review.              United States v.\n\nMartinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d 245, 251 (1st Cir. 2003).                 See also\n\nMassaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 505 (2003); United States\n\nv. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1062-63 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"We have held with\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fa regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel cannot make their debut on\n\ndirect review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally\n\nbe presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\") (collecting\n\ncases). We discern no basis in this appeal for making an exception\n\nto this long-standing rule.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed, without\n\nprejudice to Olivera's right to raise his ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
