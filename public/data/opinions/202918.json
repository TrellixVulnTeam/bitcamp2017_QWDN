Nelson Aristud-Gonzalez was an\n\nemployee of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (\"the\n\nbank\").       He began work in 1999 as a payroll assistant and became a\n\npayroll manager in 2000.          When that promotion was revoked because\n\nthe bank had not followed merit procedures, he was made a special\n\nassistant to the bank president--a \"trust\" position subject to\n\nremoval at will. In September 2005, Aristud lost that position and\n\nwas given no other.\n\n               In 2003, while working as special assistant, Aristud\n\nbrought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000), charging that he had\n\nbeen       deprived   of   his   payroll   manager   position   based   on   his\n\npolitical affiliation; lack of a prior hearing (allegedly in\n\nviolation of his due process rights) was also alleged.1             The named\n\ndefendants were the bank, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico, and its then-president Hector Mendez-Vazquez.\n\n               The district court rejected the first amendment claim,\n\ndetermining that there was no evidence of improper political\n\nmotivation sufficient to justify a trial.            As to the lack of a pre-\n\ndeprivation hearing, the court held that under Puerto Rico law\n\nAristud had no property interest in his payroll manager job because\n\nthe appointment had been improper, Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co., 841\n\n\n\n       1\n      After Aristud was terminated in September 2005, he sought to\namend his federal complaint to include allegations arising from\nthat termination. The court did not permit the amendment, which\nwould have been Aristud's third.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fF.2d 1169, 1173 (1st Cir. 1988), and none in his subsequent \"trust\"\n\nposition as special assistant.   3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1465(2) (2006);\n\nGalloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Aristud had not sought relief implicating his original\n\nposition at the bank--a career position as payroll assistant--but\n\nthe district court's decision adverted to it as part of the\n\nchronology.   The district court noted that Aristud had secured the\n\npayroll manager job after losing the assistant position and that he\n\nhad lost the assistant position because it was classified as a job\n\nfor union members and Aristud had declined to join the union.\n\n           Following the dismissal of his section 1983 claims,\n\nAristud brought a new lawsuit in the Puerto Rico Superior Court.\n\nIn it, he sought to require the bank to reinstate him to his\n\noriginal career position as payroll assistant.          Again, Aristud\n\nalleged   political   discrimination   in   violation   of   the   First\n\nAmendment.2   The bank countered by moving in the original federal\n\naction for an injunction to bar Aristud from pursuing his new case;\n\nthe new case, argued the bank, was an attempt to re-litigate\n\nmatters foreclosed by the federal judgment.\n\n           The district court rejected the request.          In a brief\n\ndecision, the court said that it had power to protect its prior\n\n\n\n     2\n      He also sought reinstatement to this position under Puerto\nRico law--later reenacted in 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1465a(1)--\nproviding for reinstatement of career employees who are transferred\nto trust positions.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fjudgment; but it said \"substantial justification\" was needed to\n\ninterfere with state proceedings and that--because res judicata and\n\ncollateral estoppel defenses could be asserted in those state\n\nproceedings--there    was   no    irreparable    injury    and     an   adequate\n\nalternative remedy existed.         A motion for reconsideration was\n\ndenied.\n\n           The bank now appeals to this court, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in declining to enjoin the new\n\nstate court proceeding.     Abuse of discretion is the usual standard\n\napplied   in   reviewing    the   grant   or    denial    of   a    preliminary\n\ninjunction, although issues of law (reviewed de novo) and issues of\n\nfact (reviewed for clear error) can also arise.                    Water Keeper\n\nAlliance v. United States Dep't of Def., 271 F.3d 21, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    The bank makes arguments that could be classified in each\n\nof these categories.\n\n           Much of the bank's brief is devoted to an attempt to show\n\nthat the new state court suit is barred by findings made in the\n\nfederal action;3 the pertinent doctrine is collateral estoppel or\n\nissue preclusion.    The bank also argues that the new suit is barred\n\nby the doctrine that forbids claim splitting--merger and bar or\n\n\n\n     3\n      The bank asserts that two pertinent issues allegedly resolved\nin the first case will, based on the complaint and discovery\nmaterials in the second case, be at issue in the second: whether\nAristud lost his first job as payroll assistant because it was a\nunion job and he was not a member; and whether the bank had a\npolicy of discriminating against members of Aristud's party.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fclaim preclusion.    The latter is sometimes called res judicata but\n\nstrictly speaking both doctrines are branches of res judicata,\n\nwhich is the umbrella term.\n\n          Whether either issue or claim preclusion applies to limit\n\nor bar Aristud's new suit would take some sorting out.          Claim\n\npreclusion, especially in federal courts, has expanded in recent\n\ndecades from its long-time use to prevent re-litigation of the same\n\n\"cause of action\" to the barring of claims that were not brought\n\nearlier but grew out of the same nucleus of operative facts and\n\n\"should have been brought\" in the earlier action.       E.g., Porn v.\n\nNat'l Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 93 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          Issue preclusion doctrine has been more stable, in the\n\nrespects pertinent to this case, but normally does not bar a whole\n\nsuit but rather only re-litigation of specific facts earlier\n\nresolved and necessary to the original judgment.     Grella v. Salem\n\nFive Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1994).            Issue\n\npreclusion--unlike    the   more    rigid   rules   governing   claim\n\npreclusion--is also subject to various conditions and exceptions\n\nlaid out in the Restatement, treatises and case law.4    For example,\n\nit is far from clear that a description of how Aristud came to lose\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 28 (1982); 18 Wright,\nMiller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d §§\n4416, 4422, 4426 (2002 & Supp. 2007); Hoult v. Hoult, 157 F.3d 29,\n31 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting doctrine's various exceptions).\n\n                                   -6-\n\fhis first position was \"necessary\" to the judgment in the federal\n\nlawsuit.\n\n            Some overlap exists between Aristud's two lawsuits but we\n\nhave no intention of pursuing the issue--and for the same reason as\n\nthe district judge.       True, a federal court can issue an injunction\n\nto    protect    its   judgment;   this       is   a   conventional    ground    for\n\nequitable relief and an explicit exception to the Anti-Injunction\n\nAct, 28 U.S.C. § 2283, which otherwise limits the ability of\n\nfederal courts to derail state litigation.\n\n            However, the \"protect the judgment\" category covers more\n\nthan one type of case. For example, ancillary injunctive relief is\n\ncommon   where    a    defendant   has    failed       to   comply   with   a   prior\n\ninjunction.       E.g., Nat'l Law Ctr. on Homelessness & Poverty v.\n\nUnited States Veterans Admin., 765 F. Supp. 1, 6 (D.D.C. 1991).\n\nInjunctive relief incident to an interpleader action is also\n\ncommon--the whole purpose being to avoid inconsistent results in\n\nseparate lawsuits. E.g., Gen. Ry. Signal Co. v. Corcoran, 921 F.2d\n\n700, 707 (7th Cir. 1991).\n\n            By contrast, the need for an injunction barring a new\n\nlawsuit, where relief is sought solely on the ground that the claim\n\nhas    already    been   litigated       in    a   prior     action,   takes    more\n\njustification, De Cosme v. Sea Containers, Ltd., 874 F.2d 66, 68-69\n\n(1st Cir. 1989), and injunctive relief based on issue preclusion\n\nwould be even rarer.        Yes, the judge in the prior case knows the\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fscope of his own litigation, but the judge in the new case has the\n\nadvantage in assessing its scope.           And res judicata in both its\n\nforms turns on the relationship between two lawsuits.\n\n           Accordingly, many judges would take the view that, absent\n\nunusual circumstances, res judicata is just another defense that\n\nought to be asserted in the new lawsuit; and judges are even more\n\nlikely to take this view where, as here, the res judicata question\n\nis itself subject to debate and might not yield an all or nothing\n\nanswer.    We ourselves have said that substantial justification\n\nshould be provided for such intervention.              SMA Life Assurance Co.\n\nv. Sanchez-Pica, 960 F.2d 274, 277 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           No     doubt   some    cases     call       out    for   preemption:\n\nconsiderations might be the number and frequency of new suits,\n\nwhether they are obviously barred by res judicata, the burden\n\nimposed   by    re-litigation    in   a   far   away    or   unfriendly   venue,\n\nimproper motivations for the new suit or suits and the extent to\n\nwhich the res judicata issue turns on judgments that are clearly\n\nbetter able to be made by the first judge.             Courts have adverted to\n\nsuch concerns to inform their discretion.5\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Harrelson v. United States, 613 F.2d 114, 116 (5th Cir. 1980)\n(possible use to bar repetitive suits where litigants are harassing\ntheir opponents); In re Louisiana-Pacific Inner Seal Siding Litig.,\n234 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1180 (D. Or. 2002) (risk that multiple state\ncourt suits would be instituted against defendant); Walter E.\nHeller & Co., Inc. v. Cox, 379 F. Supp. 299, 309-10 (S.D.N.Y. 1974)\n(litigant subjected to fifteen repetitive suits over nine years).\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           This case has nothing that leaps out as a reason for\n\ntaking the res judicata issues away from the local court--let alone\n\nreasons so compelling that we would think that the district court\n\nhad abused its discretion.     The bank criticizes the district judge\n\nfor failing to spell out his calculations; but the considerations\n\nso plainly supported a decision to leave the matter to the local\n\ncourt that no one needed further explanation and the appeal,\n\nalthough not technically frivolous, is hopeless.\n\n           The district judge spoke both of a lack of irreparable\n\ninjury   and   of   an   available   remedy    of   urging   res   judicata\n\ndefensively in the new lawsuit.        The    bank says that the defense\n\nagainst the new lawsuit will cost time and money and that this\n\ncounts as irreparable injury; it does not address the adequate\n\nremedy issue but conceivably could argue that it would cost more to\n\nlitigate in the new case.\n\n           Courts sometimes treat the cost of further litigation as\n\nan important equitable consideration, sometimes say it is not\n\nirreparable injury, and sometimes disregard irreparable injury as\n\na requirement where someone seeks to re-litigate a previously\n\ndecided issue.6     Possibly there is some pattern to this contrariety\n\n\n     6\n      Compare Ballenger v. Mobil Oil Corp., 138 Fed. Appx. 615, 622\n(5th Cir. 2005) (\"No independent demonstration of irreparable harm\nor a lack of alternative remedies is necessary to win an injunction\nunder the relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.\"),\nwith In re SDDS, Inc., 97 F.3d 1030, 1041 (8th Cir. 1996) (the cost\nof relitigation constitutes irreparable harm), and with FDIC v.\nBank of N.Y., 479 F. Supp. 2d 1, 19 (D.D.C. 2007) (cost of\n\n                                     -9-\n\fof   statements;   not   all   litigation   expenses   are   the   same   in\n\nmagnitude or certainty or symmetry as between alternative forums.\n\n           In all events, the Puerto Rico courts are an alternative\n\nforum and any assumption that it would cost less to decide the res\n\njudicata issue in the district court is unsupported.           If the res\n\njudicata issue can be easily resolved, the local court can do that.\n\nAnd, to the extent that res judicata has some application but does\n\nnot end the local litigation, only one court need tackle the\n\nproblem rather than two.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nrepetitive litigation an equitable consideration), and with SMA\nLife Assurance, 960 F.2d at 277 (defendant had not demonstrated\nirreparable harm or an inadequate remedy).\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

Sanchez-Pica,</i> 960 F.2d 274, 277 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>No doubt some cases call out for preemption: considerations might be the number and frequency of new suits, whether they are obviously barred by res judicata, the burden imposed by re-litigation in a far away or unfriendly venue, improper motivations for the new suit or suits and the extent to which the res judicata issue turns on judgments that are clearly better able to be made by the first judge. Courts have adverted to such concerns to inform their discretion.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>This case has nothing that leaps out as a reason for taking the res judicata issues away from the local courtlet alone reasons so compelling that we would think that the district court had abused its discretion. The bank criticizes the district judge for failing to spell out his calculations; but the considerations so plainly supported a decision to leave the matter to the local court that no one needed further explanation and the appeal, although not technically frivolous, is hopeless.</p>\n<p>The district judge spoke both of a lack of irreparable injury and of an available remedy of urging res judicata defensively in the new lawsuit. The bank says that the defense against the new lawsuit will cost time and money and that this counts as irreparable injury; it does not address the adequate remedy issue but conceivably could argue that it would cost more to litigate in the new case.</p>\n<p>Courts sometimes treat the cost of further litigation as an important equitable consideration, sometimes say it is not irreparable injury, and sometimes disregard irreparable injury as a requirement where someone seeks to re-litigate a previously decided issue.<sup>[6]</sup> Possibly there is some pattern to this contrariety of statements; not all litigation expenses are the same in magnitude or certainty or symmetry as between alternative forums.</p>\n<p>In all events, the Puerto Rico courts are an alternative forum and any assumption that it would cost less to decide the res judicata issue in the district court is unsupported. If the res judicata issue can be easily resolved, the local court can do that. And, to the extent that res judicata has some application but does not end the local litigation, only one court need tackle the problem rather than two.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  After Aristud was terminated in September 2005, he sought to amend his federal complaint to include allegations arising from that termination.

He began work in 1999 as a payroll assistant and became a payroll manager in 2000. When that promotion was revoked because the bank had not followed merit procedures, he was made a special assistant to the bank president-a \"trust\" position subject to removal at will. In September 2005, Aristud lost that position and was given no other.</p>\n<p>In 2003, while working as special assistant, Aristud brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000), charging that he had been deprived of his payroll manager position based on his political affiliation; lack of a prior hearing (allegedly in violation of his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> due process rights) was also alleged.<sup>[1]</sup> The named defendants were the bank, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and its then-president Hector Mendez-Vazquez.</p>\n<p>The district court rejected the first amendment claim, determining that there was no evidence of improper political motivation sufficient to justify a trial. As to the lack of a pre-deprivation hearing, the court held that under Puerto Rico law Aristud had no property interest in his payroll manager job because the appointment had been improper, <i>Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503066\"><a href=\"/opinion/503066/bessie-a-kauffman-v-puerto-rico-telephone-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1173 (1st Cir.1988), and none in his subsequent \"trust\" position as special assistant. 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1465(2) (2006); <i>Galloza v. Foy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201328\"><a href=\"/opinion/201328/galloza-gonzalez-v-foy/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Aristud had not sought relief implicating his original position at the banka career position as payroll assistantbut the district court's decision adverted to it as part of the chronology. The district court noted that Aristud had secured the payroll manager job after losing the assistant position and that he had lost the assistant position because it was classified as a job for union members and Aristud had declined to join the union.</p>\n<p>Following the dismissal of his section 1983 claims, Aristud brought a new lawsuit in the Puerto Rico Superior Court. In it, he sought to require the bank to reinstate him to his original career position as payroll assistant. Again, Aristud alleged political discrimination in violation of the First Amendment.<sup>[2]</sup> The bank countered by moving in the original federal action for an injunction to bar Aristud from pursuing his new case; the new case, argued the bank, was an attempt to re-litigate matters foreclosed by the federal judgment.</p>\n<p>The district court rejected the request. In a brief decision, the court said that it had power to protect its prior judgment; but it said \"substantial justification\" was needed to interfere with state proceedings and thatbecause res judicata and collateral estoppel defenses could be asserted in those state proceedingsthere was no irreparable injury and an adequate alternative remedy existed. A motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p>The bank now appeals to this court, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in declining to enjoin the new state court proceeding. Abuse of discretion is the usual standard applied in reviewing the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction, although issues of law (reviewed <i>de novo</i>) and issues of fact (reviewed for clear error) can also arise. <i>Water Keeper Alliance v. United States Dep't of Def.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199678\"><a href=\"/opinion/199678/water-keeper-allianc-v-dept-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 2001). The bank makes arguments that could be classified in each of these categories.</p>\n<p>Much of the bank's brief is devoted to an attempt to show that the new state court suit is barred by findings made in the federal action;<sup>[3]</sup> the pertinent doctrine is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> collateral estoppel or issue preclusion. The bank also argues that the new suit is barred by the doctrine that forbids claim splittingmerger and bar or claim preclusion. The latter is sometimes called res judicata but strictly speaking both doctrines are branches of res judicata, which is the umbrella term.</p>\n<p>Whether either issue or claim preclusion applies to limit or bar Aristud's new suit would take some sorting out. Claim preclusion, especially in federal courts, has expanded in recent decades from its long-time use to prevent re-litigation of the same \"cause of action\" to the barring of claims that were not brought earlier but grew out of the same nucleus of operative facts and \"should have been brought\" in the earlier action. <i>E.g., </i><i>Porn v. Nat'l Grange Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196943\"><a href=\"/opinion/196943/porn-v-national-grange/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>Issue preclusion doctrine has been more stable, in the respects pertinent to this case, but normally does not bar a whole suit but rather only re-litigation of specific facts earlier resolved and necessary to the original judgment. <i>Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684074\"><a href=\"/opinion/684074/paul-j-grella-trustee-v-salem-five-cent-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 1994). Issue preclusionunlike the more rigid rules governing claim preclusionis also subject to various conditions and exceptions laid out in the Restatement, treatises and case law.<sup>[4]</sup> For example, it is far from clear that a description of how Aristud came to lose his first position was \"necessary\" to the judgment in the federal lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Some overlap exists between Aristud's two lawsuits but we have no intention of pursuing the issueand for the same reason as the district judge. True, a federal court can issue an injunction to protect its judgment; this is a conventional ground for equitable relief and an explicit exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2283, which otherwise limits the ability of federal courts to derail state litigation.</p>\n<p>However, the \"protect the judgment\" category covers more than one type of case. For example, ancillary injunctive relief is common where a defendant has failed to comply with a prior injunction. <i>E.g., </i><i>Nat'l Law Ctr. on Homelessness &amp; Poverty v. United States Veterans Admin.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351172\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351172/national-law-center-v-us-veterans-admin/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (D.D.C.1991). Injunctive relief incident to an interpleader action is also commonthe whole purpose being to avoid inconsistent results in separate lawsuits. <i>E.g., </i><i>Gen. Ry. Signal Co. v. Corcoran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553224\"><a href=\"/opinion/553224/general-railway-signal-company-v-james-p-corcoran-superintendent-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span>, 707 (7th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>By contrast, the need for an injunction barring a new lawsuit, where relief is sought solely on the ground that the claim has already been litigated in a prior action, takes more justification, <i>De Cosme v. Sea Containers, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522868\"><a href=\"/opinion/522868/benita-sanchez-vda-de-cosme-v-sea-containers-ltd-appeal-of-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 68-69 (1st Cir.1989), and injunctive relief based on issue preclusion would be even rarer. Yes, the judge in the prior case knows the scope of his own litigation, but the judge in the new case has the advantage in assessing its scope. And res judicata in both its forms turns on the relationship between two lawsuits.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, many judges would take the view that, absent unusual circumstances, res judicata is just another defense that ought to be asserted in the new lawsuit; and judges are even more likely to take this view where, as here, the res <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> judicata question is itself subject to debate and might not yield an all or nothing answer. We ourselves have said that substantial justification should be provided for such intervention. <i>SMA Life Assurance Co. v. Sanchez-Pica,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580703\"><a href=\"/opinion/580703/sma-life-assurance-company-v-antonio-sanchez-pica/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 277 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>No doubt some cases call out for preemption: considerations might be the number and frequency of new suits, whether they are obviously barred by res judicata, the burden imposed by re-litigation in a far away or unfriendly venue, improper motivations for the new suit or suits and the extent to which the res judicata issue turns on judgments that are clearly better able to be made by the first judge.
