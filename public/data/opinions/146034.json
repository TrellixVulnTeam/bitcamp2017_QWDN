This Petroleum Practices Marketing\n\nAct suit is between the plaintiff, Shell Company (Puerto Rico)\n\nLimited (\"Shell\"), and defendant, the Los Frailes Service Station,\n\nInc. (\"LFSS\"), which owned and operated the Los Frailes gasoline\n\nservice station in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico as a Shell franchisee\n\nfrom 1997 until 2003.    Shell terminated LFSS's franchise, and this\n\nappeal by LFSS primarily concerns the permanent injunction awarding\n\nShell   relief    against     LFSS     and   the   dismissal   of   LFSS's\n\ncounterclaims.    The complications in this case arise from LFSS's\n\ndual status as the owner of the service station and surrounding\n\nproperty, in which capacity it leased the property to Shell, and as\n\na retailer-franchisee, in which capacity LFSS subleased the service\n\nstation from Shell to operate it.\n\n          Since    December    2003,    when   Shell   first   obtained   a\n\npreliminary injunction, LFSS has been ordered to cease using\n\nShell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns; to comply with\n\nall post-termination contractual provisions; and to \"immediately\n\nsurrender the station in question, the storage tanks and all\n\npertinent equipment to Shell, in order for Shell to designate a\n\nthird party to operate the same.\"       The Shell Co.

Dec. 2, 2003).\n\n          On January 23, 2007, the district court granted Shell\n\nsummary judgment on LFSS's counterclaims. See The Shell Co. (P.R.)\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fLtd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc. (Shell II), 551 F. Supp. 2d\n\n127,       134    (D.P.R.     2007).       The    district    court    converted    the\n\npreliminary injunction to a permanent injunction on January 29,\n\n2007, ordering and compelling LFSS to cease any use of Shell\n\ntrademarks, trade dress, or color patterns, to comply with the\n\npost-termination provisions of its franchise agreements with Shell,\n\nand, in addition, to allow Shell \"to continue in possession of the\n\nLos Frailes Service Station, along with the subterraneous storage\n\ntanks      and     all   pertinent       equipment,   until     the    expiration    of\n\n[Shell's] rights under the lease agreement between the parties,\"\n\nset to expire in 2014.

Jan. 31, 2007).1               In the same order, the district court\n\ndenied LFSS's motion to reconsider its grant of summary judgment to\n\nShell on LFSS's counterclaims and dismissed LFSS's breach of\n\ncontract counterclaim for failure to prosecute.                       Id. at 1-2.    In\n\nthe meantime, LFSS has gone through bankruptcy, and Shell has\n\nchanged          its   name   to   Sol    Puerto    Rico     Limited    following   an\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The district court later issued an amended order\nclarifying that Shell was entitled to injunctive relief only under\nSection 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), to compel\nLFSS to stop further use of Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and\ncolor patterns. See The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv.\nStation, Inc. (Shell V), No. 03-1623, slip op. at 1-2 (D.P.R. Dec.\n30, 2008) (amended judgment); The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los\nFrailes Serv.

Supp. 2d. 193, 201-\n03, 205 (D.P.R. 2008) (opinion and order).\n\n                                            -3-\n\facquisition and share purchase in 2006.2           See Shell IV, 596 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 196 n.1.       Shell has been in control of the property\n\nsince 2003.\n\n           LFSS appeals from various provisions of the permanent\n\ninjunction, the grant of summary judgment to Shell on LFSS's\n\nfederal   and    state   law   counterclaims   against   Shell,    and   the\n\ndismissal of LFSS's state law breach of contract counterclaim with\n\nprejudice (for failure to prosecute).          We hold that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by enjoining LFSS from further\n\nuse of Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns under\n\nSection 43(a) of the Lanham Act.      We further hold that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by compelling LFSS to comply\n\nwith the post-termination provisions of its franchise agreements\n\nwith Shell.     The district court did, however, abuse its discretion\n\nby extending the injunction to compel LFSS \"to allow [Shell] to\n\ncontinue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station . . .\n\nuntil the expiration of [Shell]'s rights under the lease agreement\n\nbetween the parties\" in 2014.      Shell III, slip op. at 2.      We vacate\n\nthat provision of the injunction, without prejudice to Shell's\n\nseeking further injunctive relief at a future date.         We also hold\n\nthat the district court properly granted Shell summary judgment on\n\n\n\n     2\n          In order to accurately describe the parties' interactions\nand the events leading up to this suit, all of which occurred\nbefore the merger, we refer to the plaintiff as \"Shell\" throughout\nand discuss the significance of the merger where relevant.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fLFSS's counterclaims and that there was no abuse of discretion in\n\ndismissing LFSS's breach of contract counterclaim for failure to\n\nprosecute.\n\n                         I. Factual Background\n\n            The   following   facts    are   either   uncontested   or   were\n\nstipulated by the parties.\n\n            The gasoline service station located at the corner of\n\nState Road 177 and Muró Street in the Los Frailes area of Guaynabo\n\nhas long been one of the busiest in the region.             LFSS has owned\n\nthis station and the property surrounding it since 1977.                 For\n\nseveral decades, LFSS sold Shell-brand gasoline as an independent\n\nretailer under a lease arrangement with Shell.              In 1997, LFSS\n\nbecame a Shell franchisee.\n\n            Three contracts, all signed on April 11, 1997, defined\n\nthe franchise relationship between Shell and LFSS: an amended lease\n\nagreement, a retailer/sublease agreement, and a trademark and\n\nequipment agreement.\n\n            The amended lease agreement extended Shell's 1992 lease\n\nof the service station and its surrounding property until February\n\n28, 2014.    The \"primary and essential purpose\" of the lease was to\n\nmaintain a service station there, and, under the amended lease,\n\nShell did not need LFSS's permission to sublease the station to a\n\nthird party retailer to operate.        In exchange for this leasehold,\n\nShell agreed to pay graduated rent to LFSS based on the number of\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fgallons of gasoline the retailer (whether LFSS or a third party)\n\nbought from Shell each month.\n\n            Under       the   retailer/sublease         agreement,       Shell     then\n\nsubleased    the     station    back    to     LFSS    to    operate    as   a     Shell\n\nfranchisee.       As a Shell franchisee, LFSS had the right to operate\n\nthe station under the Shell name, as an exclusive retailer of\n\nShell-brand petroleum products.                 In exchange, LFSS agreed to\n\ncertain obligations, including to purchase a minimum average of\n\n300,000 gallons of fuel from Shell each month, to pay for Shell\n\nproducts on time each month on the check or credit terms set by\n\nShell, to keep the station open and running during its hours of\n\noperation, and to operate the station for the exclusive purpose of\n\nselling only Shell-brand products.\n\n            The trademark and equipment agreement governed LFSS's\n\nexclusive use of Shell trademarks and of equipment Shell provided\n\nto   LFSS   and    also   set   out    LFSS's    maintenance,         inventory,    and\n\ndelivery obligations.         This agreement recognized Shell's ownership\n\nof the underground storage tanks and other equipment at the station\n\nand gave LFSS the right to use this equipment only to sell and\n\nstore Shell-brand fuel when operating the station.\n\n            These three agreements also included important provisions\n\ngoverning     when      the   agreements     could     be     terminated     and    the\n\nconsequences       of     termination.           The        parties    contest      the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\finterpretation of many of these provisions, and we discuss them\n\nfurther below.\n\n             From 1997 to 2000, LFSS operated the Los Frailes station\n\nas a Shell station under the terms of these agreements.           Beginning\n\nin   2000,   the   parties   made    several    amendments   to   the   lease\n\nagreement.    A February 15, 2001, amendment, at issue in this case,\n\ngave LFSS a temporary rent benefit from Shell to encourage a higher\n\nvolume of gasoline sales.3     Under the amendment, this rent benefit\n\nwould automatically continue every month unless Shell notified LFSS\n\notherwise in writing.\n\n             On July 2, 2001, Shell informed LFSS and its other\n\nPuerto Rican franchisees that it was implementing a Competitive\n\nAdjustment Program (CAP), and LFSS agreed to participate.                The\n\nprogram established certain price zones for retailers and set\n\nmaximum retail prices for Shell's retailers in those zones.               In\n\nexchange, the CAP gave retailers discounts on wholesale fuel\n\nprices, again based on those zones.            Following an investigation,\n\nthe Puerto Rico Department of Justice ordered Shell to cease the\n\nCAP program on January 30, 2004, on the ground that it violated\n\nPuerto Rican antitrust law.         Shell complied.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          Specifically, in addition to the rent specified in the\nlease, Shell agreed to pay LFSS an additional $0.02 per gallon for\nthe first 480,000 gallons sold, and an additional $0.03 per gallon\nfor every gallon over 490,000 that LFSS sold.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           LFSS participated in the CAP for the duration of its\n\nfranchise with Shell.    Though LFSS now contests whether the CAP\n\ndisplaced the temporary rent benefit Shell implemented in February\n\n2001, LFSS does not contest the district court's factual finding\n\nthat LFSS sent Shell an April 9, 2002 letter proposing \"a temporary\n\nadjustment in rent for LFSS as we had in the first quarter of last\n\nyear.\"   We discuss the CAP in further detail below.\n\n           By early 2003, LFSS was suffering from cash flow problems\n\nand so did not pay for more than $80,000 worth of Shell's fuel\n\ndeliveries.   Shell, pursuant to the retailer/sublease agreement,\n\nalso implemented a hard cash payment policy and required LFSS to\n\npay for Shell products by certified check at delivery.\n\n           During the weekend of May 17 and 18, 2003, LFSS instead\n\ntried to pay for two deliveries with personal checks.    On Monday,\n\nMay 19, Shell told LFSS that until LFSS paid for the weekend\n\ndeliveries with certified checks, Shell would not make any further\n\ndeliveries. LFSS did not comply; there were no further deliveries,\n\nLFSS ran out of fuel to sell, and the station temporarily closed.\n\nThat same day, May 19, LFSS sent Shell a letter stating that Shell\n\nhad not paid the February 2001 additional rent benefit since July\n\n2001 (when the CAP went into effect), that Shell had not sent\n\nwritten notice of its cancellation, and that Shell therefore\n\nimmediately owed the balance of the additional rent from July 2001\n\nuntil April 2003.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f             On May 21, 2003, LFSS sent Shell a letter purportedly\n\ncancelling their entire commercial relationship, including the\n\nlease, citing Shell's alleged failure to pay LFSS the additional\n\nrent and its alleged obligation to deliver fuel to LFSS.           LFSS then\n\npurchased fuel from other refiners and distributors, covered some\n\nbut not all of the Shell trademarks at the station, and began\n\nselling non-Shell-brand fuel. LFSS also put up signs saying \"We Do\n\nNot   Sell   Shell   Gasoline.\"       The   signs   were   not   prominently\n\ndisplayed.\n\n             On May 23, 2003, Shell informed LFSS by letter that it\n\nwas terminating LFSS's franchise, which Shell said terminated the\n\nretailer/sublease agreement and trademarks and equipment agreement\n\nbut not the underlying lease agreement under which Shell leased the\n\nproperty from LFSS.       Shell said that LFSS's termination of the\n\nlease was invalid because LFSS had not complied with the lease\n\ntermination provisions.       Shell then demanded that LFSS honor its\n\nobligations     under   the   lease   and   under   the    post-termination\n\nprovisions of the retailer/sublease and equipment and trademark\n\nagreements by immediately vacating the service station premises and\n\nturning over Shell's equipment.\n\n             LFSS instead continued to operate the service station by\n\nselling non-Shell-brand fuel at the service station.             Shell then\n\nbrought assorted federal and state law claims against LFSS in the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ffederal district court of Puerto Rico less than two weeks later, on\n\nJune 3, 2003, eventually culminating in this appeal.\n\n                           II. The Parties' Claims\n\n             Before delving into the legal analysis, we summarize\n\nShell and LFSS's respective claims and counterclaims.\n\n             Shell's      claims   against       LFSS     proceed      from     Shell's\n\ncontention that it validly terminated LFSS's franchise on May 23,\n\n2003.     Shell says it was entitled to do so under the Petroleum\n\nMarketing Practices Act (\"PMPA\"), 15 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq., a\n\nfederal law that regulates franchisors' termination of franchises,\n\nbecause    of    LFSS's    failure    to   pay    for     fuel     deliveries,     its\n\nunreasonable closing of the station, and its sale of non-Shell fuel\n\nwhile displaying Shell trademarks.\n\n             Shell claims LFSS's post-termination actions violated\n\nShell's rights in two respects.                 First, Shell says that LFSS\n\ncreated a likelihood that consumers would be confused or deceived\n\nwhen it sold non-Shell products while displaying Shell trademarks,\n\nin   violation    of   Section     43(a)   of    the     Lanham    Act,   15    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1125(a).      On this basis, Shell requested, and the district court\n\ngranted,     injunctive      relief   to     stop       LFSS    from    using     Shell\n\ntrademarks, trade dress, or color patterns.                    See Shell IV, 596 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 203-05; Shell I, slip op. at 29-31.\n\n             Second, Shell says its termination of the franchise left\n\nits underlying lease of the station from LFSS intact.                            Shell\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\ffurther claimed that LFSS's refusal to vacate the premises and to\n\nallow Shell to exercise its property rights over the station as a\n\nlessor violated the terms of the lease, as well as various post-\n\ntermination provisions in the retailer/sublease and trademark and\n\nequipment agreements requiring LFSS to relinquish possession of the\n\nstation.   This was the district court's basis for compelling LFSS\n\nto comply with all post-termination contractual provisions and for\n\nthe separate provision of the injunction allowing Shell to remain\n\nin possession of the service station until the expiration of its\n\nlease in 2014.    See Shell I, slip op. at 27-29, 32-34.\n\n           LFSS makes several arguments as to why the district court\n\nabused its discretion in granting Shell a permanent injunction.\n\nLFSS   first   claims   that   it    validly   terminated   all   contracts,\n\nincluding the lease, on May 21, 2003, two days before Shell\n\npurportedly terminated the franchise.           In the alternative, LFSS\n\nsays, Shell's termination of the franchise was not valid under the\n\nPMPA, and the district court erred in finding otherwise.\n\n           LFSS further argues that the district court erred in\n\ngranting injunctive relief.         It contests the injunction on Shell's\n\nLanham Act claim, urging that the evidence was contradictory and\n\ninsufficient to support a likelihood of confusion.           In any event,\n\nLFSS says, Shell is not entitled to the specific remedy of an\n\ninjunction to enforce the lease, which gives Shell possession until\n\n2014, whether under the PMPA or any of Shell's other claims, and\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthe district court erred in finding otherwise.              This last issue is\n\npotentially the most difficult in the case, raising questions about\n\nthe scope of injunctive relief available to franchisors under the\n\nPMPA.\n\n           LFSS   also    argues     that    the   district   court    erred   in\n\ngranting Shell summary judgment on LFSS's counterclaim that Shell's\n\nCAP program violated federal and Puerto Rican antitrust law.\n\nSpecifically, LFSS argues that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion by striking LFSS's cross-motion for summary judgment and\n\ndenying its motion for reconsideration.                  Its main substantive\n\nchallenge, however, is that the district court erroneously made\n\nfactual inferences in Shell's favor when granting summary judgment\n\nto Shell on LFSS's antitrust claims and that there were material\n\nissues of fact precluding summary judgment. Finally, LFSS says the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by dismissing its state law\n\nbreach of contract counterclaim for failure to prosecute, because,\n\nLFSS insists, it diligently asserted this claim.\n\n           We analyze LFSS's challenges to the permanent injunction,\n\nsummary   judgment,      and    dismissal    of    its   breach   of   contract\n\ncounterclaim in turn.          We vacate only the portion of the district\n\ncourt's injunction allowing Shell to continue in possession of the\n\nLos Frailes service station until 2014, when its lease expires, and\n\nwe affirm the district court's judgment on all other grounds.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f                  III. Shell's Claims against LFSS\n\n           We   review   a   district   court's   grant   of   a   permanent\n\ninjunction for abuse of discretion; we review its underlying\n\nconclusions of law de novo and any factual findings for clear\n\nerror.4   García-Rubiera v. Calderón, 570 F.3d 443, 455-56 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n           A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction before a\n\ndistrict court must ordinarily show: \"(1) that it has suffered an\n\nirreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as\n\nmonetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3)\n\nthat, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff\n\nand defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the\n\npublic interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\"\n\neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006); see\n\nalso CoxCom, Inc. v. Chaffee, 536 F.3d 101, 112 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nLFSS's claims of error cut across these criteria.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          LFSS's argument that the district court could not convert\nthe preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction without an\nevidentiary hearing fails.      The district court converted the\npreliminary injunction into a permanent injunction only after\nissuing a show cause order to LFSS, and only after determining that\nLFSS had not advanced any new evidence or legal arguments beyond\nwhat it had presented at the preliminary injunction hearing. Under\nthose circumstances, an evidentiary hearing would have served\nlittle purpose, and the district court's conversion was not error.\nSee HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc., 847\nF.2d 908, 915 (1st Cir. 1988); cf. United States v. Owens, 54 F.3d\n271, 276-77 (6th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                   -13-\n\fA.        LFSS's Purported Termination of the Lease Agreement\n\n          LFSS's primary argument on appeal is that LFSS validly\n\nterminated its lease of the Los Frailes station to Shell on May 21,\n\n2003, and that the district court therefore erred by granting Shell\n\nan injunction that gave Shell possession of the service station.\n\n          We reject this argument; LFSS's attempt to terminate the\n\nlease on May 21 was plainly invalid.5    Even assuming dubitante that\n\nShell had defaulted on its lease obligations, article 17 of the\n\nlease provided that LFSS could terminate the lease in the event of\n\ndefault only after a sixty-day curative period.       LFSS admits that\n\nits May 21, 2003, letter of termination cited Shell's purported\n\nbreaches as the grounds for termination and did not comply with the\n\nsixty-day curative requirement.\n\n          Instead, LFSS claims that a different part of the lease\n\nagreement, article 7, authorized LFSS to terminate the lease with\n\nShell immediately, without any sixty-day curative period, on the\n\nsole condition that LFSS pay Shell for the cost of the improvements\n\nand alterations Shell had made to the station, less depreciation.\n\n          Because   LFSS   only   developed   this   interpretation   of\n\narticle 7 at oral argument and not in its briefs, this argument is\n\n\n\n     5\n          The parties have not briefed the question of whether this\ncourt is, in any event, bound by the bankruptcy court's\ndetermination that the lease remained in effect and Shell retained\nall its rights as a lessor under that agreement, though the\ndistrict court relied on that judgment in rejecting LFSS's claims\nbelow. See Shell III, slip op. at 3.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fwaived. See Mass. Museum of Contemporary Art Found. v. Büchel, 593\n\nF.3d 38, 65 (1st Cir. 2010).      Even if the argument were properly\n\nbefore this court, it would fail.         Article 7 states in relevant\n\npart that \"[i]f this lease is terminated before the expiration of\n\nits term . . . for causes attributable to [LFSS],\" LFSS, \"in\n\naddition to any other remedy under the contract,\" must \"immediately\n\npay [Shell] an amount equivalent to the amount not depreciated (or\n\namortized) of the improvements and permanent alterations made by\n\n[Shell] in the Property, in the Station or in the surrounding\n\nareas.\"   This is plainly a liquidated damages provision addressing\n\nthe consequences of termination, not the conditions under which the\n\nparties could terminate the agreement.         It cannot be construed as\n\nan open-ended alternative to the limitations on termination set out\n\nin article 17.\n\nB.          Shell's PMPA Claim\n\n            In the alternative, LFSS argues that the district court\n\nerred in concluding as a matter of law that Shell's termination of\n\nLFSS's    franchise   complied   with    the   PMPA.    Absent   a   valid\n\ntermination, LFSS suggests, Shell suffered no irreparable injury,\n\nsince Shell's asserted harms arose from LFSS's alleged failure to\n\ncomply with the consequences of franchise termination.               Those\n\nconsequences include the loss of LFSS's right to use Shell's\n\ntrademarks and equipment and to sublease and operate the service\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fstation.   This argument also fails; we reject its assumption that\n\nShell's termination was invalid.\n\n           The    PMPA,    enacted       in     1978,    addressed        franchisors'\n\n\"allegedly unfair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the\n\npetroleum industry\" by \"establish[ing] minimum federal standards\n\ngoverning the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum franchises.\"\n\nMac's Shell Serv., Inc. v. Shell Oil Prods. Co. LLC, 130 S. Ct.\n\n1251, 1255 (2010).     Under provisions of the PMPA, franchisors can\n\nterminate or fail to renew a franchise \"only if the franchisor\n\nprovides written notice and takes the action in question for a\n\nreason specifically recognized in the statute.\"                    Id.6\n\n           Reasons recognized in the statute for termination include\n\n\"[t]he occurrence of an event which is . . . relevant to the\n\nfranchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the\n\nfranchise . . . is reasonable.\"               15 U.S.C. § 2802(b)(2)(C).               The\n\nPMPA explicitly includes \"failure by the franchisee to pay the\n\nfranchisor in a timely manner,\" id. § 2802(c)(8), \"failure by the\n\nfranchisee   to    operate        the   marketing       premises   for     .   .   .   an\n\nunreasonable      period     of     time\"     under     the   circumstances,           id.\n\n§   2802(c)(9)(B),     and        \"willful      adulteration,      mislabeling         or\n\nmisbranding of motor fuels or other trademark violations of the\n\nfranchisee,\" id. § 2802(c)(10), as examples of such events.\n\n\n\n     6\n          It is clear, and LFSS does not contest, that Shell\nprovided adequate written notice of the termination here.\n\n                                         -16-\n\f              LFSS does not contest that it failed to make payments on\n\ntime, temporarily closed the station, and sold non-Shell-brand\n\nfuel. Rather, it argues that the PMPA requires courts to determine\n\nwhether   a    termination   based   on     these   events    was   objectively\n\nreasonable under the circumstances, not just whether an event\n\nlisted under § 2802(c) technically occurred.                 The circumstances\n\nhere, LFSS says, made Shell's termination unreasonable, because the\n\ncash flow problems leading to these three events were caused by\n\nShell's alleged violation of antitrust laws and its purported\n\nfailure to pay LFSS the temporary rent benefit Shell agreed to in\n\nFebruary 2001. Those two allegations are also the basis for LFSS's\n\ncounterclaims against Shell.\n\n              The district court rejected this argument, holding as a\n\nmatter of law that Shell's termination of the franchise was per se\n\nreasonable because the termination was based on those three,\n\nexplicitly listed statutory grounds for termination.                See Shell I,\n\nslip op. at 19-21.      The district court's reasoning suggested that\n\nthe termination was valid even under an objective reasonableness\n\nstandard.      It found that LFSS's claim that Shell's nonpayment of\n\nthe rent benefit caused LFSS's cash flow problems lacked merit\n\nbecause of LFSS's April 2002 admission in its letter to Shell that\n\nthe February 2001 rent benefit was no longer in effect.               Id. at 22.\n\n              We need not evaluate the wisdom of a per se rule that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\ftermination is reasonable if an event listed in § 2802(c) occurs.7\n\nLFSS       could   not    prevail    even    if    we    reviewed     whether   Shell's\n\ntermination was objectively reasonable. The district court did not\n\nclearly err in finding that the February 2001 rent benefit was\n\ntemporary,         long   since     terminated,         and   could   not   have   been\n\nresponsible for LFSS's May 2003 cash flow problems.                      In any event,\n\nuncontested record evidence shows that LFSS's cash flow problems,\n\nculminating in its inability to pay Shell for deliveries, had a\n\nnumber of causes unrelated to Shell's actions with respect to the\n\n\n\n\n       7\n          The district court's interpretation of the PMPA reflects\nthe law of this circuit: if any of the events listed in § 2802(c)\noccur, \"termination is conclusively presumed to be reasonable as a\nmatter of law.\" Desfosses v. Wallace Energy, Inc., 836 F.2d 22, 26\n(1st Cir. 1987).   At least one other circuit also adopted this\nrule. See Hinkleman v. Shell Oil Co., 962 F.2d 372, 377 (4th Cir.\n1992) (per curiam). But see Patel v. Sun Co., Inc., 141 F.3d 447,\n456-57 (3d Cir. 1998) (\"There is no question that at least some of\nthe § 2802(c) relevant event exceptions mandate some form of\njudicial scrutiny.\"); Marathon Petroleum Co. v. Pendleton, 889 F.2d\n1509, 1512 (6th Cir. 1989) (suggesting that all terminations for\nevents listed in § 2802(c) are subject to judicial scrutiny to\ndetermine whether they were objectively reasonable); Sun Refining\n& Mktg. Co. v. Rago, 741 F.2d 670, 672-74 (3d Cir. 1984) (holding\nthat in light of the PMPA's purpose of benefitting franchisees,\ncourts must look to whether franchisor terminations under\n§ 2802(c)(8) and (9) are objectively reasonable and not presume\nreasonableness per se).\n\n                                            -18-\n\fCAP or the temporary rent benefit.8    Shell's termination of the\n\nfranchise was valid under the PMPA.\n\nC.        Shell's Lanham Act Claim\n\n          LFSS also challenges the district court's grant of a\n\npermanent injunction preventing LFSS from further using Shell\n\ntrademarks, trade dress, and color patterns.    The district court\n\nreasoned that this relief was warranted under Section 43(a) of the\n\nLanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), because LFSS's sale of non-Shell\n\nproducts while displaying Shell trademarks was likely to cause\n\nconfusion as to the origin of LFSS's petroleum products. See Shell\n\nI, slip op. at 29-32; Shell IV, slip op. at 17-18 (limiting\n\ninjunctive relief to § 1125(a)).\n\n          Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act creates civil liability\n\nfor \"any person who . . . uses in commerce any word, term, name,\n\nsymbol, or device . . . which . . . is likely to cause confusion .\n\n. . as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods,\n\nservices, or commercial activities by another person.\"   15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1125(a)(1)(A).   This circuit generally looks to a non-exclusive,\n\nmulti-factor list to determine whether a likelihood of confusion\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          Specifically, in 2000, before the CAP or the February\n2001 rent benefit were implemented, LFSS's net operating income was\n$33,440, but it loaned more than $150,000 to its stockholders\nduring the fiscal year.     LFSS also took out substantial loans\ntotaling about $675,000 before implementing the CAP, and LFSS paid\nout more than $200,000 to its president, the station operator, in\n2000, 2002, and 2003.\n\n                                -19-\n\fexists.9   That list is merely illustrative, however; the purpose of\n\nthe   inquiry    is    simply   to   determine   whether   \"the   allegedly\n\ninfringing conduct carries with it a likelihood of confounding an\n\nappreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising\n\nordinary care.\"       Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v.\n\nWinship Green Nursing Ctr., 103 F.3d 196, 201 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           The application of those factors to the record is a\n\nhighly fact-intensive inquiry.         See Visible Sys. Corp. v. Unisys\n\nCorp., 551 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2008).         That is especially so\n\ngiven that LFSS is challenging the district court's decision to\n\nlimit the evidence to Shell's photographs and the persuasiveness of\n\nthat evidence.    We accordingly review the district court's finding\n\nof a likelihood of confusion for clear error, and hold that the\n\ndistrict court did not clearly err in its finding.\n\n           There is no need to go through a mechanical application\n\nof the multi-factor list to reach this conclusion.           The district\n\ncourt properly rejected LFSS's argument that Shell's photographs of\n\n\n\n      9\n          Specifically, this circuit looks to\n     (1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the similarity of\n     the goods (or, in a service mark case, the services); (3)\n     the relationship between the parties' channels of trade;\n     (4) the juxtaposition of their advertising; (5) the\n     classes of prospective purchasers; (6) the evidence of\n     actual confusion; (7) the defendant's intent in adopting\n     its allegedly infringing mark; and (8) the strength of\n     the plaintiff's mark.\nInt'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr., 103 F.3d\n196, 201 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Visible Sys. Corp. v. Unisys\nCorp., 551 F.3d 65, 73 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                     -20-\n\fstill-visible Shell trademarks at the Los Frailes service station\n\nare unpersuasive and unreliable evidence.          LFSS presented evidence\n\nsquarely challenging Shell's photographs only in 2007 and had\n\npreviously made stipulations at odds with the 2007 evidence that it\n\npresented.    See Shell IV, 596 F. Supp. 2d at 201-02.\n\n          Moreover,      beyond   the   photographic    evidence,     it   is\n\nuncontested that LFSS had operated a Shell station on the premises\n\nfor more than a decade, and that LFSS covered up some, but not all,\n\nof the Shell trademarks displayed at the Los Frailes station while\n\nselling non-Shell-brand fuel.       It is also uncontested that LFSS\n\nfailed to alter the overall appearance of the service station,\n\nwhich retained the trade dress of a Shell station.            LFSS further\n\nconceded before the district court that the fuel it sold after May\n\n21, 2003, was of inferior quality to the fuel it had previously\n\nsold under Shell trademarks.        Shell I, slip op. at 24.          LFSS's\n\nbrief on appeal concedes that the station continued to serve the\n\nsame   potential      customers   before     and   after    the     franchise\n\ntermination.\n\n          These facts amply support the district court's finding\n\nthat   when    LFSS   began   selling     non-Shell-brand    fuel     without\n\ncompletely obscuring the Shell trademarks at the station, LFSS's\n\nactions were substantially likely to confuse reasonably prudent\n\nconsumers.    Given that the Los Frailes station had been identified\n\nwith the Shell brand for over a decade and that Shell trademarks\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fwere still visible at the station, LFSS's signs stating \"We Do Not\n\nSell Shell Gasoline\" were not enough to avoid likely confusion, not\n\nleast because customers could only see those signs after they were\n\nalready at the gas pump.10\n\n\n\nD.              The Provision of the Injunction Ordering LFSS to Allow\n                Shell   to    Retain   Possession   of    the  Service\n                Station until the Expiration of the Lease\n\n                We next address LFSS's argument that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in granting the portion of the injunction\n\nthat compelled LFSS \"to allow [Shell] to continue in possession of\n\nthe Los Frailes Service Station . . . until the expiration of\n\n[Shell]'s rights under the lease agreement between the parties\" in\n\n2014.        Shell III, slip op. at 2.\n\n                The district court did not provide any specific reasoning\n\nin   its      opinion   as   to   why   this   particular   provision   of   the\n\ninjunction, guaranteeing Shell's continued presence for a number of\n\nyears into the future, was necessary to remedy the irreparable\n\n\n        10\n          We likewise reject LFSS's argument that Shell lacked\nstanding to assert an injury on its Lanham Act claims because of\nShell's 2006 acquisition and share purchase and its rebranding as\nSol Puerto Rico, and specifically because Sol is not the registrant\nof the relevant Shell trademarks. Anyone \"who may suffer adverse\nconsequences from a violation of section 1125(a) has standing to\nsue regardless of whether he is the registrant of the trademark.\"\nQuabaug Rubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co., Inc., 567 F.2d 154, 160\n(1st Cir. 1977); see also Waldman Publ'g Corp. v. Landoll, Inc., 43\nF.3d 775, 784-85 (2d Cir. 1994). Sol, as the owner of numerous\nShell stations, plainly has an interest in preventing the confusion\nof the Shell brand with the inferior-quality fuel that LFSS sold\nwhile still displaying some Shell trademarks.\n\n                                        -22-\n\fharms associated with Shell's loss of goodwill and market presence.\n\nThose    harms   derived      from    LFSS's    failure      to   comply   with   the\n\nconsequences      of    its      franchise      termination,        including     the\n\ntermination of LFSS's sublease of the service station from Shell\n\nand LFSS's obligation to cease operating the station as Shell's\n\ndesignated retailer/sublessee.             Shell I, slip op. at 28-29.            But\n\nthe district court's injunction included a separate provision\n\nspecifically requiring LFSS to comply with the post-termination\n\nprovisions of the retailer/sublease agreement and the trademark and\n\nequipment agreement.        Id.      The portion of the injunction requiring\n\nLFSS to also allow Shell to remain in possession of the service\n\nstation until its rights under the lease expired in 2014 was in\n\naddition to, and separate from, that provision.                   Id.   The district\n\ncourt appears to have reasoned that the PMPA allows franchisors to\n\nobtain injunctions based on an underlying lease agreement, not\n\nmerely    injunctions      to    enforce      post-termination      provisions    of\n\nfranchise agreements.           Id. at 27-29.\n\n            On appeal, LFSS does not challenge the portion of the\n\ninjunction ordering it to comply with post-termination clauses in\n\nthe   franchise   agreements.           Nor    does   LFSS    dispute    that   those\n\ncontractual clauses provided that \"[i]f this Contract is terminated\n\nor non-renewed, [LFSS] will deliver the Station and the Equipment\n\nto [Shell]\" within twenty-four hours of termination.                    Once LFSS's\n\nsublease of the station from LFSS ended, LFSS had to vacate the\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fpremises.   Shell then could presumably enter into another sublease\n\nwith a new retailer to operate the service station.    It is unclear\n\nfrom the record whether that has in fact happened.\n\n            Instead, LFSS's argument is that the district court\n\nshould not have added the additional portion of the injunction\n\ncompelling LFSS to allow Shell to possess the station until Shell's\n\nrights under the lease expire in 2014. LFSS is essentially arguing\n\nthat franchisors like Shell cannot use the PMPA to obtain this kind\n\nof injunctive remedy, as distinct from whatever post-termination\n\nobligations LFSS has under the franchise agreements.11\n\n            We agree that the district court abused its discretion in\n\nordering LFSS to allow Shell to continue in possession of the Los\n\nFrailes service station until Shell's rights under the lease\n\nexpired.\n\n            Here, Shell made no showing of irreparable harm that\n\nmight justify an order giving it possession of the property for the\n\n\n\n     11\n           Though LFSS broadly asserts that the PMPA does not allow\nfranchisors to obtain injunctive relief against franchisees if the\nrelief would give the franchisors property rights, LFSS does not\nclaim that this prevents the district court from ordering LFSS to\ncomply with its post-termination contractual obligations. In any\nevent, we need not decide whether the PMPA allows franchisors to\nobtain injunctions to enforce those kinds of obligations. Shell's\ncomplaint also included a claim to judicially dispossess LFSS of\nthe service station premises and equipment under Puerto Rican law,\nand Shell can obtain enforcement of the relevant post-termination\ncontractual provisions on that basis.     Shell did not, however,\nbring any state law claims that would provide an alternate basis\nfor it to obtain an injunctive remedy involving the lease agreement\nin this suit.\n\n                                 -24-\n\ffull   term    of   the     lease,   until    2014.      The   post-termination\n\nprovisions of the retailer/sublease and trademark and equipment\n\ncontracts adequately protected Shell's right to resume possession\n\nof the station and its equipment.              We see no basis for further\n\nordering LFSS to allow Shell to possess the property until 2014\n\nunder the lease; the district court's order compelling LFSS to\n\ncomply   with       these    post-termination         provisions    sufficiently\n\nprotected Shell's interests.          The district court did not hold that\n\nany violations of the lease by LFSS may have caused discrete,\n\nirreparable harms to Shell or that injunctive relief would be the\n\nremedy for such harms.\n\n              Moreover, the terms of this portion of the injunction\n\nappear to allow Shell to continue possessing the property and\n\nservice station until the lease expires even if Shell, in the\n\nfuture, breaches its obligations under the lease.                  Shell plainly\n\ncannot be entitled to that remedy, which goes even beyond ordering\n\nenforcement of the lease agreement.\n\n              We vacate this portion of the injunction alone, without\n\nprejudice.      Shell is free to try to obtain this remedy at a later\n\ndate if future events warrant it.\n\n          IV. LFSS's Antitrust Counterclaim against Shell\n\n              LFSS also appeals the district court's decision to strike\n\nLFSS's cross-motion for summary judgment and its grant of summary\n\n\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fjudgment   to   Shell    on   LFSS's   federal   and   state   law   antitrust\n\ncounterclaims.\n\n            We review a district court's decision to strike a motion\n\nfor summary judgment for an abuse of discretion when it is stricken\n\nfor a failure to comply with the terms of a case-management order.\n\nSee Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(holding   that   case    management-related     decisions     are   generally\n\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion).             We review the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment de novo and make all reasonable\n\nfactual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant,\n\nLFSS.    Boston & Me. Corp. v.

Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the movant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"          Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).    \"We may affirm . . . on any basis in the record.\"\n\nChiang v. Verizon New England, Inc., 595 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).    We affirm both rulings.\n\nA.          The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in\n            Striking LFSS's Summary Judgment Motion\n\n            LFSS's argument that the district court erred in striking\n\nits motion for summary judgment ignores the salient fact that\n\nLFSS's motion was filed on January 3, 2007, weeks after the\n\nconclusion of discovery, and well after the September 1, 2006,\n\ndeadline the district court imposed for dispositive motions.\n\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\f            LFSS argues on appeal that the district court's extension\n\nof discovery until November 30, 2006, effectively extended or\n\nvacated the September 1 deadline. That argument, however, does not\n\nprovide a persuasive ground for questioning the district court's\n\ndiscretionary case management decisions.              See Perez-Cordero v.\n\nWal-Mart P.R., 440 F.3d 531, 533 (1st Cir. 2006); Rosario-Diaz, 140\n\nF.3d at 315.      LFSS had numerous opportunities to request a filing\n\nextension   for    its   summary   judgment     motion     at   various   status\n\nconferences after the September deadline; it took none of them.\n\nNor has LFSS presented any convincing reason for the delay in\n\nfiling this motion.12      There was no abuse of discretion in denying\n\nLFSS's summary judgment motion.\n\nB.          The District Court Properly Granted Summary Judgment to\n            Shell on LFSS's Antitrust Counterclaim\n\n            LFSS further argues that the district court improperly\n\ngranted   summary    judgment   against    it   on   its    claims   under   the\n\nRobinson-Patman Act and equivalent provisions of Puerto Rican\n\nantitrust law because, it says, there were contested material\n\nissues of fact as to various elements of that claim even absent the\n\n\n\n\n     12\n          In any event, as the district court noted in its opinion\ngranting summary judgment to Shell, the outcome would have been no\ndifferent even if it had considered this untimely motion. LFSS's\npurported evidence that it was in actual competition with other,\nnearby retailers that it said received better prices from Shell was\nweak at best, and it failed to show price differentials. See Shell\nII, 551 F. Supp. 2d at 134 n.3.\n\n                                    -27-\n\fevidence submitted in its stricken motion for summary judgment. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n              Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the\n\nRobinson-Patman Act, prohibits price discrimination among different\n\npurchasers         of    like     commodities             if    \"the    effect    of     such\n\ndiscrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend\n\nto   create    a     monopoly     in    any       line    of    commerce,\"     among     other\n\nconsequences.            15   U.S.C.        §    13(a).        The   Robinson-Patman        Act\n\nprohibits, inter alia, actions \"directed at injuring competition\n\namong   the    discriminating           seller's          customers,\"       referred   to    as\n\n\"secondary line violations.\"                    See Able Sales Co., Inc. v. Compañía\n\nde Azucar de P.R., 406 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              LFSS       claims    that         Shell     engaged      in    secondary-line\n\nviolations through the CAP program Shell implemented in July 2001.\n\nLFSS says that in establishing price zones for retailers, the CAP\n\noffered    certain        Shell    retailers           (those    operating      Shell-owned\n\nstations) more favorable prices on Shell fuel than LFSS and other\n\nretailer-owned stations received.\n\n              One of the basic requirements of competitive injury,\n\nhowever,      is     a   showing       of       \"actual     competition\"       between      the\n\ndisfavored retailer (LFSS) and those retailers benefitting from the\n\nprice discrimination.             Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc. v. Reeder-Simco\n\nGMC, Inc., 546 U.S. 164, 177 (2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -28-\n\f             The central reason LFSS's argument fails is because, as\n\nthe district court found,             LFSS presented no evidence that it was\n\nactually     in    competition       with     the    retailers    it    said   were    the\n\nbeneficiaries of the CAP.             LFSS's response to Shell's motion for\n\nsummary judgment simply asserted that under an August 2005 Puerto\n\nRican law, P.R. Laws. Ann., tit. 23, § 1104, the entire island\n\nconstituted       a   single    price    zone       and   that   all    retailers     were\n\npresumptively         each   other's     competitors.            But    that   law    was\n\nmarginally        relevant     at   best.       It    was   a    non-retroactive       law\n\nimplemented two years after this suit began, and a year after the\n\nCAP was discontinued.           See Shell III, slip op. at 8-9.\n\n             We likewise reject LFSS's argument that the deposition\n\ntestimony showing three other Shell stations were within two miles\n\nof LFSS meant that those stations were presumptively in competition\n\nwith   the    Los     Frailes       service    station.          This   testimony     was\n\nexceptionally vague.            LFSS neither presented corroboration nor\n\nexplained why consumers would in practice choose among these\n\nstations. On the evidence submitted in this case, even viewing all\n\nreasonable inferences in LFSS's favor, proximity does not does not\n\nper se show actual competition.\n\n             LFSS's reply to Shell's motion for summary judgment\n\npresented no other factual or legal basis for finding LFSS was in\n\ncompetition with favored retailers, and its attempts on appeal to\n\ncreate an issue of material fact on this point all depend on the\n\n\n                                            -29-\n\fexhibits in support of its stricken motion for summary judgment.\n\nWe need go no further.13 LFSS cannot satisfy the first prerequisite\n\nof its antitrust claims, and thus the district court properly\n\ngranted Shell summary judgment.\n\n           V. LFSS's State Law Breach of Contract Counterclaim\n\n              Finally, we reject LFSS's argument that the district\n\ncourt erred in dismissing for failure to prosecute LFSS's breach of\n\ncontract claim for additional rent due under the lease.           We review\n\ndismissals for failure to prosecute under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) for\n\nan abuse of discretion.           See Malot v. Dorado Beach Cottages\n\nAssocs., 478 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2007).            There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion here.\n\n              LFSS conceded before the district court in a 2007 show-\n\ncause hearing that this claim had been included only in a section\n\nof an earlier response to a motion to show cause.              The district\n\ncourt could reasonably find there was no real development of this\n\nclaim since 2003.      LFSS's main argument before the district court\n\nwas   that    the   district   court    should   nonetheless   exercise   its\n\ndiscretion not to deem the argument waived.             LFSS made all its\n\npresent arguments as to the lack of hardship to Shell before the\n\n\n      13\n          We note that the district court amply explained why, even\nassuming arguendo that LFSS presented an issue of material fact on\nthe question of whether it was in competition with favored\nretailers, there were no material issues of fact on the other\nrequired elements of this claim that would preclude Shell from\nobtaining judgment on the merits. See Shell II, 551 F. Supp. 2d at\n134-35.\n\n                                       -30-\n\fdistrict court, which carefully considered them.            Nor, despite the\n\nextensive filings in this case, has LFSS at any point explained why\n\nthis claim has merit.    LFSS has also not developed the argument as\n\nto why this claim should not have been dismissed with prejudice;\n\nin any event, the district court's decision to dismiss a claim for\n\nfailure to prosecute with or without prejudice is ordinarily within\n\nits discretion. The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndismissing the claim with prejudice.\n\n           We affirm the district court's grant of a permanent\n\ninjunction ordering LFSS to refrain from further use of any Shell\n\ntrademarks, trade dress, or color patterns and ordering LFSS to\n\ncomply with relevant post-termination contractual obligations.              We\n\nvacate, without prejudice, the portion of the permanent injunction\n\nordering   and   compelling   LFSS    to    allow   Shell   to   continue   in\n\npossession of the Los Frailes Service Station until the expiration\n\nof the lease in 2014.     Shell is free to seek future injunctive\n\nrelief should it be warranted.             The district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment and its dismissal of LFSS's breach of contract\n\ncounterclaim with prejudice are affirmed.           No costs are awarded.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\f",

(\"LFSS\"), which owned and operated the Los Frailes gasoline service station in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico as a Shell franchisee from 1997 until 2003. Shell terminated LFSS's franchise, and this appeal by LFSS primarily concerns the permanent injunction awarding Shell relief against LFSS and the dismissal of LFSS's counterclaims. The complications in this case arise from LFSS's dual status as the owner of the service station and surrounding property, in which capacity it leased the property to Shell, and as a retailer-franchisee, in which capacity LFSS subleased the service station from Shell to operate it.</p>\n<p>Since December 2003, when Shell first obtained a preliminary injunction, LFSS has been ordered to cease using Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns; to comply with all post-termination contractual provisions; and to \"immediately surrender the station in question, the storage tanks and all pertinent equipment to Shell, in order for Shell to designate a third party to operate the same.\" <i>The Shell Co.

The district court converted the preliminary injunction to a permanent injunction on January 29, 2007, ordering and compelling LFSS to cease any use of Shell trademarks, trade dress, or color patterns, to comply with the post-termination provisions of its franchise agreements with Shell, and, in addition, to allow Shell \"to continue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station, along with the subterraneous storage tanks and all pertinent equipment, until the expiration of [Shell's] rights under the lease agreement between the parties,\" set to expire in 2014. <i>The Shell Co.

Shell has been in control of the property since 2003.</p>\n<p>LFSS appeals from various provisions of the permanent injunction, the grant of summary judgment to Shell on LFSS's federal and state law counterclaims against Shell, and the dismissal of LFSS's state law breach of contract counterclaim with prejudice (for failure to prosecute). We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by enjoining LFSS from further use of Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. We further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by compelling LFSS to comply with the post-termination provisions of its franchise agreements with Shell. The district court did, however, abuse its discretion by extending the injunction to compel LFSS \"to allow [Shell] to continue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station... until the expiration of [Shell]'s rights under the lease agreement between the parties\" in 2014. <i>Shell III,</i> slip op. at 2. We vacate that provision of the injunction, without prejudice to Shell's seeking further injunctive relief at a future date. We also hold that the district court properly granted Shell summary judgment on LFSS's counterclaims and that there was no abuse of discretion in dismissing LFSS's breach of contract counterclaim for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>The following facts are either uncontested or were stipulated by the parties.</p>\n<p>The gasoline service station located at the corner of State Road 177 and Muró Street in the Los Frailes area of Guaynabo has long been one of the busiest in the region. LFSS has owned this station and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> the property surrounding it since 1977. For several decades, LFSS sold Shell-brand gasoline as an independent retailer under a lease arrangement with Shell. In 1997, LFSS became a Shell franchisee.</p>\n<p>Three contracts, all signed on April 11, 1997, defined the franchise relationship between Shell and LFSS: an amended lease agreement, a retailer/sublease agreement, and a trademark and equipment agreement.</p>\n<p>The amended lease agreement extended Shell's 1992 lease of the service station and its surrounding property until February 28, 2014. The \"primary and essential purpose\" of the lease was to maintain a service station there, and, under the amended lease, Shell did not need LFSS's permission to sublease the station to a third party retailer to operate. In exchange for this leasehold, Shell agreed to pay graduated rent to LFSS based on the number of gallons of gasoline the retailer (whether LFSS or a third party) bought from Shell each month.</p>\n<p>Under the retailer/sublease agreement, Shell then subleased the station back to LFSS to operate as a Shell franchisee. As a Shell franchisee, LFSS had the right to operate the station under the Shell name, as an exclusive retailer of Shell-brand petroleum products. In exchange, LFSS agreed to certain obligations, including to purchase a minimum average of 300,000 gallons of fuel from Shell each month, to pay for Shell products on time each month on the check or credit terms set by Shell, to keep the station open and running during its hours of operation, and to operate the station for the exclusive purpose of selling only Shell-brand products.</p>\n<p>The trademark and equipment agreement governed LFSS's exclusive use of Shell trademarks and of equipment Shell provided to LFSS and also set out LFSS's maintenance, inventory, and delivery obligations. This agreement recognized Shell's ownership of the underground storage tanks and other equipment at the station and gave LFSS the right to use this equipment only to sell and store Shell-brand fuel when operating the station.</p>\n<p>These three agreements also included important provisions governing when the agreements could be terminated and the consequences of termination. The parties contest the interpretation of many of these provisions, and we discuss them further below.</p>\n<p>From 1997 to 2000, LFSS operated the Los Frailes station as a Shell station under the terms of these agreements. Beginning in 2000, the parties made several amendments to the lease agreement. A February 15, 2001, amendment, at issue in this case, gave LFSS a temporary rent benefit from Shell to encourage a higher volume of gasoline sales.<sup>[3]</sup> Under the amendment, this rent benefit would automatically continue every month unless Shell notified LFSS otherwise in writing.</p>\n<p>On July 2, 2001, Shell informed LFSS and its other Puerto Rican franchisees that it was implementing a Competitive Adjustment Program (CAP), and LFSS agreed to participate. The program established certain price zones for retailers and set maximum retail prices for Shell's retailers in those zones. In exchange, the CAP gave retailers discounts on wholesale fuel prices, again based on those zones. Following an investigation, the Puerto Rico Department of Justice ordered Shell to cease the CAP program on January 30, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> 2004, on the ground that it violated Puerto Rican antitrust law. Shell complied.</p>\n<p>LFSS participated in the CAP for the duration of its franchise with Shell. Though LFSS now contests whether the CAP displaced the temporary rent benefit Shell implemented in February 2001, LFSS does not contest the district court's factual finding that LFSS sent Shell an April 9, 2002 letter proposing \"a temporary adjustment in rent for LFSS as we had in the first quarter of last year.\" We discuss the CAP in further detail below.</p>\n<p>By early 2003, LFSS was suffering from cash flow problems and so did not pay for more than $80,000 worth of Shell's fuel deliveries. Shell, pursuant to the retailer/sublease agreement, also implemented a hard cash payment policy and required LFSS to pay for Shell products by certified check at delivery.</p>\n<p>During the weekend of May 17 and 18, 2003, LFSS instead tried to pay for two deliveries with personal checks. On Monday, May 19, Shell told LFSS that until LFSS paid for the weekend deliveries with certified checks, Shell would not make any further deliveries. LFSS did not comply; there were no further deliveries, LFSS ran out of fuel to sell, and the station temporarily closed. That same day, May 19, LFSS sent Shell a letter stating that Shell had not paid the February 2001 additional rent benefit since July 2001 (when the CAP went into effect), that Shell had not sent written notice of its cancellation, and that Shell therefore immediately owed the balance of the additional rent from July 2001 until April 2003.</p>\n<p>On May 21, 2003, LFSS sent Shell a letter purportedly cancelling their entire commercial relationship, including the lease, citing Shell's alleged failure to pay LFSS the additional rent and its alleged obligation to deliver fuel to LFSS. LFSS then purchased fuel from other refiners and distributors, covered some but not all of the Shell trademarks at the station, and began selling non-Shell-brand fuel. LFSS also put up signs saying \"We Do Not Sell Shell Gasoline.\" The signs were not prominently displayed.</p>\n<p>On May 23, 2003, Shell informed LFSS by letter that it was terminating LFSS's franchise, which Shell said terminated the retailer/sublease agreement and trademarks and equipment agreement but not the underlying lease agreement under which Shell leased the property from LFSS. Shell said that LFSS's termination of the lease was invalid because LFSS had not complied with the lease termination provisions. Shell then demanded that LFSS honor its obligations under the lease and under the post-termination provisions of the retailer/sublease and equipment and trademark agreements by immediately vacating the service station premises and turning over Shell's equipment.</p>\n<p>LFSS instead continued to operate the service station by selling non-Shell-brand fuel at the service station. Shell then brought assorted federal and state law claims against LFSS in the federal district court of Puerto Rico less than two weeks later, on June 3, 2003, eventually culminating in this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. The Parties' Claims</h2>\n<p>Before delving into the legal analysis, we summarize Shell and LFSS's respective claims and counterclaims.</p>\n<p>Shell's claims against LFSS proceed from Shell's contention that it validly terminated LFSS's franchise on May 23, 2003. Shell says it was entitled to do so under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (\"PMPA\"), 15 U.S.C. § 2801 <i>et seq.,</i> a federal law that regulates franchisors' termination of franchises, because of LFSS's failure to pay for fuel deliveries, its unreasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> closing of the station, and its sale of non-Shell fuel while displaying Shell trademarks.</p>\n<p>Shell claims LFSS's post-termination actions violated Shell's rights in two respects. First, Shell says that LFSS created a likelihood that consumers would be confused or deceived when it sold non-Shell products while displaying Shell trademarks, in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). On this basis, Shell requested, and the district court granted, injunctive relief to stop LFSS from using Shell trademarks, trade dress, or color patterns. <i>See </i><i>Shell IV,</i> 596 F.Supp.2d at 203-05; <i>Shell I,</i> slip op. at 29-31.</p>\n<p>Second, Shell says its termination of the franchise left its underlying lease of the station from LFSS intact. Shell further claimed that LFSS's refusal to vacate the premises and to allow Shell to exercise its property rights over the station as a lessor violated the terms of the lease, as well as various post-termination provisions in the retailer/sublease and trademark and equipment agreements requiring LFSS to relinquish possession of the station. This was the district court's basis for compelling LFSS to comply with all post-termination contractual provisions and for the separate provision of the injunction allowing Shell to remain in possession of the service station until the expiration of its lease in 2014. <i>See Shell I,</i> slip op. at 27-29, 32-34.</p>\n<p>LFSS makes several arguments as to why the district court abused its discretion in granting Shell a permanent injunction. LFSS first claims that it validly terminated all contracts, including the lease, on May 21, 2003, two days before Shell purportedly terminated the franchise. In the alternative, LFSS says, Shell's termination of the franchise was not valid under the PMPA, and the district court erred in finding otherwise.</p>\n<p>LFSS further argues that the district court erred in granting injunctive relief. It contests the injunction on Shell's Lanham Act claim, urging that the evidence was contradictory and insufficient to support a likelihood of confusion. In any event, LFSS says, Shell is not entitled to the specific remedy of an injunction to enforce the lease, which gives Shell possession until 2014, whether under the PMPA or any of Shell's other claims, and the district court erred in finding otherwise. This last issue is potentially the most difficult in the case, raising questions about the scope of injunctive relief available to franchisors under the PMPA.</p>\n<p>LFSS also argues that the district court erred in granting Shell summary judgment on LFSS's counterclaim that Shell's CAP program violated federal and Puerto Rican antitrust law. Specifically, LFSS argues that the district court abused its discretion by striking LFSS's cross-motion for summary judgment and denying its motion for reconsideration. Its main substantive challenge, however, is that the district court erroneously made factual inferences in Shell's favor when granting summary judgment to Shell on LFSS's antitrust claims and that there were material issues of fact precluding summary judgment. Finally, LFSS says the district court abused its discretion by dismissing its state law breach of contract counterclaim for failure to prosecute, because, LFSS insists, it diligently asserted this claim.</p>\n<p>We analyze LFSS's challenges to the permanent injunction, summary judgment, and dismissal of its breach of contract counterclaim in turn. We vacate only the portion of the district court's injunction allowing Shell to continue in possession of the Los Frailes service station until 2014, when its lease expires, and we affirm the district court's judgment on all other grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> III. Shell's Claims against LFSS</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion; we review its underlying conclusions of law de novo and any factual findings for clear error.<sup>[4]</sup><i>García-Rubiera v. Calderón,</i> 570 F.3d 443, 455-56 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction before a district court must ordinarily show: \"(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\" <i>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.,</i> 547 U.S. 388, 391, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006); <i>see also </i><i>CoxCom, Inc. v. Chaffee,</i> 536 F.3d 101, 112 (1st Cir.2008). LFSS's claims of error cut across these criteria.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. LFSS's Purported Termination of the Lease Agreement</h2>\n<p>LFSS's primary argument on appeal is that LFSS validly terminated its lease of the Los Frailes station to Shell on May 21, 2003, and that the district court therefore erred by granting Shell an injunction that gave Shell possession of the service station.</p>\n<p>We reject this argument; LFSS's attempt to terminate the lease on May 21 was plainly invalid.<sup>[5]</sup> Even assuming dubitante that Shell had defaulted on its lease obligations, article 17 of the lease provided that LFSS could terminate the lease in the event of default only after a sixty-day curative period. LFSS admits that its May 21, 2003, letter of termination cited Shell's purported breaches as the grounds for termination and did not comply with the sixty-day curative requirement.</p>\n<p>Instead, LFSS claims that a different part of the lease agreement, article 7, authorized LFSS to terminate the lease with Shell immediately, without any sixty-day curative period, on the sole condition that LFSS pay Shell for the cost of the improvements and alterations Shell had made to the station, less depreciation.</p>\n<p>Because LFSS only developed this interpretation of article 7 at oral argument and not in its briefs, this argument is waived. <i>See </i><i>Mass. Museum of Contemporary Art Found. v. Büchel,</i> 593 F.3d 38, 65 (1st Cir.2010). Even if the argument were properly before this court, it would fail. Article 7 states in relevant part that \"[i]f this lease is terminated before the expiration of its term ... for causes attributable to [LFSS],\" LFSS, \"in addition to any other remedy under the contract,\" must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> \"immediately pay [Shell] an amount equivalent to the amount not depreciated (or amortized) of the improvements and permanent alterations made by [Shell] in the Property, in the Station or in the surrounding areas.\" This is plainly a liquidated damages provision addressing the consequences of termination, not the conditions under which the parties could terminate the agreement. It cannot be construed as an open-ended alternative to the limitations on termination set out in article 17.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Shell's PMPA Claim</h2>\n<p>In the alternative, LFSS argues that the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that Shell's termination of LFSS's franchise complied with the PMPA. Absent a valid termination, LFSS suggests, Shell suffered no irreparable injury, since Shell's asserted harms arose from LFSS's alleged failure to comply with the consequences of franchise termination. Those consequences include the loss of LFSS's right to use Shell's trademarks and equipment and to sublease and operate the service station. This argument also fails; we reject its assumption that Shell's termination was invalid.</p>\n<p>The PMPA, enacted in 1978, addressed franchisors' \"allegedly unfair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the petroleum industry\" by \"establish[ing] minimum federal standards governing the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum franchises.\" <i>Mac's Shell Serv., Inc. v. Shell Oil Prods. Co. LLC,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1251, 1255, 176 L.Ed.2d 36 (2010). Under provisions of the PMPA, franchisors can terminate or fail to renew a franchise \"only if the franchisor provides written notice and takes the action in question for a reason specifically recognized in the statute.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Reasons recognized in the statute for termination include \"[t]he occurrence of an event which is ... relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise ... is reasonable.\" 15 U.S.C. § 2802(b)(2)(C). The PMPA explicitly includes \"failure by the franchisee to pay the franchisor in a timely manner,\" <i>id.</i> § 2802(c)(8), \"failure by the franchisee to operate the marketing premises for ... an unreasonable period of time\" under the circumstances, <i>id.</i> § 2802(c)(9)(B), and \"willful adulteration, mislabeling or misbranding of motor fuels or other trademark violations of the franchisee,\" <i>id.</i> § 2802(c)(10), as examples of such events.</p>\n<p>LFSS does not contest that it failed to make payments on time, temporarily closed the station, and sold non-Shell-brand fuel. Rather, it argues that the PMPA requires courts to determine whether a termination based on these events was objectively reasonable under the circumstances, not just whether an event listed under § 2802(c) technically occurred. The circumstances here, LFSS says, made Shell's termination unreasonable, because the cash flow problems leading to these three events were caused by Shell's alleged violation of antitrust laws and its purported failure to pay LFSS the temporary rent benefit Shell agreed to in February 2001. Those two allegations are also the basis for LFSS's counterclaims against Shell.</p>\n<p>The district court rejected this argument, holding as a matter of law that Shell's termination of the franchise was per se reasonable because the termination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> was based on those three, explicitly listed statutory grounds for termination. <i>See Shell I,</i> slip op. at 19-21. The district court's reasoning suggested that the termination was valid even under an objective reasonableness standard. It found that LFSS's claim that Shell's nonpayment of the rent benefit caused LFSS's cash flow problems lacked merit because of LFSS's April 2002 admission in its letter to Shell that the February 2001 rent benefit was no longer in effect. <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>We need not evaluate the wisdom of a per se rule that termination is reasonable if an event listed in § 2802(c) occurs.<sup>[7]</sup> LFSS could not prevail even if we reviewed whether Shell's termination was objectively reasonable. The district court did not clearly err in finding that the February 2001 rent benefit was temporary, long since terminated, and could not have been responsible for LFSS's May 2003 cash flow problems. In any event, uncontested record evidence shows that LFSS's cash flow problems, culminating in its inability to pay Shell for deliveries, had a number of causes unrelated to Shell's actions with respect to the CAP or the temporary rent benefit.<sup>[8]</sup> Shell's termination of the franchise was valid under the PMPA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Shell's Lanham Act Claim</h2>\n<p>LFSS also challenges the district court's grant of a permanent injunction preventing LFSS from further using Shell trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns. The district court reasoned that this relief was warranted under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), because LFSS's sale of non-Shell products while displaying Shell trademarks was likely to cause confusion as to the origin of LFSS's petroleum products. <i>See Shell I,</i> slip op. at 29-32; <i>Shell IV,</i> 596 F.Supp.2d at 202-03 (limiting injunctive relief to § 1125(a)).</p>\n<p>Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act creates civil liability for \"any person who ... uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device ... which ... is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A). This circuit generally looks to a non-exclusive, multi-factor list to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists.<sup>[9]</sup> That list is merely illustrative, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> however; the purpose of the inquiry is simply to determine whether \"the allegedly infringing conduct carries with it a likelihood of confounding an appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising ordinary care.\" <i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr.,</i> 103 F.3d 196, 201 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>The application of those factors to the record is a highly fact-intensive inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Visible Sys. Corp. v. Unisys Corp.,</i> 551 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir.2008). That is especially so given that LFSS is challenging the district court's decision to limit the evidence to Shell's photographs and the persuasiveness of that evidence. We accordingly review the district court's finding of a likelihood of confusion for clear error, and hold that the district court did not clearly err in its finding.</p>\n<p>There is no need to go through a mechanical application of the multi-factor list to reach this conclusion. The district court properly rejected LFSS's argument that Shell's photographs of still-visible Shell trademarks at the Los Frailes service station are unpersuasive and unreliable evidence. LFSS presented evidence squarely challenging Shell's photographs only in 2007 and had previously made stipulations at odds with the 2007 evidence that it presented. <i>See </i><i>Shell IV,</i> 596 F.Supp.2d at 201-02.</p>\n<p>Moreover, beyond the photographic evidence, it is uncontested that LFSS had operated a Shell station on the premises for more than a decade, and that LFSS covered up some, but not all, of the Shell trademarks displayed at the Los Frailes station while selling non-Shell-brand fuel. It is also uncontested that LFSS failed to alter the overall appearance of the service station, which retained the trade dress of a Shell station. LFSS further conceded before the district court that the fuel it sold after May 21, 2003, was of inferior quality to the fuel it had previously sold under Shell trademarks. <i>Shell I,</i> slip op. at 24. LFSS's brief on appeal concedes that the station continued to serve the same potential customers before and after the franchise termination.</p>\n<p>These facts amply support the district court's finding that when LFSS began selling non-Shell-brand fuel without completely obscuring the Shell trademarks at the station, LFSS's actions were substantially likely to confuse reasonably prudent consumers. Given that the Los Frailes station had been identified with the Shell brand for over a decade and that Shell trademarks were still visible at the station, LFSS's signs stating \"We Do Not Sell Shell Gasoline\" were not enough to avoid likely confusion, not least because customers could only see those signs after they were already at the gas pump.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> D. The Provision of the Injunction Ordering LFSS to Allow Shell to Retain Possession of the Service Station until the Expiration of the Lease</h2>\n<p>We next address LFSS's argument that the district court abused its discretion in granting the portion of the injunction that compelled LFSS \"to allow [Shell] to continue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station ... until the expiration of [Shell]'s rights under the lease agreement between the parties\" in 2014. <i>Shell III,</i> slip op. at 2.</p>\n<p>The district court did not provide any specific reasoning in its opinion as to why this particular provision of the injunction, guaranteeing Shell's continued presence for a number of years into the future, was necessary to remedy the irreparable harms associated with Shell's loss of goodwill and market presence. Those harms derived from LFSS's failure to comply with the consequences of its franchise termination, including the termination of LFSS's sublease of the service station from Shell and LFSS's obligation to cease operating the station as Shell's designated retailer/sublessee. <i>Shell I,</i> slip op. at 28-29. But the district court's injunction included a separate provision specifically requiring LFSS to comply with the post-termination provisions of the retailer/sublease agreement and the trademark and equipment agreement. <i>Id.</i> The portion of the injunction requiring LFSS to also allow Shell to remain in possession of the service station until its rights under the lease expired in 2014 was in addition to, and separate from, that provision. <i>Id.</i> The district court appears to have reasoned that the PMPA allows franchisors to obtain injunctions based on an underlying lease agreement, not merely injunctions to enforce post-termination provisions of franchise agreements. <i>Id.</i> at 27-29.</p>\n<p>On appeal, LFSS does not challenge the portion of the injunction ordering it to comply with post-termination clauses in the franchise agreements. Nor does LFSS dispute that those contractual clauses provided that \"[i]f this Contract is terminated or non-renewed, [LFSS] will deliver the Station and the Equipment to [Shell]\" within twenty-four hours of termination. Once LFSS's sublease of the station from Shell ended, LFSS had to vacate the premises. Shell then could presumably enter into another sublease with a new retailer to operate the service station. It is unclear from the record whether that has in fact happened.</p>\n<p>Instead, LFSS's argument is that the district court should not have added the additional portion of the injunction compelling LFSS to allow Shell to possess the station <i>until</i> Shell's rights under the lease expire in 2014. LFSS is essentially arguing that franchisors like Shell cannot use the PMPA to obtain this kind of injunctive remedy, as distinct from whatever post-termination obligations LFSS has under the franchise agreements.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> We agree that the district court abused its discretion in ordering LFSS to allow Shell to continue in possession of the Los Frailes service station until Shell's rights under the lease expired.</p>\n<p>Here, Shell made no showing of irreparable harm that might justify an order giving it possession of the property for the full term of the lease, until 2014. The post-termination provisions of the retailer/sublease and trademark and equipment contracts adequately protected Shell's right to resume possession of the station and its equipment. We see no basis for further ordering LFSS to allow Shell to possess the property until 2014 under the lease; the district court's order compelling LFSS to comply with these post-termination provisions sufficiently protected Shell's interests. The district court did not hold that any violations of the lease by LFSS may have caused discrete, irreparable harms to Shell or that injunctive relief would be the remedy for such harms.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the terms of this portion of the injunction appear to allow Shell to continue possessing the property and service station until the lease expires even if Shell, in the future, breaches its obligations under the lease. Shell plainly cannot be entitled to that remedy, which goes even beyond ordering enforcement of the lease agreement.</p>\n<p>We vacate this portion of the injunction alone, without prejudice. Shell is free to try to obtain this remedy at a later date if future events warrant it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. LFSS's Antitrust Counterclaim against Shell</h2>\n<p>LFSS also appeals the district court's decision to strike LFSS's cross-motion for summary judgment and its grant of summary judgment to Shell on LFSS's federal and state law antitrust counterclaims.</p>\n<p>We review a district court's decision to strike a motion for summary judgment for an abuse of discretion when it is stricken for a failure to comply with the terms of a case-management order. <i>See </i><i>Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir.1998) (holding that case management-related decisions are generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion). We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and make all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant, LFSS. <i>Boston &amp; Me. Corp. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> 587 F.3d 89, 98 (1st Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). \"We may affirm ... on any basis in the record.\" <i>Chiang v. Verizon New England, Inc.,</i> 595 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir.2010). We affirm both rulings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Striking LFSS's Summary Judgment Motion</h2>\n<p>LFSS's argument that the district court erred in striking its motion for summary judgment ignores the salient fact that LFSS's motion was filed on January 3, 2007, weeks after the conclusion of discovery, and well after the September 1, 2006, deadline the district court imposed for dispositive motions.</p>\n<p>LFSS argues on appeal that the district court's extension of discovery until November 30, 2006, effectively extended or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> vacated the September 1 deadline. That argument, however, does not provide a persuasive ground for questioning the district court's discretionary case management decisions. <i>See </i><i>Perez-Cordero v. Wal-Mart P.R.,</i> 440 F.3d 531, 533 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315. LFSS had numerous opportunities to request a filing extension for its summary judgment motion at various status conferences after the September deadline; it took none of them. Nor has LFSS presented any convincing reason for the delay in filing this motion.<sup>[12]</sup> There was no abuse of discretion in denying LFSS's summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The District Court Properly Granted Summary Judgment to Shell on LFSS's Antitrust Counterclaim</h2>\n<p>LFSS further argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment against it on its claims under the Robinson-Patman Act and equivalent provisions of Puerto Rican antitrust law because, it says, there were contested material issues of fact as to various elements of that claim even absent the evidence submitted in its stricken motion for summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, prohibits price discrimination among different purchasers of like commodities if \"the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce,\" among other consequences. 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). The Robinson-Patman Act prohibits, inter alia, actions \"directed at injuring competition among the discriminating seller's customers,\" referred to as \"secondary line violations.\" <i>See </i><i>Able Sales Co., Inc. v. Compañía de Azucar de P.R.,</i> 406 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>LFSS claims that Shell engaged in secondary-line violations through the CAP program Shell implemented in July 2001. LFSS says that in establishing price zones for retailers, the CAP offered certain Shell retailers (those operating Shell-owned stations) more favorable prices on Shell fuel than LFSS and other retailer-owned stations received.</p>\n<p>One of the basic requirements of competitive injury, however, is a showing of \"actual competition\" between the disfavored retailer (LFSS) and those retailers benefiting from the price discrimination. <i>Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc. v. Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc.,</i> 546 U.S. 164, 177, 126 S.Ct. 860, 163 L.Ed.2d 663 (2006).</p>\n<p>The central reason LFSS's argument fails is because, as the district court found, LFSS presented no evidence that it was actually in competition with the retailers it said were the beneficiaries of the CAP. LFSS's response to Shell's motion for summary judgment simply asserted that under an August 2005 Puerto Rican law, P.R. Laws. Ann., tit. 23, § 1104, the entire island constituted a single price zone and that all retailers were presumptively each other's competitors. But that law was marginally relevant at best. It was a non-retroactive law implemented two years after this suit began, and a year after the CAP was discontinued. <i>See Shell III,</i> slip op. at 8-9.</p>\n<p>We likewise reject LFSS's argument that the deposition testimony showing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> three other Shell stations were within two miles of LFSS meant that those stations were presumptively in competition with the Los Frailes service station. This testimony was exceptionally vague. LFSS neither presented corroboration nor explained why consumers would in practice choose among these stations. On the evidence submitted in this case, even viewing all reasonable inferences in LFSS's favor, proximity does not per se show actual competition.</p>\n<p>LFSS's reply to Shell's motion for summary judgment presented no other factual or legal basis for finding LFSS was in competition with favored retailers, and its attempts on appeal to create an issue of material fact on this point all depend on the exhibits in support of its stricken motion for summary judgment. We need go no further.<sup>[13]</sup> LFSS cannot satisfy the first prerequisite of its antitrust claims, and thus the district court properly granted Shell summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. LFSS's State Law Breach of Contract Counterclaim</h2>\n<p>Finally, we reject LFSS's argument that the district court erred in dismissing for failure to prosecute LFSS's breach of contract claim for additional rent due under the lease. We review dismissals for failure to prosecute under Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b) for an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Malot v. Dorado Beach Cottages Assocs.,</i> 478 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir.2007). There was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p>LFSS conceded before the district court in a 2007 show-cause hearing that this claim had been included only in a section of an earlier response to a motion to show cause. The district court could reasonably find there was no real development of this claim since 2003. LFSS's main argument before the district court was that the district court should nonetheless exercise its discretion not to deem the argument waived. LFSS made all its present arguments as to the lack of hardship to Shell before the district court, which carefully considered them. Nor, despite the extensive filings in this case, has LFSS at any point explained why this claim has merit. LFSS has also not developed the argument as to why this claim should not have been dismissed with prejudice; in any event, the district court's decision to dismiss a claim for failure to prosecute with or without prejudice is ordinarily within its discretion. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the district court's grant of a permanent injunction ordering LFSS to refrain from further use of any Shell trademarks, trade dress, or color patterns and ordering LFSS to comply with relevant post-termination contractual obligations. We <i>vacate,</i> without prejudice, the portion of the permanent injunction ordering and compelling LFSS to allow Shell to continue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station until the expiration of the lease in 2014. Shell is free to seek future injunctive relief should it be warranted. The district court's grant of summary judgment and its dismissal of LFSS's breach of contract counterclaim with prejudice are <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court later issued an amended order clarifying that Shell was entitled to injunctive relief only under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), to compel LFSS to stop further use of Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns. <i>See The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc.</i> (<i>Shell V</i>), No. 03-1623, slip op. at 1-2 (D.P.R. Dec. 30, 2008) (amended judgment); <i>The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc.</i> (<i>Shell IV</i>), 596 F.Supp.2d. 193, 201-03, 205 (D.P.R.2008) (opinion and order).</p>\n<p>[2]  In order to accurately describe the parties' interactions and the events leading up to this suit, all of which occurred before the merger, we refer to the plaintiff as \"Shell\" throughout and discuss the significance of the merger where relevant.</p>\n<p>[3]  Specifically, in addition to the rent specified in the lease, Shell agreed to pay LFSS an additional $0.02 per gallon for the first 480,000 gallons sold, and an additional $0.03 per gallon for every gallon over 490,000 that LFSS sold.</p>\n<p>[4]  LFSS's argument that the district court could not convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction without an evidentiary hearing fails. The district court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction only after issuing a show cause order to LFSS, and only after determining that LFSS had not advanced any new evidence or legal arguments beyond what it had presented at the preliminary injunction hearing. Under those circumstances, an evidentiary hearing would have served little purpose, and the district court's conversion was not error. <i>See </i><i>HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc.,</i> 847 F.2d 908, 915 (1st Cir.1988); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Owens,</i> 54 F.3d 271, 276-77 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>[5]  The parties have not briefed the question of whether this court is, in any event, bound by the bankruptcy court's determination that the lease remained in effect and Shell retained all its rights as a lessor under that agreement, though the district court relied on that judgment in rejecting LFSS's claims below. <i>See Shell III,</i> slip op. at 3.</p>\n<p>[6]  It is clear, and LFSS does not contest, that Shell provided adequate written notice of the termination here.</p>\n<p>[7]  The district court's interpretation of the PMPA reflects the law of this circuit: if any of the events listed in § 2802(c) occur, \"termination is conclusively presumed to be reasonable as a matter of law.\" <i>Desfosses v. Wallace Energy, Inc.,</i> 836 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1987). At least one other circuit also adopted this rule. <i>See </i><i>Hinkleman v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 962 F.2d 372, 377 (4th Cir.1992) (per curiam). <i>But see </i><i>Patel v. Sun Co., Inc.,</i> 141 F.3d 447, 456-57 (3d Cir.1998) (\"There is no question that at least some of the § 2802(c) relevant event exceptions mandate some form of judicial scrutiny.\"); <i>Marathon Petroleum Co. v. Pendleton,</i> 889 F.2d 1509, 1512 (6th Cir.1989) (suggesting that all terminations for events listed in § 2802(c) are subject to judicial scrutiny to determine whether they were objectively reasonable); <i>Sun Refining &amp; Mktg. Co. v. Rago,</i> 741 F.2d 670, 672-74 (3d Cir.1984) (holding that in light of the PMPA's purpose of benefitting franchisees, courts must look to whether franchisor terminations under § 2802(c)(8) and (9) are objectively reasonable and not presume reasonableness per se).</p>\n<p>[8]  Specifically, in 2000, before the CAP or the February 2001 rent benefit were implemented, LFSS's net operating income was $33,440, but it loaned more than $150,000 to its stockholders during the fiscal year. LFSS also took out substantial loans totaling about $675,000 before implementing the CAP, and LFSS paid out more than $200,000 to its president, the station operator, in 2000, 2002, and 2003.</p>\n<p>[9]  Specifically, this circuit looks to\n</p>\n<p>(1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the similarity of the goods (or, in a service mark case, the services); (3) the relationship between the parties' channels of trade; (4) the juxtaposition of their advertising; (5) the classes of prospective purchasers; (6) the evidence of actual confusion; (7) the defendant's intent in adopting its allegedly infringing mark; and (8) the strength of the plaintiff's mark.</p>\n<p><i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr.,</i> 103 F.3d 196, 201 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also </i><i>Visible Sys. Corp. v. Unisys Corp.,</i> 551 F.3d 65, 73 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[10]  We likewise reject LFSS's argument that Shell lacked standing to assert an injury on its Lanham Act claims because of Shell's 2006 acquisition and share purchase and its rebranding as Sol Puerto Rico, and specifically because Sol is not the registrant of the relevant Shell trademarks. Anyone \"who may suffer adverse consequences from a violation of section 1125(a) has standing to sue regardless of whether he is the registrant of the trademark.\" <i>Quabaug Rubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co., Inc.,</i> 567 F.2d 154, 160 (1st Cir. 1977); <i>see also </i><i>Waldman Publ'g Corp. v. Landoll, Inc.,</i> 43 F.3d 775, 784-85 (2d Cir.1994). Sol, as the owner of numerous Shell stations, plainly has an interest in preventing the confusion of the Shell brand with the inferior-quality fuel that LFSS sold while still displaying some Shell trademarks.</p>\n<p>[11]  Though LFSS broadly asserts that the PMPA does not allow franchisors to obtain injunctive relief against franchisees if the relief would give the franchisors property rights, LFSS does not claim that this prevents the district court from ordering LFSS to comply with its post-termination contractual obligations. In any event, we need not decide whether the PMPA allows franchisors to obtain injunctions to enforce those kinds of obligations. Shell's complaint also included a claim to judicially dispossess LFSS of the service station premises and equipment under Puerto Rican law, and Shell can obtain enforcement of the relevant post-termination contractual provisions on that basis. Shell did not, however, bring any state law claims that would provide an alternate basis for it to obtain an injunctive remedy involving the lease agreement in this suit.</p>\n<p>[12]  In any event, as the district court noted in its opinion granting summary judgment to Shell, the outcome would have been no different even if it had considered this untimely motion. LFSS's purported evidence that it was in actual competition with other, nearby retailers that it said received better prices from Shell was weak at best, and it failed to show price differentials. <i>See </i><i>Shell II,</i> 551 F.Supp.2d at 134 n. 3.</p>\n<p>[13]  We note that the district court amply explained why, even assuming arguendo that LFSS presented an issue of material fact on the question of whether it was in competition with favored retailers, there were no material issues of fact on the other required elements of this claim that would preclude Shell from obtaining judgment on the merits. <i>See </i><i>Shell II,</i> 551 F.Supp.2d at 134-35.</p>\n\n</div>",

(\"LFSS\"), which owned and operated the Los Frailes gasoline service station in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico as a Shell franchisee from 1997 until 2003. Shell terminated LFSS's franchise, and this appeal by LFSS primarily concerns the permanent injunction awarding Shell relief against LFSS and the dismissal of LFSS's counterclaims. The complications in this case arise from LFSS's dual status as the owner of the service station and surrounding property, in which capacity it leased the property to Shell, and as a retailer-franchisee, in which capacity LFSS subleased the service station from Shell to operate it.</p>\n<p>Since December 2003, when Shell first obtained a preliminary injunction, LFSS has been ordered to cease using Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns; to comply with all post-termination contractual provisions; and to \"immediately surrender the station in question, the storage tanks and all pertinent equipment to Shell, in order for Shell to designate a third party to operate the same.\" <i>The Shell Co.

The district court converted the preliminary injunction to a permanent injunction on January 29, 2007, ordering and compelling LFSS to cease any use of Shell trademarks, trade dress, or color patterns, to comply with the post-termination provisions of its franchise agreements with Shell, and, in addition, to allow Shell \"to continue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station, along with the subterraneous storage tanks and all pertinent equipment, until the expiration of [Shell's] rights under the lease agreement between the parties,\" set to expire in 2014. <i>The Shell Co.

We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by enjoining LFSS from further use of Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. We further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by compelling LFSS to comply with the post-termination provisions of its franchise agreements with Shell. The district court did, however, abuse its discretion by extending the injunction to compel LFSS \"to allow [Shell] to continue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station... until the expiration of [Shell]'s rights under the lease agreement between the parties\" in 2014. <i>Shell III,</i> slip op. at 2. We vacate that provision of the injunction, without prejudice to Shell's seeking further injunctive relief at a future date. We also hold that the district court properly granted Shell summary judgment on LFSS's counterclaims and that there was no abuse of discretion in dismissing LFSS's breach of contract counterclaim for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>The following facts are either uncontested or were stipulated by the parties.</p>\n<p>The gasoline service station located at the corner of State Road 177 and Muró Street in the Los Frailes area of Guaynabo has long been one of the busiest in the region. LFSS has owned this station and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> the property surrounding it since 1977. For several decades, LFSS sold Shell-brand gasoline as an independent retailer under a lease arrangement with Shell. In 1997, LFSS became a Shell franchisee.</p>\n<p>Three contracts, all signed on April 11, 1997, defined the franchise relationship between Shell and LFSS: an amended lease agreement, a retailer/sublease agreement, and a trademark and equipment agreement.</p>\n<p>The amended lease agreement extended Shell's 1992 lease of the service station and its surrounding property until February 28, 2014. The \"primary and essential purpose\" of the lease was to maintain a service station there, and, under the amended lease, Shell did not need LFSS's permission to sublease the station to a third party retailer to operate. In exchange for this leasehold, Shell agreed to pay graduated rent to LFSS based on the number of gallons of gasoline the retailer (whether LFSS or a third party) bought from Shell each month.</p>\n<p>Under the retailer/sublease agreement, Shell then subleased the station back to LFSS to operate as a Shell franchisee. As a Shell franchisee, LFSS had the right to operate the station under the Shell name, as an exclusive retailer of Shell-brand petroleum products. In exchange, LFSS agreed to certain obligations, including to purchase a minimum average of 300,000 gallons of fuel from Shell each month, to pay for Shell products on time each month on the check or credit terms set by Shell, to keep the station open and running during its hours of operation, and to operate the station for the exclusive purpose of selling only Shell-brand products.</p>\n<p>The trademark and equipment agreement governed LFSS's exclusive use of Shell trademarks and of equipment Shell provided to LFSS and also set out LFSS's maintenance, inventory, and delivery obligations. This agreement recognized Shell's ownership of the underground storage tanks and other equipment at the station and gave LFSS the right to use this equipment only to sell and store Shell-brand fuel when operating the station.</p>\n<p>These three agreements also included important provisions governing when the agreements could be terminated and the consequences of termination. The parties contest the interpretation of many of these provisions, and we discuss them further below.</p>\n<p>From 1997 to 2000, LFSS operated the Los Frailes station as a Shell station under the terms of these agreements. Beginning in 2000, the parties made several amendments to the lease agreement. A February 15, 2001, amendment, at issue in this case, gave LFSS a temporary rent benefit from Shell to encourage a higher volume of gasoline sales.<sup>[3]</sup> Under the amendment, this rent benefit would automatically continue every month unless Shell notified LFSS otherwise in writing.</p>\n<p>On July 2, 2001, Shell informed LFSS and its other Puerto Rican franchisees that it was implementing a Competitive Adjustment Program (CAP), and LFSS agreed to participate. The program established certain price zones for retailers and set maximum retail prices for Shell's retailers in those zones. In exchange, the CAP gave retailers discounts on wholesale fuel prices, again based on those zones. Following an investigation, the Puerto Rico Department of Justice ordered Shell to cease the CAP program on January 30, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> 2004, on the ground that it violated Puerto Rican antitrust law. Shell complied.</p>\n<p>LFSS participated in the CAP for the duration of its franchise with Shell. Though LFSS now contests whether the CAP displaced the temporary rent benefit Shell implemented in February 2001, LFSS does not contest the district court's factual finding that LFSS sent Shell an April 9, 2002 letter proposing \"a temporary adjustment in rent for LFSS as we had in the first quarter of last year.\" We discuss the CAP in further detail below.</p>\n<p>By early 2003, LFSS was suffering from cash flow problems and so did not pay for more than $80,000 worth of Shell's fuel deliveries. Shell, pursuant to the retailer/sublease agreement, also implemented a hard cash payment policy and required LFSS to pay for Shell products by certified check at delivery.</p>\n<p>During the weekend of May 17 and 18, 2003, LFSS instead tried to pay for two deliveries with personal checks. On Monday, May 19, Shell told LFSS that until LFSS paid for the weekend deliveries with certified checks, Shell would not make any further deliveries. LFSS did not comply; there were no further deliveries, LFSS ran out of fuel to sell, and the station temporarily closed. That same day, May 19, LFSS sent Shell a letter stating that Shell had not paid the February 2001 additional rent benefit since July 2001 (when the CAP went into effect), that Shell had not sent written notice of its cancellation, and that Shell therefore immediately owed the balance of the additional rent from July 2001 until April 2003.</p>\n<p>On May 21, 2003, LFSS sent Shell a letter purportedly cancelling their entire commercial relationship, including the lease, citing Shell's alleged failure to pay LFSS the additional rent and its alleged obligation to deliver fuel to LFSS. LFSS then purchased fuel from other refiners and distributors, covered some but not all of the Shell trademarks at the station, and began selling non-Shell-brand fuel. LFSS also put up signs saying \"We Do Not Sell Shell Gasoline.\" The signs were not prominently displayed.</p>\n<p>On May 23, 2003, Shell informed LFSS by letter that it was terminating LFSS's franchise, which Shell said terminated the retailer/sublease agreement and trademarks and equipment agreement but not the underlying lease agreement under which Shell leased the property from LFSS. Shell said that LFSS's termination of the lease was invalid because LFSS had not complied with the lease termination provisions. Shell then demanded that LFSS honor its obligations under the lease and under the post-termination provisions of the retailer/sublease and equipment and trademark agreements by immediately vacating the service station premises and turning over Shell's equipment.</p>\n<p>LFSS instead continued to operate the service station by selling non-Shell-brand fuel at the service station. Shell then brought assorted federal and state law claims against LFSS in the federal district court of Puerto Rico less than two weeks later, on June 3, 2003, eventually culminating in this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. The Parties' Claims</h2>\n<p>Before delving into the legal analysis, we summarize Shell and LFSS's respective claims and counterclaims.</p>\n<p>Shell's claims against LFSS proceed from Shell's contention that it validly terminated LFSS's franchise on May 23, 2003. Shell says it was entitled to do so under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (\"PMPA\"), 15 U.S.C. § 2801 <i>et seq.,</i> a federal law that regulates franchisors' termination of franchises, because of LFSS's failure to pay for fuel deliveries, its unreasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> closing of the station, and its sale of non-Shell fuel while displaying Shell trademarks.</p>\n<p>Shell claims LFSS's post-termination actions violated Shell's rights in two respects. First, Shell says that LFSS created a likelihood that consumers would be confused or deceived when it sold non-Shell products while displaying Shell trademarks, in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). On this basis, Shell requested, and the district court granted, injunctive relief to stop LFSS from using Shell trademarks, trade dress, or color patterns. <i>See </i><i>Shell IV,</i> 596 F.Supp.2d at 203-05; <i>Shell I,</i> slip op. at 29-31.</p>\n<p>Second, Shell says its termination of the franchise left its underlying lease of the station from LFSS intact. Shell further claimed that LFSS's refusal to vacate the premises and to allow Shell to exercise its property rights over the station as a lessor violated the terms of the lease, as well as various post-termination provisions in the retailer/sublease and trademark and equipment agreements requiring LFSS to relinquish possession of the station. This was the district court's basis for compelling LFSS to comply with all post-termination contractual provisions and for the separate provision of the injunction allowing Shell to remain in possession of the service station until the expiration of its lease in 2014. <i>See Shell I,</i> slip op. at 27-29, 32-34.</p>\n<p>LFSS makes several arguments as to why the district court abused its discretion in granting Shell a permanent injunction. LFSS first claims that it validly terminated all contracts, including the lease, on May 21, 2003, two days before Shell purportedly terminated the franchise. In the alternative, LFSS says, Shell's termination of the franchise was not valid under the PMPA, and the district court erred in finding otherwise.</p>\n<p>LFSS further argues that the district court erred in granting injunctive relief. It contests the injunction on Shell's Lanham Act claim, urging that the evidence was contradictory and insufficient to support a likelihood of confusion. In any event, LFSS says, Shell is not entitled to the specific remedy of an injunction to enforce the lease, which gives Shell possession until 2014, whether under the PMPA or any of Shell's other claims, and the district court erred in finding otherwise. This last issue is potentially the most difficult in the case, raising questions about the scope of injunctive relief available to franchisors under the PMPA.</p>\n<p>LFSS also argues that the district court erred in granting Shell summary judgment on LFSS's counterclaim that Shell's CAP program violated federal and Puerto Rican antitrust law. Specifically, LFSS argues that the district court abused its discretion by striking LFSS's cross-motion for summary judgment and denying its motion for reconsideration. Its main substantive challenge, however, is that the district court erroneously made factual inferences in Shell's favor when granting summary judgment to Shell on LFSS's antitrust claims and that there were material issues of fact precluding summary judgment. Finally, LFSS says the district court abused its discretion by dismissing its state law breach of contract counterclaim for failure to prosecute, because, LFSS insists, it diligently asserted this claim.</p>\n<p>We analyze LFSS's challenges to the permanent injunction, summary judgment, and dismissal of its breach of contract counterclaim in turn. We vacate only the portion of the district court's injunction allowing Shell to continue in possession of the Los Frailes service station until 2014, when its lease expires, and we affirm the district court's judgment on all other grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> III. Shell's Claims against LFSS</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion; we review its underlying conclusions of law de novo and any factual findings for clear error.<sup>[4]</sup><i>García-Rubiera v.

LFSS's claims of error cut across these criteria.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. LFSS's Purported Termination of the Lease Agreement</h2>\n<p>LFSS's primary argument on appeal is that LFSS validly terminated its lease of the Los Frailes station to Shell on May 21, 2003, and that the district court therefore erred by granting Shell an injunction that gave Shell possession of the service station.</p>\n<p>We reject this argument; LFSS's attempt to terminate the lease on May 21 was plainly invalid.<sup>[5]</sup> Even assuming dubitante that Shell had defaulted on its lease obligations, article 17 of the lease provided that LFSS could terminate the lease in the event of default only after a sixty-day curative period. LFSS admits that its May 21, 2003, letter of termination cited Shell's purported breaches as the grounds for termination and did not comply with the sixty-day curative requirement.</p>\n<p>Instead, LFSS claims that a different part of the lease agreement, article 7, authorized LFSS to terminate the lease with Shell immediately, without any sixty-day curative period, on the sole condition that LFSS pay Shell for the cost of the improvements and alterations Shell had made to the station, less depreciation.</p>\n<p>Because LFSS only developed this interpretation of article 7 at oral argument and not in its briefs, this argument is waived. <i>See </i><i>Mass. Museum of Contemporary Art Found. v. Büchel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204153\"><a href=\"/opinion/204153/massachusetts-museum-contemp-art-foun-v-buchel/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2010). Even if the argument were properly before this court, it would fail. Article 7 states in relevant part that \"[i]f this lease is terminated before the expiration of its term ... for causes attributable to [LFSS],\" LFSS, \"in addition to any other remedy under the contract,\" must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> \"immediately pay [Shell] an amount equivalent to the amount not depreciated (or amortized) of the improvements and permanent alterations made by [Shell] in the Property, in the Station or in the surrounding areas.\" This is plainly a liquidated damages provision addressing the consequences of termination, not the conditions under which the parties could terminate the agreement. It cannot be construed as an open-ended alternative to the limitations on termination set out in article 17.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Shell's PMPA Claim</h2>\n<p>In the alternative, LFSS argues that the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that Shell's termination of LFSS's franchise complied with the PMPA. Absent a valid termination, LFSS suggests, Shell suffered no irreparable injury, since Shell's asserted harms arose from LFSS's alleged failure to comply with the consequences of franchise termination. Those consequences include the loss of LFSS's right to use Shell's trademarks and equipment and to sublease and operate the service station. This argument also fails; we reject its assumption that Shell's termination was invalid.</p>\n<p>The PMPA, enacted in 1978, addressed franchisors' \"allegedly unfair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the petroleum industry\" by \"establish[ing] minimum federal standards governing the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum franchises.\" <i>Mac's Shell Serv., Inc. v. Shell Oil Prods. Co. LLC,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1730\"><a href=\"/opinion/1730/macs-shell-service-inc-v-shell-oil-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1251</span></a></span>, 1255, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1730\"><a href=\"/opinion/1730/macs-shell-service-inc-v-shell-oil-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span> (2010). Under provisions of the PMPA, franchisors can terminate or fail to renew a franchise \"only if the franchisor provides written notice and takes the action in question for a reason specifically recognized in the statute.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Reasons recognized in the statute for termination include \"[t]he occurrence of an event which is ... relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise ... is reasonable.\" 15 U.S.C. § 2802(b)(2)(C). The PMPA explicitly includes \"failure by the franchisee to pay the franchisor in a timely manner,\" <i>id.</i> § 2802(c)(8), \"failure by the franchisee to operate the marketing premises for ... an unreasonable period of time\" under the circumstances, <i>id.</i> § 2802(c)(9)(B), and \"willful adulteration, mislabeling or misbranding of motor fuels or other trademark violations of the franchisee,\" <i>id.</i> § 2802(c)(10), as examples of such events.</p>\n<p>LFSS does not contest that it failed to make payments on time, temporarily closed the station, and sold non-Shell-brand fuel. Rather, it argues that the PMPA requires courts to determine whether a termination based on these events was objectively reasonable under the circumstances, not just whether an event listed under § 2802(c) technically occurred. The circumstances here, LFSS says, made Shell's termination unreasonable, because the cash flow problems leading to these three events were caused by Shell's alleged violation of antitrust laws and its purported failure to pay LFSS the temporary rent benefit Shell agreed to in February 2001. Those two allegations are also the basis for LFSS's counterclaims against Shell.</p>\n<p>The district court rejected this argument, holding as a matter of law that Shell's termination of the franchise was per se reasonable because the termination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> was based on those three, explicitly listed statutory grounds for termination. <i>See Shell I,</i> slip op. at 19-21. The district court's reasoning suggested that the termination was valid even under an objective reasonableness standard. It found that LFSS's claim that Shell's nonpayment of the rent benefit caused LFSS's cash flow problems lacked merit because of LFSS's April 2002 admission in its letter to Shell that the February 2001 rent benefit was no longer in effect. <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>We need not evaluate the wisdom of a per se rule that termination is reasonable if an event listed in § 2802(c) occurs.<sup>[7]</sup> LFSS could not prevail even if we reviewed whether Shell's termination was objectively reasonable. The district court did not clearly err in finding that the February 2001 rent benefit was temporary, long since terminated, and could not have been responsible for LFSS's May 2003 cash flow problems. In any event, uncontested record evidence shows that LFSS's cash flow problems, culminating in its inability to pay Shell for deliveries, had a number of causes unrelated to Shell's actions with respect to the CAP or the temporary rent benefit.<sup>[8]</sup> Shell's termination of the franchise was valid under the PMPA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Shell's Lanham Act Claim</h2>\n<p>LFSS also challenges the district court's grant of a permanent injunction preventing LFSS from further using Shell trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns. The district court reasoned that this relief was warranted under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), because LFSS's sale of non-Shell products while displaying Shell trademarks was likely to cause confusion as to the origin of LFSS's petroleum products. <i>See Shell I,</i> slip op. at 29-32; <i>Shell IV,</i> 596 F.Supp.2d at 202-03 (limiting injunctive relief to § 1125(a)).</p>\n<p>Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act creates civil liability for \"any person who ... uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device ... which ... is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A). This circuit generally looks to a non-exclusive, multi-factor list to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists.<sup>[9]</sup> That list is merely illustrative, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> however; the purpose of the inquiry is simply to determine whether \"the allegedly infringing conduct carries with it a likelihood of confounding an appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising ordinary care.\" <i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732304\"><a href=\"/opinion/732304/the-international-association-of-machinists-and-aerospace-workers-afl-cio/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 201 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>The application of those factors to the record is a highly fact-intensive inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Visible Sys. Corp. v. Unisys Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203606\"><a href=\"/opinion/203606/visible-systems-corp-v-unisys-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 73-74 (1st Cir.2008). That is especially so given that LFSS is challenging the district court's decision to limit the evidence to Shell's photographs and the persuasiveness of that evidence. We accordingly review the district court's finding of a likelihood of confusion for clear error, and hold that the district court did not clearly err in its finding.</p>\n<p>There is no need to go through a mechanical application of the multi-factor list to reach this conclusion. The district court properly rejected LFSS's argument that Shell's photographs of still-visible Shell trademarks at the Los Frailes service station are unpersuasive and unreliable evidence. LFSS presented evidence squarely challenging Shell's photographs only in 2007 and had previously made stipulations at odds with the 2007 evidence that it presented. <i>See </i><i>Shell IV,</i> 596 F.Supp.2d at 201-02.</p>\n<p>Moreover, beyond the photographic evidence, it is uncontested that LFSS had operated a Shell station on the premises for more than a decade, and that LFSS covered up some, but not all, of the Shell trademarks displayed at the Los Frailes station while selling non-Shell-brand fuel. It is also uncontested that LFSS failed to alter the overall appearance of the service station, which retained the trade dress of a Shell station. LFSS further conceded before the district court that the fuel it sold after May 21, 2003, was of inferior quality to the fuel it had previously sold under Shell trademarks. <i>Shell I,</i> slip op. at 24. LFSS's brief on appeal concedes that the station continued to serve the same potential customers before and after the franchise termination.</p>\n<p>These facts amply support the district court's finding that when LFSS began selling non-Shell-brand fuel without completely obscuring the Shell trademarks at the station, LFSS's actions were substantially likely to confuse reasonably prudent consumers. Given that the Los Frailes station had been identified with the Shell brand for over a decade and that Shell trademarks were still visible at the station, LFSS's signs stating \"We Do Not Sell Shell Gasoline\" were not enough to avoid likely confusion, not least because customers could only see those signs after they were already at the gas pump.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> D. The Provision of the Injunction Ordering LFSS to Allow Shell to Retain Possession of the Service Station until the Expiration of the Lease</h2>\n<p>We next address LFSS's argument that the district court abused its discretion in granting the portion of the injunction that compelled LFSS \"to allow [Shell] to continue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station ... until the expiration of [Shell]'s rights under the lease agreement between the parties\" in 2014. <i>Shell III,</i> slip op. at 2.</p>\n<p>The district court did not provide any specific reasoning in its opinion as to why this particular provision of the injunction, guaranteeing Shell's continued presence for a number of years into the future, was necessary to remedy the irreparable harms associated with Shell's loss of goodwill and market presence. Those harms derived from LFSS's failure to comply with the consequences of its franchise termination, including the termination of LFSS's sublease of the service station from Shell and LFSS's obligation to cease operating the station as Shell's designated retailer/sublessee. <i>Shell I,</i> slip op. at 28-29. But the district court's injunction included a separate provision specifically requiring LFSS to comply with the post-termination provisions of the retailer/sublease agreement and the trademark and equipment agreement. <i>Id.</i> The portion of the injunction requiring LFSS to also allow Shell to remain in possession of the service station until its rights under the lease expired in 2014 was in addition to, and separate from, that provision. <i>Id.</i> The district court appears to have reasoned that the PMPA allows franchisors to obtain injunctions based on an underlying lease agreement, not merely injunctions to enforce post-termination provisions of franchise agreements. <i>Id.</i> at 27-29.</p>\n<p>On appeal, LFSS does not challenge the portion of the injunction ordering it to comply with post-termination clauses in the franchise agreements. Nor does LFSS dispute that those contractual clauses provided that \"[i]f this Contract is terminated or non-renewed, [LFSS] will deliver the Station and the Equipment to [Shell]\" within twenty-four hours of termination. Once LFSS's sublease of the station from Shell ended, LFSS had to vacate the premises. Shell then could presumably enter into another sublease with a new retailer to operate the service station. It is unclear from the record whether that has in fact happened.</p>\n<p>Instead, LFSS's argument is that the district court should not have added the additional portion of the injunction compelling LFSS to allow Shell to possess the station <i>until</i> Shell's rights under the lease expire in 2014. LFSS is essentially arguing that franchisors like Shell cannot use the PMPA to obtain this kind of injunctive remedy, as distinct from whatever post-termination obligations LFSS has under the franchise agreements.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> We agree that the district court abused its discretion in ordering LFSS to allow Shell to continue in possession of the Los Frailes service station until Shell's rights under the lease expired.</p>\n<p>Here, Shell made no showing of irreparable harm that might justify an order giving it possession of the property for the full term of the lease, until 2014. The post-termination provisions of the retailer/sublease and trademark and equipment contracts adequately protected Shell's right to resume possession of the station and its equipment. We see no basis for further ordering LFSS to allow Shell to possess the property until 2014 under the lease; the district court's order compelling LFSS to comply with these post-termination provisions sufficiently protected Shell's interests. The district court did not hold that any violations of the lease by LFSS may have caused discrete, irreparable harms to Shell or that injunctive relief would be the remedy for such harms.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the terms of this portion of the injunction appear to allow Shell to continue possessing the property and service station until the lease expires even if Shell, in the future, breaches its obligations under the lease. Shell plainly cannot be entitled to that remedy, which goes even beyond ordering enforcement of the lease agreement.</p>\n<p>We vacate this portion of the injunction alone, without prejudice. Shell is free to try to obtain this remedy at a later date if future events warrant it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. LFSS's Antitrust Counterclaim against Shell</h2>\n<p>LFSS also appeals the district court's decision to strike LFSS's cross-motion for summary judgment and its grant of summary judgment to Shell on LFSS's federal and state law antitrust counterclaims.</p>\n<p>We review a district court's decision to strike a motion for summary judgment for an abuse of discretion when it is stricken for a failure to comply with the terms of a case-management order. <i>See </i><i>Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197880\"><a href=\"/opinion/197880/rosario-diaz-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 315 (1st Cir.1998) (holding that case management-related decisions are generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion). We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and make all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant, LFSS. <i>Boston &amp; Me. Corp. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204082\"><a href=\"/opinion/204082/boston-and-maine-v-massachusetts-bay-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 98 (1st Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). \"We may affirm ... on any basis in the record.\" <i>Chiang v. Verizon New England, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2010). We affirm both rulings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Striking LFSS's Summary Judgment Motion</h2>\n<p>LFSS's argument that the district court erred in striking its motion for summary judgment ignores the salient fact that LFSS's motion was filed on January 3, 2007, weeks after the conclusion of discovery, and well after the September 1, 2006, deadline the district court imposed for dispositive motions.</p>\n<p>LFSS argues on appeal that the district court's extension of discovery until November 30, 2006, effectively extended or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> vacated the September 1 deadline. That argument, however, does not provide a persuasive ground for questioning the district court's discretionary case management decisions. <i>See </i><i>Perez-Cordero v. Wal-Mart P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202096\"><a href=\"/opinion/202096/perez-cordero-v-wal-mart-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 533 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315. LFSS had numerous opportunities to request a filing extension for its summary judgment motion at various status conferences after the September deadline; it took none of them. Nor has LFSS presented any convincing reason for the delay in filing this motion.<sup>[12]</sup> There was no abuse of discretion in denying LFSS's summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The District Court Properly Granted Summary Judgment to Shell on LFSS's Antitrust Counterclaim</h2>\n<p>LFSS further argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment against it on its claims under the Robinson-Patman Act and equivalent provisions of Puerto Rican antitrust law because, it says, there were contested material issues of fact as to various elements of that claim even absent the evidence submitted in its stricken motion for summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, prohibits price discrimination among different purchasers of like commodities if \"the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce,\" among other consequences. 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). The Robinson-Patman Act prohibits, inter alia, actions \"directed at injuring competition among the discriminating seller's customers,\" referred to as \"secondary line violations.\" <i>See </i><i>Able Sales Co., Inc. v. Compañía de Azucar de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201568\"><a href=\"/opinion/201568/able-sales-co-inc-v-compania-de-azucar/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>LFSS claims that Shell engaged in secondary-line violations through the CAP program Shell implemented in July 2001. LFSS says that in establishing price zones for retailers, the CAP offered certain Shell retailers (those operating Shell-owned stations) more favorable prices on Shell fuel than LFSS and other retailer-owned stations received.</p>\n<p>One of the basic requirements of competitive injury, however, is a showing of \"actual competition\" between the disfavored retailer (LFSS) and those retailers benefiting from the price discrimination. <i>Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc. v. Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145696\"><a href=\"/opinion/145696/volvo-trucks-north-america-inc-v-reeder-simco-gmc-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 177, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145696\"><a href=\"/opinion/145696/volvo-trucks-north-america-inc-v-reeder-simco-gmc-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145696\"><a href=\"/opinion/145696/volvo-trucks-north-america-inc-v-reeder-simco-gmc-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span> (2006).</p>\n<p>The central reason LFSS's argument fails is because, as the district court found, LFSS presented no evidence that it was actually in competition with the retailers it said were the beneficiaries of the CAP. LFSS's response to Shell's motion for summary judgment simply asserted that under an August 2005 Puerto Rican law, P.R. Laws. Ann., tit. 23, § 1104, the entire island constituted a single price zone and that all retailers were presumptively each other's competitors. But that law was marginally relevant at best. It was a non-retroactive law implemented two years after this suit began, and a year after the CAP was discontinued. <i>See Shell III,</i> slip op. at 8-9.</p>\n<p>We likewise reject LFSS's argument that the deposition testimony showing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> three other Shell stations were within two miles of LFSS meant that those stations were presumptively in competition with the Los Frailes service station. This testimony was exceptionally vague. LFSS neither presented corroboration nor explained why consumers would in practice choose among these stations. On the evidence submitted in this case, even viewing all reasonable inferences in LFSS's favor, proximity does not per se show actual competition.</p>\n<p>LFSS's reply to Shell's motion for summary judgment presented no other factual or legal basis for finding LFSS was in competition with favored retailers, and its attempts on appeal to create an issue of material fact on this point all depend on the exhibits in support of its stricken motion for summary judgment. We need go no further.<sup>[13]</sup> LFSS cannot satisfy the first prerequisite of its antitrust claims, and thus the district court properly granted Shell summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. LFSS's State Law Breach of Contract Counterclaim</h2>\n<p>Finally, we reject LFSS's argument that the district court erred in dismissing for failure to prosecute LFSS's breach of contract claim for additional rent due under the lease. We review dismissals for failure to prosecute under Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b) for an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Malot v. Dorado Beach Cottages Assocs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202644\"><a href=\"/opinion/202644/malot-v-dorado-beach-cottage/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2007). There was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p>LFSS conceded before the district court in a 2007 show-cause hearing that this claim had been included only in a section of an earlier response to a motion to show cause. The district court could reasonably find there was no real development of this claim since 2003. LFSS's main argument before the district court was that the district court should nonetheless exercise its discretion not to deem the argument waived. LFSS made all its present arguments as to the lack of hardship to Shell before the district court, which carefully considered them. Nor, despite the extensive filings in this case, has LFSS at any point explained why this claim has merit. LFSS has also not developed the argument as to why this claim should not have been dismissed with prejudice; in any event, the district court's decision to dismiss a claim for failure to prosecute with or without prejudice is ordinarily within its discretion. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the district court's grant of a permanent injunction ordering LFSS to refrain from further use of any Shell trademarks, trade dress, or color patterns and ordering LFSS to comply with relevant post-termination contractual obligations. We <i>vacate,</i> without prejudice, the portion of the permanent injunction ordering and compelling LFSS to allow Shell to continue in possession of the Los Frailes Service Station until the expiration of the lease in 2014. Shell is free to seek future injunctive relief should it be warranted. The district court's grant of summary judgment and its dismissal of LFSS's breach of contract counterclaim with prejudice are <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court later issued an amended order clarifying that Shell was entitled to injunctive relief only under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), to compel LFSS to stop further use of Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns. <i>See The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc.</i> (<i>Shell V</i>), No. 03-1623, slip op. at 1-2 (D.P.R. Dec. 30, 2008) (amended judgment); <i>The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc.</i> (<i>Shell IV</i>), 596 F.Supp.2d. 193, 201-03, 205 (D.P.R.2008) (opinion and order).</p>\n<p>[2]  In order to accurately describe the parties' interactions and the events leading up to this suit, all of which occurred before the merger, we refer to the plaintiff as \"Shell\" throughout and discuss the significance of the merger where relevant.</p>\n<p>[3]  Specifically, in addition to the rent specified in the lease, Shell agreed to pay LFSS an additional $0.02 per gallon for the first 480,000 gallons sold, and an additional $0.03 per gallon for every gallon over 490,000 that LFSS sold.</p>\n<p>[4]  LFSS's argument that the district court could not convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction without an evidentiary hearing fails. The district court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction only after issuing a show cause order to LFSS, and only after determining that LFSS had not advanced any new evidence or legal arguments beyond what it had presented at the preliminary injunction hearing. Under those circumstances, an evidentiary hearing would have served little purpose, and the district court's conversion was not error. <i>See </i><i>HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506586\"><a href=\"/opinion/506586/hmg-property-investors-inc-v-parque-industrial-rio-canas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 915 (1st Cir.1988); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Owens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695546\"><a href=\"/opinion/695546/united-states-of-america-v-stan-d-owens-van-wert-county-sheriff-john-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 276-77 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>[5]  The parties have not briefed the question of whether this court is, in any event, bound by the bankruptcy court's determination that the lease remained in effect and Shell retained all its rights as a lessor under that agreement, though the district court relied on that judgment in rejecting LFSS's claims below. <i>See Shell III,</i> slip op. at 3.</p>\n<p>[6]  It is clear, and LFSS does not contest, that Shell provided adequate written notice of the termination here.</p>\n<p>[7]  The district court's interpretation of the PMPA reflects the law of this circuit: if any of the events listed in § 2802(c) occur, \"termination is conclusively presumed to be reasonable as a matter of law.\" <i>Desfosses v. Wallace Energy, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499438\"><a href=\"/opinion/499438/charles-h-desfosses-v-wallace-energy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1987). At least one other circuit also adopted this rule. <i>See </i><i>Hinkleman v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582575\"><a href=\"/opinion/582575/francis-george-hinkleman-v-shell-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 377 (4th Cir.1992) (per curiam). <i>But see </i><i>Patel v. Sun Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752998\"><a href=\"/opinion/752998/prakash-h-patel-shobha-p-patel-hw-v-sun-company-inc-lancaster/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 456-57 (3d Cir.1998) (\"There is no question that at least some of the § 2802(c) relevant event exceptions mandate some form of judicial scrutiny.\"); <i>Marathon Petroleum Co. v.

LFSS also took out substantial loans totaling about $675,000 before implementing the CAP, and LFSS paid out more than $200,000 to its president, the station operator, in 2000, 2002, and 2003.</p>\n<p>[9]  Specifically, this circuit looks to\n</p>\n<p>(1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the similarity of the goods (or, in a service mark case, the services); (3) the relationship between the parties' channels of trade; (4) the juxtaposition of their advertising; (5) the classes of prospective purchasers; (6) the evidence of actual confusion; (7) the defendant's intent in adopting its allegedly infringing mark; and (8) the strength of the plaintiff's mark.</p>\n<p><i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732304\"><a href=\"/opinion/732304/the-international-association-of-machinists-and-aerospace-workers-afl-cio/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 201 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also </i><i>Visible Sys. Corp. v.

Anyone \"who may suffer adverse consequences from a violation of section 1125(a) has standing to sue regardless of whether he is the registrant of the trademark.\" <i>Quabaug Rubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"351555\"><a href=\"/opinion/351555/quabaug-rubber-company-v-fabiano-shoe-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 160 (1st Cir. 1977); <i>see also </i><i>Waldman Publ'g Corp. v. Landoll, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685594\"><a href=\"/opinion/685594/waldman-publishing-corp-and-playmore-inc-publishers-v-landoll-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 784-85 (2d Cir.1994). Sol, as the owner of numerous Shell stations, plainly has an interest in preventing the confusion of the Shell brand with the inferior-quality fuel that LFSS sold while still displaying some Shell trademarks.</p>\n<p>[11]  Though LFSS broadly asserts that the PMPA does not allow franchisors to obtain injunctive relief against franchisees if the relief would give the franchisors property rights, LFSS does not claim that this prevents the district court from ordering LFSS to comply with its post-termination contractual obligations. In any event, we need not decide whether the PMPA allows franchisors to obtain injunctions to enforce those kinds of obligations. Shell's complaint also included a claim to judicially dispossess LFSS of the service station premises and equipment under Puerto Rican law, and Shell can obtain enforcement of the relevant post-termination contractual provisions on that basis. Shell did not, however, bring any state law claims that would provide an alternate basis for it to obtain an injunctive remedy involving the lease agreement in this suit.</p>\n<p>[12]  In any event, as the district court noted in its opinion granting summary judgment to Shell, the outcome would have been no different even if it had considered this untimely motion. LFSS's purported evidence that it was in actual competition with other, nearby retailers that it said received better prices from Shell was weak at best, and it failed to show price differentials. <i>See </i><i>Shell II,</i> 551 F.Supp.2d at 134 n. 3.</p>\n<p>[13]  We note that the district court amply explained why, even assuming arguendo that LFSS presented an issue of material fact on the question of whether it was in competition with favored retailers, there were no material issues of fact on the other required elements of this claim that would preclude Shell from obtaining judgment on the merits. <i>See </i><i>Shell II,</i> 551 F.Supp.2d at 134-35.</p>\n\n</div>",
