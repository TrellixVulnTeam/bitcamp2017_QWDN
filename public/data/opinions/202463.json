Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n               Torruella, Selya and Dyk,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     David J.

This    is   a    habeas       case.        The\n\npetitioner, Anthony Olszewski III (“Olszewski”), was convicted of\n\nfirst-degree murder in the Massachusetts state courts.                              He claims\n\nthat his due process rights were violated when the Commonwealth\n\npermitted the destruction of exculpatory evidence prior to trial\n\nand   made   improper    statements        in     closing        arguments      at       trial.\n\nOlszewski    also   seeks     relief      on     the    grounds     that       he    received\n\nineffective    assistance         of    counsel        and   that   the    trial         court\n\nimproperly     dismissed      a        sitting     juror      based       on        ex    parte\n\ncommunications.      We conclude that none of these claims warrants\n\nhabeas relief, and therefore affirm the district court’s denial of\n\nthe petition.\n\n                                           I.\n\n             Joanne Welch was murdered sometime between 7 and 9 P.M.\n\non January 28, 1982.        Olszewski and Welch had been involved in a\n\nromantic relationship that ended approximately one month before\n\nWelch’s murder.         Prior to the murder, Welch had begun dating\n\nanother man, which upset Olszewski.                     On the day of the murder,\n\nseveral of Olszewski’s friends heard Olszewski threaten to kill\n\nWelch. That same day, Welch told family members and coworkers that\n\nshe planned to drive to Olszewski’s house after work to retrieve\n\nher personal belongings and some money.                      She intended to return\n\nhome for dinner and expected a call from her new boyfriend to\n\narrange a date for the evening of January 28.                             Welch visited\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fOlszewski’s house and retrieved her belongings, but never returned\n\nhome.\n\n            On       January    29,    1982,    on   Great   Plains   Road     in   West\n\nSpringfield, Massachusetts, the police located shoes and earrings\n\nbelonging       to   Welch     along   with    two   teeth,   a   strip   of    chrome\n\nautomobile trim, and a belt hanging from a tree.                  The police found\n\nWelch’s body seven miles away.                 She had fractures to her jaw and\n\npelvis, bruising, abrasions, and several missing teeth.                      The teeth\n\nfound on Great Plains Road appeared to be Welch’s.                             Welch’s\n\ninjuries were consistent with blows from a fist or foot and\n\nstrangulation.         On January 30, the police found Welch’s car parked\n\nnext to a Westfield, Massachusetts bowling alley. There was blood,\n\nhair, and fiber belonging to Welch in the car, and a strip of\n\nchrome trim was missing from the passenger side.\n\n            Olszewski admitted that Welch came to his house on\n\nJanuary 28; his defense was alibi during the period of time that\n\nthe murder was committed.              He claimed that Welch left his house\n\naround 6:30 that evening, and that between 7 and 9 P.M.,1 he was in\n\nthe company of his friend, Philip Strong.                     Olszewski met other\n\nfriends around 9 P.M.\n\n\n            1\n               Exactly when Olszewski allegedly met with Strong is\nunclear. The Supreme Judicial Court found that Olszewski “told the\npolice that he was in the company of Philip Strong between 7 and 9\nP.M.” Commonwealth v. Olszewski, 416 Mass. 707, 710, 625 N.E.2d\n529, 533 (1993). At trial, however, Officer Whitehead testified\nthat Olszewski said that he met Strong at the Y.M.C.A. at 7:30 P.M.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f            On January 31, 1982, Strong provided the police with a\n\nwritten statement corroborating Olszewski’s alibi. On February 15,\n\n1982, the police questioned Strong a second time, and Strong\n\nadmitted    that   the   first   statement    was   false.      Contrary    to\n\nestablished procedures, the police did not copy the first statement\n\nand left Strong alone with the only copy of the statement.             Strong\n\nripped it up and threw the pieces in the trash.                 Strong then\n\nprovided the police with a second statement that stated that, on\n\nJanuary 29, Olszewski told Strong that Olszewski had murdered\n\nWelch. The police did not attempt to retrieve the first statement\n\nuntil later that night when Officer Sypek looked in the trash for\n\nthe pieces and found that the trash had already been emptied.              The\n\nfirst statement was never recovered.\n\n            On February 12, 1983, Olszewski was convicted of Welch’s\n\nmurder based in large part on Strong’s testimony.                 On direct\n\nappeal,    the   Massachusetts   Supreme     Judicial   Court   vacated    the\n\nconviction and remanded the case based on the prosecution’s use at\n\ntrial of evidence that was lost or destroyed.2                  The   Supreme\n\nJudicial Court instructed the trial court that on remand, under\n\n\n\n            2\n               The lost evidence at issue on appeal included\nStrong’s first statement, the belt, blood samples taken from the\nroad and parking lot, a paint chip taken from Welch’s skin, a\ncarpet swatch taken from Welch’s vehicle, an automobile window\ncrank handle, and a plastic cup lid found in Welch’s vehicle. Some\nof this evidence, but not Strong’s first statement, was recovered\nafter the Supreme Judicial Court’s order but before the trial court\nconducted an evidentiary hearing.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fCommonwealth v. Willie, 400 Mass. 427, 510 N.E.2d 258 (1987),\n\n“[f]or each piece of missing evidence shown to be potentially\n\nexculpatory,       the   judge     must     weigh       the   culpability    of     the\n\nCommonwealth and its agents, the materiality of the evidence, and\n\nthe   potential     prejudice      to    the     defendant.”        Commonwealth     v.\n\nOlszewski, 401 Mass. 749, 757, 519 N.E.2d 587, 592 (1988).                        It is\n\nunclear whether the Supreme Judicial Court’s decision to vacate was\n\nbased in part on the destruction of Strong’s first statement.                       On\n\nthe one hand, there is language in the opinion directing the trial\n\ncourt to consider the destruction of Strong’s first statement on\n\nthe   remand.       On   the     other    hand,    the    Supreme    Judicial     Court\n\nconcluded that “the defense counsel fully described to the jury the\n\ncircumstances of the making and the destruction of Strong’s first\n\nstatement.       The defense thoroughly cross-examined, and effectively\n\nimpeached,       Strong.         The     judge     properly       admitted   Strong’s\n\ntestimony.”\n\n           Nonetheless on remand the trial court considered the\n\nremand order as extending to the destruction of Strong’s first\n\nstatement.        The    trial    court    held     a    series    of   hearings    and\n\nsuppressed certain evidence on the ground that the state destroyed\n\nthe predicate physical evidence.3                At the hearing, the trial judge\n\nconsidered whether the destruction of Strong’s first statement\n\n\n             3\n               The trial judge suppressed all results of tests\nconducted on blood stains found at Great Plains Road and beneath\nWelch’s car in the bowling alley parking lot.     The judge also\nsuppressed the results of blood tests taken on the belt.\n                               -5-\n\fshould be grounds for dismissing the indictment.            The judge stated\n\nin his findings of fact:\n\n           I do not believe that Captain Sypek and\n           Detective Zielinksi were so obtuse that they\n           did not realize that the first statement had\n           been destroyed until after Strong had given\n           his second statement and left the station and\n           until after the wastepaper basket in the\n           conference room had been emptied.      On the\n           contrary, I strongly suspect that they\n           deliberately left the statement on the\n           conference room table and left the room in the\n           hope that Strong would destroy the statement\n           and give a new one.\n\nNonetheless,   in     finding   that    the    indictment    should   not   be\n\ndismissed, the trial judge ruled that, although the police were\n\n“incredibly foolish,” he did “not believe it was done maliciously.”\n\nLeaving Strong alone with his first statement “did not amount to a\n\nbad faith effort to deprive the defendant of exculpatory evidence.”\n\nAfter   “[w]eighing    the   culpability      of   the   police   against   the\n\nmateriality of the evidence and the potential prejudice to the\n\ndefendant” under Massachusetts law, the court denied Olszewski’s\n\nmotion to dismiss the indictment.\n\n           At the second trial, the judge allowed Olszewski to\n\nexamine witnesses concerning the circumstances of the destruction\n\nof the statement; permitted Olszewski to cross-examine the police\n\nabout the contents of the statement; and gave a jury instruction\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fregarding the lost statement.4           On February 5, 1990, Olszewski\n\nagain was convicted of first-degree murder.          He was sentenced to\n\nlife in prison.         On his second direct appeal to the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court, Olszewski argued, inter alia, that (1) Strong’s\n\ntestimony should have been excluded because Strong’s original\n\nstatement       was   destroyed;   (2)   the   prosecutor   made    improper\n\nstatements during closing arguments; and (3) the trial court’s\n\ndismissal of a sitting juror based on ex parte communications\n\nbetween the juror and the court violated Olszewski’s federal\n\nconstitutional rights.       Commonwealth v. Olszewski, 416 Mass. 707,\n\n625 N.E.2d 529 (1993).       The Supreme Judicial Court rejected these\n\narguments and affirmed the conviction.\n\n            After the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed his conviction,\n\nOlszewski filed a motion for a new trial claiming that his trial\n\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to call his father at a witness\n\nand that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise\n\nan ineffective assistance argument on direct appeal.               The trial\n\njudge denied the motion on the merits.          Olszewski through counsel\n\nlater filed a motion to amend his motion for a new trial.               This\n\nmotion to amend included a claim, raised for the first time, that\n\nhis trial counsel was ineffective for failing to inform the court\n\n\n\n            4\n               The jury instruction stated, “If the jury believes\nthat the police destroyed, concealed, condoned or participated in\nthe destruction or concealment of any statement of any witness, the\njury may infer that the destroyed or concealed statement contained\nsomething unfavorable to the Commonwealth’s case.”\n                                -7-\n\fabout the reason for not calling Olszewski’s father as a witness\n\n(on the theory that the court would then have refused to allow the\n\nprosecution to rely on the father’s failure to testify). The court\n\ndenied the motion to amend on the ground that the defendant had\n\nwaived the issue by failing to present it in his motion for a new\n\ntrial.   A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court denied\n\nOlszewski’s petition for leave to appeal because his claim was “not\n\nnew.”\n\n          On December 5, 2001, Olszewski filed this petition for a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.   Olszewski raised the three arguments\n\nthat he raised on direct appeal and included the ineffective\n\nassistance claim that he raised in his motion to amend.\n\n          On January 18, 2005, the magistrate judge issued a\n\ndetailed report recommending that Olszewski’s petition be rejected.\n\nIn her recommendation, the magistrate judge first addressed the\n\ndestruction of Strong’s original statement.       Although the judge\n\nassumed that the police acted in bad faith in allowing Strong to\n\ndestroy the statement, she ruled that the loss of evidence did not\n\nviolate Olszewski’s due process rights because, under California v.\n\nTrombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984), Olszewski could recreate the\n\nsubstance of the document through cross-examining witnesses at\n\ntrial.\n\n          The   magistrate   judge    then   addressed   whether   the\n\nprosecutor’s    statements   during    closing   argument    violated\n                                -8-\n\fOlszewski’s due process rights.              As to three of the allegedly\n\nimproper statements, the magistrate judge found that the trial\n\ncourt’s jury instruction cured any error.                With respect to the\n\nremaining two statements (as to which there was no instruction),\n\nthe   magistrate     judge      also   concluded     that     there     was    no\n\nconstitutional error.        The prosecutor’s misstatement that two of\n\nOlszewski’s alibi witnesses waited to testify until eight years\n\nafter the murder, while erroneous, was a “fleeting reference in the\n\nmidst of a detailed challenge to the veracity of these alibi\n\nwitnesses’ testimony” and “did not improperly taint the trial.”\n\nAs to the last allegedly improper comment, the magistrate judge\n\nfound that the prosecutor did not act improperly in asking the jury\n\nto infer that the failure of Olszewski’s father to testify meant\n\nthat his testimony would have been adverse to Olszewski.\n\n            Next,   the   magistrate     judge     found    that    Olszewski’s\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim was procedurally defaulted\n\nbecause it was clear that neither the trial court nor the single\n\njustice of the Supreme Judicial Court reached the merits of the\n\nclaim.   Finally, the magistrate judge found that the trial court’s\n\nex parte communications with and the dismissal of a juror were not\n\nimproper because the juror was replaced with an alternate that\n\nOlszewski’s   counsel     had   selected     and   any   possible     error   was\n\nharmless.\n\n            On March 30, 2005, the district court issued an order\n\nadopting the magistrate judge’s findings and denying Olszewski’s\n                                       -9-\n\fpetition without holding an evidentiary hearing.                      This appeal\n\nfollowed.     This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n1291 and 2253.\n\n                                       II.\n\n             Where the district court does not hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing, we review the district court’s denial of habeas corpus\n\nrelief without deference.         Evicci v. Maloney, 387 F.3d 37, 39-40\n\n(1st Cir. 2004); Correia v. Hall, 364 F.3d 385, 387-88 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n             This court’s review of petitioner’s claims is governed by\n\nthe    Antiterrorism     and   Effective         Death   Penalty     Act   of   1996\n\n(“AEDPA”).     Pub. L. No. 104-132, § 104, 110 Stat. 1214, 1218-19\n\n(1996). Under AEDPA, we may only grant the petition if the Supreme\n\nJudicial     Court’s   decision      “was    contrary     to,   or    involved    an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States” or “was based\n\non an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.”                    § 104(3)(d).\n\nHere, we conclude that there is no right to habeas relief.                      With\n\nrespect to most of the claims, petitioner’s constitutional rights\n\nwere   not   violated;    in   the    case       of   petitioner’s     ineffective\n\nassistance     of   counsel    claim,       we    find   that   his    claim     was\n\nprocedurally defaulted.\n\n                                      III.\n\n             Olszewski first contends that his constitutional due\n                                 -10-\n\fprocess rights were violated when the Commonwealth failed to\n\npreserve Strong’s first statement.\n\n                                         A.\n\n              It     is   undisputed     that    Strong’s     first   statement\n\ncorroborated Olszewski’s alibi and that Strong destroyed the only\n\nexisting copy of his first statement.              Strong testified that he\n\ngave the first statement on January 31, 1982, in the presence of\n\nDetective Edward Sypek and one or two officers whose names Strong\n\ncould   not       recall.5   At   both   the    evidentiary   hearing   and   at\n\nOlszewski’s second trial, Strong testified that his first statement\n\nrecited that, between 7 and 9 P.M. on January 28, 1982, Strong and\n\nOlszewski were talking in the Y.M.C.A. parking lot.6                  At trial,\n\nDetective Sypek confirmed that the statement “sa[id] I [Strong] was\n\nwith Tony [Olszewski] from seven to nine.”\n\n\n\n              5\n               The trial court found that Strong told the police\nand wrote in his first statement that:\n\n     on January 28[, 1982] he had been driving around in his\n     own car at about 7:00 P.M. when he saw the defendant in\n     his car, parked by the old Y.M.C.A. on Upper Church\n     Street.    He said he pulled his car alongside the\n     defendant’s car, that the two talked for about an hour\n     and a half, and that Joanne Welch was not mentioned at\n     all in the course of the conversation.     He said the\n     defendant left shortly before 9:00 P.M. and that he did\n     not see him for the rest of the evening.\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court adopted these factual findings.\n              6\n               On cross-examination, Strong admitted that his first\nstatement might have said that he was with Olszewski between 7:30\nand 8:30 P.M., but his “memory [was] that it was sometime between\nseven and nine.”\n                               -11-\n\f          At trial, Strong testified that when he returned to the\n\npolice station on February 15, 1982, Officer Sypek yelled at him\n\nand accused him of lying in his first statement.          Strong then\n\nconfessed that his first statement was false.       After he admitted\n\nthat the statement was false, the police violated their established\n\nprocedures by failing to photocopy the first statement and leaving\n\nStrong alone in an interview room for some period of time with the\n\nonly existing copy of the statement.      Strong ripped up his first\n\nstatement and threw the pieces in the trash can while he was alone\n\nin the interview room.    The police did not immediately attempt to\n\nretrieve the pieces from the trash.     Although Officer Sypek later\n\nlooked for the pieces, the trash had already been emptied by the\n\ncleaning service.\n\n          Strong gave his second statement on the same day that he\n\ndestroyed his first statement.     In the second statement, Strong\n\nsaid that he was not with Olszewski on January 28, but instead\n\nencountered him on January 29, at which time Olszewski “told me\n\nthat he had killed Joanne Welch,” and stated that “he wanted to go\n\nup and dispose of the body.”      They got into Strong’s car, and\n\nStrong drove toward the location where Welch’s body was found.\n\n          On   February   16,   1982,   Strong   gave   the   police   a\n\nsupplemental statement detailing his activities on January 28,\n\n1982.   He stated that he was having dinner with his fiancee at a\n\nsteakhouse in Holyoke between 7:40 P.M. and 9 P.M. on January 28.\n\n          At trial, Strong was a key prosecution witness.              He\n                             -12-\n\ftestified to the substance of the second statement and elaborated\n\nfurther:\n\n            [Olszewski] said that Joanne had stopped over\n            his house and they had an argument about her\n            new boyfriend there, and Joanne had asked\n            [Olszewski] for h[er] money and she said that\n            if he didn’t give her her money back, that she\n            would tell the cops about the robberies at the\n            Westfield Mobil station. And then [Olszewski]\n            said that they got into the car and drove over\n            to Bear Hole. He got in Bear Hole and started\n            to strangle her . . . and he wrapped a belt\n            around her neck, dragged her out of the car,\n            threw the belt away, stomped on her neck with\n            his heel of his shoe, then ran her over with\n            the car several times. One of the times she\n            got stuck underneath the car.     He got out,\n            pulled her out underneath the car, put her in\n            the car, and then drove her up there to Shaker\n            Road where he threw the body off, and then\n            parked the car at the bowling alley.\n\nAs they approached the location of Welch’s body, “in front of us\n\nwas   a   state   trooper’s   car   and   some   yellow   tape   .   .   .   and\n\n[Olszewski] said that’s where he had dumped the body, turn around.”\n\nStrong turned the car around and drove to a Westfield bowling\n\nalley, where Olszewski “pointed out where he had parked Joanne’s\n\ncar.”     Strong testified that he drove Olszewski back into West\n\nSpringfield and eventually dropped him off.\n\n                                     B.\n\n            “It is axiomatic that [Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n(1963)] and its progeny established that a defendant has a due\n\nprocess right to request and receive evidence that the government\n\npossesses which is material to his guilt or punishment.”                 United\n\nStates v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990, 993 (1st Cir. 1993).           To address the\n                               -13-\n\fproblem of the loss or destruction of evidence by the prosecution,\n\n“the Supreme Court has developed a framework to analyze ‘what might\n\nloosely be called the area of constitutionally guaranteed access to\n\nevidence.’”    Id. (quoting California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479,\n\n485 (1984) and Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 55 (1988)).         The\n\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Trombetta and Youngblood govern the\n\nconstitutionality of the nondisclosure of evidence in “cases in\n\nwhich the government no longer possesses the disputed evidence.”\n\nId.\n\n          In Trombetta, defendants were charged with drunk driving\n\nand objected to the state’s admission of breath-analysis tests.\n\n467 U.S. at 483.    They complained that the police had destroyed the\n\noriginal breath samples and that as a consequence they could not\n\nconduct their own tests.       Id.     The Supreme Court rejected the\n\ndefendants’ due process claim.       Id. at 489.   As a threshold matter,\n\nthe Court noted that the police “were acting ‘in good faith and in\n\naccord with their normal practice’” when they disposed of the\n\nbreath samples.     Id. at 488 (citing Killian v. United States, 368\n\nU.S.   231,   242   (1961)).     The     Court   then   held   that   “more\n\nimportantly,” the missing evidence did not “meet [the] standard of\n\nconstitutional materiality.”         Id. at 488-89.      To satisfy this\n\nstandard, the “evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that\n\nwas apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a\n\nnature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable\n\nevidence by other reasonably available means.” Id. The Court held\n                                  -14-\n\fthat neither condition was met.          Id.     First, the samples were not\n\napparently exculpatory because “the chances [were] extremely low\n\nthat preserved samples would have been exculpatory.”                    Id.     The\n\nsecond     condition     was   not    met     because   the     defendants      had\n\n“alternative      means        of    demonstrating          their     innocence,”\n\ne.g. inspecting the calibration of the breathalyzer machine or\n\ncross-examining the officer who administered the test. Id. at 490.\n\n            Four years later, in Arizona v. Youngblood, the Supreme\n\nCourt considered the police’s failure to preserve blood and semen\n\nsamples taken from a rape victim.                A police criminologist had\n\nconducted an initial review of the samples, but the state failed to\n\npreserve the samples by refrigeration so that the defendant could\n\nconduct his own tests.         488 U.S. at 53-54.       The Youngblood Court\n\nfound that the evidence was not apparently exculpatory, even though\n\nit   had   potentially    greater     value    than   the    breath   samples    in\n\nTrombetta, because “[t]he possibility that the semen samples could\n\nhave exculpated respondent if preserved or tested is not enough to\n\nsatisfy the standard of constitutional materiality in Trombetta.”\n\nId. at 56 n.*.    In explaining Trombetta’s “apparently exculpatory”\n\nrequirement, the Court emphasized that it must be apparent that the\n\nevidence is exculpatory before it is lost or destroyed.                Id. at 56.\n\nThe Court then set forth a new standard for lost evidence that is\n\nonly “potentially useful.”          Id. at 58.   The Court held “that unless\n\na criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police,\n\nfailure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute\n                                       -15-\n\fa denial of due process of law.”       Id. at 58.   In contrast, the\n\nCourt recognized that a bad faith showing is not required when the\n\nevidence is apparently exculpatory:     “[t]he Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in Brady, makes the good\n\nor bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to\n\ndisclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence.”      Id. at\n\n57.   The defendant did not establish a due process violation under\n\nthe facts of Youngblood because the evidence was only “potentially\n\nuseful” and the actions of the police could “at worst be described\n\nas negligent.”   Id. at 58.\n\n           The issue again arose in Illinois v. Fisher, 540 U.S.\n\n544, 549 (2004), where the Court reviewed Youngblood and Trombetta.\n\nIn Fisher, the defendant, who was charged with possession of\n\ncocaine, filed a discovery motion requesting all physical evidence,\n\nincluding the cocaine, that the state intended to use at trial.\n\nId. at 545.   Before the cocaine was provided to the defendant, the\n\ndefendant “jumped bond” becoming a fugitive.        Id.   When he was\n\ncaptured ten years later, the state reinstated the possession\n\ncharges but had, in good faith, already destroyed the cocaine. Id.\n\nat 546.   The Court reiterated that “the applicability of the bad-\n\nfaith requirement in Youngblood depended ... on the distinction\n\nbetween ‘materially exculpatory’ evidence and ‘potentially useful’\n\nevidence.”    Id. at 549.     Bad faith was not necessary if the\n\nevidence was “materially exculpatory.”      Such a showing was only\n\nnecessary if the evidence was “potentially useful.”         The Court\n                                -16-\n\fconcluded that the cocaine was only “potentially useful evidence”\n\nand     that      there     was     no     due        process     violation     under\n\nYoungblood because the defendant did not allege that the police\n\nacted in bad faith.         Id. at 547-48.\n\n             A    variety    of    other    circuits       have    considered     the\n\nrelationship between Trombetta and Youngblood and have concluded\n\nthat (1) the destruction of “apparently exculpatory” evidence does\n\nnot require a showing of bad faith but that (2) if the evidence is\n\nonly “potentially useful,” a bad-faith showing is required.7                     Each\n\nof    this     court's    past    decisions      in    this     area   has   involved\n\npotentially useful evidence, rather than apparently exculpatory\n\nevidence,8 and in these cases, the court has held that a showing of\n\n\n             7\n               See United States v. Moore, 452 F.3d 382, 388 (5th\nCir. 2006)(“impermissibly withheld evidence must be either (1)\nmaterial and exculpatory or (2) only potentially useful, in\ncombination with a showing of bad faith on the part of the\ngovernment”); United States v. Estrada, 453 F.3d 1208, 1212-13 (9th\nCir. 2006) (only requiring a showing of bad faith when the evidence\nis   “potentially    exculpatory,   as   opposed    to   apparently\nexculpatory”); Bullock v. Carver 297 F.3d 1036, 1056 (10th Cir.\n2002) (“A defendant can obtain relief under the Due Process Clause\nwhen he can show that a police department destroyed evidence with\n‘an exculpatory value that was apparent before [it] was destroyed.’\n... Where, however, the police only failed to preserve ‘potentially\nuseful’ evidence that might have been exculpatory, a defendant must\nprove that the police acted in bad faith by destroying the\nevidence.”) (internal citations omitted); United States v. Wright,\n260 F.3d 568, 571 (6th Cir. 2001) (“The destruction of material\nexculpatory evidence violates due process regardless of whether the\ngovernment acted in bad faith.”).\n             8\n               See United States v. Garza,435 F.3d 73, 75 (1st Cir.\n2006)(noting that drugs and tape recordings of drug transactions\nare only “potentially exculpatory”); DiBenedetto v. Hall, 272 F.3d\n1, 13 (1st Cir. 2001) (finding that blood stains on a sneaker were\nnot “clearly exculpatory”); Femia, 9 F.3d at 995 (finding that the\n                               -17-\n\fbad faith is required.9        In contrast, this case involves apparently\n\nexculpatory     evidence,      rather    than   merely   potentially   useful\n\nevidence.       We need not decide whether, as the Supreme Court has\n\nsuggested and other circuits have held, a showing of bad faith is\n\nunnecessary in these circumstances, although we note that the state\n\nagrees that such a showing is not required because Strong’s first\n\nstatement was apparently exculpatory.            Nor need we decide whether\n\nbad faith was demonstrated on the facts of this case, as the\n\ndistrict court assumed.          We proceed instead to the question of\n\nwhether the destroyed evidence satisfies Trombetta’s requirement\n\nthat it be “to some extent irreplaceable.”            Femia, 9 F.3d at 994.\n\n            The requirement that the evidence be irreplaceable was\n\ndirectly addressed by the Supreme Court in Trombetta in connection\n\nwith the second prong of the materiality requirement.              The Supreme\n\nCourt considered whether the defendants “were without alternate\n\nmeans of demonstrating their innocence.”            Trombetta, 467 U.S. at\n\n490.    In      that   case,    the     Court   concluded   that   sufficient\n\n\nparts of audio tapes capturing conversations between the defendant\nand other alleged co-conspirators “can only be characterized as\npotentially exculpatory evidence”).\n            9\n               See Garza, 435 F.3d at 75 (“where lost or destroyed\nevidence is deemed to be only potentially exculpatory, as opposed\nto apparently exculpatory, the defendant must show that the\nevidence was destroyed in bad faith”); Femia, 9 F.3d at 994 (“we\nfind no due process violation with respect to evidence that no\nlonger exists because it was not destroyed in bad faith”); cf.\nDiBenedetto, 272 F.3d at 12 (“We need not decide whether this meets\nthe ‘bad faith’ standard, because a closer look at the Supreme\nCourt decision in Trombetta indicates that DiBenedetto’s due\nprocess claims falls short in other regards.”).\n                               -18-\n\falternatives existed, including (1) inspecting the breathalyzer\n\nmachine, (2) raising an argument that radio waves or the diet of\n\nthe defendant influenced the results, or (3) cross-examining the\n\nofficer who administered the test.                     Id.         The irreplaceability\n\nrequirement was also recognized by this court in DiBenedetto, which\n\nheld    that     the    loss    of    a    blood    spot   on       a   sneaker    was   not\n\nirreplaceable.          272 F.3d at 13.           In DiBenedetto, we compared the\n\nblood spot to the breath samples in Trombetta: “in this case, the\n\nevidence to be presented was not the spot itself, but rather the\n\ntest    results,        which   the       defendant     was     free     to    impeach   by\n\nquestioning the expert about the test methodology, the inconsistent\n\nresults, and, most importantly, about the test’s inability to\n\nconclude the spot was even human blood.”                      Id.\n\n               The defendant argues that Trombetta’s irreplaceability\n\nrequirement has been eliminated by Youngblood. We disagree. There\n\nis     nothing     in     Youngblood         to     suggest     elimination        of    the\n\nirreplaceability requirement.                   Also, while neither the Supreme\n\nCourt nor this court has directly addressed the irreplaceability\n\nrequirement in the context of apparently exculpatory evidence (as\n\nopposed to potentially exculpatory evidence), we conclude that\n\nproof    of    irreplaceability            is   required      in    both      apparent   and\n\npotential exculpatory evidence cases.                   In all cases under Brady,\n\nthe defendant must demonstrate that the evidence was material to\n\nestablish a constitutional violation whether the prosecution acted\n\nin good fath or bad faith.                See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87\n                                             -19-\n\f(1963); Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434-35 (1995); United\n\nStates     v.        Hansen,     434    F.3d      92,    102      (1st     Cir.     2006).\n\nIrreplaceability         is     part    of   the     materiality         requirement   in\n\ndestroyed evidence cases, and it follows that the defendant in such\n\na   case   bears       the     burden   of     showing     that    the     evidence    was\n\nirreplaceable.          See Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 489; Femia, 9 F.3d at\n\n993.   Olszewski has not met that burden.\n\n            The question of whether evidence is “to some extent\n\nirreplaceable” is a legal question based on underlying facts.                          See\n\nTrombetta, 467 U.S. at 489.             Here, the underlying facts are not in\n\ndispute, so we must determine whether, in light of those undisputed\n\nfacts, the irreplaceability requirement has been satisfied.                            We\n\nconclude that the destroyed evidence was not irreplaceable.                          There\n\nhas been no showing that Olszewski was unable to recreate the\n\nsubstance       of    Strong’s    original        statement    through      testimony.10\n\nStrong’s first statement was short, roughly one paragraph (and less\n\nthan one page).           There were no internal conflicts in Strong’s\n\ntestimony       about    the     content     of    the   statement,        and    Strong’s\n\ntestimony       about    the    statement      did   not    conflict       with    Sypek’s\n\ntestimony about the statement.\n\n\n            10\n               This case is unlike United States v. Cooper, 983\nF.2d 928 (9th Cir. 1993), where the police destroyed laboratory\nequipment allegedly used to manufacture methamphetamine. The Ninth\nCircuit held that “[general] testimony about the possible nature of\nthe destroyed equipment would be an inadequate substitute.” Id. at\n932.   In that case, no witness was directly familiar with the\ndestroyed evidence and there was no other record of the evidence,\ne.g. photographs or laboratory tests.\n                                -20-\n\f            Perhaps most importantly, Olszewski did not show that\n\nthere was material information in the first statement that Strong\n\nand Sypek could not recall.       Even though Strong appears to have\n\nmemory lapses as to surrounding events and could not remember the\n\nstatement “word for word,” he testified that he “mostly” remembered\n\nwhat was in his first statement.      Likewise, although Officer Sypek\n\nagreed on cross-examination that there might be “other things” in\n\nthe statement that he could not remember, he remembered “the\n\nsubstance    of   the   statement.”    Thus,   at   best   the   testimony\n\nestablished that the witnesses could not recall details in the\n\nfirst statement unrelated to its substance.\n\n            In short, although the loss of exculpatory information as\n\na result of the destruction of Strong’s first statement could\n\nresult in a due process violation,11 Olszewski has failed to show\n\nthat the statement contained additional, material information that\n\nwas lost as a result of the destruction.        Mere speculation about\n\nthe possible existence of additional, material evidence in the\n\ndestroyed statement is simply insufficient to demonstrate a due\n\nprocess violation.\n\n\n            11\n                At oral argument, we asked the assistant attorney\ngeneral to “assume that Strong recalled that he had listed the\nidentity of another witness in the statement who was with them\nduring the supposed alibi period and he could not remember the name\nof the person and the police could not remember the name. Would we\nhave a due process violation under those circumstances, assuming\nbad faith?” In response, the assistant attorney general conceded\nthat “if there were such a piece of evidence in that statement that\nnobody could recall but everyone knew there was a name in there,\nyou would have a due process violation.”\n                                -21-\n\f            Olszewski   also    argues       that   his    statement   was\n\nirreplaceable because cross-examining Strong and the police about\n\nthe statement was not sufficient because it “forced Olszewski to\n\ntry to prove his case through impeachment of a damaging, hostile\n\nwitness.”     Trombetta itself involved the need to recreate the\n\nevidence through hostile witnesses, but there is no suggestion that\n\nthis is insufficient.\n\n            Because Olszewski has not shown that he was “unable to\n\nobtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means,” we\n\nconclude that the destruction of Strong’s statement was not a\n\nviolation of due process under the Supreme Court’s decisions in\n\nTrombetta, Youngblood, and Fisher.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n            Olszewski next argues that the prosecution made a number\n\nof   prejudicial   statements   in    closing   argument   that   violated\n\nOlszewski’s due process rights.            For this kind of due process\n\nchallenge to succeed, “it is not enough that prosecutors’ remarks\n\nwere undesirable or even universally condemned . . . .”           Darden v.\n\nWainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Rather, as the Supreme Court has made clear, “[t]he\n\nrelevant question is whether the prosecutor’s comments ‘so infected\n\nthe trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a\n\ndenial of due process.’” Id. (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo,\n\n416 U.S. 637, 643 (1974)).      In assessing whether the prosecutor’s\n\n“improper statements during closing argument require[s] a new\n                             -22-\n\ftrial, we examine (1) whether the prosecutor's conduct was isolated\n\nand/or deliberate; (2) whether the trial court gave a strong and\n\nexplicit cautionary instruction; and (3) whether it is likely that\n\nany prejudice surviving the judge's instruction could have affected\n\nthe outcome of the case.”    United States v. Lowe, 145 F.3d 45, 50\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)\n\n          Two     of   the    prosecutor’s   statements    involved\n\nmisdescriptions of the evidence, and the court gave a curative jury\n\ninstruction urging the jury to disregard the statements.12     This\n\n\n          12\n               Olszewski argues that the prosecutor improperly\nstated that Olszewski demonstrated a lack of remorse because\nOlszewski did not have contact with the Welch family “[e]ven after\n[Joanne’s] body was found.” Defense counsel objected, explaining\nthat Olszewski attended Welch’s wake, and the judge immediately\ninstructed the jury:\n\n          there was a mention made with regard to any\n          contact between the defendant and the Welch\n          family.      If   that  should   possibly   be\n          interpreted as a suggestion that the defendant\n          did not attend the wake of the deceased, that\n          should be ignored completely.    There was no\n          evidence one way or the other on that point,\n          but no inference should be drawn that that was\n          true if any suggestion to that effect was\n          made.\n\n          Olszewski also contends that he was prejudiced by the\nprosecution’s closing-argument reference to a witness’s opinion\nthat Olszewski was guilty. Defense counsel objected, arguing that\nthe statement had previously been excluded.       The trial judge\nimmediately instructed the jury:     “[i]f there was . . . any\nargument with regard to any of the witnesses expressing an opinion\nas to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, I ask you to ignore\nthat also.”   In the jury charge, the judge further instructed:\n“There was in the course of the trial certain evidence which I\nordered stricken. . . . You must not consider any evidence which\nhas been stricken. Please do everything in your power to put that\ncompletely out of your mind. Once it is stricken, it should play\n                               -23-\n\fcourt    has    consistently     held    that    where     the     prosecutor\n\nunintentionally misstates the evidence during closing argument, a\n\njury instruction ordinarily is “sufficient to cure any potential\n\nprejudice,”13 particularly where, as here, the instruction was given\n\nimmediately after the statement.        There is no suggestion here that\n\nthe prosecutor deliberately misstated the evidence.              We find that\n\nthese   instructions   were    sufficient   to   cure    any   error   by   the\n\nprosecutor.\n\n           Olszewski also complains that the prosecutor personally\n\nvouched for Olszewski’s guilt.      The prosecutor stated: “ladies and\n\ngentlemen, there is no fear in my voice when I say to you that\n\neither Phil Strong killed this girl or the defendant killed her.\n\nAbsolutely none.”      He then suggested that because Strong had no\n\nmotive or opportunity, the killer had to be Olszewski.                 Defense\n\ncounsel objected, and the trial judge gave an immediate limiting\n\ninstruction:     “It is important to remember that anything that\n\ncounsel says in closing argument is not evidence.              I think I made\n\nthat point before and I want to re-emphasize it.”              The judge also\n\ngave an instruction in the jury charge itself:            “[Y]ou must make\n\n\n\nno part in your deliberations.”\n           13\n               United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1999);\nsee also United States    v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 35-36 (1st Cir.\n2006) (holding that where the prosecutor inadvertently misstated\nthe evidence any prejudice was cured by the trial judge’s jury\ninstruction); Lowe, 145 F.3d at 50 (“The court [through a curative\ninstruction] properly accounted for any possible prejudice from the\ngovernment’s remark.”).\n                               -24-\n\fyour determination of the facts on the basis of the evidence which\n\nhas been presented in the course of the trial. . . . The evidence\n\ndoes not include anything that either counsel may have said at any\n\ntime in the course of the trial.”\n\n            This court has stated that “the representative of the\n\ngovernment approaches the jury with . . . tremendous credibility\n\nbut that personal credibility is one weapon he must not use.”\n\nUnited States v. Gonzalez Vargas, 558 F.2d 631, 633 (1st Cir.\n\n1977).     This case is distinguishable from cases such as Gonzalez\n\nVargas   where     the   prosecutor’s   argument   was   held   to   deny   due\n\nprocess.     Id.    In Gonzalez Vargas, the prosecutor told the jury\n\nwhat he “personally believe[d]” on four separate occasions, and the\n\ncourt failed to give any curative jury instruction. Id. at 632-33.\n\nHere, while the prosecutor may have erred in stating his personal\n\nopinion to the jury, the statement was brief and the trial court’s\n\ninstructions to the jury sufficiently corrected for any potential\n\nprejudice.14\n\n            In two other instances there was no curative instruction.\n\nOlszewski contends that the prosecutor improperly questioned the\n\ncredibility of two witnesses, Lori Garvey and Michelle Herrieux-\n\nBernier, who gave statements that they saw Joanne Welch between 7\n\n\n            14\n               The Supreme Judicial Court noted, “[A] single\nunfortunate and unartful isolated instance of the use of the first-\nperson pronoun ... in the course of a legitimate argument as to the\ninferences the jury should draw from the evidence does not\nconstitute error.” Commonwealth v. Olszewski, 416 Mass. at 726,\n625 N.E.2d at 541-42 (internal citations omitted).\n                               -25-\n\fand 9 P.M. on January 28, 1982, by arguing that “it didn’t happen\n\n[until] eight years later that this information [came] forward.”\n\nIn fact, at least one of these witnesses testified at Olszewski’s\n\nfirst trial.     There was no curative instruction because Olszewski\n\ndid not object to this statement at trial.               We are not persuaded\n\nthat this fleeting comment “so infected the trial with unfairness\n\nas to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.”\n\nDarden, 477 U.S. at 181.\n\n            In   the    other   instance,    Olszewski      argues    that   the\n\nprosecutor improperly urged the jury to infer, from the fact that\n\nOlszewski’s father did not testify at the trial, that the father’s\n\ntestimony would have been adverse to Olszewski.                   There was no\n\ncurative    instruction.        Indeed,    the   trial   court    approved   the\n\nargument in advance and instructed the jurors that they could infer\n\nthat the witness “would have given testimony unfavorable to”\n\nOlszewski if the jurors found that the witness was available, was\n\n“friendly   to   or    at   least   not   hostilely   disposed     toward”   the\n\ndefendant, and could “be expected to give testimony of distinct\n\nimportance to the case.”\n\n            The surrounding facts are as follows:                At Olszewski’s\n\nfirst trial, his father testified that, around 6:30 P.M. on January\n\n28, 1982, he picked his son up on Hillcrest Avenue in West\n\nSpringfield and brought him home.                Olszewski’s father did not\n\ntestify at the second trial.          According to Strong’s testimony at\n\nthe second trial, Olszewski informed Strong that Olszewski’s father\n                                -26-\n\fhad picked him up in Westfield (where the body was found) after the\n\nmurder (later than 6:30 P.M.).     In closing, the prosecutor argued:\n\n“ladies and gentlemen, his father has been here for two weeks\n\nsitting here watching this case.    You can infer by the fact that he\n\ndidn’t get up and tell you that he didn’t pick up his son, you can\n\ninfer from that . . . that he did pick up his son in Westfield,” in\n\naccordance with Strong’s version of events.\n\n          A jury may draw an adverse inference from a witness’s\n\nfailure to testify if “the evidence shows that the witness is\n\navailable to testify on behalf of the party, that the testimony of\n\nthe witness would be relevant and noncumulative, and that the\n\nwitness is not prejudiced against the nonproducing party.”     United\n\nStates v. Ariza-Ibarra, 651 F.2d 2, 16 (1st Cir. 1981).      We find\n\nthat this standard is met here where Olszewski’s father was present\n\nat the trial, his testimony was relevant, and he was not apparently\n\nprejudiced against Olszewski.     However, the defendant argues that\n\nthe statement was constitutionally improper because the prosecution\n\nmisrepresented the likely testimony of the witness.\n\n          We agree that under the decisions of the Supreme Court a\n\ndue   process   violation   may      occur   when   the   prosecution\n\nmischaracterizes the earlier sworn testimony of a witness.     Miller\n\nv. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 7 (1967).      That is not what happened here.\n\nThe prosecutor in closing did not misstate the father’s testimony\n\nat the first trial.    The prosecutor was not required to assume\n\nthat, if the father were to testify again, his testimony would be\n                                 -27-\n\ffavorable to Olszewski given the possibility that Olszewski’s\n\nfather could change his testimony were he to testify a second time.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we fail to see how the prosecutor’s\n\n“missing witness” argument violated Olszewski’s due process rights.\n\n           Finally, we conclude that any prejudice caused by the\n\nprosecutor’s closing argument was far outweighed by the strength of\n\nthe government’s evidence against Olszewski.            See United States v.\n\nUdechukwu, 11 F.3d 1101, 1106 (1st Cir. 1993) (considering “the\n\nstrength   of   the   evidence    against    the    defendant”).       Strong’s\n\ntestimony recounted Olszewski’s confession in detail, contained\n\nfacts that would only have been known to someone involved in the\n\nmurder, and was consistent with Welch’s extensive injuries.                   The\n\nprosecution also presented evidence that Olszewski had a motive to\n\nkill Welch, that he threatened to kill Welch, and that Welch\n\nintended to meet with Olszewski on the night of the murder.\n\n           Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor’s statements\n\nin   closing      argument,   whether       considered     individually       or\n\ncumulatively, did not constitute a due process violation.\n\n                                     V.\n\n           Olszewski argues that he suffered ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel when his trial counsel failed to explain to the court\n\nthat she did not call Olszewski’s father as a witness because of\n\nher concern that the father’s hostility toward the prosecution\n\nmight damage the jury’s perception of Olszewski.               If the court had\n\nreceived   this    information,    Olszewski       contends,    it   would   have\n                                    -28-\n\fprohibited the prosecution from arguing in closing that Olszewski’s\n\nfailure to call his father was grounds to infer that the father’s\n\ntestimony would have been adverse to Olszewski. The district court\n\nconcluded    that   Olszewski’s   ineffective    assistance   claim   was\n\ndefaulted in the course of the state court proceedings and thus was\n\nnot available for relief on habeas.      We agree.\n\n            We are precluded from reviewing state court decisions on\n\nhabeas review if the decision rests on “independent and adequate\n\nstate ground[s].”     Simpson v. Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 205-06 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (citing Trest v. Cain, 522 U.S. 87, 118 S.Ct. 478, 480\n\n(1997)).    “[I]ndependent and adequate state grounds exist where\n\n‘the state court declined to hear [the federal claims] because the\n\n[defendant] failed to meet a state procedural requirement.’”          Id.\n\n(quoting Brewer v. Marshall, 119 F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir. 1997)).\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, after a defendant’s direct appeal is\n\ncompleted, the Supreme Judicial Court cannot review        appeals from\n\nthe denial of collateral attacks on a defendant’s conviction unless\n\na single justice finds the claims to be “new and substantial.”        Id.\n\n(citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, § 33E).        This court has held that\n\n“[w]here there has been procedural waiver below, the denial of\n\nreview under § 33E [because the claim is not new and substantial]\n\nis an independent and adequate state ground that bars federal\n\nhabeas review.”     Id.\n\n            The default here concerns the new trial proceedings in\n\n                                  -29-\n\fthe Massachusetts state court, proceedings that were somewhat\n\ncomplex.   After Olszewski’s second trial, but before his direct\n\nappeal, Olszewski’s trial counsel filed a motion for a new trial,\n\nwhich the trial judge denied on the merits.      This motion did not\n\nraise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.        Olszewski’s\n\nconviction was affirmed on direct appeal.     The direct appeal also\n\ndid not raise an ineffectiveness claim.\n\n           After his direct appeal, Olszewski filed a pro se motion\n\nfor a new trial, arguing that (1) his trial counsel was ineffective\n\nfor not calling Olszewski’s father as a witness (we refer to this\n\nineffectiveness claim as “the failure to call claim”) and (2)\n\nappellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the failure\n\nto call claim on direct appeal.   The trial judge denied the pro se\n\nmotion.    Olszewski then filed a motion for appointment of counsel,\n\nwhich a single Supreme Judicial Court justice granted.         After\n\ncounsel was appointed, but still acting pro se, Olszewski filed a\n\nmotion to amend his motion for a new trial.     His pro se motion to\n\namend again raised the failure to call claim.    Three months later,\n\nOlszewski, now through counsel, filed a second motion to amend,\n\narguing for the first time that his trial counsel was ineffective\n\nfor failing to inform the court of the reason for not calling\n\nOlszewski’s father to testify.     We refer to this ineffectiveness\n\nclaim as the \"communication claim.\"     The trial court rejected both\n\nineffectiveness claims.   The trial judge held that the failure to\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fcall claim was “already raised in the ... new trial motion [filed\n\npro se after the direct appeal], which was argued, considered and\n\ndenied.”   The trial judge rejected the communication claim because\n\nit should have been raised in the second new trial motion and was\n\nnot new.\n\n            On a petition for leave to appeal, the issues were\n\naddressed by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court who\n\nruled that the claims were “not new.”           We understand the single\n\njustice's ruling that the claims were “not new\" to rest on two\n\nseparate grounds:     first, as to the failure to call claim, the\n\nsingle justice concluded that the “missing witness” argument had\n\nbeen   fully   considered   on   the   direct   appeal;   that   counsel's\n\nineffectiveness in failing to call the father as a witness could\n\nhave been raised on direct appeal; and that there was no showing\n\nthat appellate counsel had been ineffective in presenting the\n\nappeal.    In this connection, the single justice stated:\n\n            given (1) the full bench’s thorough evaluation\n            of the “missing witness” issue and its ruling,\n            after    plenary   review,    to   affirm  the\n            conviction; and (2) the absence of any proof\n            that counsel was constitutionally ineffective\n            in   presenting   the   appeal,  I   find  the\n            defendant’s claim is not new.\n\n            Second, with respect to the communication claim, the\n\nsingle justice concluded that counsel in the second new trial\n\nmotion had presented a closely related ineffectiveness argument\n\n(the failure to call claim), and that the communication claim was\n\n                                   -31-\n\fnot new because it could have been raised in the earlier new trial\n\nmotion.   The single justice stated, “The strategic decision to\n\npress one approach in a motion for a new trial rather than another\n\ndoes not make the claim new.”\n\n          We think that the single justice's ground for finding the\n\ncommunication claim not new - that is, the failure to raise it in\n\nthe new trial motion after the direct appeal - constitutes an\n\nindependent and adequate state ground for the refusal to consider\n\nthe communication claim, and is completely unrelated to the merits.\n\nThe defendant's argument to the contrary rests on reading the\n\nsingle justice's first ground for denying relief as related to the\n\ncommunications claim. While the single justice's opinion is hardly\n\na model of clarity, we do not read that opinion as disagreeing with\n\nthe trial judge's reasons for rejecting the claim - which clearly\n\nwere grounded in the failure to raise the communication claim in\n\nthe new trial motion filed after the direct appeal.     Rather, we\n\nread the single justice's opinion as agreeing with that decision.\n\nMoreover, we do not see how the single justice could have intended\n\nto tax counsel for failure to raise the ineffectiveness issue\n\n(concerning the failure to communicate with the trial judge) on\n\ndirect appeal since the record on direct appeal would not have\n\nsupported such an argument. Accordingly, we hold that the district\n\ncourt was correct to deny habeas review of the communication\n\n\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fclaim.15\n\n                                VI.\n\n           Finally, Olszewski argues that his Sixth Amendment rights\n\nwere violated when the trial judge excused a sitting juror on the\n\nbasis of ex parte communications.     We reject this contention as\n\nwell.\n\n           The jury for Olszewski’s second trial was impaneled in\n\nPittsfield (Berkshire County), to be sequestered in Springfield\n\n(Hampden County). During jury selection, a prospective juror asked\n\nto be excused on the ground that sequestration would cause personal\n\nhardship because his wife was ill and needed at-home care.        The\n\njudge rejected the excuse and the juror was impaneled along with\n\nfifteen others.    When the prospective juror returned home that\n\nevening, his wife became distraught that she would be left alone.\n\nThat night, the juror’s son telephoned the judge and stated that\n\nhis mother could not be left alone.   After contacting the juror’s\n\nwife’s physician for confirmation of her condition, the judge\n\nexcused the juror from further service on grounds of hardship. The\n\njudge informed counsel for both parties of these events in court\n\nthe next day.   The excused juror was replaced by an alternate.\n\n           15\n               Even when a petitioner’s claims are procedurally\nbarred, this court may review the claims if     “the prisoner can\ndemonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice” or “that\nfailure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental\nmiscarriage of justice.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750\n(1991).   Olszewski does not argue that either of these exceptions\napplies here.\n                               -33-\n\f            The defendant here does not assert that the trial judge\n\nerred in excusing the juror, and it is well established that “[t]he\n\ndecision to substitute an alternate juror is committed to the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court” and will not be overturned “absent\n\na showing of bias or prejudice to the defendant.”16            United States\n\nv. Corsino, 812 F.2d 26, 33 (1st Cir. 1987) (internal citations\n\nomitted).        Rather, the defendant contends that he had a Sixth\n\nAmendment right to be present when the trial judge communicated\n\nwith the juror’s son and doctor, and when the juror was excused.\n\n            “[T]he right to personal presence at all critical stages\n\nof the trial ... [is a] fundamental right[ ] of each criminal\n\ndefendant.”      Rushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 117 (1983).       This right\n\nmust be balanced against “the necessity for preserving society’s\n\ninterest in the administration of criminal justice.”            Id. at 118.\n\nWe see no basis for Olszewski’s claim that the judge’s action in\n\nexcusing the juror violated his Sixth Amendment rights.            Nor do we\n\nthink   that     the   judge’s   ex   parte   communications    amounted    to\n\nprejudicial error.       Unrecorded ex parte communications between a\n\ntrial judge and a juror are subject to harmless error review.              Id.\n\nat 119-20.       Error is harmless where “the jury’s deliberations, as\n\na whole, [are] not biased by the undisclosed communication.”               Id.\n\n\n            16\n               In fact, the Supreme Judicial Court found that it is\n“obvious that the defendant would not have opposed excusing the\njuror” where defense counsel “did not move for a mistrial, or\nrequest empanelment of an additional juror or any other remedial\nmeasure.” Olszewski, 416 Mass. at 722, 625 N.E.2d at 539.\n                               -34-\n\fat 121.   Olszewski has not alleged that the jury was biased by the\n\nex parte communications.\n\n           This case is like United States v. Evans, 352 F.3d 65 (2d\n\nCir. 2003), where a juror suffered an asthma attack during trial.\n\nThat evening, the trial judge telephoned the juror ex parte and was\n\ntold that the attack was “more serious than usual” and that the\n\njuror’s doctor instructed him to stay at home.    Id. at 68.   While\n\non the telephone, the judge excused the juror.     Id.   The Second\n\nCircuit found that any error was harmless because the juror was\n\nexcused “well before” the case was sent to the jury, the remaining\n\njurors were “not adversely influenced,” and the dismissal did not\n\n“produce a drastic shift in the jury’s composition.”     Id. at 70.\n\n           The lack of prejudice in this case is particularly clear\n\nwhere there is no suggestion that the juror discussed the case with\n\nother jurors; he was dismissed before the trial began; and counsel\n\nwas informed of the communications the next morning at which time\n\nthere was no suggestion of actual or potential prejudice or any\n\nrequest for curative action by the trial court.    Indeed, that the\n\njudge dismissed the juror before court reconvened in the morning\n\nhelped to ensure that the remaining jurors would not be prejudiced\n\nby the dismissed juror’s dissatisfaction. Accordingly, we conclude\n\nthat the district court correctly denied habeas relief as to this\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                                -35-\n\f                    VII.\n\nThe decision of the district court is\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                    -36-\n\f",

He claims\n\nthat his due process rights were violated when the Commonwealth\n\npermitted the destruction of exculpatory evidence prior to trial\n\nand   made   improper    statements        in     closing        arguments      at       trial.\n\nOlszewski    also   seeks     relief      on     the    grounds     that       he    received\n\nineffective    assistance         of    counsel        and   that   the    trial         court\n\nimproperly     dismissed      a        sitting     juror      based       on        ex    parte\n\ncommunications.      We conclude that none of these claims warrants\n\nhabeas relief, and therefore affirm the district court’s denial of\n\nthe petition.\n\n                                           I.\n\n             Joanne Welch was murdered sometime between 7 and 9 P.M.\n\non January 28, 1982.        Olszewski and Welch had been involved in a\n\nromantic relationship that ended approximately one month before\n\nWelch’s murder.         Prior to the murder, Welch had begun dating\n\nanother man, which upset Olszewski.                     On the day of the murder,\n\nseveral of Olszewski’s friends heard Olszewski threaten to kill\n\nWelch. That same day, Welch told family members and coworkers that\n\nshe planned to drive to Olszewski’s house after work to retrieve\n\nher personal belongings and some money.                      She intended to return\n\nhome for dinner and expected a call from her new boyfriend to\n\narrange a date for the evening of January 28.                             Welch visited\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fOlszewski’s house and retrieved her belongings, but never returned\n\nhome.\n\n            On       January    29,    1982,    on   Great   Plains   Road     in   West\n\nSpringfield, Massachusetts, the police located shoes and earrings\n\nbelonging       to   Welch     along   with    two   teeth,   a   strip   of    chrome\n\nautomobile trim, and a belt hanging from a tree.                  The police found\n\nWelch’s body seven miles away.                 She had fractures to her jaw and\n\npelvis, bruising, abrasions, and several missing teeth.                      The teeth\n\nfound on Great Plains Road appeared to be Welch’s.                             Welch’s\n\ninjuries were consistent with blows from a fist or foot and\n\nstrangulation.         On January 30, the police found Welch’s car parked\n\nnext to a Westfield, Massachusetts bowling alley. There was blood,\n\nhair, and fiber belonging to Welch in the car, and a strip of\n\nchrome trim was missing from the passenger side.\n\n            Olszewski admitted that Welch came to his house on\n\nJanuary 28; his defense was alibi during the period of time that\n\nthe murder was committed.              He claimed that Welch left his house\n\naround 6:30 that evening, and that between 7 and 9 P.M.,1 he was in\n\nthe company of his friend, Philip Strong.                     Olszewski met other\n\nfriends around 9 P.M.\n\n\n            1\n               Exactly when Olszewski allegedly met with Strong is\nunclear. The Supreme Judicial Court found that Olszewski “told the\npolice that he was in the company of Philip Strong between 7 and 9\nP.M.” Commonwealth v.

On February 15,\n\n1982, the police questioned Strong a second time, and Strong\n\nadmitted    that   the   first   statement    was   false.      Contrary    to\n\nestablished procedures, the police did not copy the first statement\n\nand left Strong alone with the only copy of the statement.             Strong\n\nripped it up and threw the pieces in the trash.                 Strong then\n\nprovided the police with a second statement that stated that, on\n\nJanuary 29, Olszewski told Strong that Olszewski had murdered\n\nWelch. The police did not attempt to retrieve the first statement\n\nuntil later that night when Officer Sypek looked in the trash for\n\nthe pieces and found that the trash had already been emptied.              The\n\nfirst statement was never recovered.\n\n            On February 12, 1983, Olszewski was convicted of Welch’s\n\nmurder based in large part on Strong’s testimony.                 On direct\n\nappeal,    the   Massachusetts   Supreme     Judicial   Court   vacated    the\n\nconviction and remanded the case based on the prosecution’s use at\n\ntrial of evidence that was lost or destroyed.2                  The   Supreme\n\nJudicial Court instructed the trial court that on remand, under\n\n\n\n            2\n               The lost evidence at issue on appeal included\nStrong’s first statement, the belt, blood samples taken from the\nroad and parking lot, a paint chip taken from Welch’s skin, a\ncarpet swatch taken from Welch’s vehicle, an automobile window\ncrank handle, and a plastic cup lid found in Welch’s vehicle.

It is\n\nunclear whether the Supreme Judicial Court’s decision to vacate was\n\nbased in part on the destruction of Strong’s first statement.                       On\n\nthe one hand, there is language in the opinion directing the trial\n\ncourt to consider the destruction of Strong’s first statement on\n\nthe   remand.       On   the     other    hand,    the    Supreme    Judicial     Court\n\nconcluded that “the defense counsel fully described to the jury the\n\ncircumstances of the making and the destruction of Strong’s first\n\nstatement.       The defense thoroughly cross-examined, and effectively\n\nimpeached,       Strong.         The     judge     properly       admitted   Strong’s\n\ntestimony.”\n\n           Nonetheless on remand the trial court considered the\n\nremand order as extending to the destruction of Strong’s first\n\nstatement.        The    trial    court    held     a    series    of   hearings    and\n\nsuppressed certain evidence on the ground that the state destroyed\n\nthe predicate physical evidence.3                At the hearing, the trial judge\n\nconsidered whether the destruction of Strong’s first statement\n\n\n             3\n               The trial judge suppressed all results of tests\nconducted on blood stains found at Great Plains Road and beneath\nWelch’s car in the bowling alley parking lot.     The judge also\nsuppressed the results of blood tests taken on the belt.\n                               -5-\n\fshould be grounds for dismissing the indictment.            The judge stated\n\nin his findings of fact:\n\n           I do not believe that Captain Sypek and\n           Detective Zielinksi were so obtuse that they\n           did not realize that the first statement had\n           been destroyed until after Strong had given\n           his second statement and left the station and\n           until after the wastepaper basket in the\n           conference room had been emptied.      On the\n           contrary, I strongly suspect that they\n           deliberately left the statement on the\n           conference room table and left the room in the\n           hope that Strong would destroy the statement\n           and give a new one.\n\nNonetheless,   in     finding   that    the    indictment    should   not   be\n\ndismissed, the trial judge ruled that, although the police were\n\n“incredibly foolish,” he did “not believe it was done maliciously.”\n\nLeaving Strong alone with his first statement “did not amount to a\n\nbad faith effort to deprive the defendant of exculpatory evidence.”\n\nAfter   “[w]eighing    the   culpability      of   the   police   against   the\n\nmateriality of the evidence and the potential prejudice to the\n\ndefendant” under Massachusetts law, the court denied Olszewski’s\n\nmotion to dismiss the indictment.\n\n           At the second trial, the judge allowed Olszewski to\n\nexamine witnesses concerning the circumstances of the destruction\n\nof the statement; permitted Olszewski to cross-examine the police\n\nabout the contents of the statement; and gave a jury instruction\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fregarding the lost statement.4           On February 5, 1990, Olszewski\n\nagain was convicted of first-degree murder.          He was sentenced to\n\nlife in prison.         On his second direct appeal to the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court, Olszewski argued, inter alia, that (1) Strong’s\n\ntestimony should have been excluded because Strong’s original\n\nstatement       was   destroyed;   (2)   the   prosecutor   made    improper\n\nstatements during closing arguments; and (3) the trial court’s\n\ndismissal of a sitting juror based on ex parte communications\n\nbetween the juror and the court violated Olszewski’s federal\n\nconstitutional rights.       Commonwealth v. Olszewski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2063473\"><a href=\"/opinion/2063473/commonwealth-v-olszewski/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2063473\"><a href=\"/opinion/2063473/commonwealth-v-olszewski/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).       The Supreme Judicial Court rejected these\n\narguments and affirmed the conviction.\n\n            After the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed his conviction,\n\nOlszewski filed a motion for a new trial claiming that his trial\n\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to call his father at a witness\n\nand that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise\n\nan ineffective assistance argument on direct appeal.               The trial\n\njudge denied the motion on the merits.          Olszewski through counsel\n\nlater filed a motion to amend his motion for a new trial.               This\n\nmotion to amend included a claim, raised for the first time, that\n\nhis trial counsel was ineffective for failing to inform the court\n\n\n\n            4\n               The jury instruction stated, “If the jury believes\nthat the police destroyed, concealed, condoned or participated in\nthe destruction or concealment of any statement of any witness, the\njury may infer that the destroyed or concealed statement contained\nsomething unfavorable to the Commonwealth’s case.”\n                                -7-\n\fabout the reason for not calling Olszewski’s father as a witness\n\n(on the theory that the court would then have refused to allow the\n\nprosecution to rely on the father’s failure to testify). The court\n\ndenied the motion to amend on the ground that the defendant had\n\nwaived the issue by failing to present it in his motion for a new\n\ntrial.   A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court denied\n\nOlszewski’s petition for leave to appeal because his claim was “not\n\nnew.”\n\n          On December 5, 2001, Olszewski filed this petition for a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.   Olszewski raised the three arguments\n\nthat he raised on direct appeal and included the ineffective\n\nassistance claim that he raised in his motion to amend.\n\n          On January 18, 2005, the magistrate judge issued a\n\ndetailed report recommending that Olszewski’s petition be rejected.\n\nIn her recommendation, the magistrate judge first addressed the\n\ndestruction of Strong’s original statement.       Although the judge\n\nassumed that the police acted in bad faith in allowing Strong to\n\ndestroy the statement, she ruled that the loss of evidence did not\n\nviolate Olszewski’s due process rights because, under California v.\n\nTrombetta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111206\"><a href=\"/opinion/111206/california-v-trombetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (1984), Olszewski could recreate the\n\nsubstance of the document through cross-examining witnesses at\n\ntrial.\n\n          The   magistrate   judge    then   addressed   whether   the\n\nprosecutor’s    statements   during    closing   argument    violated\n                                -8-\n\fOlszewski’s due process rights.              As to three of the allegedly\n\nimproper statements, the magistrate judge found that the trial\n\ncourt’s jury instruction cured any error.                With respect to the\n\nremaining two statements (as to which there was no instruction),\n\nthe   magistrate     judge      also   concluded     that     there     was    no\n\nconstitutional error.        The prosecutor’s misstatement that two of\n\nOlszewski’s alibi witnesses waited to testify until eight years\n\nafter the murder, while erroneous, was a “fleeting reference in the\n\nmidst of a detailed challenge to the veracity of these alibi\n\nwitnesses’ testimony” and “did not improperly taint the trial.”\n\nAs to the last allegedly improper comment, the magistrate judge\n\nfound that the prosecutor did not act improperly in asking the jury\n\nto infer that the failure of Olszewski’s father to testify meant\n\nthat his testimony would have been adverse to Olszewski.\n\n            Next,   the   magistrate     judge     found    that    Olszewski’s\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim was procedurally defaulted\n\nbecause it was clear that neither the trial court nor the single\n\njustice of the Supreme Judicial Court reached the merits of the\n\nclaim.   Finally, the magistrate judge found that the trial court’s\n\nex parte communications with and the dismissal of a juror were not\n\nimproper because the juror was replaced with an alternate that\n\nOlszewski’s   counsel     had   selected     and   any   possible     error   was\n\nharmless.\n\n            On March 30, 2005, the district court issued an order\n\nadopting the magistrate judge’s findings and denying Olszewski’s\n                                       -9-\n\fpetition without holding an evidentiary hearing.

Strong testified that he\n\ngave the first statement on January 31, 1982, in the presence of\n\nDetective Edward Sypek and one or two officers whose names Strong\n\ncould   not       recall.5   At   both   the    evidentiary   hearing   and   at\n\nOlszewski’s second trial, Strong testified that his first statement\n\nrecited that, between 7 and 9 P.M. on January 28, 1982, Strong and\n\nOlszewski were talking in the Y.M.C.A. parking lot.6                  At trial,\n\nDetective Sypek confirmed that the statement “sa[id] I [Strong] was\n\nwith Tony [Olszewski] from seven to nine.”\n\n\n\n              5\n               The trial court found that Strong told the police\nand wrote in his first statement that:\n\n     on January 28[, 1982] he had been driving around in his\n     own car at about 7:00 P.M. when he saw the defendant in\n     his car, parked by the old Y.M.C.A. on Upper Church\n     Street.    He said he pulled his car alongside the\n     defendant’s car, that the two talked for about an hour\n     and a half, and that Joanne Welch was not mentioned at\n     all in the course of the conversation.     He said the\n     defendant left shortly before 9:00 P.M. and that he did\n     not see him for the rest of the evening.\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court adopted these factual findings.\n              6\n               On cross-examination, Strong admitted that his first\nstatement might have said that he was with Olszewski between 7:30\nand 8:30 P.M., but his “memory [was] that it was sometime between\nseven and nine.”\n                               -11-\n\f          At trial, Strong testified that when he returned to the\n\npolice station on February 15, 1982, Officer Sypek yelled at him\n\nand accused him of lying in his first statement.          Strong then\n\nconfessed that his first statement was false.       After he admitted\n\nthat the statement was false, the police violated their established\n\nprocedures by failing to photocopy the first statement and leaving\n\nStrong alone in an interview room for some period of time with the\n\nonly existing copy of the statement.      Strong ripped up his first\n\nstatement and threw the pieces in the trash can while he was alone\n\nin the interview room.    The police did not immediately attempt to\n\nretrieve the pieces from the trash.     Although Officer Sypek later\n\nlooked for the pieces, the trash had already been emptied by the\n\ncleaning service.\n\n          Strong gave his second statement on the same day that he\n\ndestroyed his first statement.     In the second statement, Strong\n\nsaid that he was not with Olszewski on January 28, but instead\n\nencountered him on January 29, at which time Olszewski “told me\n\nthat he had killed Joanne Welch,” and stated that “he wanted to go\n\nup and dispose of the body.”      They got into Strong’s car, and\n\nStrong drove toward the location where Welch’s body was found.\n\n          On   February   16,   1982,   Strong   gave   the   police   a\n\nsupplemental statement detailing his activities on January 28,\n\n1982.   He stated that he was having dinner with his fiancee at a\n\nsteakhouse in Holyoke between 7:40 P.M. and 9 P.M. on January 28.\n\n          At trial, Strong was a key prosecution witness.              He\n                             -12-\n\ftestified to the substance of the second statement and elaborated\n\nfurther:\n\n            [Olszewski] said that Joanne had stopped over\n            his house and they had an argument about her\n            new boyfriend there, and Joanne had asked\n            [Olszewski] for h[er] money and she said that\n            if he didn’t give her her money back, that she\n            would tell the cops about the robberies at the\n            Westfield Mobil station. And then [Olszewski]\n            said that they got into the car and drove over\n            to Bear Hole. He got in Bear Hole and started\n            to strangle her . . . and he wrapped a belt\n            around her neck, dragged her out of the car,\n            threw the belt away, stomped on her neck with\n            his heel of his shoe, then ran her over with\n            the car several times. One of the times she\n            got stuck underneath the car.     He got out,\n            pulled her out underneath the car, put her in\n            the car, and then drove her up there to Shaker\n            Road where he threw the body off, and then\n            parked the car at the bowling alley.\n\nAs they approached the location of Welch’s body, “in front of us\n\nwas   a   state   trooper’s   car   and   some   yellow   tape   .   .   .   and\n\n[Olszewski] said that’s where he had dumped the body, turn around.”\n\nStrong turned the car around and drove to a Westfield bowling\n\nalley, where Olszewski “pointed out where he had parked Joanne’s\n\ncar.”     Strong testified that he drove Olszewski back into West\n\nSpringfield and eventually dropped him off.\n\n                                     B.\n\n            “It is axiomatic that [Brady v.

The\n\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Trombetta and Youngblood govern the\n\nconstitutionality of the nondisclosure of evidence in “cases in\n\nwhich the government no longer possesses the disputed evidence.”\n\nId.\n\n          In Trombetta, defendants were charged with drunk driving\n\nand objected to the state’s admission of breath-analysis tests.\n\n467 U.S. at 483.    They complained that the police had destroyed the\n\noriginal breath samples and that as a consequence they could not\n\nconduct their own tests.       Id.     The Supreme Court rejected the\n\ndefendants’ due process claim.       Id. at 489.   As a threshold matter,\n\nthe Court noted that the police “were acting ‘in good faith and in\n\naccord with their normal practice’” when they disposed of the\n\nbreath samples.     Id. at 488 (citing Killian v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   242   (1961)).     The     Court   then   held   that   “more\n\nimportantly,” the missing evidence did not “meet [the] standard of\n\nconstitutional materiality.”         Id. at 488-89.      To satisfy this\n\nstandard, the “evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that\n\nwas apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a\n\nnature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable\n\nevidence by other reasonably available means.” Id. The Court held\n                                  -14-\n\fthat neither condition was met.          Id.     First, the samples were not\n\napparently exculpatory because “the chances [were] extremely low\n\nthat preserved samples would have been exculpatory.”                    Id.     The\n\nsecond     condition     was   not    met     because   the     defendants      had\n\n“alternative      means        of    demonstrating          their     innocence,”\n\ne.g. inspecting the calibration of the breathalyzer machine or\n\ncross-examining the officer who administered the test. Id. at 490.\n\n            Four years later, in Arizona v. Youngblood, the Supreme\n\nCourt considered the police’s failure to preserve blood and semen\n\nsamples taken from a rape victim.                A police criminologist had\n\nconducted an initial review of the samples, but the state failed to\n\npreserve the samples by refrigeration so that the defendant could\n\nconduct his own tests.         488 U.S. at 53-54.       The Youngblood Court\n\nfound that the evidence was not apparently exculpatory, even though\n\nit   had   potentially    greater     value    than   the    breath   samples    in\n\nTrombetta, because “[t]he possibility that the semen samples could\n\nhave exculpated respondent if preserved or tested is not enough to\n\nsatisfy the standard of constitutional materiality in Trombetta.”\n\nId. at 56 n.*.    In explaining Trombetta’s “apparently exculpatory”\n\nrequirement, the Court emphasized that it must be apparent that the\n\nevidence is exculpatory before it is lost or destroyed.                Id. at 56.\n\nThe Court then set forth a new standard for lost evidence that is\n\nonly “potentially useful.”          Id. at 58.   The Court held “that unless\n\na criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police,\n\nfailure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute\n                                       -15-\n\fa denial of due process of law.”       Id. at 58.   In contrast, the\n\nCourt recognized that a bad faith showing is not required when the\n\nevidence is apparently exculpatory:     “[t]he Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in Brady, makes the good\n\nor bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to\n\ndisclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence.”      Id. at\n\n57.   The defendant did not establish a due process violation under\n\nthe facts of Youngblood because the evidence was only “potentially\n\nuseful” and the actions of the police could “at worst be described\n\nas negligent.”   Id. at 58.\n\n           The issue again arose in Illinois v. Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131160\"><a href=\"/opinion/131160/illinois-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (2004), where the Court reviewed Youngblood and Trombetta.\n\nIn Fisher, the defendant, who was charged with possession of\n\ncocaine, filed a discovery motion requesting all physical evidence,\n\nincluding the cocaine, that the state intended to use at trial.\n\nId. at 545.   Before the cocaine was provided to the defendant, the\n\ndefendant “jumped bond” becoming a fugitive.        Id.   When he was\n\ncaptured ten years later, the state reinstated the possession\n\ncharges but had, in good faith, already destroyed the cocaine. Id.\n\nat 546.   The Court reiterated that “the applicability of the bad-\n\nfaith requirement in Youngblood depended ... on the distinction\n\nbetween ‘materially exculpatory’ evidence and ‘potentially useful’\n\nevidence.”    Id. at 549.     Bad faith was not necessary if the\n\nevidence was “materially exculpatory.”      Such a showing was only\n\nnecessary if the evidence was “potentially useful.”         The Court\n                                -16-\n\fconcluded that the cocaine was only “potentially useful evidence”\n\nand     that      there     was     no     due        process     violation     under\n\nYoungblood because the defendant did not allege that the police\n\nacted in bad faith.         Id. at 547-48.\n\n             A    variety    of    other    circuits       have    considered     the\n\nrelationship between Trombetta and Youngblood and have concluded\n\nthat (1) the destruction of “apparently exculpatory” evidence does\n\nnot require a showing of bad faith but that (2) if the evidence is\n\nonly “potentially useful,” a bad-faith showing is required.7                     Each\n\nof    this     court's    past    decisions      in    this     area   has   involved\n\npotentially useful evidence, rather than apparently exculpatory\n\nevidence,8 and in these cases, the court has held that a showing of\n\n\n             7\n               See United States v.

We need not decide whether, as the Supreme Court has\n\nsuggested and other circuits have held, a showing of bad faith is\n\nunnecessary in these circumstances, although we note that the state\n\nagrees that such a showing is not required because Strong’s first\n\nstatement was apparently exculpatory.            Nor need we decide whether\n\nbad faith was demonstrated on the facts of this case, as the\n\ndistrict court assumed.          We proceed instead to the question of\n\nwhether the destroyed evidence satisfies Trombetta’s requirement\n\nthat it be “to some extent irreplaceable.”            Femia, 9 F.3d at 994.\n\n            The requirement that the evidence be irreplaceable was\n\ndirectly addressed by the Supreme Court in Trombetta in connection\n\nwith the second prong of the materiality requirement.              The Supreme\n\nCourt considered whether the defendants “were without alternate\n\nmeans of demonstrating their innocence.”            Trombetta, 467 U.S. at\n\n490.    In      that   case,    the     Court   concluded   that   sufficient\n\n\nparts of audio tapes capturing conversations between the defendant\nand other alleged co-conspirators “can only be characterized as\npotentially exculpatory evidence”).\n            9\n               See Garza, 435 F.3d at 75 (“where lost or destroyed\nevidence is deemed to be only potentially exculpatory, as opposed\nto apparently exculpatory, the defendant must show that the\nevidence was destroyed in bad faith”); Femia, 9 F.3d at 994 (“we\nfind no due process violation with respect to evidence that no\nlonger exists because it was not destroyed in bad faith”); cf.\nDiBenedetto, 272 F.3d at 12 (“We need not decide whether this meets\nthe ‘bad faith’ standard, because a closer look at the Supreme\nCourt decision in Trombetta indicates that DiBenedetto’s due\nprocess claims falls short in other regards.”).\n                               -18-\n\falternatives existed, including (1) inspecting the breathalyzer\n\nmachine, (2) raising an argument that radio waves or the diet of\n\nthe defendant influenced the results, or (3) cross-examining the\n\nofficer who administered the test.                     Id.         The irreplaceability\n\nrequirement was also recognized by this court in DiBenedetto, which\n\nheld    that     the    loss    of    a    blood    spot   on       a   sneaker    was   not\n\nirreplaceable.          272 F.3d at 13.           In DiBenedetto, we compared the\n\nblood spot to the breath samples in Trombetta: “in this case, the\n\nevidence to be presented was not the spot itself, but rather the\n\ntest    results,        which   the       defendant     was     free     to    impeach   by\n\nquestioning the expert about the test methodology, the inconsistent\n\nresults, and, most importantly, about the test’s inability to\n\nconclude the spot was even human blood.”                      Id.\n\n               The defendant argues that Trombetta’s irreplaceability\n\nrequirement has been eliminated by Youngblood. We disagree. There\n\nis     nothing     in     Youngblood         to     suggest     elimination        of    the\n\nirreplaceability requirement.                   Also, while neither the Supreme\n\nCourt nor this court has directly addressed the irreplaceability\n\nrequirement in the context of apparently exculpatory evidence (as\n\nopposed to potentially exculpatory evidence), we conclude that\n\nproof    of    irreplaceability            is   required      in    both      apparent   and\n\npotential exculpatory evidence cases.                   In all cases under Brady,\n\nthe defendant must demonstrate that the evidence was material to\n\nestablish a constitutional violation whether the prosecution acted\n\nin good fath or bad faith.

See Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 489; Femia, 9 F.3d at\n\n993.   Olszewski has not met that burden.\n\n            The question of whether evidence is “to some extent\n\nirreplaceable” is a legal question based on underlying facts.                          See\n\nTrombetta, 467 U.S. at 489.             Here, the underlying facts are not in\n\ndispute, so we must determine whether, in light of those undisputed\n\nfacts, the irreplaceability requirement has been satisfied.                            We\n\nconclude that the destroyed evidence was not irreplaceable.

There were no internal conflicts in Strong’s\n\ntestimony       about    the     content     of    the   statement,        and    Strong’s\n\ntestimony       about    the    statement      did   not    conflict       with    Sypek’s\n\ntestimony about the statement.\n\n\n            10\n               This case is unlike United States v.

The Ninth\nCircuit held that “[general] testimony about the possible nature of\nthe destroyed equipment would be an inadequate substitute.” Id. at\n932.   In that case, no witness was directly familiar with the\ndestroyed evidence and there was no other record of the evidence,\ne.g. photographs or laboratory tests.\n                                -20-\n\f            Perhaps most importantly, Olszewski did not show that\n\nthere was material information in the first statement that Strong\n\nand Sypek could not recall.       Even though Strong appears to have\n\nmemory lapses as to surrounding events and could not remember the\n\nstatement “word for word,” he testified that he “mostly” remembered\n\nwhat was in his first statement.      Likewise, although Officer Sypek\n\nagreed on cross-examination that there might be “other things” in\n\nthe statement that he could not remember, he remembered “the\n\nsubstance    of   the   statement.”    Thus,   at   best   the   testimony\n\nestablished that the witnesses could not recall details in the\n\nfirst statement unrelated to its substance.\n\n            In short, although the loss of exculpatory information as\n\na result of the destruction of Strong’s first statement could\n\nresult in a due process violation,11 Olszewski has failed to show\n\nthat the statement contained additional, material information that\n\nwas lost as a result of the destruction.        Mere speculation about\n\nthe possible existence of additional, material evidence in the\n\ndestroyed statement is simply insufficient to demonstrate a due\n\nprocess violation.\n\n\n            11\n                At oral argument, we asked the assistant attorney\ngeneral to “assume that Strong recalled that he had listed the\nidentity of another witness in the statement who was with them\nduring the supposed alibi period and he could not remember the name\nof the person and the police could not remember the name. Would we\nhave a due process violation under those circumstances, assuming\nbad faith?” In response, the assistant attorney general conceded\nthat “if there were such a piece of evidence in that statement that\nnobody could recall but everyone knew there was a name in there,\nyou would have a due process violation.”\n                                -21-\n\f            Olszewski   also    argues       that   his    statement   was\n\nirreplaceable because cross-examining Strong and the police about\n\nthe statement was not sufficient because it “forced Olszewski to\n\ntry to prove his case through impeachment of a damaging, hostile\n\nwitness.”     Trombetta itself involved the need to recreate the\n\nevidence through hostile witnesses, but there is no suggestion that\n\nthis is insufficient.\n\n            Because Olszewski has not shown that he was “unable to\n\nobtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means,” we\n\nconclude that the destruction of Strong’s statement was not a\n\nviolation of due process under the Supreme Court’s decisions in\n\nTrombetta, Youngblood, and Fisher.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n            Olszewski next argues that the prosecution made a number\n\nof   prejudicial   statements   in    closing   argument   that   violated\n\nOlszewski’s due process rights.

If   that  should   possibly   be\n          interpreted as a suggestion that the defendant\n          did not attend the wake of the deceased, that\n          should be ignored completely.    There was no\n          evidence one way or the other on that point,\n          but no inference should be drawn that that was\n          true if any suggestion to that effect was\n          made.\n\n          Olszewski also contends that he was prejudiced by the\nprosecution’s closing-argument reference to a witness’s opinion\nthat Olszewski was guilty. Defense counsel objected, arguing that\nthe statement had previously been excluded.       The trial judge\nimmediately instructed the jury:     “[i]f there was . . . any\nargument with regard to any of the witnesses expressing an opinion\nas to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, I ask you to ignore\nthat also.”   In the jury charge, the judge further instructed:\n“There was in the course of the trial certain evidence which I\nordered stricken. . . . You must not consider any evidence which\nhas been stricken. Please do everything in your power to put that\ncompletely out of your mind.

There is no suggestion here that\n\nthe prosecutor deliberately misstated the evidence.              We find that\n\nthese   instructions   were    sufficient   to   cure    any   error   by   the\n\nprosecutor.\n\n           Olszewski also complains that the prosecutor personally\n\nvouched for Olszewski’s guilt.      The prosecutor stated: “ladies and\n\ngentlemen, there is no fear in my voice when I say to you that\n\neither Phil Strong killed this girl or the defendant killed her.\n\nAbsolutely none.”      He then suggested that because Strong had no\n\nmotive or opportunity, the killer had to be Olszewski.                 Defense\n\ncounsel objected, and the trial judge gave an immediate limiting\n\ninstruction:     “It is important to remember that anything that\n\ncounsel says in closing argument is not evidence.              I think I made\n\nthat point before and I want to re-emphasize it.”              The judge also\n\ngave an instruction in the jury charge itself:            “[Y]ou must make\n\n\n\nno part in your deliberations.”\n           13\n               United States v.

This case is distinguishable from cases such as Gonzalez\n\nVargas   where     the   prosecutor’s   argument   was   held   to   deny   due\n\nprocess.     Id.    In Gonzalez Vargas, the prosecutor told the jury\n\nwhat he “personally believe[d]” on four separate occasions, and the\n\ncourt failed to give any curative jury instruction. Id. at 632-33.\n\nHere, while the prosecutor may have erred in stating his personal\n\nopinion to the jury, the statement was brief and the trial court’s\n\ninstructions to the jury sufficiently corrected for any potential\n\nprejudice.14\n\n            In two other instances there was no curative instruction.\n\nOlszewski contends that the prosecutor improperly questioned the\n\ncredibility of two witnesses, Lori Garvey and Michelle Herrieux-\n\nBernier, who gave statements that they saw Joanne Welch between 7\n\n\n            14\n               The Supreme Judicial Court noted, “[A] single\nunfortunate and unartful isolated instance of the use of the first-\nperson pronoun ... in the course of a legitimate argument as to the\ninferences the jury should draw from the evidence does not\nconstitute error.” Commonwealth v. Olszewski, 416 Mass. at 726,\n625 N.E.2d at 541-42 (internal citations omitted).\n                               -25-\n\fand 9 P.M. on January 28, 1982, by arguing that “it didn’t happen\n\n[until] eight years later that this information [came] forward.”\n\nIn fact, at least one of these witnesses testified at Olszewski’s\n\nfirst trial.     There was no curative instruction because Olszewski\n\ndid not object to this statement at trial.               We are not persuaded\n\nthat this fleeting comment “so infected the trial with unfairness\n\nas to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.”\n\nDarden, 477 U.S. at 181.\n\n            In   the    other   instance,    Olszewski      argues    that   the\n\nprosecutor improperly urged the jury to infer, from the fact that\n\nOlszewski’s father did not testify at the trial, that the father’s\n\ntestimony would have been adverse to Olszewski.                   There was no\n\ncurative    instruction.        Indeed,    the   trial   court    approved   the\n\nargument in advance and instructed the jurors that they could infer\n\nthat the witness “would have given testimony unfavorable to”\n\nOlszewski if the jurors found that the witness was available, was\n\n“friendly   to   or    at   least   not   hostilely   disposed     toward”   the\n\ndefendant, and could “be expected to give testimony of distinct\n\nimportance to the case.”\n\n            The surrounding facts are as follows:                At Olszewski’s\n\nfirst trial, his father testified that, around 6:30 P.M. on January\n\n28, 1982, he picked his son up on Hillcrest Avenue in West\n\nSpringfield and brought him home.                Olszewski’s father did not\n\ntestify at the second trial.          According to Strong’s testimony at\n\nthe second trial, Olszewski informed Strong that Olszewski’s father\n                                -26-\n\fhad picked him up in Westfield (where the body was found) after the\n\nmurder (later than 6:30 P.M.).     In closing, the prosecutor argued:\n\n“ladies and gentlemen, his father has been here for two weeks\n\nsitting here watching this case.    You can infer by the fact that he\n\ndidn’t get up and tell you that he didn’t pick up his son, you can\n\ninfer from that . . . that he did pick up his son in Westfield,” in\n\naccordance with Strong’s version of events.\n\n          A jury may draw an adverse inference from a witness’s\n\nfailure to testify if “the evidence shows that the witness is\n\navailable to testify on behalf of the party, that the testimony of\n\nthe witness would be relevant and noncumulative, and that the\n\nwitness is not prejudiced against the nonproducing party.”     United\n\nStates v.

We find\n\nthat this standard is met here where Olszewski’s father was present\n\nat the trial, his testimony was relevant, and he was not apparently\n\nprejudiced against Olszewski.     However, the defendant argues that\n\nthe statement was constitutionally improper because the prosecution\n\nmisrepresented the likely testimony of the witness.\n\n          We agree that under the decisions of the Supreme Court a\n\ndue   process   violation   may      occur   when   the   prosecution\n\nmischaracterizes the earlier sworn testimony of a witness.

That is not what happened here.\n\nThe prosecutor in closing did not misstate the father’s testimony\n\nat the first trial.    The prosecutor was not required to assume\n\nthat, if the father were to testify again, his testimony would be\n                                 -27-\n\ffavorable to Olszewski given the possibility that Olszewski’s\n\nfather could change his testimony were he to testify a second time.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we fail to see how the prosecutor’s\n\n“missing witness” argument violated Olszewski’s due process rights.\n\n           Finally, we conclude that any prejudice caused by the\n\nprosecutor’s closing argument was far outweighed by the strength of\n\nthe government’s evidence against Olszewski.

Strong’s\n\ntestimony recounted Olszewski’s confession in detail, contained\n\nfacts that would only have been known to someone involved in the\n\nmurder, and was consistent with Welch’s extensive injuries.                   The\n\nprosecution also presented evidence that Olszewski had a motive to\n\nkill Welch, that he threatened to kill Welch, and that Welch\n\nintended to meet with Olszewski on the night of the murder.\n\n           Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor’s statements\n\nin   closing      argument,   whether       considered     individually       or\n\ncumulatively, did not constitute a due process violation.\n\n                                     V.\n\n           Olszewski argues that he suffered ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel when his trial counsel failed to explain to the court\n\nthat she did not call Olszewski’s father as a witness because of\n\nher concern that the father’s hostility toward the prosecution\n\nmight damage the jury’s perception of Olszewski.               If the court had\n\nreceived   this    information,    Olszewski       contends,    it   would   have\n                                    -28-\n\fprohibited the prosecution from arguing in closing that Olszewski’s\n\nfailure to call his father was grounds to infer that the father’s\n\ntestimony would have been adverse to Olszewski. The district court\n\nconcluded    that   Olszewski’s   ineffective    assistance   claim   was\n\ndefaulted in the course of the state court proceedings and thus was\n\nnot available for relief on habeas.

This court has held that\n\n“[w]here there has been procedural waiver below, the denial of\n\nreview under § 33E [because the claim is not new and substantial]\n\nis an independent and adequate state ground that bars federal\n\nhabeas review.”     Id.\n\n            The default here concerns the new trial proceedings in\n\n                                  -29-\n\fthe Massachusetts state court, proceedings that were somewhat\n\ncomplex.   After Olszewski’s second trial, but before his direct\n\nappeal, Olszewski’s trial counsel filed a motion for a new trial,\n\nwhich the trial judge denied on the merits.      This motion did not\n\nraise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.        Olszewski’s\n\nconviction was affirmed on direct appeal.     The direct appeal also\n\ndid not raise an ineffectiveness claim.\n\n           After his direct appeal, Olszewski filed a pro se motion\n\nfor a new trial, arguing that (1) his trial counsel was ineffective\n\nfor not calling Olszewski’s father as a witness (we refer to this\n\nineffectiveness claim as “the failure to call claim”) and (2)\n\nappellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the failure\n\nto call claim on direct appeal.   The trial judge denied the pro se\n\nmotion.    Olszewski then filed a motion for appointment of counsel,\n\nwhich a single Supreme Judicial Court justice granted.         After\n\ncounsel was appointed, but still acting pro se, Olszewski filed a\n\nmotion to amend his motion for a new trial.     His pro se motion to\n\namend again raised the failure to call claim.    Three months later,\n\nOlszewski, now through counsel, filed a second motion to amend,\n\narguing for the first time that his trial counsel was ineffective\n\nfor failing to inform the court of the reason for not calling\n\nOlszewski’s father to testify.     We refer to this ineffectiveness\n\nclaim as the \"communication claim.\"     The trial court rejected both\n\nineffectiveness claims.   The trial judge held that the failure to\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fcall claim was “already raised in the ... new trial motion [filed\n\npro se after the direct appeal], which was argued, considered and\n\ndenied.”   The trial judge rejected the communication claim because\n\nit should have been raised in the second new trial motion and was\n\nnot new.\n\n            On a petition for leave to appeal, the issues were\n\naddressed by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court who\n\nruled that the claims were “not new.”           We understand the single\n\njustice's ruling that the claims were “not new\" to rest on two\n\nseparate grounds:     first, as to the failure to call claim, the\n\nsingle justice concluded that the “missing witness” argument had\n\nbeen   fully   considered   on   the   direct   appeal;   that   counsel's\n\nineffectiveness in failing to call the father as a witness could\n\nhave been raised on direct appeal; and that there was no showing\n\nthat appellate counsel had been ineffective in presenting the\n\nappeal.    In this connection, the single justice stated:\n\n            given (1) the full bench’s thorough evaluation\n            of the “missing witness” issue and its ruling,\n            after    plenary   review,    to   affirm  the\n            conviction; and (2) the absence of any proof\n            that counsel was constitutionally ineffective\n            in   presenting   the   appeal,  I   find  the\n            defendant’s claim is not new.\n\n            Second, with respect to the communication claim, the\n\nsingle justice concluded that counsel in the second new trial\n\nmotion had presented a closely related ineffectiveness argument\n\n(the failure to call claim), and that the communication claim was\n\n                                   -31-\n\fnot new because it could have been raised in the earlier new trial\n\nmotion.   The single justice stated, “The strategic decision to\n\npress one approach in a motion for a new trial rather than another\n\ndoes not make the claim new.”\n\n          We think that the single justice's ground for finding the\n\ncommunication claim not new - that is, the failure to raise it in\n\nthe new trial motion after the direct appeal - constitutes an\n\nindependent and adequate state ground for the refusal to consider\n\nthe communication claim, and is completely unrelated to the merits.\n\nThe defendant's argument to the contrary rests on reading the\n\nsingle justice's first ground for denying relief as related to the\n\ncommunications claim. While the single justice's opinion is hardly\n\na model of clarity, we do not read that opinion as disagreeing with\n\nthe trial judge's reasons for rejecting the claim - which clearly\n\nwere grounded in the failure to raise the communication claim in\n\nthe new trial motion filed after the direct appeal.     Rather, we\n\nread the single justice's opinion as agreeing with that decision.\n\nMoreover, we do not see how the single justice could have intended\n\nto tax counsel for failure to raise the ineffectiveness issue\n\n(concerning the failure to communicate with the trial judge) on\n\ndirect appeal since the record on direct appeal would not have\n\nsupported such an argument. Accordingly, we hold that the district\n\ncourt was correct to deny habeas review of the communication\n\n\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fclaim.15\n\n                                VI.\n\n           Finally, Olszewski argues that his Sixth Amendment rights\n\nwere violated when the trial judge excused a sitting juror on the\n\nbasis of ex parte communications.     We reject this contention as\n\nwell.\n\n           The jury for Olszewski’s second trial was impaneled in\n\nPittsfield (Berkshire County), to be sequestered in Springfield\n\n(Hampden County). During jury selection, a prospective juror asked\n\nto be excused on the ground that sequestration would cause personal\n\nhardship because his wife was ill and needed at-home care.        The\n\njudge rejected the excuse and the juror was impaneled along with\n\nfifteen others.    When the prospective juror returned home that\n\nevening, his wife became distraught that she would be left alone.\n\nThat night, the juror’s son telephoned the judge and stated that\n\nhis mother could not be left alone.   After contacting the juror’s\n\nwife’s physician for confirmation of her condition, the judge\n\nexcused the juror from further service on grounds of hardship. The\n\njudge informed counsel for both parties of these events in court\n\nthe next day.   The excused juror was replaced by an alternate.\n\n           15\n               Even when a petitioner’s claims are procedurally\nbarred, this court may review the claims if     “the prisoner can\ndemonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice” or “that\nfailure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental\nmiscarriage of justice.” Coleman v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750\n(1991).   Olszewski does not argue that either of these exceptions\napplies here.\n                               -33-\n\f            The defendant here does not assert that the trial judge\n\nerred in excusing the juror, and it is well established that “[t]he\n\ndecision to substitute an alternate juror is committed to the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court” and will not be overturned “absent\n\na showing of bias or prejudice to the defendant.”16            United States\n\nv. Corsino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483542\"><a href=\"/opinion/483542/united-states-v-rafael-corsino/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1st Cir. 1987) (internal citations\n\nomitted).        Rather, the defendant contends that he had a Sixth\n\nAmendment right to be present when the trial judge communicated\n\nwith the juror’s son and doctor, and when the juror was excused.\n\n            “[T]he right to personal presence at all critical stages\n\nof the trial ... [is a] fundamental right[ ] of each criminal\n\ndefendant.”      Rushen v. Spain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111051\"><a href=\"/opinion/111051/rushen-v-spain/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117 (1983).       This right\n\nmust be balanced against “the necessity for preserving society’s\n\ninterest in the administration of criminal justice.”            Id. at 118.\n\nWe see no basis for Olszewski’s claim that the judge’s action in\n\nexcusing the juror violated his Sixth Amendment rights.            Nor do we\n\nthink   that     the   judge’s   ex   parte   communications    amounted    to\n\nprejudicial error.       Unrecorded ex parte communications between a\n\ntrial judge and a juror are subject to harmless error review.              Id.\n\nat 119-20.       Error is harmless where “the jury’s deliberations, as\n\na whole, [are] not biased by the undisclosed communication.”               Id.\n\n\n            16\n               In fact, the Supreme Judicial Court found that it is\n“obvious that the defendant would not have opposed excusing the\njuror” where defense counsel “did not move for a mistrial, or\nrequest empanelment of an additional juror or any other remedial\nmeasure.” Olszewski, 416 Mass. at 722, 625 N.E.2d at 539.\n                               -34-\n\fat 121.   Olszewski has not alleged that the jury was biased by the\n\nex parte communications.\n\n           This case is like United States v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784450\"><a href=\"/opinion/784450/united-states-of-america-appellee-cross-appellant-v-jeffrey-evans-ronald/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d\n\nCir. 2003), where a juror suffered an asthma attack during trial.\n\nThat evening, the trial judge telephoned the juror ex parte and was\n\ntold that the attack was “more serious than usual” and that the\n\njuror’s doctor instructed him to stay at home.    Id. at 68.   While\n\non the telephone, the judge excused the juror.     Id.   The Second\n\nCircuit found that any error was harmless because the juror was\n\nexcused “well before” the case was sent to the jury, the remaining\n\njurors were “not adversely influenced,” and the dismissal did not\n\n“produce a drastic shift in the jury’s composition.”     Id. at 70.\n\n           The lack of prejudice in this case is particularly clear\n\nwhere there is no suggestion that the juror discussed the case with\n\nother jurors; he was dismissed before the trial began; and counsel\n\nwas informed of the communications the next morning at which time\n\nthere was no suggestion of actual or potential prejudice or any\n\nrequest for curative action by the trial court.    Indeed, that the\n\njudge dismissed the juror before court reconvened in the morning\n\nhelped to ensure that the remaining jurors would not be prejudiced\n\nby the dismissed juror’s dissatisfaction. Accordingly, we conclude\n\nthat the district court correctly denied habeas relief as to this\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                                -35-\n\f                    VII.\n\nThe decision of the district court is\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                    -36-\n\f</pre>",
