Petitioner John M. McCambridge\n\nappeals the district court's denial of his habeas corpus petition\n\nchallenging the constitutionality of his state conviction for\n\nmanslaughter.        A panel of this court had earlier reversed the\n\ndistrict court and granted his petition, holding: (1) that the\n\nprosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and improperly\n\ntook advantage of the absence of this evidence in its closing\n\narguments, in violation of McCambridge's right to due process; and\n\n(2) that the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision holding otherwise\n\nwas    contrary     to     and   an    unreasonable     application       of   clearly\nestablished Supreme Court law.              McCambridge v. Hall, No. 00-1621,\n\nslip op. (1st Cir. Sept. 24, 2001).                That opinion was withdrawn\nwhen   the   full     court      subsequently     granted      the     Commonwealth's\npetition for en banc review.               We now affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of habeas corpus.\n\n                                           I.\n\n             John McCambridge was charged in 1994 with first degree\nmurder, weapons violations and various motor vehicle offenses. The\ncharges arose out of a shooting and a motor vehicle accident\ninvolving McCambridge and the victim, Richard Doyle.                      McCambridge\n\nadmitted to the shooting and said he acted in self-defense.                          The\n\njury   rejected      the      murder   charge    and    the   charge    that    he   was\n\noperating a motor vehicle after his license had been revoked or\n\nsuspended,     but       it    convicted    him    of    manslaughter,         unlawful\n\npossession of a firearm, operating a motor vehicle under the\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\finfluence of alcohol, and reckless operation of a motor vehicle.\n\nHe is currently serving a sentence of fifteen to twenty years.\n\n             We   describe   the    facts   pertinent    to     the   grounds   of\ndecision as they were found by the state court, Commonwealth v.\n\nMcCambridge, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 285, 690 N.E.2d 470 (1998), fleshed\n\nout by other facts contained in the record and consistent with the\nstate court findings.         We are bound to accept the state court\n\nfindings of fact unless McCambridge convinces us, by clear and\n\nconvincing    evidence,      that   they    are   in   error.     28   U.S.C.    ยง\n\n2254(e)(1).       On no point has he done so.\n\n          McCambridge and Doyle were drinking friends and former\n\nco-workers.       The two had been out drinking together at a bar in\n\nCambridge on the night of the incident, which occurred in the early\nhours of November 11, 1993.          At the bar, McCambridge argued with\n\nthe bartender, screaming at him either because of the television\n\nset, or because of McCambridge's attentions to the bartender's\ngirlfriend. Leaving the bar around one a.m., Doyle and McCambridge\n\ndrove off together in Doyle's van.\n\n             At about two a.m., a state trooper observed a traffic\n\ndisturbance on the Southeast Expressway, which was caused by the\n\nvan weaving through the southbound lanes and driving unusually\n\nslowly, about forty miles per hour, on this major road.                         The\n\ntrooper turned on his lights and siren in an attempt to pull over\n\nthe van, but the van continued to weave through the lanes.               The van\n\nthen accelerated to between fifty miles per hour and sixty-five\n\nmiles per hour and swerved into the cement curbing on the right\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fshoulder of the Expressway.       After the van hit the right shoulder,\n\nit fish-tailed across the road, turning perpendicular to the\n\nExpressway and slowing to a speed of about thirty-five miles per\nhour.    The van then struck the cement center median head-on,\n\nhitting first on the front right side, then with the whole front of\n\nthe van.     The van   went up into the air, rising several feet, and\nlanded with the driver's side down, facing the wrong way down the\n\nroad.   The van then skidded backwards about ten feet, rotating 360\n\ndegrees as it slid.      The trooper also said that, as the van went\n\ninto the center median, he saw a head in the driver's seat area;\n\nthe head smashed into the windshield as the van hit the ground.\n\nThe trooper estimated that about two minutes passed from when he\n\nfirst saw the van until the crash, and that the van had traveled\nabout two or two-and-a-half miles, weaving and then crashing.\n\n             A second witness, an off-duty state trooper, saw the van\n\nweaving through the Expressway lanes, then fish-tailing into the\nright shoulder, crossing the Expressway into the center median,\n\nrising up into the air, and landing on the driver's side.             A third\n\nwitness saw the van weaving across lanes, then actually rocking\n\nback and forth before it hit the right shoulder, at which point it\n\nshot straight across the road into the center median, and flipped\n\nonto its side, landing with the driver's side down on the pavement.\n\n             The trooper and other witnesses found McCambridge in a\n\nfetal position in the area of the driver's seat, bleeding from a\n\nhead injury.    Rescue personnel had to remove the van windshield in\n\norder   to   free   McCambridge   from    the   vehicle.   As   the   rescue\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fpersonnel were removing McCambridge's outerwear, a derringer pistol\n\nfell out of his clothing.\n\n             Doyle had been thrown from the van and his head was\npinned under the driver's side rear wheel so that only his body was\n\nvisible. His clothing had been torn off around the neck area,\n\nleaving his chest completely exposed.              The state troopers at the\n\nscene reported that his skin appeared blue or grayish, he was not\n\nbreathing and he had no pulse, although one paramedic testified\n\nthat Doyle was still warm to the touch when the paramedic arrived.\n\nThere was no attempt to resuscitate him. Doyle was pronounced dead\nupon arrival at the hospital.           He had been shot once in the right\n\ncheek and once in the back (in the area of the right shoulder).               He\nalso had a head wound indicating that the back of his head had\nstruck or been struck with a linear object that was at least three\n\ninches in length and had no sharp or rough edges.                Doyle's blood\nalcohol level was 0.22%.\n             In    the   van,   the    troopers    found   a   Smith   &   Wesson\n\nsemiautomatic pistol; the safety was off and the gun was cocked,\n\nloaded, and ready to fire.          The police also found a billy club with\n\nblood on it that was consistent with Doyle's blood type and two\n\nboxes of ammunition, each corresponding to one of the two guns.\n\nDoyle had been living in the van prior to the crash, and the van\n\nwas   used    by    a    homeless     advocacy    organization   to    transport\n\nindividuals to shelters.\n\n             The prosecution's theory at trial was that McCambridge\n\nhad shot Doyle and was driving the van, en route to dumping the\n\n                                        -5-\n\fbody, when the crash occurred.             McCambridge admitted shooting\n\nDoyle, but argued he did so in self-defense.              More specifically,\n\nMcCambridge claimed that Doyle, in a drunken rage, was threatening\nto   shoot   him   for   implying   that    Doyle   was    a    child   abuser.\n\nMcCambridge says that the derringer was Doyle's, which Doyle\n\nhimself had placed on the dashboard, as he was on his way to sell\nthe gun to a customer in Quincy.\n\n             McCambridge testified that the argument in the van had\n\nits genesis in a conversation between Doyle and himself, a month or\n\nso before the shooting.     In that conversation, McCambridge says he\n\ntold Doyle that he had heard Doyle had been convicted for child\n\nabuse.   Doyle, after initially denying the charge, admitted it was\n\ntrue, said he had done his time for it, and said he didn't want to\nhear any more.     Doyle told McCambridge that \"if [McCambridge] ever\n\nthrew it up to him, his face again . . . he'd put a bullet in\n\n[McCambridge's] frigging head.\"\n             Despite this warning, McCambridge says he raised the\n\ntopic again in the van, just prior to the shooting.                McCambridge\n\ntestified that the argument began after leaving the bar, when\n\nMcCambridge asked Doyle, who was driving, to give him a ride to his\n\nex-wife's house.     Doyle said he had to make a phone call and left\n\nthe van.     When he returned, Doyle said he had to go to Quincy\n\nbecause he had a customer for a derringer pistol.              Doyle pulled the\n\nderringer out from under the seat and threw it on the dashboard.\n\nMcCambridge again asked to be taken to his ex-wife's, but Doyle\n\ndrove on toward Quincy.      This angered McCambridge and so he told\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fDoyle he was drunk and called Doyle a name implying that Doyle had\n\nabused a child.   McCambridge testified that Doyle then pulled out\n\na   nine-millimeter   Smith   &   Wesson   from   his   waist   band,   and\nthreatened McCambridge with it.          McCambridge testified that he\n\npushed downward on Doyle's right hand, while Doyle pushed upwards,\n\nand that he begged Doyle to put the gun down.           At the same time,\nMcCambridge says he grabbed the derringer from the dashboard.           He\n\nsaw Doyle cock the hammer of the Smith & Wesson, so he shot Doyle\n\nin the face with the derringer.       McCambridge testified he had no\n\nmemory of anything else until he woke up in the hospital.\n           According to a ballistics expert's testimony at trial,\n\nDoyle had been shot with the derringer pistol that fell out of\n\nMcCambridge's clothing at the accident scene.             The ballistics\n\nexpert testified that the derringer needed to be manually loaded,\nwould only bear two cartridges, and needed to be manually cocked\neach time the weapon was fired.     He further testified that it would\n\ntake between thirteen and sixteen pounds of pressure to pull the\n\ntrigger, which he characterized as \"a very heavy trigger pull.\" He\n\nalso testified that he would expect a considerable flash when the\n\ngun was fired, \"enough to instantaneously brighten a darkened\n\nroom.\"   The state trooper pursuing the van testifed that he saw no\nflash or other light from the van's interior.\n           A forensic chemist testified at trial for the prosecution\n\nthat, in her opinion, Doyle was shot while he was in the driver's\nseat of the van; but at the time of the accident, Doyle was\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fprobably near the sliding passenger's side door and McCambridge in\n\nthe driver's seat.   This supported the prosecution's theory of the\n\ncase, which was that McCambridge had shot Doyle sometime after\nleaving the bar, and then deposited his body in the back of the\n\nvan.   She testified that Doyle's blood was spattered in a downward\n\nand outward direction on the driver's side door in a manner\nsuggesting a high-velocity impact, such as from a gunshot wound,\n\nwith blood dripping down the door.    This indicated that the van was\n\nin an upright position when the blood spattered on the door.     She\n\ntestified that the hardening around the edges of blood droplets\n\nsuggested that the blood on the upper part of the window remained\n\nundisturbed for about three minutes and that the larger quantities\n\nof blood, dripping down the driver's side door, were undisturbed\nfor at least five minutes.\n\n           Blood matching Doyle's type was found on the driver's\n\nseat and had soaked through the upholstery into the cushion, and a\n\npool of Doyle's blood type had collected under the driver's seat.\n\nThere was also blood on the seat of McCambridge's jeans that was\nconsistent with Doyle's blood; the forensics expert testified that\nthe stain was consistent with McCambridge sitting in blood, rather\n\nthan merely wiping up against blood.    More of the Doyle-type blood\nwas found on the front leg of McCambridge's jeans; on a jacket\n\nbelonging to McCambridge, which the police found in the back of the\n\nvan after the crash; and on the billy club found in the van.\n\nDoyle's blood was also on the passenger's side sliding door, which\n\nwas off the hinges at the bottom, and open \"like a flap.\"     Fibers\n\n                                -8-\n\ffrom Doyle's sweater were fused to the lower portion of the sliding\n\ndoor, indicating that the sweater had struck the door with great\n\nforce.     She also testified that, based on the stippling marks on\nDoyle's clothing, she believed the gunshot wound in Doyle's back\n\nwas caused by a shot fired from a distance of three feet or\n\ngreater.\n              As for McCambridge, the forensics expert found tissue,\n\nhair    and   blood    on    the   upper     passenger's         side    corner    of   the\n\nwindshield and on the passenger's side dashboard that appeared to\n\nbe McCambridge's, as well as on the rear-view mirror (which was\n\ndetached from its proper place).                   McCambridge's blood was also\n\nfound on his sweater and the jacket he was wearing at the time of\n\nthe    crash.       The   expert     also    found       glass   fragments      from    the\nwindshield      and    the    passenger's         side    window    in     McCambridge's\n\nclothes, indicating that McCambridge was probably in contact with\n\nthe passenger's side window when it broke.                         (There was no such\nevidence      that    Doyle    had     come       in     contact    with    the    broken\n\nwindshield.)\n\n              The     Commonwealth      had        a     specialist        in     accident\n\nreconstruction testify.            He supported the witnesses' memories of\n\nthe crash, and opined that Doyle's body must have been ejected from\n\nthe flapping passenger's side sliding door at the first impact. He\n\nalso testified that, upon impact, the occupants of the van would\n\nhave been thrown forward and to the right.                       He further testified\nthat the driver was likely to have been pinned behind the wheel.\n\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\f             The medical examiner who testified for the Commonwealth\n\nstated     that   the   manner   in   which   Doyle's   impact   wounds   bled\n\nsuggested that it was possible that he was still alive at the time\nof the crash, but that he could not be sure.             He based this upon\n\nthe fact that there was blood in the tissues surrounding the impact\n\nabrasions, which could indicate that Doyle's heart was still\npumping blood at the time of impact, but that could also be caused\n\nby the body being turned multiple times.1           The medical examiner's\n\nopinion was that Doyle was shot first in the cheek, from a distance\n\nof six to eight inches to the right of the right cheek; this shot\n\nprobably would have killed Doyle within eight minutes.             He stated\n\nthat the second gunshot, to the upper right back shoulder area,\n\nsevered Doyle's aorta and thus probably would have killed Doyle in\nless than two to three minutes, and definitely in less than eight\n\nminutes.      He also concluded that, based on the amount of blood\n\nthat Doyle had inhaled into his lungs, Doyle had time to take at\nleast a few breaths between the two shots.          Based on Doyle's blood\n\nalcohol content and the fact that Doyle had absorbed all the\nalcohol in his stomach, the medical examiner estimated that Doyle\nhad stopped drinking about ninety minutes prior to being killed.\n\nThe medical expert also testified that Doyle's head wound was\nconsistent with a blow from a billy club, such as was found in the\nvan.\n\n\n\n       1\n          He testified that it also could have been caused by\nattempts to resuscitate Doyle, but none of the witnesses recalled\nany attempts at resuscitation.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            McCambridge's      forensics   expert   testified   that,   upon\n\nimpact, the passenger would be propelled forward into the right-\n\nhand corner of the windshield, but that the steering wheel and\nconsole could prevent the driver from hitting the windshield,\n\ninstead sending the driver back, through the twenty-nine inch space\n\nbetween the front bucket seats, and out the passenger's side\nsliding door.       He further testified that the derringer has an\n\naverage muzzle energy of 95 foot pounds, roughly equivalent to a\n\npunch from a professional boxer, whereas the Smith & Wesson has an\n\naverage muzzle energy of 355 foot pounds.           Due to the relatively\n\nweak muzzle energy of the derringer, he testified that it was\n\npossible for Doyle to have been shot once and still have remained\n\nconscious, active, and possibly even more aggressive because of the\nwound.\n\n            Since the habeas issue asserted is based on the question\n\nof evidence as to whether or not Doyle had been convicted of child\nabuse, we go into detail on this point.          At trial, the prosecution\n\ncalled    Doyle's   brother.      During   the   testimony,   McCambridge's\n\ncounsel asked for a side-bar and informed the court that, if the\n\nCommonwealth planned to challenge the truth of Doyle's conviction\n\nfor child abuse, he would like the opportunity to cross-examine\n\nDoyle's brother about whether Doyle had served time for child\n\nabuse.2    At that point, the prosecution said it was not certain\n\nwhether it intended to challenge the truth of the conviction.            The\n\n     2\n          Prior to trial, McCambridge, proceeding pro se, had\nunsuccessfully requested Doyle's \"rap sheet\" by means of a hand-\nwritten letter to the prosecutor.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fcourt said that it would keep Doyle's brother available to be\n\nrecalled as a witness if the prosecution decided to argue that\n\nDoyle had not been convicted.\n            Later, during McCambridge's testimony, the prosecutor\n\nobjected on hearsay and prejudice grounds to McCambridge referring\n\nto   Doyle's   conviction.      The     prosecutor     said    the   prejudice\noutweighed any probative value.          The court asked if there was a\n\nconviction on the charge.      Defense counsel represented there was a\n\nconviction, but said \"whether it's true or not in some ways is\n\nirrelevant.\" At that point, the judge asked counsel whether either\n\nhad checked Doyle's probation record.          The prosecutor replied, \"It\n\njust says -- it doesn't say what for.              I have no idea what it's\n\nfor.\"     The judge allowed McCambridge to testify to his first\nconversation with Doyle about the conviction, agreeing that it went\n\nto McCambridge's state of mind, which was relevant to the self-\n\ndefense theory, and not for the truth of the conviction, which was\nnot relevant to self-defense. On cross-examination of McCambridge,\n\nthe prosecutor raised the issue of the conviction, and then asked,\n\n\"You know Mr. Doyle is deceased?,\" to which McCambridge answered\n\nyes.    The prosecutor then asked, \"He can't refute your allegations\n\nright now; can he?\"      The defense objected to that question, and the\n\nobjection was sustained.\n\n            Near   the   conclusion    of    the   defense's   case,   defense\n\ncounsel requested a side-bar to clarify whether he needed to recall\n\nDoyle's brother.    That turned, he said, on whether the prosecution\n\nintended to impugn McCambridge's credibility by arguing that Doyle\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fhad never been convicted or in jail, when there was no evidence\n\neither way on this point.     The prosecutor took the position that\n\nDoyle had not been in jail, that the defense counsel could ask the\nquestion of Doyle's brother if he wanted, and that it was up to the\n\ndefense, not the prosecution, to put Doyle's criminal record into\n\nevidence. When asked by the court, the prosecutor said, \"He wasn't\nin jail, Judge,\" and then, when the court further asked if Doyle\n\nwas convicted, the prosecutor responded \"No.   No.\"   The prosecutor\n\nsaid all he had seen on the record was spousal abuse, \"so far as\n\n[he knew, Doyle] had never been in jail,\" and that was all he could\n\nsay on the matter.\n\n          Defense counsel said he did not have access to the\n\ncriminal record and would like it produced.      He said he did not\nwant to make it part of the case but that he \"d[id]n't want to open\n\nit up for argument that [he] didn't prove that [Doyle] had one,\n\nand, therefore, [McCambridge] was lying.\"      The court asked the\nprosecution what it intended to argue on the issue. The prosecutor\n\nreplied that he had no problem if the defendant called the brother\n\n\"because, as far as I know, there is no record that Mr. Doyle had\n\nany convictions.\"    When the judge inquired further, the prosecutor\n\nsaid he should not be put in the position of disclosing what his\n\nclosing argument would be.     He foreshadowed what he might do by\n\nsaying McCambridge \"gets up there and says [Doyle's] done time when\n\nI know he hasn't from the records I've seen.    And if [McCambridge\n\nhas] got the record, he can [attempt to introduce it.]\"    The court\n\nthen interjected that the information had come in only for the\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fstate of mind of the defendant.          The prosecutor said that was all\n\nhe was going to argue.\n\n          In his closing argument, the defense counsel was careful\nto emphasize that McCambridge's testimony about Doyle's conviction\n\nwas offered only to show his state of mind and that there was no\n\nevidence that Doyle ever molested or abused any child.             He stated\nthat \"[t]here is simply no evidence one way or another . . . .\n\nThere is no evidence that he did it.          There is no evidence that he\n\ndidn't do it.      It was admitted for . . . the state of mind.\"           The\n\nprosecutor,   in    turn,   in   his   closing   referred   to   the   earlier\nconversation:\n\n                 Does the defendant have something for you to\n          believe when he gets up there and says, oh, yeah, I had\n          an argument with Richard Doyle because of child\n          molestation? There is absolutely evidence of that. Was\n          that put in there to tell you what his frame of mind was?\n          No. That was his third shot at the victim from the stand,\n          assassinating his reputation with no evidence. That's\n          what that was for, I suggest to you, not to show state of\n          mind.\nLiterally read, the prosecution admitted there was evidence that\n\ndefendant had an argument with Doyle in the aftermath of the child\nabuse accusation, but that the real purpose for the testimony was\nto impugn the victim, not to show McCambridge's state of mind.3\n\n\n     3\n          The now-withdrawn panel opinion of this court assumed\nthat there had been a typographical error and that the transcript\nomitted the word \"no\" between \"absolutely\" and \"evidence.\" But the\ntranscript sentence and the flow of the argument make perfect sense\nas stated.   The prosecutor may well have meant that there was\nevidence of the conviction, or of the prior conversation, but no\nevidence of the alleged confrontation the night of Doyle's death.\nThis was the transcript that the state court had and McCambridge's\nbrief before the Massachusetts Appeals Court cited the passage as\nit appeared in the transcript, with no modifications. If there was\n\n                                       -14-\n\fDefense   counsel   did   not   object     to   the   prosecution's   closing\n\nstatement. Nor was the closing statement presented as error to the\n\nstate courts on McCambridge's direct appeal.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           McCambridge appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court, presenting three main arguments: that the derringer\n\nand his clothes were the product of an unlawful search and seizure\n\nand should have been suppressed; that the jury should have been\n\ninstructed   on   the   possibility   of    a   necessity   defense   to   the\n\nfirearms charge; and that \"the trial court erred by not requiring\nDoyle's criminal record to be made part of the record, and the\n\nprosecutor may have violated the defendant's state and federal due\nprocess rights by not disclosing that record.\"               On this third\nargument, McCambridge argued:\n\n                  The suppression of material evidence favorable to\n           the accused and requested by him violates the due process\n           clause of the Fifth Amendment. Brady v. Maryland, 373\n           U.S. 83, 87 (1963).    In the case at bar, because the\n           trial court refused to require the Commonwealth to\n           produce Doyle's criminal record, the defendant cannot\n           prove that exculpatory evidence was withheld. . . . Thus,\n           this Court should order the Commonwealth to produce\n           Doyle's criminal record so that an appellate decision can\n           be made. In the alternative, the case should be remanded\n           to the Superior Court for production of the document at\n           issue.\n\n\n\n\nan error in the transcript which worked against the defendant,\nunder state law he should have sought to correct the transcript.\nMass. R. App. Pro. 8(e). The first suggestion that a word was\nomitted from the transcript appears to be in the brief that the\nCommonwealth submitted before the panel of this court. Our holding\nhere does not turn on whether or not the word \"no\" should have been\nincluded, and so we do not need to decide the point.\n\n                                   -15-\n\fThe Commonwealth responded that McCambridge had not requested that\n\nDoyle's record be marked as an exhibit until the sentencing stage,\n\nthat the    proper     means    for   challenging    a   failure     to    disclose\nexculpatory evidence would have been through a motion for new trial\n\nunder Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(b), and that the\n\nconviction record was not material to the verdict because \"the jury\nclearly    believed       the     defendant's       testimony      regarding      a\n\nconfrontation with the victim,\" since they convicted him only of\n\nmanslaughter.\n\n            After filing its brief with the state appeals court, the\n\nCommonwealth filed a Motion to Expand the Record to include Doyle's\n\ncriminal record, which did in fact contain a conviction for child\n\nneglect and a notation that Doyle served six months in jail for\nthis conviction.        The Commonwealth's motion explained that, at\n\ntrial, the prosecutor had only a partial print-out of the record,\n\nwhich had no mention of the child neglect conviction, and included\nas an appendix a copy of this truncated print-out.\n\n            In   his    reply    brief,    McCambridge      argued    that     \"the\n\nCommonwealth     has   now     disclosed   that   exculpatory      evidence     was\n\nwithheld at trial\" and, citing Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n(1963),    and   United      States   v.   Bagley,    473   U.S.     667    (1995),\n\nmaintained that he was entitled to a new trial.\n\n            On appeal, the Massachusetts Appeals Court held:4\n                   Failure to mark Doyle's criminal record for\n            identification. The defendant requested the trial judge\n\n     4\n          The court reversed the firearms conviction, agreeing that\nthe judge should have instructed the jury on a necessity defense.\n\n                                       -16-\n\f          at the sentencing hearing to mark Doyle's criminal record\n          as an \"exhibit.\" The judge denied the request and the\n          defendant claims it was error, for the record was\n          necessary to support his claim that the prosecution had\n          withheld exculpatory evidence from him. The defendant\n          claimed that Doyle's record would have supported his\n          claim that Doyle had been convicted of child abuse, which\n          would have corroborated the defendant's testimony at\n          trial that Doyle pulled a gun on him when the defendant\n          called Doyle a name indicating he was a child abuser,\n          which accusation on a prior occasion had prompted Doyle\n          to threaten the defendant's life if he ever accused him\n          of this offense again. While the defendant pressed for\n          the introduction of the victim's criminal record at\n          trial, he did not object when the judge did not order its\n          production or request that the record be marked for\n          identification. He cannot now be heard to complain that\n          the judge failed to do so at the sentencing stage.\n\n                 In any event, assuming without deciding that the\n          prosecutor should have produced the victim's record,\n          there was no prejudice to the defendant because he was\n          aware of the victim's record and was prepared to offer\n          such evidence at trial.    Moreover, by convicting the\n          defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited\n          the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van\n          was precipitated by the defendant's remark about this\n          offense to Doyle. See Commonwealth v. Tucceri, 412 Mass.\n          401, 412-14, 589 N.E.2d 1216 (1992).\n\nMcCambridge, 690 N.E.2d at 475.       In essence, the court held that\nMcCambridge   had   forfeited   the   issue   at   trial   and   could   not\n\nresuscitate it by raising it at sentencing.         It also held in the\nalternative that McCambridge suffered no prejudice from the absence\n\nof Doyle's record.\n\n          McCambridge then filed an application to obtain further\n\nreview with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC).               He\n\nargued that\n\n          the defendant was dissuaded from attempting to put [the\n          criminal record] evidence before the jury because the\n          prosecutor misled the defense by representing that the\n          alleged victim did not have a record and in any event\n          that the issue wouldn't be argued in closing.         The\n          withholding of information with the intent to mislead and\n\n                                  -17-\n\f          prejudice the defendant, and the exploitation of that\n          misdirection in closing argument violated the defendant's\n          rights to a fair trial.\n\nMcCambridge cited Brady and Commonwealth v. Tucceri, 412 Mass. 401,\n589 N.E.2d 1216 (1992), a Massachusetts case on failure to produce\n\nexculpatory evidence, as support.       The Commonwealth responded that\n\n\"any failure to produce the victim's criminal record did not\nprejudice the defendant.\" The SJC, without opinion, denied further\n\nappellate review. Commonwealth v. McCambridge, 427 Mass. 1103, 707\n\nN.E.2d 1076 (1998).\n\n                                 III.\n\n          In January 1999, McCambridge filed a petition for habeas\n\ncorpus under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254 (1994 & Supp. II 1996) in the\nDistrict of   Massachusetts.      He    argued   that   his   detention   is\nunconstitutional because the trial court erroneously admitted the\n\nseized clothing and gun into evidence in violation of both his\nFourth and Fifth Amendment rights; that the trial court failed to\ninstruct the jury on the necessity defense; and that the prosecutor\n\nimproperly    withheld    exculpatory     material,     namely,    Doyle's\nconviction record.       On the Commonwealth's motion, the district\ncourt dismissed McCambridge's first argument as to the seized\n\nclothing and gun, because it was essentially a Fourth Amendment\nclaim that was not reviewable on habeas.         McCambridge v. Hall, 68\n\nF. Supp. 2d 1, 4 (D. Mass. 1999).       The district court subsequently\n\nheld that the gun charge error did not affect the manslaughter\nconviction, as \"[t]he question put to the jury was not whether\n\nMcCambridge used an unlawful device when defending himself, but\n\n                                 -18-\n\frather whether he used excessive force.\"                McCambridge v. Hall, 94\n\nF. Supp. 2d 146, 154 (D. Mass. 2000).\n\n           The    district     court    also    held     that   McCambridge   had\nprocedurally defaulted on his claim that the prosecutor's failure\n\nto disclose Doyle's conviction record violated McCambridge's rights\n\nunder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and Giglio v. United\n\nStates, 405 U.S. 150 (1972).           McCambridge, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 154-\n\n55. The district court referred to the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nholding cited above, noting that \"[p]rocedural default acts as an\n\nindependent and adequate state ground to uphold the conviction.\"\n\nId. at 155.     The court further held that McCambridge had not shown\n\nthat \"some objective factor external to the defense impeded defense\n\ncounsel's efforts to comply with the state's procedural rule,\" id.\n\nat    155-56,    nor    had   he   shown      \"actual    prejudice\"   from    the\n\nprosecution's failure to produce the criminal conviction, id. at\n\n156, nor any miscarriage of justice, id.                The court reasoned:\n           The actual contents of Doyle's criminal record are not\n           relevant to this analysis because the details of the\n           actual criminal record were not known to McCambridge at\n           the time of the homicide. . . . Rather, McCambridge\n           believed, from whatever source, that Doyle had a criminal\n           history of child abuse, knew that accusations of child\n           abuse were likely to provoke violence from Doyle, and\n           after such provocation became fearful of his life when\n           Doyle drew a gun. To these facts McCambridge testified\n           at his trial, and the jury must have accepted that his\n           provocation story at least raised some reasonable doubt\n           in order to convict on manslaughter rather than first- or\n           second-degree murder.\n\nId.\n\n           The district court declined to issue a certificate of\n\nappealability.         This court subsequently issued a certificate of\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fappealability on McCambridge's Brady claim.                    On appeal, a panel of\n\nthis court reversed the district court and granted the habeas\n\npetition.           McCambridge v. Hall, No. 00-1621, slip op. (1st Cir.\nSept.     24,       2001).       The   panel    held    that       the    state     court's\n\ndetermination that McCambridge's counsel should have objected at\n\ntrial to the failure of the court to order the prosecutor to\nproduce the record and to mark it into evidence was contrary to\n\nclearly     established          federal      law,     and    its    conclusion          that\n\nMcCambridge suffered no prejudice was an unreasonable application\n\nof the law to the facts.                 The panel held that, under clearly\n\nestablished federal law, a defendant may rely on a prosecutor's\n\nrepresentations          that    she    has    fully    complied         with    her    Brady\n\ndisclosure requirements, and therefore, need not object.                               Id. at\n17-18.     Further, the panel held that the prosecutor's insinuation\n\nin his closing that McCambridge had invented the entire story about\n\nDoyle's criminal conviction prejudiced McCambridge and \"may well\nhave tipped the balance in favor of a manslaughter conviction.\"\n\nId. at 38.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n                A    habeas     petitioner     must    meet    certain          preliminary\n\ncriteria before we can reach the merits of his claim.                           He must have\nfairly presented his claims to the state courts and must have\nexhausted his state court remedies.                    28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(b)(1)(A).\n\nFurther,        if    the     state    decision      rests    on    the    adequate       and\nindependent state ground of procedural default, then federal habeas\n\nreview is unavailable absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or\n\n                                           -20-\n\fa showing that a miscarriage of justice will otherwise result.\n\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 282 (1999); Gunter v. Maloney,\n\n291 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 2002); Burks v. Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 716\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           The district court here held that the state court decided\n\nthat McCambridge had procedurally defaulted the claim he now makes,\nand that finding of procedural default constitutes an adequate and\n\nindependent state ground.         McCambridge, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 155. The\n\ndistrict court held that McCambridge had shown neither cause nor\n\nprejudice.    Id. at 155-56.      The district court also agreed with the\n\nAppeals Court's alternate holding, that even if the prosecution\n\nshould   have    produced   the    record,   there   was   no    prejudice   to\n\nMcCambridge.     Id. at 156.\n           Some members of the majority agree with each of the\n\ndistrict court's holdings.          All members of the majority agree on\n\nthe   district    court's   no-prejudice      holding,     and   so,   without\ndiscussion or elaboration of the procedural default argument, we\n\naddress the issue of whether the state court's conclusion that\n\nMcCambridge was not prejudiced was an unreasonable application of\n\nthe law.\n\n             Under the standard established in the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, ยง 104,\n\n110 Stat. 1214, 1219 (1996), a federal court may not issue a habeas\n\npetition \"with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the\n\nmerits in State court proceedings\" unless the state court decision:\n\n1) \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\nof   the    United    States\"   or    2)   \"was    based   on    an    unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\nthe State court proceeding.\"           28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d) (Supp. II 1996).\n\nA state court's findings on factual issues \"shall be presumed to be\n\ncorrect\" and the petitioner bears the burden of disproving factual\nfindings     by   \"clear    and      convincing     evidence.\"        28   U.S.C.     ยง\n\n2254(e)(1).\n\nA.   Applicability of ยง 2254\n\n             We first deal with, and reject, the argument of amicus\nthat we must review the prejudice issue de novo, rather than look\n\nto whether the state court's determination is unreasonable.                         The\nFederal Defender's Office5 asserts that the Massachusetts state\ncourt      analyzed    McCambridge's       Brady     claim      solely     under      a\n\nMassachusetts state standard and therefore his federal claim was\nnever \"adjudicated on the merits\" within the meaning of ยง 2254.                      If\nthat were so, we would review McCambridge's Brady claim de novo,\n\nrather than asking whether the state court's holding is \"contrary\nto, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law,\" the standard required by ยง 2254.               See DiBenedetto v.\n\nHall, 272 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S.Ct. 1622\n(2002); Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001), cert.\n\ndenied, 122 S.Ct. 1609 (2002).\n\n\n      5\n          This court invited the Federal Defender's Office to file\nan amicus brief in support of McCambridge and we thank the Office\nfor its assistance.\n\n                                       -22-\n\f            It is true that the relevant portion of the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court decision cites only to a state court decision,\n\nTucceri, 589 N.E.2d 1216.      The state court inquiry did focus on\nwhether there was \"prejudice\" to the defendant, which is the\n\nrelevant federal standard. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281-82. But\n\nthe Federal Defender's Office argues that Tucceri established a\nstandard for prejudice that is different from the federal standard,\n\nand the citation to Tucceri indicates that the court was not using\n\nthe federal standard to determine prejudice.\n\n            Tucceri states explicitly that it is articulating a state\n\nlaw standard that is \"more favorable to defendants than the Federal\n\nConstitutional standard.\"      589 N.E.2d at 1223 n.11.    There is no\n\ndispute that this is so.       If the conviction survives this more\nlenient state standard, then, absent exceptional circumstances, it\n\nfollows that the conviction would survive the federal standard, and\n\nwe see no reason the state courts would be required to say\nexplicitly that both standards are met.     If there is a federal or\n\nstate case that explicitly says that the state adheres to a\n\nstandard that is more favorable to defendants than the federal\n\nstandard (and it is correct in its characterization of the law), we\n\nwill presume the federal law adjudication to be subsumed within the\n\nstate law adjudication.     Cf. DiBenedetto, 272 F.3d at 6 (stating\n\nthat de novo review applies when \"the state court has not decided\n\nthe federal constitutional claim (even by reference to state court\n\ndecisions    dealing    with    federal   constitutional    issues)\").\n\nTherefore, we reject amicus's argument that de novo review under\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fFortini applies here, and we apply ยง 2254's standard to the state\n\nappeals court's determination that McCambridge was not prejudiced\n\nby the prosecution's failure to disclose the conviction record.\n\nB.    Standard of Review under ยง 2254\n\n            We turn to whether the state court holding that there was\n\nno    prejudice     \"was   contrary   to,     or   involved    an   unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\"              28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1).\n\n            There is no argument that the state court decision is\n\n\"contrary to\" clearly established federal law.                The Supreme Court\nhas stated:\n\n            Under the \"contrary to\" clause, a federal habeas court\n            may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a\n            conclusion opposite to that reached by this Court on a\n            question of law or if the state court decides a case\n            differently than this Court has on a set of materially\n            indistinguishable facts.\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412-13 (2000) (O'Connor, J.).\n\nHere, the state court applied the proper rule of law by asking if\nthe defendant was prejudiced, see Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281-82,\n\nand    there   is    no    Supreme    Court    case   involving      \"materially\n\nindistinguishable facts\" that is contrary to the outcome here.\n\nRather, the debate centers on whether the state appeals court\ndetermination was an \"unreasonable application\" of the federal rule\n\non prejudice to the facts of the case here.\n            Williams made it clear that \"[u]nder the 'unreasonable\n\napplication' clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if\n\nthe state court identifies the correct governing legal principle\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\ffrom [the Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that\n\nprinciple to the facts of the prisoner's case.\"             Williams, 529\n\nU.S. at 413 (O'Connor, J.).      The Supreme Court further clarified\nthat unreasonableness must be an objective standard, id. at 410,\n\nand that an erroneous or incorrect application is not necessarily\n\nan unreasonable application, id. at 411.\n          Some possible readings of \"unreasonable application\" are\n\ntoo severe: Williams indicates that the test is not whether it is\n\npossible that    a   competent   court   could   have   reached   the   same\n\nconclusion.   See    Hertz & Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice\n\nand Procedure, ยง 32.3, 1449 (4th ed. 2001) (noting that the Supreme\n\nCourt in Williams found state supreme court decision to be an\n\n\"unreasonable application\" despite the fact that other courts had\nreached the same conclusion); see also Valdez v. Ward, 219 F.3d\n\n1222, 1229-30 (10th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 979 (2001)\n\n(\"[T]he fact that one court or even a few courts have applied the\nprecedent in the same manner to close facts does not make the state\n\ncourt decision 'reasonable.'\").\n          Some possible readings are too lenient: the mere fact\n\nthat there was some error or that the state decision was incorrect\n\nis not enough.   Williams, 529 U.S. at 411; Boss v. Pierce, 263 F.3d\n\n734, 739 (7th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S.Ct. 1961 (2002);\n\nCannon v. Gibson, 259 F.3d 1253, 1260 (10th Cir. 2001), cert.\n\ndenied, 122 S.Ct. 1966 (2002); Tucker v. Catoe, 221 F.3d 600, 605\n\n(4th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1054 (2000); Francis S. v.\n\nStone, 221 F.3d 100, 111 (2d Cir. 2000).         The range for what is an\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\funreasonable application must fall somewhere between the two.\n\nWithin that range, if it is a close question whether the state\n\ndecision   is   in    error,   then    the    state   decision     cannot    be   an\nunreasonable application.         We agree with the Second Circuit that\n\n\"some    increment    of    incorrectness      beyond      error   is    required.\"\n\nFrancis S., 221 F.3d at 111.          The increment need not necessarily be\ngreat,    but   it   must    be   great      enough   to    make   the    decision\n\nunreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of the\n\nfederal court.       Id.\n\n            As Justice O'Connor noted in Williams, unreasonableness\n\nis \"difficult to define,\" 529 U.S. at 410, but it is a concept\n\nfederal judges apply in different contexts.                \"Reasonableness is a\n\nconcept, not a constant.\"         United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330,\n336 (1st Cir. 1990).        For example, the state court decision may be\n\nunreasonable if it is devoid of record support for its conclusions\n\nor is arbitrary.        O'Brien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n            To the extent prior opinions by panels of this court\nstate a standard inconsistent with that articulated here, they are\n\noverruled. Thus, the standard recited in Williams v. Matesanz, 230\n\nF.3d 421, 424 (1st Cir. 2000), and OโBrien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16,\n\n25 (1st Cir. 1998) -- that \"for the writ to issue, the state court\n\ndecision must be so offensive to existing precedent, so devoid of\n\nrecord support, or so arbitrary, as to indicate that it is outside\n\nthe universe of plausible, credible outcomes\" -- must be read to\n\nconform to these teachings.            In light of Williams v. Taylor, we\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fthink that the more stringent interpretation of ยง 2254 articulated\n\nin O'Brien and Williams v. Matesanz is not justified.\n\nC.   Prejudice Analysis\n\n            We apply this \"unreasonable application\" standard to the\n\nstate appellate court's determination that there was no prejudice\n\nto McCambridge from the failure of the prosecutor to have produced\n\nthe victim's record.         The Massachusetts Appeals Court based its no\n\nprejudice    finding    on    two   independent     reasons.      There    was   no\n\nprejudice because 1) McCambridge was aware of the victim's record\n\nand was prepared to offer such evidence at trial; and 2) \"[b]y\nconvicting    the    defendant      of   manslaughter,     the   jury    obviously\n\ncredited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was\nprecipitated by the defendant's remark about this offense to\nDoyle.\"     690 N.E.2d at 475.           While some on the en banc majority\n\nthink the    state     appeals      court's     first   ground   alone   would   be\ndispositive, we focus on the second ground, which all in the\nmajority think clearly disposes of the petition.\n\n            Even assuming arguendo that the prosecutor should have\nturned over the conviction record, there is no prejudice under\nBrady and so no due process violation unless there is \"a reasonable\n\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\"                   United\n\nStates v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985) (plurality opinion).\n\nThis has been referred to as the Brady prejudice or materiality\nstandard; without it, there is no Brady violation.                Strickler, 527\n\nU.S. at 281-82.\n\n                                         -27-\n\f           The Supreme Court explained in Bagley that a \"'reasonable\n\nprobability' is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\n\nthe outcome.\"    473 U.S. at 682; see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S.\n419, 435 (1995) (\"One . . . show[s] a           Brady violation by . . .\n\nshowing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to\n\nput the whole case in such a different light as to undermine\nconfidence in the verdict.\"); United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97,\n\n109-10 (1976) (\"The mere possibility that an item of undisclosed\n\ninformation might have helped the defense, or might have affected\n\nthe outcome of the trial, does not establish 'materiality' in the\n\nconstitutional sense.\"); United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1216,\n\n1220 (1st Cir. 1993) (discussing materiality in the context of\n\nBrady claims).     At the same time, prejudice under Brady should not\nbe equated with a sufficiency of the evidence standard, Kyles, 514\n\nU.S. at 434-35, nor does it \"mean that the reviewing court must be\n\ncertain that a different result would obtain,\" United States v.\nDumas, 207 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Defendant and amicus argue that the only reasonable\n\nconclusion is that McCambridge was prejudiced sufficiently to\n\nwarrant a new trial.       They point to the prosecutor's closing\n\ncomments,6 saying he implied that Doyle was not convicted, after\nthe   prosecutor   had   not   produced   the    conviction   record   and\n\nrepresented to the court there was no such conviction.         They argue\n\n\n      6\n          For  present   purposes,  we   do  not   pass  on the\nCommonwealth's arguments that McCambridge never objected to the\nprosecution's closing argument, or raised this as an independent\nissue in the state appeals court, and so has waived the issue.\n\n                                  -28-\n\fthat this was a close case on the evidence and ultimately hinged on\n\nMcCambridge's credibility, which they argue was deeply wounded by\n\nthe prosecutor's comment.            As support for this, they say that\nDoyle's blood alcohol level, subcutaneous bleeding, and the medical\n\ntechnician's testimony that Doyle was still warm indicate that\n\nDoyle was shot shortly before the crash;               that the blood and tissue\nsamples on the passenger side door and windshield indicate that\n\nMcCambridge was in the passenger's seat at the time of the crash;\n\nthat there was a cocked gun with the safety off in the van; and\n\nthat the boxes of ammunition in the car indicate that both guns\n\nbelonged to Doyle. They also argue that the state appellate court's\n\nreasoning that \"by convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the\n\njury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle\nin the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about [the\n\nconviction]    to    Doyle,\"   690      N.E.2d   at     475,   is   arbitrary   and\n\nunsupported by the record, because the jury convicted McCambridge\nof driving offenses and therefore clearly did not credit his\n\ntestimony as to how the fight began.\n\n            The     Commonwealth     responds     that,    given    the   evidence\n\npresented     to    the   jury,    it    was     not    unreasonable      for   the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court to conclude that, even if McCambridge\n\nhad been able to corroborate his testimony with the conviction\n\nrecord and the prosecutor had not made his statement in closing,\n\nthere was no \"reasonable probability that . . . the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.\"                 Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682.\n\nThe result in this proceeding was that McCambridge was acquitted of\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\ffirst degree murder and convicted of manslaughter, so the question\n\nis whether there is a reasonable probability that the manslaughter\n\nverdict would have been different.\n             To assess that question, we first turn to the state trial\n\ncourt's extensive jury instructions, which we quote in relevant\n\npart below. The trial judge explained the Commonwealth's burden to\nprove that McCambridge did not act in self-defense:\n\n             The Commonwealth must prove . . . that one or more of the\n             three requirements of self-defense was absent from this\n             case.\n\n                    . . . [T]hose three requirements are first that\n             the defendant must have reasonably believed that he was\n             being attacked or was immediately about to be attacked\n             and that he was in immediate danger of being killed or\n             seriously injured.\n\n                    Second, the defendant must have done everything\n             that was reasonable under the circumstances to avoid\n             physical combat before resorting to force and, third,\n             that the defendant must have used no more force than was\n             reasonably necessary in the circumstances to protect\n             himself.\n\nShe   also   gave   thorough   instructions   on   how   to   differentiate\n\nmanslaughter upon provocation from self-defense and the role of\n\nexcessive force:\n                    Manslaughter is an unlawful, intentional killing\n             resulting from a sudden transport of the passions of\n             fear, anger, fright, nervous excitement or heat of blood\n             when there is no time to deliberate and when such passion\n             or heat of blood is produced by adequate or reasonable\n             provocation and without malice or upon sudden combat it\n             would have been likely to produce in an ordinary person\n             an abnormal state of mind and actually did produce such\n             a state of mind in the defendant.\n\n             . . . .\n\n                    . . . The first element the Commonwealth must\n             prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant\n             inflicted an injury upon Mr. Doyle from which Mr. Doyle\n\n                                   -30-\n\f          died; second, that the defendant injured Mr. Doyle as a\n          result of sudden combat or in the heat of passion or\n          using excessive force in self-defense; and, third, that\n          the homicide was committed unlawfully without legal\n          excuse or justification.\n                 The provocation sufficient to reduce an unlawful\n          killing from murder to manslaughter is that provocation\n          which would likely produce in the ordinary person such a\n          state of passion, anger, fear, fright, or nervous\n          excitement as would eclipse a person's capacity for\n          reflection or restraint and actually did produce such a\n          state of mind in the defendant.\n\n          . . . .\n\n                 Another factor or circumstance which mitigates or\n          reduces murder to manslaughter is when a person kills\n          using   excessive   force   in  self-defense.    .  .   .\n          Specifically, if the person initiated an assault against\n          the defendant so that the defendant reasonably feared\n          that he was in danger of being killed or suffering\n          grievous bodily harm at the hands of Mr. Doyle, then the\n          defendant has the initial right to use whatever means\n          were reasonably necessary to avert the threatened harm.\n          But, if the defendant used excessive force, that is, more\n          force than was reasonable or proper under the\n          circumstances of this case or the defendant, himself,\n          became the attacker and the use of such force resulted in\n          the death of his assailant, then that would constitute\n          manslaughter.\nAfter a few hours of deliberation, the jury asked for clarification\n\non unlawful killing, malice aforethought, burden of proof, and\n\nreasonable doubt.   The jury then asked for clarification on the\n\ndefinition of manslaughter.   The judge re-read the manslaughter\n\ninstructions that she had previously given.\n\n          Based on these instructions, the state appeals court\n\nreasonably concluded that the jury must have found that McCambridge\n\nwas provoked in some way, resulting in a sudden heat of passion,\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fleading to physical conflict.7             That is what McCambridge himself\n\nsaid       and   the    jury   accepted   his    version.   The    only    evidence\n\npresented at trial regarding any possible provocation for the\naltercation was McCambridge's testimony that Doyle threatened him\n\nwith the nine millimeter Smith & Wesson after McCambridge had\n\ncalled him a child abuser, and that a conflict ensued.                     Thus the\njury accepted McCambridge's story about Doyle's anger at being\n\ncalled a child abuser.              Nothing could be added to this by having\n\nthe fact of the child neglect conviction established or admitted\n\ninto evidence.\n\n                 The state court also reasonably concluded that the jury\n\nnecessarily found that McCambridge, in his self defense, used at\n\nleast excessive force against Doyle (or that McCambridge turned\ninto the attacker).             Neither the fact of Doyle's conviction, nor\n\nthe contested excerpt from the prosecutor's closing argument, is\n\nmaterial to whether McCambridge used excessive force.\n                 The     evidence    overwhelmingly     supports     the     jury's\n\nconclusion.            McCambridge shot Doyle twice, once in the face and\n\nonce in the back.              The fact that Doyle was shot in the back is\n\nitself evidence of excessive force.                 Before shooting the second\n\nshot, McCambridge had to cock the trigger of his gun again before\n\n\n       7\n          Under our analysis, it matters not whether the jury\nthought this was manslaughter due to a heat of passion or to sudden\ncombat. The defense did not differentiate (nor do the facts lend\nthemselves to such differentiation) -- the defense's essential\nargument was that McCambridge did kill Doyle but he did it in self-\ndefense when Doyle reached for the gun during their altercation and\nMcCambridge's response was not excessive.         This brings the\nexcessive force question into play.\n\n                                          -32-\n\ffiring.   This was not an automatic weapon, and the trigger pull was\n\nvery heavy.    The forensic evidence was that Doyle had time to draw\n\nin at least a couple of breaths before the second shot, and\nMcCambridge pulled back from an initial shooting distance of about\n\nsix inches to a distance of about three feet for the second shot.\n\nThere was also evidence that Doyle's head had been struck with a\nbilly club, and a billy club with his blood-type on it was found.\n\nEven by McCambridge's account, the drunken Doyle was simultaneously\n\nattempting to drive the van down one of Boston's busiest highways,\n\nand so could not have been free to fully engage in the altercation.\n\nMcCambridge himself said he had had at least some success in\n\npushing Doyle's gun hand down and away, again supporting the\n\nconclusion that McCambridge used more force than was needed.\n           McCambridge makes an independent argument based on the\n\nother verdict.       We reject McCambridge's argument that because the\n\njury convicted him of the motor vehicle charges, they necessarily\nrejected his testimony about the argument and how it developed, and\n\nso the conviction record would have made a difference. The Appeals\n\nCourt could reasonably conclude, supported by the expert testimony,\n\nthat the jury concluded that once McCambridge shot Doyle, he pushed\n\nDoyle toward the back of the van and attempted to drive from the\n\npassenger's seat or the driver's seat.            Either act would suffice\n\nfor the motor vehicle charges.         See Commonwealth v. Ginnetti, 400\n\nMass.   181,   508    N.E.2d   603,   605    (1987)   (holding   that,   under\n\nMassachusetts statute criminalizing operating a motor vehicle under\n\nthe influence and reckless operation of a motor vehicle, \"a person\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\f. . . operates a motor vehicle by starting its engine or by making\n\nuse of the power provided by its engine\").                    See generally J.\n\nPearson, Annotation, What Constitutes Driving, Operating, or Being\nin   Control   of    Motor    Vehicle    for    Purposes   of    Driving    While\n\nIntoxicated Statute or Ordinance, 93 A.L.R.3d 7, ยง 6(a) (2002)\n\n(citing cases interpreting \"operating\" to include manipulation of\n\ncontrols   from      passenger's   seat).        The   state     trial     judge's\n\ninstructions made it clear to the jury that an individual need not\n\nbe seated in the driver's seat in order to be \"operating\" a vehicle\n\nwithin the meaning of the law.8                And there was evidence that\n\nMcCambridge was in the driver's seat and sat in that seat after it\n\nwas soaked with Doyle's blood.\n\n           The      overall   import    of    McCambridge's     argument    as   to\n\nprejudice is that the prosecution's closing went to McCambridge's\n\ncredibility, and that, in turn, impugned the verdict. For a number\n\nof reasons, we think that the state court's conclusion that this\n\ndid not impugn the verdict is not an unreasonable application of\n\nclearly established law.\n\n\n\n      8\n           The instructions were as follows:\n           A person operates a motor vehicle not only while doing\n           all of the well-known and easily recognized things that\n           drivers do as they travel along a street or highway but\n           also in doing any acts which directly tend to set the\n           vehicle in motion. The law is that a person is operating\n           a motor vehicle when he manipulates a mechanical or\n           electrical part of the vehicle like the gear shaft or\n           ignition which alone or in sequence will set the motor\n           vehicle in motion.\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\f          What mattered for McCambridge's defense was not the truth\n\nof the fact of conviction itself, but rather the fact that the two\n\nhad argued based on McCambridge's accusing Doyle of having abused\na child, and the subsequent threat supposedly made by Doyle.\n\nMcCambridge was allowed to testify as to this.    McCambridge argues\n\nthat the inevitable result was that he was discredited before the\n\njury and even before his own attorney -- he posits that his\n\nattorney emphasized manslaughter in his closing, rather than self\n\ndefense, because of the appearance that McCambridge had lied about\n\nthe conviction story.\n          We   take   the   analysis   in   stages.   First,   under\n\nMassachusetts law, the conviction record would not normally have\nbeen admissible, even as corroborative evidence. See Commonwealth\n\nv. Todd, 408 Mass. 724, 563 N.E.2d 211, 214 (1990) (holding that\n\nexclusion of victim's conviction record was not error in part\nbecause what was important for the defense was the defendant's\nbelief, not the fact of the convictions); Commonwealth v. Fontes,\n\n396 Mass. 733, 488 N.E.2d 760, 762 (1986) (holding that defendant\nmay introduce specific instances of victim's violent conduct to\nsupport self-defense theory only if such instances are recent and\n\nknown to defendant at the time of the homicide).          Since the\nconviction was inadmissible, we are left with the prosecution's\nstatement at closing.   To the extent that the prosecutor attempted\n\nto imply that McCambridge was lying about the existence of a\n\n\n\n\n                                -35-\n\fconviction in his closing argument, an objection could have been\n\nmade, but was not.9\n\n          Second, even if admissible, proof of the existence of the\nconviction was not material to the question of use of excessive\n\nforce in self defense.   As counsel for McCambridge had just said in\n\nhis closing, there was no evidence one way or the other as to the\nconviction and this was not the point anyway.        As the district\n\ncourt pointed out, an accusation of child abuse or molestation may\n\nbe even more likely to provoke violent rage if it is baseless.\n\nThus, as defense counsel suggested, it was the accusation of child\n\nabuse, whether true or not, which enraged Doyle.10\n\n          Third, the effect of the lack of evidence of a conviction\n\nand the prosecutor's statement was minimal given the wealth of\nevidence supporting the conviction. The contested statement in the\n\nclosing argument comprises only one short paragraph in a sixteen-\n\npage transcript. The judge instructed the jury that nothing in the\nclosing argument was to be considered as evidence.     And there was\n\n     9\n           The remedy at that point would have been an instruction\nto the jury to disregard the prosecutor's accusation. McCambridge's\ncounsel could have requested this remedy even without the\nconviction record, since the court had already indicated that the\nquestion was McCambridge's state of mind.       Of course, if the\nprosecutor had produced the conviction record as requested by\nMcCambridge, he probably would not have ventured to accuse\nMcCambridge of lying on this point, if that, contrary to how the\ntrial transcript reads, is what he did.\n     10\n          Indeed, the conviction, had it been available, might have\nundercut the defense, or at least it could be reasonably thought to\ndo so. Doyle had been convicted of child neglect. Child neglect\nis shameful, but \"child abuse,\" the term used by McCambridge, is a\nworse accusation. A false and worse accusation against Doyle could\nwell lead to the conclusion that McCambridge was picking a fight\nand so the shooting was premeditated.\n\n                                -36-\n\fother evidence, particularly physical evidence, that undercuts\n\nMcCambridge's credibility as to his assertion that he did no more\n\nthan   act    properly       to   defend   himself   --     the   blood   evidence\nindicating that Doyle was shot at least five minutes before the van\n\nflipped; the fact that no witness reported gun flashes, although at\n\nleast one witness watched for two minutes before the crash; the\nfact that Doyle had been shot more than once and most likely was\n\nalso   hit    over    the    head   with   the   bloodied    billy   club,   which\n\nMcCambridge could not explain; the fact that the weapon was found\n\nin McCambridge's clothes, apparently tucked in there after the\n\nshooting; the trooper's testimony that the van's driver smashed\n\ninto the windshield and remained in the front area of the van; the\n\nevidence indicating that Doyle was thrown hard into the passenger\nside door and then out the bottom of that door, and was neither\n\ntrapped in the driver's seat nor thrown into the windshield; the\n\nblood on the seat of McCambridge's jeans, most likely from the\nbloodied driver's seat cushion; and the fact that Doyle was already\n\ngray-blue when the troopers first saw him.             The physical evidence,\n\nnotably      the     blood    patterns,    was    simply     inconsistent     with\n\nMcCambridge's theory that the shootings occurred within thirty\n\nseconds.     At most, the prosecutor's statement was another stab at\n\nthe already damaged credibility of the defendant, who was most\n\nlikely viewed as telling some, but not all, of the truth.                    Jurors\n\nneed not believe everything a witness says, nor need they believe\n\nwitnesses are not selective in recounting events.                     Daily life\n\nexperience refutes any such belief.              The physical evidence, too,\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fmight well cause a jury to disbelieve McCambridge's convenient\n\nstatement that he recalled everything up to the point he fired the\n\nfirst shot in self-defense, and recalled nothing after that.            None\nof the arguments advanced by McCambridge \"put[s] the whole case in\n\nsuch a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\"\n\nKyle, 514 U.S. at 435.         Much less do these arguments lead us to\nconclude that the state court's judgment that there was no due\n\nprocess violation was unreasonable.11\n            Comparing the facts here with other cases, it is not\n\nunreasonable to conclude the Brady materiality/prejudice standard\n\nis not met.    In United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976), the\n\ndefendant    also   claimed     self-defense,    and   objected   to     the\n\nprosecution's failure to disclose the victim's criminal record.\nId. at 100-01.      The Court held that the non-disclosure \"did not\n\ndeprive [the defendant] of a fair trial as guaranteed by the Due\n\nProcess   Clause    of   the    Fifth   Amendment.\"    The   Court     noted\napprovingly the trial judge's emphasis on the \"incongruity\" of a\n\nself-defense claim with \"the evidence of [the victim's] multiple\nwounds and [the defendant's] unscathed condition\"; the fact that\n\nthe criminal record would not have contradicted any evidence\n\noffered by the prosecutor; and that the conviction record would be\n\ncumulative of evidence that the victim was armed with a knife at\n\n     11\n          As discussed earlier, the closing argument transcript may\nbe read as it is written, that the prosecutor said \"There is\nabsolutely evidence of that [conviction and earlier argument],\"\nindicating that the prosecutor was not accusing McCambridge of\nfabricating the conviction, but only of fabricating the self-\ndefense story.    If the transcript is read that way, we still\nconclude that the conviction record was immaterial.\n\n                                    -38-\n\fthe time of the crime.         Id. at 113-14.     Moreover, in Agurs, the\n\ntrial court and appellate court had assumed the conviction record\n\nwould be admissible, id. at 100-02 & n.3, while in this case it was\nnot.\n\n            In United States v. Dumas, this court considered a case\n\nin which the defendant claimed that he had been entrapped into a\ndrug charge by his prison cellmate, and the prosecution failed to\n\ndisclose evidence indicating that the cellmate had been put on\n\nsuicide watch, and evidence that would corroborate the defendant's\n\ntestimony as to how long the two had shared a cell.           207 F.3d 11,\n\n13-15   (1st   Cir.   2000).     Although   the   defense   hinged   on   the\n\ndefendant's credibility, we found that neither the corroborative\n\nnor the impeachment evidence was material for Brady purposes.             Id.\n\nat 16-17.\n\n            This court's decision in United States v. Udechukwu, 11\n\nF.3d 1101 (1st Cir. 1993), does not assist McCambridge, much less\ndoes it show that the state court's decision was an unreasonable\n\napplication of federal constitutional law.             In Udechukwu, the\n\ngovernment, over objection, withheld evidence about a known drug\n\ntrafficker, evidence that was favorable to the defendant.                 In\n\nclosing, the prosecution questioned the existence of the trafficker\n\nwhen the prosecution knew that he existed.           Id. at 1102-05.      The\n\ncourt did not reach the question of whether there was reversible\n\nerror in the government's failure to disclose.          Rather, the court\n\nfound a fatal taint from the prosecutor's \"persistent theme in\n\nclosing argument suggesting the nonexistence of this information --\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\fand even the opposite of what the government knew.\"     Id. at 1105.\n\nHere, in contrast, the prosecutor's closing had one line on this\n\npoint; it was far from a persistent theme in a closing comprising\nsixteen pages of transcript.    Here, the underlying information was\n\nnot admissible.   Here, in contrast to Udechukwu, there was no\n\nobjection made to the prosecution's closing argument.    And here it\nis far less clear that the failure involved government misconduct;\n\nrather, it was sloppiness.     The prosecutor here had an incomplete\n\nreport on which he relied.        The prosecutor did not knowingly\n\nmisrepresent to the jury.    Udechukwu does not support McCambridge.\n\n          On habeas review, McCambridge faces a double hurdle --\n\nshowing both that there is a reasonable probability that the jury\n\nwould have reached a different conclusion if it had the conviction\nrecord or if the prosecutor had not made the statement in the\n\nclosing, and that the state appeals court determination on this\n\npoint was unreasonable.     Given the evidence here, he cannot clear\neither hurdle.\n\nConclusion\n\n          The petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.\n\n                     -- Dissent follows. --\n\n\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, with whom CYR, Senior Circuit\n\nJudge, joins, dissenting. The Massachusetts Appeals Court rejected\n\nMcCambridge's Brady claim on two grounds.         See Brady v. Maryland,\n\n373 U.S. 83 (1963).     First, it ruled that McCambridge failed to\nobject, as required, when the prosecutor refused to disclose the\n\nrequested    exculpatory   evidence;    namely,    evidence   of   Doyle's\n\nconviction for child abuse.    Second, the appeals court ruled that\nMcCambridge could show no prejudice resulting from the prosecutor's\n\nwrongful suppression of that evidence.       As a member of the panel\n\nthat first reviewed this case, I concluded that the first ruling of\nthe appeals court was contrary to clearly established federal law,\nand its second ruling constituted an unreasonable application of\nfederal law.    Despite the en banc proceedings and the thoughtful\n\nmajority opinion, I continue to hold those views.             I therefore\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n                  I. Nondisclosure of Brady Material\n\n            The Supreme Court held as follows in Brady v. Maryland:\n\n\"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an\naccused . . . violates due process where the evidence is material\n\neither to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or\n\nbad faith of the prosecution.\"         373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).        The\nfavorable evidence at issue here is the criminal record of the\nvictim, Doyle.1     McCambridge testified at trial that Doyle had\n\n\n\n     1\n       The Commonwealth does not dispute that the evidence of\nDoyle's conviction was favorable to McCambridge.\n\n                                 -41-\n\fbecome violent when McCambridge called Doyle a derogatory name that\n\nreferred to Doyle's conviction for child abuse.            McCambridge also\n\ndescribed an incident a few months prior to their automobile\naccident when he asked Doyle whether he had been convicted of child\n\nabuse and Doyle threatened to kill McCambridge if he were ever to\n\nmention the topic again.          Therefore, Doyle's criminal conviction\nrelated to McCambridge's theory of self-defense because it provided\n\nan explanation for why Doyle might have become violent in the van.\n\nAdditionally, McCambridge's testimony regarding Doyleโs earlier\n\nthreat afforded a significant evidentiary basis for the jury to\n\nassess McCambridgeโs state of mind at the time of the shooting in\n\ndetermining whether McCambridge had been in reasonable fear of\n\ndeath or serious bodily injury.\n           In charging an unlawful killing, the Commonwealth assumed\n\nthe burden of proving that McCambridge did not act in self-defense.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Reed, 691 N.E.2d 560, 563 (Mass. 1998).              The\njury might not have found McCambridge guilty of any wrongful\n\nkilling   if   it   could   not    reject,   beyond   a   reasonable   doubt,\nMcCambridge's testimony that he reasonably perceived that he was in\n\nimminent danger of death or serious bodily harm.              McCambridge's\n\ncredibility on this self-defense claim and his perception of\n\nDoyle's alleged actions in the van and his earlier threat were thus\n\npotentially determinative of the verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -42-\n\f            Doyle had, in fact, been convicted of and imprisoned for\n\nchild neglect.2      Yet, during trial, the prosecutor represented,\n\nboth to defense counsel and the trial judge, that there was no such\nconviction on Doyle's official record.\n\nA. Requests, Representations, and Rulings Regarding the Exculpatory\nEvidence\n\n            The question of Doyle's record arose several times during\nthe trial.    There were three discussions at the bench. The first\n\nsidebar took place on the third day of the trial when Doyle's\nbrother was testifying for the Commonwealth.                   Defense counsel\n\ninformed the court and the prosecutor that McCambridge's testimony\nregarding    the    altercation     in     the   van   would      refer    to   his\n\nunderstanding      that   Doyle   had    been    convicted   of    child    abuse.\n\nDefense counsel stated that he saw no reason to question Doyle's\n\nbrother about the decedent's conviction unless the prosecutor\n\nintended to take the position that McCambridge was lying.                       The\n\nprosecutor responded that he had not yet decided whether he would\n\nchallenge McCambridge's veracity regarding Doyle's conviction. Due\n\nto the prosecutor's ambivalence in this respect, the defense was\n\nunable to resolve, at this point, whether to question Doyle's\n\nbrother about the conviction.            Therefore, the court ordered that\nthe witness be held over for possible later questioning by the\n\n\n     2\n      Doyle's official record indicates that he was convicted of\nchild neglect and was sentenced to two years, six months to be\nserved and the remainder suspended, with the six month period of\nincarceration to be followed by a two year period of probation.\nMcCambridge referred at trial to a conviction for child abuse. The\nCommonwealth does not argue that the abuse/neglect distinction has\nany bearing on its disclosure obligation.\n\n                                        -43-\n\fdefense.     During this initial sidebar, the prosecutor was put on\n\nnotice that the record of Doyle's conviction tended to exculpate\n\nMcCambridge by corroborating McCambridge's anticipated testimony.\n             The second sidebar on the issue of Doyle's conviction\n\noccurred     during      defense   counsel's    direct   examination   of\n\nMcCambridge.      The prosecutor objected, on hearsay grounds, to\nMcCambridge's reference to the conviction when he described the\n\nthreat allegedly made by Doyle a month before the killing.             The\n\ncourt overruled the prosecutor's objection on the ground that the\n\ntestimony was not being offered for the truth of the conviction,\n\nbut rather to establish McCambridge's state of mind with respect to\n\nhis fear of being killed by Doyle.         The prosecutor replied that he\n\nthought the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its\nprobative value.       The following exchange took place:\n\n                    THE COURT: Do we have a conviction on\n             this charge?\n\n                    DEFENSE: Do I have a certified copy of\n             the conviction? I do not. But I assert that\n             it is true, that he was convicted for this\n             charge. . . . I don't think my brother can say\n             to your Honor that, in fact, he was not\n             convicted. I've read the newspaper articles\n             about it.\n\n                       COURT: Has anyone checked his probation\n             record?\n\n                    PROSECUTOR: It just says -- it doesn't\n             say what for. I have no idea what it's for.\n\n                    COURT: Okay. I'll tell them that it's\n             not being offered for the truth of the matter.3\n\n\n\n     3\n         This jury instruction was never given.\n\n                                    -44-\n\fThe key event during the second sidebar was the prosecutor's\n\nrepresentation that he had looked at Doyle's record but had found\n\nit to be unclear.\n          The question of the conviction arose again shortly after\n\nthe second sidebar. Despite the court's ruling that the jury would\n\nbe told that McCambridge's testimony regarding Doyle's conviction\nwas not being offered for the truth of the matter, the prosecutor\n\nattempted to raise doubts about the fact of the conviction during\n\nhis cross-examination of the defendant.\n\n                 PROSECUTOR: You said that you had an\n          argument with Mr. Doyle sometime prior to this\n          in September and you said that he was involved\n          in a problem of child molestation; is that\n          correct?\n\n                    DEFENDANT: I was told that. . . .\n                                  * * *\n\n                 PROSECUTOR: You know Mr.         Doyle    is\n          deceased; isn't that correct, sir?\n\n\n                    DEFENDANT: He certainly is.\n\n                 PROSECUTOR:   He  can't     refute       your\n          allegations right now; can he?\n\n                    DEFENSE: Objection to that, your Honor.\n\n                    THE COURT: Sustained.\n\nThis line of questioning foreshadowed the prosecutor's reference to\n\nDoyle's conviction in closing argument.       It also explains the\n\nconcern expressed by defense counsel at the third sidebar, held on\n\nthe fourth day of trial just before the defense rested.\n\n    During this third and final sidebar, the court again asked the\n\nprosecutor whether he had checked Doyle's record and the defense\n\n                                 -45-\n\frequested that the prosecution produce the record. Defense counsel\n\nalso referred to the possibility of recalling Doyle's brother to\n\nestablish the conviction, while indicating once again that he would\nnot do so unless the prosecutor intended to argue that McCambridge\n\nwas lying about it:\n\n                 DEFENSE:   He    is   maligning   [the\n          defendant's] character, you know, as if there\n          is some evidence in the case that he [the\n          victim] wasn't really in jail.\n\n                 PROSECUTOR: He wasn't in jail, Judge.\n\n                 THE COURT: Did you check his record?\n\n                 PROSECUTOR: He wasn't in jail, Judge.\n\n                 THE COURT:    Was he convicted?\n\n                 PROSECUTOR:   No.     No.\n\n                 DEFENSE:    Do you have       his   record?\n          Let's make it part of the --\n\n                 PROSECUTOR: No. I'm not going to make\n          it a part. That's your case, sir. . . . So,\n          as far as I know, he's never been in jail a\n          day of his life.\n\n                                  * * *\n\n                 DEFENSE: Your Honor, I don't have\n          access to his criminal record. . . . So if\n          he's got a criminal record, this is an\n          important issue, it seems to me. I would like\n          it produced so we can all see whether or not\n          he did have a criminal record and what, if\n          anything, he was convicted of. I'm concerned\n          about it. I don't want to make it part of the\n          case. On the other hand, I don't want to open\n          it up for argument that I didn't prove that he\n          had one and, therefore, my guy was lying.\n\n                                       * * *\n\n\n\n\n                                -46-\n\f                PROSECUTOR: . . . [A]s far as I know,\n         there is   no record that Mr. Doyle had any\n         convictions.\n\n                     THE COURT: What do you intend to argue?\n                    PROSECUTOR: . . . I am going to argue\n             the facts of the case, Judge. That's all I'm\n             going to argue.\n\n                    THE COURT: There's inferences            the\n             jurors may want to draw from those facts.       Are\n             you --\n\n                PROSECUTOR: But you can't draw an\n         inference from something where there's no\n         conviction of a guy.        I mean, the guy\n         [McCambridge] gets up there and says [Doyle's]\n         done time when I know he hasn't from the\n         records that I've seen. And, if he's got the\n         records, he can --\n\n                THE COURT: But this was offered really\n         for state of mind, not for the truth of it,\n         not as to whether or not he did, in fact, do\n         any time or anything like that. Therefore, I\n         don't know if it's appropriate to argue\n         whether he did or he didn't. I am allowing it\n         only for the state of mind of the defendant.\n\n                PROSECUTOR: Then that's all I'm going\n         to argue, Judge.\n\nAt the third sidebar, defense counsel expressed a willingness to\nkeep proof of the existence of the conviction out of the case in\n\ncompliance with the judge's ruling.            However, he also voiced\n\nconcern that the prosecutor would use the absence of evidence\nconfirming     the   conviction   to   cast   doubt   upon   McCambridge's\n\ncredibility.    In   addition,    defense   counsel   directly     asked   the\nprosecutor for Doyle's record.\n             During these sidebar discussions, the prosecutor made two\n\nkinds of statements about Doyle's criminal record.               First, the\n\n\n                                    -47-\n\fprosecutor made qualified statements that Doyle had no criminal\n\nrecord by saying, \"as far as I know.\"      However, at other moments,\n\nthe   prosecutor   more   definitively   denied   that   Doyle   had   been\nconvicted by answering the court's questions with a simple \"No, no\"\n\nor saying, \"I know he hasn't [been convicted] from the records that\n\nI've seen.\"\n           Doyle's criminal record was in the Criminal Offender\n\nRecord Information System (CORI) of Massachusetts. A person's CORI\n\nreport lists his or her court appearances and convictions, if any.4\nThe Commonwealth has represented that at trial the prosecutor had\n\nonly the first page of Doyle's three-page CORI report; the relevant\n\nconviction appears on the second page.5       The Commonwealth argues\n\nthat it did not violate the requirements of Brady for three\n\nreasons.   First, it says that the prosecutor disclosed all the\n\ninformation he had about Doyle's criminal record because the\n\n      4\n       CORI reports are kept by the Criminal History Systems Board\nof Massachusetts. The Board is responsible for collecting and\norganizing criminal offender record information. See Mass. Gen.\nLaws ch. 6, ยง 168 (2000). The Board is comprised of several law\nenforcement officials and associations.      Private users of the\nsystem, victims of crime, and experts in personal privacy issues\nare also represented. The Board serves as a centralized repository\nfor criminal record information and may disseminate information\nonly to criminal justice agencies, agencies required to have access\nby statute, and other agencies or individuals \"where it has been\ndetermined [by the Board] that the public interest in disseminating\nsuch information to these parties clearly outweighs the interests\nin security and privacy.\" Id. at ยง 172.\n      5\n      The Commonwealth has not contended (nor did the trial court\nsuggest) that the defense had access to Doyle's CORI report in the\nabsence of a court order or cooperation by the prosecution.\nMassachusetts law permits dissemination of these records only to\nagencies and individuals that the Board has certified. See Mass.\nGen. Laws ch. 6, ยง 172.\n\n                                  -48-\n\fincomplete CORI print-out did not indicate that Doyle had ever been\n\nconvicted of child abuse.       Second, the Commonwealth contends that\n\nMcCambridge should have been more diligent in requesting that the\nrecord   be    produced.     Finally,     the    Commonwealth    argues    that\n\nMcCambridge      was    required    to    object    to   the     prosecutor's\n\nnondisclosure of Doyle's criminal record.6\n\n              1. Evidence in the possession of the government\n\n              Under well-settled law, a prosecutor's duty to disclose\n\nexculpatory evidence extends beyond his or her personal knowledge\n\nof such evidence.      See Kyles v. Whitley,       514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995)\n(describing the prosecutor's duty \"to learn of any favorable\n\nevidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in\nthe case\").       This duty exists because the prosecutor is the\nrepresentative of the government in proceeding against a defendant\n\nin a criminal case.      See Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154\n\n(1972) (\"The prosecutor's office is . . . the spokesman for the\nGovernment.\").         Therefore,   a    state   prosecutor     may   be   held\n\naccountable, in appropriate circumstances, for the nondisclosure of\nBrady material in the possession of a state agency without regard\n\nto the prosecutor's personal knowledge of the existence of that\n\nmaterial. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 282 (discussing nondisclosure\n\nof Brady material \"known to the Commonwealth\" but apparently not to\n\nthe prosecutor); United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 111 (1976).\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       In its brief to the en banc court the Commonwealth focuses\non the second and third arguments.\n\n                                    -49-\n\f          While the above cited cases involved evidence known to\n\nthe police, their logic applies to the present case as well, since\n\nDoyleโs criminal record was in the CORI database maintained by the\nCommonwealth.    The prosecutor requested Doyle's criminal record\n\nfrom the Board, an agency established to coordinate the exchange of\n\ninformation among law enforcement personnel, including prosecutors\nand police officers. Based on the information he received from the\n\nBoard, the prosecutor made inaccurate representations to the court\n\nand to the defense that Doyle had no criminal record.              Under these\n\ncircumstances,        the   Commonwealth       is    responsible       for   the\n\nnondisclosure    regardless      of   the    prosecutor's     actual    personal\n\nknowledge.      See    Kyles,   514   U.S.    at    437-38   (holding    that   a\n\nprosecutor's ignorance of exculpatory evidence not produced by a\nstate agency does not insulate the government from responsibility\n\nfor a Brady violation).         Accordingly, the prosecutor's statement\n\nthat Doyle had no criminal record \"as far as I know\" does not\nrelieve the Commonwealth of its obligations under Brady and its\n\nprogeny because the prosecutor's personal awareness of Doyle's\n\nconviction is irrelevant.\n\n          2. Defense obligation to request exculpatory evidence\n\n          The Commonwealth argues that defense counsel should have\nfiled a formal discovery request for Doyle's criminal record.\nThere is no legal support for this contention.               Brady obligations\n\napply independently of any request by the defense.              See Strickler,\n527 U.S. at 280 (\"[T]he duty to disclose [exculpatory] evidence is\n\napplicable even though there has been no request by the accused.\")\n\n                                      -50-\n\f(citing Agurs, 427 U.S. at 107).        The prosecutor in this case was\n\non notice from the time of the first sidebar conference that\n\nevidence   substantiating      McCambridge's    claim     that    Doyle       had   a\ncriminal record would be favorable to McCambridge's theory of self-\n\ndefense.        There was no need for McCambridge to request that\n\nevidence specifically.\n            The Commonwealth also asserts that it was not obligated\n\nto disclose evidence of Doyle's conviction because the defense\n\ncould have found that evidence through a reasonably diligent\n\ninvestigation.      See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d\n\n135, 147 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"The government has no Brady burden when\n\nthe necessary facts . . . are readily available to a diligent\n\ndefender.\").      However, as noted, McCambridge could not access the\nCORI database without a court order.          See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, ยง\n\n172.     Moreover,    the    Commonwealth's    argument     about       the   ready\n\navailability of evidence misses the point in an important way.\nThis was not a case where the defense simply refused to look for\n\nevidence it knew existed and relied on the prosecution to disclose\nthat evidence.       Rather, the prosecutor misrepresented, to both\n\ndefense counsel and the court, that the exculpatory evidence did\n\nnot    exist.      Defense   counsel   was    entitled    to     rely    on    that\n\nrepresentation.      See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 283 n.23.           Under these\n\ncircumstances, McCambridge was not obligated to inquire further.\n\n            The    Commonwealth   argued     before   the   panel       that    the\n\nprosecutor's statements that Doyle had no criminal record \"as far\n\nas I know\" should have alerted defense counsel to the possibility\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\fthat such a record did exist but was simply not personally known to\n\nthe prosecutor. Because the prosecutor expressed this uncertainty,\n\nthe Commonwealth asserted, McCambridge and his counsel should have\nbeen more diligent in confirming whether the prosecutor's qualified\n\nstatements   were,   in   fact,    true.     The   Commonwealth   cites   no\n\nauthority for this argument, and I have found none.           Under well-\nsettled law, as I have explained, Brady obligations apply to a\n\nprosecutor's conduct even when the defense has not sought discovery\n\nof the exculpatory evidence.         See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280;\n\nAgurs, 427 U.S. at 107. Moreover, McCambridge's counsel reasonably\n\nrelied upon the prosecutor's representations that Doyle had never\n\nbeen convicted, see Strickler, 527 U.S. at 283 n.23, and because\n\nthe prosecutor was acting in his capacity as representative for the\ngovernment, see Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437, defense counsel was also\n\nreasonable in concluding that the prosecutor's denials indicated\n\nthat such evidence of a conviction did not exist.\n\n          3. Requirement      to    object    to   the   nondisclosure    of\nexculpatory evidence\n\n          Finally, the Commonwealth argues that McCambridge was\n\nrequired to object to the prosecutor's inaccurate representation\n\nabout Doyle's record, despite Strickler's holding that \"defense\n\ncounsel may reasonably rely\" on a prosecutor's representation that\n\nshe has complied fully with Brady, Strickler, 527 U.S. at 283 n.23,\n\nthus rendering unnecessary an objection to the nondisclosure of\nthat evidence.   In Strickler, the prosecutor maintained an \"open\n\nfile\" policy, meaning that \"his entire prosecution file was made\n\n\n                                    -52-\n\favailable to the defense.\"      Id. at 283 n.22.    While it is not clear\n\nfrom the record whether the Commonwealth maintained an open file\n\npolicy in this case, the prosecutor's statements to defense counsel\nand to the court that Doyle had no criminal record constitute\n\nessentially the same representation at issue in Strickler: that the\n\nprosecution had fulfilled its constitutional duty under Brady.\nUnder such circumstances, defense counsel is not required to\n\nobject.   Indeed, the Supreme Court rejected such a requirement in\n\nStrickler:\n\n           \"The   presumption,    well    established  by\n           tradition and experience, that prosecutors\n           have fully discharged their official duties,\n           is inconsistent with the novel suggestion that\n           conscientious    defense    counsel    have  a\n           procedural obligation to assert constitutional\n           error on the basis of mere suspicion that some\n           prosecutorial misstep may have occurred.\"\n\nStrickler, 527 U.S. at 286-87 (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n             The Commonwealth has argued, again, that the prosecutor's\n\noccasional use of the words \"as far as I know\" excuses its failure\n\nto   disclose   the   exculpatory   evidence    because       such    equivocal\nlanguage should have indicated to the defense that a specific\n\nobjection to the nondisclosure was necessary.             This argument is\n\nunpersuasive for the same reasons it was unpersuasive in the\n\ncontext   of    McCambridge's   failure    to   pursue    a    more    thorough\n\ninvestigation of Doyle's criminal record: the Commonwealth cannot\n\nescape its Brady obligations by qualifying its nondisclosure of\n\nexculpatory evidence and then shifting its disclosure burden to\n\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\fdefense counsel.   Moreover, the potential mischief invited by the\n\nCommonwealth's argument provides strong reason for rejecting it.\n\nB. The state court decision\n\n          McCambridge argued to the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nthat the prosecution did not fulfill its disclosure obligations\n\nunder Brady.   For example, he stated in his opening brief:\n\n                 The suppression of material evidence\n          favorable to the accused and requested by him\n          violates the due process clause of the Fifth\n          Amendment. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87\n          (1963). In the case at bar, because the trial\n          court refused to require the Commonwealth to\n          produce Doyle's criminal record, the defendant\n          cannot prove that exculpatory evidence was\n          withheld.   The defendant did everything he\n          could to preserve this issue.     Compare this\n          case with Commonwealth v. O'Brien, 419 Mass.\n          470, 477 (1995).     Thus, this Court should\n          order the Commonwealth to produce Doyle's\n          criminal record so that an appellate decision\n          can be made.    In the alternative, the case\n          should be remanded to the Superior Court for\n          production of the document at issue.\n                 If Doyle had a criminal record        as\n          described by the defendant at trial, then   the\n          withholding of that information and         the\n          misleading of the defense was intentional   and\n          prejudicial. See Commonwealth v. Tucceri,   412\n          Mass. 401 (1992).     A new trial would      be\n          required.\nAs this passage from McCambridge's brief reveals, he articulated a\n\nclaim under Brady, with appropriate citations, and argued that the\n\nprosecutor's nondisclosure of Doyle's record -- if the record\nindeed existed -- prejudiced him.\n\n          The prosecution finally disclosed Doyle's criminal record\nafter McCambridge filed his brief to the appeals court.     Following\n\n\n\n                               -54-\n\fthe Commonwealthโs belated disclosure, McCambridge refined his\n\nBrady argument in his reply brief:\n\n                 In United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S.\n          667 (1985), the Supreme Court recognized that\n          an incomplete response to a specific request\n          for disclosure not only deprives the defense\n          of the specific evidence, but also suggests to\n          the defense that such evidence does not exist.\n          The defense's reliance on such a misleading\n          representation can result in important changes\n          in trial strategy. In the case at bar, the\n          defendant was specifically misinformed about\n          Doyle's criminal record. The defendant then\n          gave up his strategy of attempting to elicit\n          information about that record from Doyle's\n          brother or the Clerk of the Norfolk Superior\n          Court.   The prosecutor fully exploited his\n          misrepresentation in closing argument.\n\n                 The state constitutional and/or common\n          law standard for a Brady violation does\n          consider the issue of bad faith.          See,\n          Commonwealth v. Tucceri, 412 Mass. 401 (1992).\n          Where bad faith has been demonstrated, and the\n          withheld evidence might have affected the\n          outcome of the trial, the defendant is\n          entitled to a new trial. In the absence of\n          bad faith, a new trial is necessary if the\n          withheld evidence would have been a real\n          factor in the jury's deliberation.      In the\n          case at bar, the defendant's truthfulness\n          about the circumstances of his confrontation\n          with Doyle was the central issue in the case.\n          The blocking of the Commonwealth's claim, that\n          the so-called argument about Doyle's child\n          abuse record was only the defendant's attempt\n          to assassinate Doyle's reputation, would have\n          been a real factor in the jury's deliberation,\n          and probably would have tipped the scales in\n          favor of the defendant.\n\nAgain, McCambridge identified the proper legal authority for his\n\nBrady claim and explained why he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's\n\nfailure to fulfill his disclosure obligations.\n\n          McCambridge's Brady claim was thus fully presented to the\n\nMassachussets   Appeals   Court.      In   its   opinion   affirming\n\n                               -55-\n\fMcCambridge's conviction and sentence, the appeals court addressed\n\nthe issue of Doyle's record only briefly: \"While the defendant\n\npressed for the introduction of the victim's criminal record at\ntrial,   he    did    not   object    when   the   judge   did    not   order   its\n\nproduction or request that the record be marked for identification.\n\nHe cannot now be heard to complain that the judge failed to do so\nat the sentencing stage.\"            McCambridge, 690 N.E.2d at 475.            The\n\ncourt did not seem to recognize the Brady implications of Doyle's\n\ncriminal record - despite McCambridge's argument on the issue in\n\nboth his opening and reply briefs.\n\n              Under the new standard for federal habeas review, we must\n\nexamine the state court determination of McCambridge's Brady claim\n\nto   determine       whether   it    is   contrary   to    or    an   unreasonable\napplication of clearly established federal law.                  See 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n2254(d)(1).     The Supreme Court has said the following with respect\n\nto the \"contrary to\" prong of ยง 2254(d)(1):\n              The text of ยง 2254(d)(1) therefore suggests\n              that the state court's decision must be\n              substantially different from the relevant\n              precedent of this Court. . . . A state-court\n              decision will certainly be contrary to our\n              clearly established precedent if the state\n              court applies a rule that contradicts the\n              governing law set forth in our cases. . . . A\n              state-court decision will also be contrary to\n              this Court's clearly established precedent if\n              the state court confronts a set of facts that\n              are   materially  indistinguishable   from  a\n              decision of this Court and nevertheless\n              arrives at a result different from our\n              precedent.\n\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405-06 (2000). The Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court did not explicitly identify a legal rule in finding\n\n\n                                          -56-\n\fthat McCambridge could not \"now be heard to complain\" about the\n\nnonproduction of Doyle's record because he did not object when the\n\ntrial court judge failed to order its production. McCambridge, 690\nN.E.2d at 475.     However, implicit in this reasoning is a legal rule\n\nthat   would     require   a   criminal     defendant   to   object   to   the\n\nprosecution's     nondisclosure    of     exculpatory   evidence   where   the\nprosecution has represented that such evidence does not exist.\n\nStrickler, however, held that defense counsel is not required to\n\nobject to the nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence where the\n\nprosecutor has represented that she has discharged fully her Brady\n\nobligations. Strickler, 527 U.S. at 289. Accordingly, the opinion\n\nof the Massachusetts Appeals Court denying McCambridge's Brady\n\nclaim, in part, because he failed to object at trial is contrary to\nclearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.\n\nC. Adequate and Independent State Ground\n\n            The Commonwealth further maintains that our review of\nMcCambridge's habeas petition is precluded because there is an\n\nadequate and independent state ground for the state appeals court\ndecision.      Federal courts \"will not review a question of federal\nlaw decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on\n\na state law ground that is independent of the federal question and\nadequate to support the judgment.\"           Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S.\n\n722, 729 (1991).      Noncompliance with a state procedural rule may\n\npreclude federal review: \"The [adequate and independent state\nground] doctrine applies to bar federal habeas when a state court\n\ndeclined    to   address   a   prisoner's    federal    claims   because   the\n\n                                    -57-\n\fprisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement.                      In\n\nthese cases, the state judgment rests on independent and adequate\n\nstate procedural grounds.\"           Id. at 729-30.         In this case, the\nCommonwealth contends that the appeals court's reliance on the\n\nMassachusetts rule requiring contemporaneous objections provides\n\nsuch an adequate and independent state ground.\n            I     have   already    indicated    that   I   would       reject   the\n\nCommonwealth's argument that McCambridge had an obligation to\n\nobject to the government's failure to disclose Brady material.                    As\n\nI have explained, there is no such obligation under federal law.\n\nIndeed,    the     Commonwealth     has    not   identified       any    authority\n\nsupporting its assertion that McCambridge was required to object.\n\nMy own review of Massachusetts caselaw has unearthed no case --\nexcept for the decision of the appeals court in this case --\n\nrequiring an objection to the inaccurate representation by a\n\nprosecutor that exculpatory evidence sought by the defense has been\ndisclosed.      See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hill, 739 N.E.2d 670 (Mass.\n\n2000); Commonwealth v. Tucceri, 589 N.E.2d 1216, 1224 (Mass. 1992).\n\nFor   a   state    procedural      rule   to   constitute    an    adequate      and\n\nindependent state ground barring federal habeas review, that rule\n\nmust be consistently enforced in the state courts.                  See Moore v.\n\nPonte, 186 F.3d 26, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1999).           Even if a Massachusetts\n\nprocedural rule requiring an objection to the nondisclosure of\n\nexculpatory evidence had been consistently enforced, such a rule\n\nwould be unconstitutional under Strickler.              Accordingly, there is\n\nno adequate and independent state ground supporting the decision of\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\fthe Massachusetts Appeals Court that precludes our review of\n\nMcCambridge's claim.\n\n                             II. Prejudice\n\n            The conclusion that the ruling by the appeals court\n\nrequiring   an   objection   to   the     prosecutor's       nondisclosure     is\n\ncontrary to clearly established federal law does not end the Brady\n\ninquiry.     Brady   established    both    a    rule   of    conduct   -    that\n\nprosecutors must disclose exculpatory evidence in the possession\n\nand control of the government - and a standard of prejudice that\n\npetitioners must meet in order to obtain relief for a prosecutor's\nfailure to comply with that rule.          See Strickler, 527 U.S. 281-82\n\n(noting elements of a Brady claim).              Accordingly, it is also\nnecessary   to   assess   whether   the    appeals      court   erred   in   its\ndetermination of prejudice under Brady, and if so, whether that\n\nerroneous determination constituted an unreasonable application of\nclearly established federal law.\n            To prevail on his Brady claim, McCambridge must show that\n\nhe was prejudiced by the prosecutor's failure to disclose the\nevidence of Doyle's criminal record.            More specifically, he must\ndemonstrate \"a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been\n\ndisclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different.\"      United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682\n\n(1985). \"A 'reasonable probability' is a probability sufficient to\n\nundermine confidence in the outcome.\"           Id.     \"The question is not\nwhether the defendant would more likely than not have received a\n\ndifferent verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he\n\n                                    -59-\n\freceived a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict\n\nworthy of confidence.\"     Strickler, 527 U.S. at 289-90.       See also\n\nUnited States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 152 (1st Cir. 2000). That\nthere was sufficient evidence on which to convict McCambridge does\n\nnot establish that his trial was fair.     See Kyles, 514 U.S. at 435.\n\n          It   seems     improbable     that,   standing   by    itself,\nMcCambridge's inability to corroborate his testimony through the\n\nintroduction of Doyle's conviction would have had an effect on the\n\njury's verdict.    However, as McCambridge has argued consistently,\n\nthe prosecutor's summation, exploiting his misleading disclosure\n\nabout Doyle's conviction, seriously prejudiced his case.\n\n          Immediately after the third sidebar, the defense rested\n\nand the parties made their closing arguments,7 the pertinent parts\nof which follow:\n\n          DEFENSE:\n                 Now, I want to talk about one other\n          thing that's not evidence in this case. Mr.\n          McCambridge told you on the stand the reason\n          that he and Mr. Doyle got into the fight,\n          besides that they were both drinking and\n          probably neither one thinking with great\n          clarity, there had been an incident a couple\n          of months previously where Mr. McCambridge\n          says he had been told something about Mr.\n          Doyle and confronted him with it.\n                 The Judge admitted that evidence as\n          evidence of Mr. McCambridge's state of mind;\n          in other words, it's not evidence that Mr.\n          Doyle ever did anything. There is no evidence\n          in this case that Mr. Doyle ever molested or\n          abused any child. . . .     There is also no\n          evidence in this case that he did it. There\n          is simply no evidence in this case one way or\n\n\n     7\n      Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(a)(1) provides\nthat \"the defendant shall present his closing argument first.\"\n\n                                 -60-\n\f          the other.   You don't know as you sit here\n          whether what transpired, what Mr. McCambridge\n          says transpired between the two of them, has\n          any backing in reality or not. There is no\n          evidence.   There is no evidence that he did\n          it. There is no evidence that he didn't do\n          it. It was admitted for a different purpose,\n          which was the state of mind.\n                 Now, you have to decide whether or not\n          something like that could cause that explosion\n          in the car, that eruption of bad blood when\n          people had been drinking.     Mr. McCambridge\n          told you that he made some comment to this\n          person that enraged him, and he had been\n          threatened before.\n\n                                * * *\n\n          PROSECUTION:\n                 Does the defendant have something for\n          you to believe when he gets up there and says,\n          oh, yeah, I had an argument with Richard Doyle\n          because of child molestation?        There is\n          absolutely evidence of that.8 Was that put in\n          there to tell you what his frame of mind was?\n          No.   That was his third shot at the victim\n          from the stand, assassinating his reputation\n          with no evidence. That's what that was for, I\n          suggest to you, not to show state of mind.\n\nIn compliance with the ruling of the judge, the defense argued in\nits summation that whether or not Doyle had in fact been convicted\n\nof child abuse was not at issue in the case, the testimony about\nDoyle's   conviction   having   been    admitted   only   to   establish\n\nMcCambridge's state of mind.     In marked contrast, the prosecutor\n\nignored the court's ruling, as well as his representation that he\n\n\n     8\n      I have reproduced the prosecutor's argument as it appears in\nthe transcript of the trial as set forth in the record. Given the\nthrust of the prosecutor's argument, I assume that either the court\nreporter or the prosecutor unintentionally omitted the word \"no\"\nbefore the word \"evidence\" in this sentence. Although the majority\nsuggests that the transcript should be read as written, the\nCommonwealth conceded in its brief to the panel that the prosecutor\neither said or intended to say \"absolutely no evidence.\"\n\n                                 -61-\n\fwould abide by that ruling, and used the absence of the exculpatory\n\nevidence    he    had    failed     to   produce     to    impugn   McCambridge's\n\ncredibility.       For reasons that are not clear from the record,\ndefense    counsel      did   not    object     to   the   prosecutor's   closing\n\nargument.       Normally, such an omission by defense counsel would\n\nwarrant requiring McCambridge to show cause for his failure to\nobject    and    prejudice    from    the     prosecutor's    closing   argument.\n\nHowever, I conclude that the Commonwealth failed to raise the issue\n\nof McCambridge's procedural default below and has thus waived that\n\nargument.\n\nA. Waiver of Waiver\n\n            Massachusetts has a \"routinely enforced, consistently\napplied contemporaneous objection rule\" regarding improper closing\n\nargument.       Burks v. DuBois, 55 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nAbsent a timely objection, Massachusetts courts will not review\nappellate claims of improper summation unless cause and prejudice\n\nare demonstrated, except to ensure that a miscarriage of justice\ndoes not occur.         See Commonwealth v. Stote, 739 N.E.2d 261, 268\n\n(Mass. 2000).      When the Massachusetts courts apply the procedural\ndefault rule, federal review of an improper summation claim is\n\nsimilarly foreclosed because failure to observe state procedural\n\nrules can constitute an adequate and independent ground for the\n\nstate court decision.          Palmariello v. Superintendent of M.C.I.\n\nNorfolk, 873 F.2d 491, 493 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            The Commonwealth did not argue in the federal district\n\ncourt that McCambridge procedurally defaulted by not objecting to\n\n                                         -62-\n\fthe prosecutor's closing argument.9    Indeed, even after receiving\n\nthree extensions of time to file a brief in the federal district\n\ncourt, the Commonwealth failed to file a timely brief.10    \"[T]his\ncircuit religiously follows the rule that issues not presented to\n\nthe district court cannot be raised on appeal.\" Ouimette v. Moran,\n\n942 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1991).\n          Moreover, litigants in federal habeas proceedings arising\n\nfrom state court convictions are generally required to raise all\n\nissues in the state courts.   See Trest, 522 U.S. at 89; Coleman,\n\n501 U.S. at 732 (noting that the independent and adequate state\n\nground doctrine \"ensures that the States' interest in correcting\n\ntheir own mistakes is respected\").    In this case, the Commonwealth\n\n\n     9\n      In its brief to the panel, the Commonwealth, for the first\ntime, did note in passing that there was no objection to its\nsummation, but it did not mention the possibility of a procedural\nbar to federal habeas review. The summation issue was disposed of\nin one paragraph. \"There is also no merit to the petitioner's\ncontention that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's reference\nduring closing argument to the fact that the victim's criminal\nrecord was not in evidence. Defense counsel, during his closing,\nhad already expressly conceded this point by stating: 'There's no\nevidence in this case that Mr. Doyle ever molested or abused any\nchild.' In any event, the petitioner did not object to the\nprosecutor's closing and the judge instructed the jury that\ncounsel's arguments were not evidence.\" This statement is patently\ninsufficient to raise an adequate and independent state ground\nargument with respect to the failure of the defendant to object to\nthe Commonwealthโs closing argument. See United States v. Fernandez,\n145 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir. 1998) (issues mentioned in perfunctory\nmanner, unaccompanied by argument, are deemed waived); Fed. R. App.\nP. 28(b). Nor can the Commonwealth raise the issue for the first\ntime before the en banc court. See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 924\nF.2d 1161, 1169 (1st Cir. 1991) (stating that a party cannot raise\nan issue for the first time on rehearing en banc).\n     10\n       Despite not receiving permission to file a brief after the\nexpiration of the final deadline, the Commonwealth did so. We\nassume it was not considered by the district court.\n\n                               -63-\n\fdid    not   argue   procedural   default   in   any   state   proceedings.\n\n\"[P]rocedural default is normally a defense that the State is\n\nobligated to raise and preserve if it is not to lose the right to\nassert the defense thereafter.\"        Trest, 522 U.S. at 89 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Commonwealth v. LaBriola, 722\n\nN.E.2d 13, 14 n.1 (Mass. 2000).      We should enforce that rule here.\n\nB. State court decision\n\n             Next I examine the opinion of the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt to determine whether its conclusion that McCambridge was not\n\nprejudiced by the nondisclosure of the exculpatory evidence is\ncontrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established\n\nfederal law.    See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1).       On the prejudice issue,\nthe appeals court said the following:\n             In any event, assuming without deciding that\n             the prosecutor should have produced the\n             victim's record, there was no prejudice to the\n             defendant because he was aware of the victim's\n             record and was prepared to offer such evidence\n             at trial.      Moreover, by convicting the\n             defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously\n             credited the defendant's testimony that the\n             struggle in the van was precipitated by the\n             defendant's remark about this offense to\n             Doyle. See Commonwealth v. Tucceri, 412 Mass.\n             401, 412-414, 589 N.E.2d 1216 (1992).\n\n             I accept the majority's conclusion that the Massachusetts\nAppeals Court applied a standard of prejudice that is consistent\n\nwith Brady, and that its decision was thus not contrary to federal\n\nlaw.    However, I would hold that the state court's conclusion on\nprejudice is an unreasonable application of the Brady prejudice\n\n\n\n\n                                   -64-\n\fstandard.      To    explain,       I    describe    the     evidence     presented     at\n\nMcCambridge's trial.\n\n             1. The evidence\n\n             The prosecution alleged at trial that McCambridge shot\n\nand killed Doyle shortly after the two men left a bar in Cambridge\n\nat 1 a.m., and that McCambridge was driving, with Doyle's body in\n\nthe back of the van, when a state trooper tried to stop the van.\n\nThe   prosecution         further       alleged     that    the     van   crashed      when\n\nMcCambridge reached for a gun with which he intended to shoot the\n\npolice officer attempting to apprehend him.                    However, the evidence\nthe Commonwealth presented at trial to prove this theory was\n\nconflicting and inconclusive.\n\n                      a. Time of death\n\n             The doctor who performed the autopsy on Doyle testified\nthat Doyle had last consumed alcohol approximately one and one half\nhours    before     his    death.         It   is    undisputed       that   Doyle      and\n\nMcCambridge left the bar when it closed at 1 a.m. and that the\naccident occurred at about 2 a.m.                 Thus, if credited by the jury,\nthe     doctor's    uncontradicted          opinion        tended    to   diminish      any\npossibility that Doyle's death occurred much before the crash\n\noccurred, let alone just after the two men left the bar at 1 a.m.\n\nAnother prosecution witness, an EMT who responded to the accident,\n\ntestified that Doyle's skin was still warm when his body was found\n\npinned beneath the van, thus tending to establish that Doyle died\n\nnot   long   before       the   accident,      particularly         in    light   of    the\n\nuncontradicted testimony that it was cold that night.\n\n                                           -65-\n\f                     b. The weapons\n\n            The    evidence    was    also    inconclusive       with   respect    to\n\nMcCambridge's      ownership    of     and    possession     of    a    gun.      The\n\nprosecution tried and failed to establish that McCambridge was\n\ncarrying a gun in the waistband of his pants before he was in the\n\nvan.    The bartender testified that McCambridge became angry when\n\nthe    bartender   started     to    close    up   the    bar.     He    said   that\n\nMcCambridge stood up and brushed up against him, chest to chest,\n\nwhile pushing his coat back.          When asked by the prosecutor whether\n\nhe saw McCambridge \"reach for anything,\" the bartender said no.\nThe bartender also testified that McCambridge did not seem to be\n\nangry with Doyle when the two men left the bar.\n            A firearms officer testified that McCambridge shot Doyle\ntwice with a derringer.         When emergency personnel were removing\n\nMcCambridge's jacket after the accident, the derringer fell to the\nfloor of the ambulance.             However, the firearms officer did not\ntrace the derringer to establish who owned it.               Nor did he attempt\n\nto identify the owner of the 9 mm. pistol with which Doyle\nallegedly had      threatened       McCambridge.         Another   Massachussetts\npolice officer testified that a box of ammunition fitting one of\n\nthe two guns was found in the van.            However, the box of ammunition,\nlabeled \"Big Al's Gun Shop,\" was never introduced into evidence and\nthe police officer had no other information about it.\n\n                        c. Location of the bodies\n\n            In an effort to bolster its theory that McCambridge had\n\nkilled Doyle up to an hour before the accident, the prosecution\n\n                                       -66-\n\fattempted to establish that McCambridge was driving when the van\n\ncrashed.     Forensic witnesses testified that blood on the seat of\n\nMcCambridge's pants was consistent with Doyle's blood, supporting\nan inference that McCambridge sat in the driver's seat at some\n\npoint.   However, there was also evidence that there was not enough\n\nblood on his pants to suggest that he sat there for long.\n           There was other conflicting evidence about the probable\n\nlocation of McCambridge's body and Doyle's body at the time of the\n\naccident. A prosecution witness testified that: (1) the passenger-\n\nside window was broken; (2) glass from the passenger-side window\n\nwas found on McCambridge's collar and under his jacket but none was\n\nfound on Doyle; and (3) if someone had been sitting in the\n\npassenger seat at the time of impact, he would have been thrown to\nthe right into the windshield or the passenger-door window.               The\n\nprosecution offered no explanation as to how or why, under its\n\ntheory of the case, McCambridge might have been in the passenger\nseat at the time of the impact.\n\n           The defense tried to show that it was not clear where the\n\ntwo bodies had been located prior to the crash and roll-over.             The\n\ndefense accident reconstructionist testified that the driver of the\n\nvan could have been thrown between the bucket seats and out of the\n\nside door when the van was lifted into the air.          The evidence was\n\nundisputed    that   after   the   accident   the   sliding   door   on   the\n\npassenger side of the van was off its bottom hinges.          The witnesses\n\nwere in agreement that Doyle had been thrown from the car through\n\nthis doorway.    Because the fabric of Doyleโs sweater had actually\n\n\n                                    -67-\n\ffused to the van, one investigator testified that Doyle's ejection\n\nmust have been the result of a major impact that generated the heat\n\nnecessary to accomplish the fusion.       This evidence indicated that\nDoyle could have been driving at the time of the crash, and did not\n\nestablish whether Doyle, if he had not been driving, was placed in\n\nthe back of the van by McCambridge prior to the accident or was\nthrown there upon impact.\n\n          Police    officers,     emergency   medical    personnel     and\n\ncivilians agreed that McCambridge was found wedged in the driver's\n\nseat area. Yet blood and hair sample tests established, without\n\ncontradiction, that McCambridge's head hit the passenger side of\n\nthe windshield during the crash.         Uncontradicted testimony also\n\nestablished that McCambridge had a gash in his head and was covered\nwith blood when he was found.\n\n               d. The police investigation and handling of evidence\n\n          There    were   other   questions   left   unanswered   by   the\ninvestigators. The accident reconstructionist for the state police\n\nhad no photographs of the tire marks on the road and could not\nexplain the absence of such important and apparently routine\nevidence.11   He also admitted during cross-examination that he had\n\nmade mistakes in drawing the accident scene; he was unsure what one\nline was intended to indicate and a second line purporting to\nrepresent the track of one tire in fact traced the track of a\n\n\n\n     11\n       The defense expert testified that it was difficult to\nanalyze the accident without a picture of the road marks and that\nit was standard procedure to carefully record such marks.\n\n                                  -68-\n\fdifferent tire.       Like the forensic chemist, he became confused\n\nregarding the physical principles governing the direction the\n\nbodies would have moved when the van hit the barrier.\n          Another     state    investigator   failed   to   document   where\n\nthings were located before they were removed from the van by the\n\npolice.   She   was    unaware of any inventory that might have been\nmade of the \"heaps of stuff\" that had been in the van, which\n\nincluded trash bags, clothing, newspapers and debris.             She also\n\nstated that the nine millimeter gun, which was loaded and cocked\n\nand allegedly used to threaten McCambridge, was found under a great\n\ndeal of debris.   Although the prosecution alleged that the van was\n\nweaving because McCambridge was reaching for this same gun in order\n\nto shoot the trooper who was trying to pull him over, there was no\ntestimony as to whether the debris would have been on top of the\n\ngun before the crash or whether the gun itself would have moved\n\nduring the crash. Moreover, the investigator could not say whether\nbloodstains of Doyle's blood type found in the back of the van were\n\nrecent or even whether they had been made by the police as they\n\nremoved items from the van.       Some of the items that had fallen onto\n\nthe road during the crash had been thrown back into the van before\n\nit was towed away, thus risking contamination and making it harder\n\nyet to reconstruct the accident.\n\n                               e. Self-Defense\n\n          In    support   of    his    self-defense    claim,   McCambridge\ntestified that Doyle became aggressive after McCambridge called him\n\na name referring to his conviction for child abuse.          He also stated\n\n                                      -69-\n\fthat he remembered nothing after the first shot he fired at Doyle\n\nuntil three to four days later when he was in the hospital.\n\nHowever, a medical expert, called by the defense, explained that a\nperson might become more aggressive after receiving the type of\n\nwound Doyle received when hit by the first bullet.                    Dismissing\n\nMcCambridge's amnesia as \"convenient,\" the prosecutor called no\nmedical experts to challenge the inference that such a memory loss\n\ncould be attributed both to shock and to the serious head wound\n\nMcCambridge sustained in the accident.               Other than McCambridge's\n\nown testimony, the record is devoid of evidence bearing on whether\n\nMcCambridge was in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury or\n\ndeath when he shot Doyle.\n\n            2. The verdict\n\n            The jury began deliberating at approximately 1:30 p.m.\n\nand returned its verdict the afternoon of the following day.12                   At\nthe end of the first day of its deliberations, the jury requested\nclarification on (1) unlawful killing, (2) malice aforethought, (3)\n\nburden of proof and (4) reasonable doubt.                 The following day, the\njury    asked   the      trial   judge   to     clarify   the   elements   of   the\nmanslaughter charge.         That afternoon, the jury returned a verdict\n\nfinding McCambridge guilty of the crime of manslaughter, unlawful\npossession      of   a   firearm,   operating      under    the   influence,    and\noperating to endanger.\n\n\n       12\n       It is unclear from the record at what time the jury was\ndismissed for the evening on the first day, at what time it\nreconvened on the second day, or at what time it rendered its\nverdict on the afternoon of the second day.\n\n                                         -70-\n\f            In returning a verdict of manslaughter, the jury rejected\n\nthe   prosecutor's   theory     that    McCambridge   acted   with    either\n\npremeditation or malice aforethought.        Its rejection of the murder\ncharge left the jury with only two options on the charge of\n\nunlawful killing: manslaughter or acquittal.            The prosecutor's\n\ninsinuation that McCambridge fabricated his testimony about Doyleโs\nconviction to besmirch Doyle's reputation was the last thing the\n\njury heard from either counsel.           This improper undermining of\n\nMcCambridge's credibility on the determinative question of self-\n\ndefense, and perhaps of his credibility in general, may well have\n\ntipped the balance in favor of a manslaughter conviction.             Thus, I\n\nconclude that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of\n\nMcCambridge's trial would have been different if the existence of\nDoyle's conviction had been disclosed and the prosecutor had not\n\nsuggested in closing argument that McCambridge was fabricating\n\nDoyle's conviction.\n            The majority disagrees with this prejudice analysis.          To\n\nconvict McCambridge of manslaughter, the majority reasons, \"the\n\njury must have found that [he] was provoked in some way, resulting\n\nin a sudden heat of passion.\"          The majority observes that \"[t]he\n\nonly evidence presented at trial regarding any possible provocation\n\nfor   the   altercation   was    McCambridge's    testimony    that    Doyle\n\nthreatened him with the nine millimeter Smith & Wesson after\n\nMcCambridge had called him a child abuser and that a conflict\n\nensued.\"    Thus, for the majority, \"the jury necessarily found that\n\nMcCambridge, in his self defense, used at least excessive force\n\n\n                                   -71-\n\fagainst Doyle (or . . . turned into the attacker).\"        The majority\n\nconcludes that \"the jury accepted McCambridge's story about Doyle's\n\nanger at being called a child abuser.       Nothing could be added to\nthis by having the fact of the child neglect conviction established\n\nor admitted into evidence.\"\n\n             In my view, this reasoning is unduly speculative.       It\nassumes that if the jury convicted McCambridge of manslaughter, it\n\nmust have believed his account of how the altercation with Doyle\n\nbegan.     However, as the amicus explains:\n\n             The jury could have disbelieved petitioner\n             almost entirely, thus rejecting his self-\n             defense testimony, and still found him guilty\n             of manslaughter rather than murder. There was\n             evidence outside petitioner's testimony that a\n             struggle was occurring inside the van while\n             driving on the highway shortly before the\n             accident.   Drivers saw the van rocking back\n             and forth on the highway, and forensic\n             evidence indicated that Doyle was shot shortly\n             before the crash.      There was independent\n             evidence supporting petitioner's testimony\n             that Doyle had pointed a cocked gun at him.\n             There was also evidence that both petitioner\n             and Doyle had been drinking.        The court\n             instructed the jury that it could find\n             manslaughter if it found that petitioner had\n             killed Doyle \"upon sudden combat.\" The court\n             also instructed that what \"distinguished\n             murder from manslaughter was the absence of\n             malice aforethought.\" The jury could simply\n             have concluded that the government failed to\n             prove its case on the critical issue of intent\n             given the paucity of the evidence supporting\n             its theory of how and when petitioner killed\n             Doyle.\n\nIn other words, the jury could have found that the circumstantial\n\nevidence supported the conclusion that McCambridge killed Doyle\n\nupon sudden combat or in the heat of passion -- for whatever reason\n\n--   but    that   it   was   not   sufficient   to   establish   malice\n\n                                    -72-\n\faforethought.13     There is simply no basis for concluding that the\n\njury must have believed McCambridge's account of what sparked the\n\nincident.\n            Nor is the majority opinion convincing when it declares\n\nthat \"[n]either the fact of Doyle's conviction, nor the contested\n\nexcerpt from the prosecutor's closing argument, is material to\nwhether McCambridge used excessive force.\"        This argument assumes\n\nthat the jury found that McCambridge acted in self-defense but with\n\nexcessive force.     Yet, again, the jury could have disbelieved his\n\nself-defense claim, but convicted him of manslaughter because the\n\ncircumstantial evidence supported a finding of \"sudden combat\" (but\n\nfailed to establish malice aforethought). If the jury had believed\n\nMcCambridge's story about the origins of the altercation, it could\nhave found that he acted in self-defense without excessive force,\n\nand thereby was entitled to an acquittal.         It is simply wrong to\n\nsay that the jury must have found that McCambridge used excessive\n\nforce in self defense, when we do not know if the jury accepted his\n\nclaim that he acted in self-defense in the first place.\n            The majority is also inconsistent in its assessment of\n\nthe   effect   on   McCambridge's   credibility   of   the   prosecutor's\n\n\n\n      13\n        As the majority points out, the jury was instructed as\nfollows:\n\n      Manslaughter is an unlawful, intentional killing\n      resulting from a sudden transport of the passions or heat\n      of blood when there is no time to deliberate and when\n      such passion or heat of blood is produced by adequate or\n      reasonable provocation and without malice or upon sudden\n      combat . . . .\n\n                                    -73-\n\freferences in closing argument to McCambridge's unsupported claim\n\nabout Doyle's conviction for child abuse.              On the one hand, the\n\nmajority asserts that \"[a]t most the prosecutor's statement was\nanother stab at the already damaged credibility of the defendant,\"\n\nsuggesting that McCambridge, generally speaking, was not a credible\n\nwitness.    Yet the majority also asserts that the jury must have\nbelieved McCambridge's testimony that he fired on Doyle in self-\n\ndefense,    in   support   of    its   theory   that   he   was   convicted    of\n\nmanslaughter because the jury decided he used excessive force in\n\nhis self-defense.       This seems to be a rather selective view of\n\nMcCambridge's credibility.\n\n            My   own   view     is   that   McCambridge's    credibility      was\n\nimpugned in the eyes of the jury on the critical issue of self-\ndefense, and there is at least a reasonable probability, the Brady\n\nprejudice standard, that this damage was attributable to the\n\nprosecutor's unfair closing argument. That view draws support from\nthe jury's conviction of McCambridge on two of the three motor\n\nvehicle offenses.       These convictions indicate unmistakably that\nthey concluded that McCambridge was driving the van at some point,\n\na determination that required rejecting substantial parts of his\n\naccount of the altercation with Doyle, the shooting, and the\n\naccident.    The majority suggests that \"[t]he Appeals Court could\n\nreasonably conclude . . . that once McCambridge shot Doyle, he\n\npushed Doyle toward the back of the van and attempted to drive from\n\nthe passenger's seat or the driver's seat.\"            It is indeed possible\n\nthat the jury reasoned as the majority describes, but a more\n\n\n                                       -74-\n\fstraightforward       explanation is that the jury simply disbelieved\n\nMcCambridge's testimony that Doyle was driving the van when he was\n\nshot.\n             My conclusion that McCambridge was prejudiced by the\n\nprosecutor's misconduct is consistent with our decision in United\n\nStates v. Udechukwu, 11 F.3d 1101 (1st Cir. 1993), where we\nconsidered      the   prejudicial    effect   of       a    prosecutor's   closing\n\nargument questioning the existence of exculpatory evidence the\n\ndefendant claimed existed but which the prosecution failed to\n\ndisclose.       The defendant in that case, charged with smuggling\n\nillegal drugs into the United States from Aruba, presented a\n\ndefense of duress.       She testified that a man named Michael Mouma\n\nhad threatened to harm her children if she did not transport drugs\nfor him.     Defense counsel attempted to obtain evidence from the\n\nprosecution to corroborate the defendant's testimony regarding\n\nMouma and the circumstances under which she had agreed to smuggle\nthe drugs.      Although the government had information that Mouma did\n\nexist,    was    in   Aruba,   and   had   been    a       drug   trafficker,   that\n\nexculpatory information was never disclosed to the defense.                      The\n\nprosecutor then used the absence of information about Mouma to\n\nchallenge       Udechukwu's    credibility    in       closing     argument.      In\n\nUdechukwu, as here, the defendant asserted on direct appeal14 that\n\n\n     14\n       We considered Udechukwu's Brady claim on direct appeal,\nrather than collateral review.      For purposes of evaluating\nMcCambridge's Brady claim, Udechukwu applies; the only difference\nin our standard of review for the two cases is that we must take\nthe additional step here of determining that the appeals court\ndecision affirming McCambridge's conviction is contrary to or an\n\n                                      -75-\n\fthe prosecution's Brady violation was magnified by the improper\n\nsummation.     We stated:\n\n             The inferences and the direct challenge to the\n             existence of a source named Michael, however,\n             when the prosecution had unearthed evidence\n             that he existed and was a prominent dealer in\n             narcotics, is indefensible.    Here we find a\n             kind of double-acting prosecutorial error: a\n             failure to communicate salient information,\n             which, under [Brady and Giglio] should be\n             disclosed to the defense, and a deliberate\n             insinuation that the truth is to the contrary.\n\nId. at 1106.\n\n             As   in   the   instant   case,   there   was    no   question   in\n\nUdechukwu that the defendant committed the acts alleged by the\n\nprosecution.      Udechukwu's defense of duress, like McCambridge's\nclaim of self-defense, depended entirely on her credibility.                  In\n\nUdechukwu, the evidence not disclosed by the prosecution only\n\npartly substantiated her defense because the fact that Mouma\nexisted, lived in Aruba, and had been involved in illegal narcotics\n\ndid not establish that Mouma ever threatened Udechukwu or asked her\n\nto smuggle drugs. Nevertheless, we reversed Udechukwu's conviction\n\nand remanded for a new trial because we concluded that she was\nprejudiced by the prosecutor's improper attack on the crucial issue\n\nof her credibility: \"Whether the government's failure to disclose\n\nthis credibility-strengthening information could be said to be\n\nreversible error, we need not decide.           We have no doubt, however,\n\nthat   the    prosecutor's     persistent      theme   in    closing   argument\n\nsuggesting the nonexistence of this information . . . did fatally\n\n\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\n\n                                       -76-\n\ftaint the trial.\" Id. at 1105.15                  Thus, I conclude that the\n\nprosecutor's insinuation during closing argument that McCambridge\n\nhad   lied   about     Doyle's   criminal      record    likewise       tainted   the\nMcCambridge trial in the relevant Brady sense.16                        It deprived\n\nMcCambridge     of    \"a   trial      resulting    in    a    verdict    worthy    of\n\nconfidence.\"17       Strickler, 527 U.S. at 289-90.\n\n             Nevertheless,       my    conclusion       that      McCambridge     was\n\nprejudiced    by     the   prosecution's       failure       to   disclose   Doyle's\n\nconviction would not be sufficient to warrant the issuance of a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus. I must also conclude that the determination\n\nof the appeals court on this issue constituted an unreasonable\n\napplication of clearly established federal law as articulated by\n\n\n\n\n      15\n      Massachusetts law is consistent with our own in this regard.\nIn Commonwealth v. Collins, 434 N.E.2d 964, 969 (Mass. 1982), the\nSupreme Judicial Court stated: \"When the failure to disclose is\ncoupled with the blatant misrepresentation made by the prosecutor\nin his closing argument to the jury, the conclusion that the\nconviction cannot stand is inescapable.\"\n      16\n       I find wholly unpersuasive the suggestion of the majority\nthat McCambridge somehow benefitted from the unavailability of\nDoyle's complete criminal record, which would have revealed the\nconviction for child neglect. The harm to McCambridge caused by\nthe prosecutor's failure to abide by his representation to the\njudge and to defense counsel that he would not question the fact of\nDoyle's conviction vastly outweighs any advantage McCambridge\ngained by not having the jury learn that Doyle's conviction was for\nchild neglect rather than child abuse.\n      17\n       In distinguishing Udechukwu, the majority says that here the\nprosecutor did not make knowing misrepresentations to the jury.\nThat may or may not be true. Indisputably, however, the prosecutor\nmade a knowing misrepresentation to the judge and to defense\ncounsel prior to closing argument that he would not argue to the\njury the absence of evidence that Doyle had been convicted of child\nabuse. This conduct cannot be excused as \"sloppiness.\"\n\n                                        -77-\n\fthe Supreme Court.18 See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1). The appeals court\n\nfound no prejudice for two reasons. First, it observed that \"there\n\nwas no prejudice to [McCambridge] because he was aware of the\nvictimโs record and was prepared to offer such evidence at trial.\"\n\nMcCambridge, 690 N.E.2d at 475.        That observation is entirely\n\nbeside the point.   McCambridge did not wish to offer proof of the\nvictimโs record because he agreed with the trial court that the\n\ntruth about that record was irrelevant.     McCambridge had referred\n\nto Doyleโs record in his testimony and his closing argument only to\n\nexplain the origin of the altercation.      The truth of the record\n\nonly became an issue at the end of the trial because of the\n\nprosecutorโs unfair attack on McCambridgeโs credibility in closing\n\nargument.\n            Second, the appeals court said that the jury must have\n\nbelieved McCambridge's account of the struggle and its cause given\n\nhis conviction for manslaughter: \"By convicting the defendant of\nmanslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony\n\nthat the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's\n\nremark about [the conviction] to Doyle.\"     McCambridge, 690 N.E.2d\n\nat 475.     As I have explained in my analysis of the majority's\n\nsimilar assessment of the prejudice issue, the court's conclusion\n\nthat the jury \"obviously credited\" McCambridge's testimony rests on\n\n\n\n\n     18\n        I agree with the majority's reformulation of the content\nof the \"unreasonable application\" clause of 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1)\nin light of Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000).\n\n                                -78-\n\fa faulty, unduly speculative premise.19              The jury may well have\n\nreached a manslaughter verdict for any number of reasons having\n\nnothing to do with its crediting of McCambridge's insistence that\nthe   struggle       was   precipitated   by   his    remark    about   Doyle's\n\nconviction.      All that can be said with certainty about the jury's\n\nevaluation of McCambridge's claim of self-defense is that the jury\ndid not credit his testimony sufficiently to acquit him.                Rather,\n\ntheir      verdict    strongly   suggested     a   negative    judgment   about\n\nMcCambridgeโs credibility, in a case where the Commonwealth's\n\nevidence was circumstantial and, on important points, inconclusive.\n\n              In summary, the state appeals court's            conclusion that\n\nthe outcome of McCambridge's trial would not have been different if\n\nthe evidence of Doyle's conviction had been disclosed rests on an\nirrelevant observation and an unduly speculative premise.                 Under\n\nthese circumstances, I must conclude that the courtโs no prejudice\n\ndetermination constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished federal law regarding prejudice in the Brady context,\n\nand the writ of habeas corpus should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n      19\n       The district court agreed with the Massachusetts Appeals\nCourt that McCambridge had not been prejudiced by the prosecutor's\nnondisclosure. It concluded that the jury must have found enough\nplausibility in McCambridge's account to reject a first or second\ndegree murder conviction: \"[T]he jury must have accepted that\n[McCambridge's] provocation story at least raised some reasonable\ndoubt in order to convict on manslaughter rather than first- or\nsecond-degree murder.\" This conclusion is unduly restrictive in\nits view that McCambridge received his due because he avoided a\nmurder conviction.     McCambridge was also entitled to fair\nconsideration of his claim that he was not guilty of manslaughter.\n\n                                     -79-\n\f",

The charges arose out of a shooting and a motor vehicle accident involving McCambridge and the victim, Richard Doyle. McCambridge admitted to the shooting and said he acted in self-defense. The jury rejected the murder charge and the charge that he was operating a motor vehicle after his license had been revoked or suspended, but it convicted him of manslaughter, unlawful possession of a fire-arm, operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and reckless operation of a motor vehicle.

The two had been out drinking together at a bar in Cambridge on the night of the incident, which occurred in the early hours of November 11, 1993. At the bar, McCambridge argued with the bartender, screaming at him either because of the television set, or because of McCambridge's attentions to the bartender's girlfriend. Leaving the bar around one a.m., Doyle and McCambridge drove off together in Doyle's van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about two a.m., a state trooper observed a traffic disturbance on the Southeast Expressway, which was caused by the van weaving through the southbound lanes and driving unusually slowly, about forty miles per hour, on this major road. The trooper turned on his lights and siren in an attempt to pull over the van, but the van continued to weave through the lanes. The van then accelerated to between fifty miles per hour and sixty-five miles per hour and swerved into the cement curbing on the right shoulder of the Expressway. After the van hit the right shoulder, it fish-tailed across the road, turning perpendicular to the Expressway and slowing to a speed of about thirty-five miles per hour. The van then struck the cement center median head-on, hitting first on the front right side, then with the whole front of the van. The van went up into the air, rising several feet, and landed with the driver's side down, facing the wrong way down the road. The van then skidded backwards about ten feet, rotating 360 degrees as it slid. The trooper also said that, as the van went into the center median, he saw a head in the driver's seat area; the head smashed into the windshield as the van hit the ground. The trooper estimated that about two minutes passed from when he first saw the van until the crash, and that the van had traveled about two or two-and-a-half miles, weaving and then crashing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second witness, an off-duty state trooper, saw the van weaving through the Expressway lanes, then fish-tailing into the right shoulder, crossing the Expressway into the center median, rising up into the air, and landing on the driver's side. A third witness saw the van weaving across lanes, then actually rocking back and forth before it hit the right shoulder, at which point it shot straight across the road into the center median, and flipped onto its side, landing with the driver's side down on the pavement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trooper and other witnesses found McCambridge in a fetal position in the area of the driver's seat, bleeding from a head injury.

As the rescue personnel were removing McCambridge's outerwear, a derringer pistol fell out of his clothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doyle had been thrown from the van and his head was pinned under the driver's side rear wheel so that only his body was visible. His clothing had been torn off around the neck area, leaving his chest completely exposed. The state troopers at the scene reported that his skin appeared blue or grayish, he was not breathing and he had no pulse, although one paramedic testified that Doyle was still warm to the touch when the paramedic arrived. There was no attempt to resuscitate him. Doyle was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. He had been shot once in the right cheek and once in the back (in the area of the right shoulder). He also had a head wound indicating that the back of his head had struck or been struck with a linear object that was at least three inches in length and had no sharp or rough edges. Doyle's blood alcohol level was 0.22%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the van, the troopers found a Smith &amp; Wesson semiautomatic pistol; the safety was off and the gun was cocked, loaded, and ready to fire. The police also found a billy club with blood on it that was consistent with Doyle's blood type and two boxes of ammunition, each corresponding to one of the two guns. Doyle had been living in the van prior to the crash, and the van was used by a homeless advocacy organization to transport individuals to shelters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution's theory at trial was that McCambridge had shot Doyle and was driving the van, en route to dumping the body, when the crash occurred. McCambridge admitted shooting Doyle, but argued he did so in self-defense. More specifically, McCambridge claimed that Doyle, in a drunken rage, was threatening to shoot him for implying that Doyle was a child abuser. McCambridge says that the derringer was Doyle's, which Doyle himself had placed on the dash-board, as he was on his way to sell the gun to a customer in Quincy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge testified that the argument in the van had its genesis in a conversation between Doyle and himself, a month or so before the shooting. In that conversation, McCambridge says he told Doyle that he had heard Doyle had been convicted for child abuse. Doyle, after initially denying the charge, admitted it was true, said he had done his time for it, and said he didn't want to hear any more. Doyle told McCambridge that \"if [McCambridge] ever threw it up to him, his face again ... he'd put a bullet in [McCambridge's] frigging head.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this warning, McCambridge says he raised the topic again in the van, just prior to the shooting. McCambridge testified that the argument began after leaving the bar, when McCambridge asked Doyle, who was driving, to give him a ride to his ex-wife's house. Doyle said he had to make a phone call and left the van. When he returned, Doyle said he had to go to Quincy because he had a customer for a derringer pistol. Doyle pulled the derringer out from under the seat and threw it on the dashboard. McCambridge again asked to be taken to his ex-wife's, but Doyle drove on toward Quincy. This angered McCambridge and so he told Doyle he was drunk and called Doyle a name implying that Doyle had abused a child. McCambridge testified that Doyle then pulled out a nine-millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson from his waist band, and threatened McCambridge with it. McCambridge testified that he pushed downward on Doyle's right hand, while Doyle pushed upwards, and that he begged Doyle to put the gun down. At the same time, McCambridge says he grabbed the derringer from the dashboard. He saw Doyle cock the hammer of the Smith &amp; Wesson, so he shot Doyle in the face with the derringer. McCambridge testified he had no memory of anything else until he woke up in the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to a ballistics expert's testimony at trial, Doyle had been shot with the derringer pistol that fell out of McCambridge's clothing at the accident scene. The ballistics expert testified that the derringer needed to be manually loaded, would only bear two cartridges, and needed to be manually cocked each time the weapon was fired. He further testified that it would take between thirteen and sixteen pounds of pressure to pull the trigger, which he characterized as \"a very heavy trigger pull.\" He also testified that he would expect a considerable flash when the gun was fired, \"enough to instantaneously brighten a darkened room.\" The state trooper pursuing the van testified that he saw no flash or other light from the van's interior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A forensic chemist testified at trial for the prosecution that, in her opinion, Doyle was shot while he was in the driver's seat of the van; but at the time of the accident, Doyle was probably near the sliding passenger's side door and McCambridge was in the driver's seat. This supported the prosecution's theory of the case, which was that McCambridge had shot Doyle sometime after leaving the bar, and then deposited his body in the back of the van. She testified that Doyle's blood was spattered in a downward and outward direction on the driver's side door in a manner suggesting a high-velocity impact, such as from a gunshot wound, with blood dripping down the door. This indicated that the van was in an upright position when the blood spattered on the door. She testified that the hardening around the edges of blood droplets suggested that the blood on the upper part of the window remained undisturbed for about three minutes and that the larger quantities of blood, dripping down the driver's side door, were undisturbed for at least five minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blood matching Doyle's type was found on the driver's seat and had soaked through the upholstery into the cushion, and a pool of Doyle's blood type had collected under the driver's seat. There was also blood on the seat of McCambridge's jeans that was consistent with Doyle's blood; the forensics expert testified that the stain was consistent with McCambridge sitting in blood, rather than merely wiping up against blood. More of the Doyle-type blood was found on the front leg of McCambridge's jeans; on a jacket belonging to McCambridge, which the police found in the back of the van after the crash; and on the billy club found in the van. Doyle's blood was also on the passenger's side sliding door, which was off the hinges at the bottom, and open \"like a flap.\" Fibers from Doyle's sweater were fused to the lower portion of the sliding door, indicating that the sweater had struck the door with great force. She also testified that, based on the stippling marks on Doyle's clothing, she believed the gunshot wound in Doyle's back was caused by a shot fired from a distance of three feet or greater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for McCambridge, the forensics expert found tissue, hair and blood on the upper passenger's side corner of the windshield and on the passenger's side dash-board that appeared to be McCambridge's, as well as on the rear-view mirror (which was detached from its proper place). McCambridge's blood was also found on his sweater and the jacket he was wearing at the time of the crash. The expert also found glass fragments from the windshield and the passenger's side window in McCambridge's clothes, indicating that McCambridge was probably in contact with the passenger's side window when it broke. (There was no such evidence that Doyle had come in contact with the broken windshield.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth had a specialist in accident reconstruction testify. He supported the witnesses' memories of the crash, and opined that Doyle's body must have been ejected from the flapping passenger's side sliding door at the first impact. He also testified that, upon impact, the occupants of the van would have been thrown forward and to the right. He further testified that the driver was likely to have been pinned behind the wheel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical examiner who testified for the Commonwealth stated that the manner in which Doyle's impact wounds bled suggested that it was possible that he was still alive at the time of the crash, but that he could not be sure. He based this upon the fact that there was blood in the tissues surrounding the impact abrasions, which could indicate that Doyle's heart was still pumping blood at the time of impact, but that could also be caused by the body being turned multiple times.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The medical examiner's opinion was that Doyle was shot first in the cheek, from a distance of six to eight inches to the right of the right cheek; this shot probably would have killed Doyle within eight minutes. He stated that the second gunshot, to the upper right back shoulder area, severed Doyle's aorta and thus probably would have killed Doyle in less than two to three minutes, and definitely in less than eight minutes. He also concluded that, based on the amount of blood that Doyle had inhaled into his lungs, Doyle had time to take at least a few breaths between the two shots. Based on Doyle's blood alcohol content and the fact that Doyle had absorbed all the alcohol in his stomach, the medical examiner estimated that Doyle had stopped drinking about ninety minutes prior to being killed. The medical expert also testified that Doyle's head wound was consistent with a blow from a billy club, such as was found in the van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge's forensics expert testified that, upon impact, the passenger would be propelled forward into the right-hand corner of the windshield, but that the steering wheel and console could prevent the driver from hitting the windshield, instead sending the driver back, through the twenty-nine inch space between the front bucket seats, and out the passenger's side sliding door. He further testified that the derringer has an average muzzle energy of 95 foot pounds, roughly equivalent to a punch from a professional boxer, whereas the Smith &amp; Wesson has an average muzzle energy of 355 foot pounds. Due to the relatively weak muzzle energy of the derringer, he testified that it was possible for Doyle to have been shot once and still have remained conscious, active, and possibly even more aggressive because of the wound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the habeas issue asserted is based on the question of evidence as to whether or not Doyle had been convicted of child abuse, we go into detail on this point. At trial, the prosecution called Doyle's brother. During the testimony, McCambridge's counsel asked for a side-bar and informed the court that, if the Commonwealth planned to challenge the truth of Doyle's conviction for child abuse, he would like the opportunity to cross-examine Doyle's brother about whether Doyle had served time for child abuse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At that point, the prosecution said it was not certain whether it intended to challenge the truth of the conviction. The court said that it would keep Doyle's brother available to be recalled as a witness if the prosecution decided to argue that Doyle had not been convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, during McCambridge's testimony, the prosecutor objected on hearsay and prejudice grounds to McCambridge referring to Doyle's conviction. The prosecutor said the prejudice outweighed any probative value. The court asked if there was a conviction on the charge. Defense counsel represented there was a conviction, but said \"whether it's true or not in some ways is irrelevant.\" At that point, the judge asked counsel whether either had checked Doyle's probation record. The prosecutor replied, \"It just says&#8212;it doesn't say what for. I have no idea what it's for.\" The judge allowed McCambridge to testify to his first conversation with Doyle about the conviction, agreeing that it went to McCambridge's state of mind, which was relevant to the self-defense theory, and not for the truth of the conviction, which was not relevant to self-defense. On cross-examination of McCambridge, the prosecutor raised the issue of the conviction, and then asked, \"You know Mr. Doyle is deceased?,\" to which McCambridge answered yes. The prosecutor then asked, \"He can't refute your allegations right now; can he?\" The defense objected to that question, and the objection was sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near the conclusion of the defense's case, defense counsel requested a side-bar to clarify whether he needed to recall Doyle's brother. That turned, he said, on whether the prosecution intended to impugn McCambridge's credibility by arguing that Doyle had never been convicted or in jail, when there was no evidence either way on this point. The prosecutor took the position that Doyle had not been in jail, that the defense counsel could ask the question of Doyle's brother if he wanted, and that it was up to the defense, not the prosecution, to put Doyle's criminal record into evidence. When asked by the court, the prosecutor said, \"He wasn't in jail, Judge,\" and then, when the court further asked if Doyle was convicted, the prosecutor responded \"No. No.\" The prosecutor said all he had seen on the record was spousal abuse, \"so far as [he knew, Doyle] had never been in jail,\" and that was all he could say on the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel said he did not have access to the criminal record and would like it produced. He said he did not want to make it part of the case but that he \"d[id]n't want to open it up for argument that [he] didn't prove that [Doyle] had one, and, therefore, [McCambridge] was lying.\" The court asked the prosecution what it intended to argue on the issue. The prosecutor replied that he had no problem if the defendant called the brother \"because, as far as I know, there is no record that Mr. Doyle had any convictions.\" When the judge inquired further, the prosecutor said he should not be put in the position of disclosing what his closing argument would be. He foreshadowed what he might do by saying McCambridge \"gets up there and says [Doyle's] done time when I know he hasn't from the records I've seen. And if [McCambridge has] got the record, he can [attempt to introduce it.]\" The court then interjected that the information had come in only for the state of mind of the defendant. The prosecutor said that was all he was going to argue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his closing argument, the defense counsel was careful to emphasize that McCambridge's testimony about Doyle's conviction was offered only to show his state of mind and that there was no evidence that Doyle ever molested or abused any child. He stated that \"[t]here is simply no evidence one way or another.... There is no evidence that he did it. There is no evidence that he didn't do it. It was admitted for ... the state of mind.\" The prosecutor, in turn, in his closing referred to the earlier conversation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does the defendant have something for you to believe when he gets up there and says, oh, yeah, I had an argument with Richard Doyle because of child molestation? There is absolutely evidence of that. Was that put in there to tell you what his frame of mind was? No. That was his third shot at the victim from the stand, assassinating his reputation with no evidence. That's what that was for, I suggest to you, not to show state of mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Literally read, the prosecution admitted there was evidence that defendant had an argument with Doyle in the aftermath of the child abuse accusation, but that the real purpose for the testimony was to impugn the victim, not to show McCambridge's state of mind.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Defense counsel did not object to the prosecution's closing statement. Nor was the closing statement presented as error to the state courts on McCambridge's direct appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, presenting three main arguments: that the derringer and his clothes were the product of an unlawful search and seizure and should have been suppressed; that the jury should have been instructed on the possibility of a necessity defense to the firearms charge; and that \"the trial court erred by not requiring Doyle's criminal record to be made part of the record, and the prosecutor may have violated the defendant's state and federal due process rights by not disclosing that record.\" On this third argument, McCambridge argued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suppression of material evidence favorable to the accused and requested by him violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 87 [83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215] (1963). In the case at bar, because the trial court refused to require the Commonwealth to produce Doyle's criminal record, the defendant cannot prove that exculpatory evidence was withheld.... Thus, this Court should order the Commonwealth to produce Doyle's criminal record so that an appellate decision can be made. In the alternative, the case should be remanded to the Superior Court for production of the document at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth responded that McCambridge had not requested that Doyle's record be marked as an exhibit until the sentencing stage, that the proper means for challenging a failure to disclose exculpatory evidence would have been through a motion for new trial under Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(b), and that the conviction record was not material to the verdict because \"the jury clearly believed the defendant's testimony regarding a confrontation with the victim,\" since they convicted him only of manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After filing its brief with the state appeals court, the Commonwealth filed a Motion to Expand the Record to include Doyle's criminal record, which did in fact contain a conviction for child neglect and a notation that Doyle served six months in jail for this conviction. The Commonwealth's motion explained that, at trial, the prosecutor had only a partial print-out of the record, which had no mention of the child neglect conviction, and included as an appendix a copy of this truncated print-out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his reply brief, McCambridge argued that \"the Commonwealth has now disclosed that exculpatory evidence was withheld at trial\" and, citing <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), maintained that he was entitled to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Massachusetts Appeals Court held:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Failure to mark Doyle's criminal record for identification.</i> The defendant requested the trial judge at the sentencing hearing to mark Doyle's criminal record as an \"exhibit.\" The judge denied the request and the defendant claims it was error, for the record was necessary to support his claim that the prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence from him. The defendant claimed that Doyle's record would have supported his claim that Doyle had been convicted of child abuse, which would have corroborated the defendant's testimony at trial that Doyle pulled a gun on him when the defendant called Doyle a name indicating he was a child abuser, which accusation on a prior occasion had prompted Doyle to threaten the defendant's life if he ever accused him of this offense again. While the defendant pressed for the introduction of the victim's criminal record at trial, he did not object when the judge did not order its production or request that the record be marked for identification. He cannot now be heard to complain that the judge failed to do so at the sentencing stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, assuming without deciding that the prosecutor should have produced the victim's record, there was no prejudice to the defendant because he was aware of the victim's record and was prepared to offer such evidence at trial. Moreover, by convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about this offense to Doyle. <i>See Commonwealth v. Tucceri,</i> 412 Mass. 401, 412-14, 589 N.E.2d 1216 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>McCambridge,</i> 690 N.E.2d at 475. In essence, the court held that McCambridge had forfeited the issue at trial and could not resuscitate it by raising it at sentencing. It also held in the alternative that McCambridge suffered no prejudice from the absence of Doyle's record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge then filed an application to obtain further review with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC). He argued that the defendant was dissuaded from attempting to put [the criminal record] evidence before the jury because the prosecutor misled the defense by representing that the alleged victim did not have a record and in any event that the issue wouldn't be argued in closing. The withholding of information with the intent to mislead and prejudice the defendant, and the exploitation of that misdirection in closing argument violated the defendant's rights to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge cited <i>Brady</i> and <i>Commonwealth v. Tucceri,</i> 412 Mass. 401, 589 N.E.2d 1216 (1992), a Massachusetts case on failure to produce exculpatory evidence, as support. The Commonwealth responded that \"any failure to produce the victim's criminal record did not prejudice the defendant.\" The SJC, without opinion, denied further appellate review. <i>Commonwealth v. McCambridge,</i> 427 Mass. 1103, 707 N.E.2d 1076 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1999, McCambridge filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996) in the District of Massachusetts. He argued that his detention is unconstitutional because the trial court erroneously admitted the seized clothing and gun into evidence in violation of both his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights; that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the necessity defense; and that the prosecutor improperly withheld exculpatory material, namely, Doyle's conviction record. On the Commonwealth's motion, the district court dismissed McCambridge's first argument as to the seized clothing and gun, because it was essentially a Fourth Amendment claim that was not reviewable on habeas. <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 68 F.Supp.2d 1, 4 (D.Mass.1999). The district court subsequently held that the gun charge error did not affect the manslaughter conviction, as \"[t]he question put to the jury was not whether McCambridge used an unlawful <i>device</i> when defending himself, but rather whether he used excessive <i>force.</i>\" <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 94 F.Supp.2d 146, 154 (D.Mass.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also held that McCambridge had procedurally defaulted on his claim that the prosecutor's failure to disclose Doyle's conviction record violated McCambridge's rights under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <i>Giglio v. United States,</i> 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). <i>McCambridge,</i> 94 F.Supp.2d at 154-55. The district court referred to the Massachusetts Appeals Court holding cited above, noting that \"[p]rocedural default acts as an independent and adequate state ground to uphold the conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 155. The court further held that McCambridge had not shown that \"some objective factor external to the defense impeded defense counsel's efforts to comply with the state's procedural rule,\" <i>id.</i> at 155-56, nor had he shown \"actual prejudice\" from the prosecution's failure to produce the criminal conviction, <i>id.</i> at 156, nor any miscarriage of justice, <i>id.</i> The court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The actual contents of Doyle's criminal record are not relevant to this analysis because the details of the actual criminal record were not known to McCambridge at the time of the homicide.... Rather, McCambridge believed, from whatever source, that Doyle had a criminal history of child abuse, knew that accusations of child abuse were likely to provoke violence from Doyle, and after such provocation became fearful of his life when Doyle drew a gun. To these facts McCambridge testified at his trial, and the jury must have accepted that his provocation story at least raised some reasonable doubt in order to convict on manslaughter rather than first- or second-degree murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to issue a certificate of appealability. This court subsequently issued a certificate of appealability on McCambridge's <i>Brady</i> claim. On appeal, a panel of this court reversed the district court and granted the habeas petition. <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> No. 00-1621, slip op., 2001 WL 1097770 (1st Cir. Sept. 24, 2001). The panel held that the state court's determination that McCambridge's counsel should have objected at trial to the failure of the court to order the prosecutor to produce the record and to mark it into evidence was contrary to clearly established federal law, and its conclusion that McCambridge suffered no prejudice was an unreasonable application of the law to the facts. The panel held that, under clearly established federal law, a defendant may rely on a prosecutor's representations that she has fully complied with her <i>Brady</i> disclosure requirements, and therefore, need not object. <i>Id.</i> at 17-18. Further, the panel held that the prosecutor's insinuation in his closing that McCambridge had invented the entire story about Doyle's criminal conviction prejudiced McCambridge and \"may well have tipped the balance in favor of a manslaughter conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A habeas petitioner must meet certain preliminary criteria before we can reach the merits of his claim.

The state court inquiry did focus on whether there was \"prejudice\" to the defendant, which is the relevant federal standard. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936. But the Federal Defender's Office argues that <i>Tucceri</i> established a standard for prejudice that is different from the federal standard, and the citation to <i>Tucceri</i> indicates that the court was not using the federal standard to determine prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tucceri</i> states explicitly that it is articulating a state law standard that is \"more favorable to defendants than the Federal Constitutional standard.\" 589 N.E.2d at 1223 n. 11. There is no dispute that this is so. If the conviction survives this more lenient state standard, then, absent exceptional circumstances, it follows that the conviction would survive the federal standard, and we see no reason the state courts would be required to say explicitly that both standards are met. If there is a federal or state case that explicitly says that the state adheres to a standard that is more favorable to defendants than the federal standard (and it is correct in its characterization of the law), we will presume the federal law adjudication to be subsumed within the state law adjudication. <i>Cf.

The range for what is an unreasonable application must fall somewhere between the two.

The Massachusetts Appeals Court based its no prejudice finding on two independent reasons. There was no prejudice because 1) McCambridge was aware of the victim's record and was prepared to offer such evidence at trial; and 2) \"[b]y convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about this offense to Doyle.\" 690 N.E.2d at 475.

Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (plurality opinion).

They point to the prosecutor's closing comments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> saying he implied that Doyle was not convicted, after the prosecutor had not produced the conviction record and represented to the court there was no such conviction. They argue that this was a close case on the evidence and ultimately hinged on McCambridge's credibility, which they argue was deeply wounded by the prosecutor's comment. As support for this, they say that Doyle's blood alcohol level, subcutaneous bleeding, and the medical technician's testimony that Doyle was still warm indicate that Doyle was shot shortly before the crash; that the blood and tissue samples on the passenger side door and windshield indicate that McCambridge was in the passenger's seat at the time of the crash; that there was a cocked gun with the safety off in the van; and that the boxes of ammunition in the car indicate that both guns belonged to Doyle. They also argue that the state appellate court's reasoning that \"by convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about [the conviction] to Doyle,\" 690 N.E.2d at 475, is arbitrary and unsupported by the record, because the jury convicted McCambridge of driving offenses and therefore clearly did not credit his testimony as to how the fight began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth responds that, given the evidence presented to the jury, it was not unreasonable for the Massachusetts Appeals Court to conclude that, even if McCambridge had been able to corroborate his testimony with the conviction record and the prosecutor had not made his statement in closing, there was no \"reasonable probability that ... the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375. The result in this proceeding was that McCambridge was acquitted of first degree murder and convicted of manslaughter, so the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that the manslaughter verdict would have been different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To assess that question, we first turn to the state trial court's extensive jury instructions, which we quote in relevant part below. The trial judge explained the Commonwealth's burden to prove that McCambridge did not act in self-defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth must prove ... that one or more of the three requirements of self-defense was absent from this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... [T]hose three requirements are first that the defendant must have reasonably believed that he was being attacked or was immediately about to be attacked and that he was in immediate danger of being killed or seriously injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the defendant must have done everything that was reasonable under the circumstances to avoid physical combat before resorting to force and, third, that the defendant must have used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to protect himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She also gave thorough instructions on how to differentiate manslaughter upon provocation from self-defense and the role of excessive force:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manslaughter is an unlawful, intentional killing resulting from a sudden transport of the passions of fear, anger, fright, nervous excitement or heat of blood when there is no time to deliberate and when such passion or heat of blood is produced by adequate or reasonable provocation and without malice or upon sudden combat it would have been likely to produce in an ordinary person an abnormal state of mind and actually did produce such a state of mind in the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... The first element the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant inflicted an injury upon Mr. Doyle from which Mr. Doyle died; second, that the defendant injured Mr. Doyle as a result of sudden combat or in the heat of passion or using excessive force in self-defense; and, third, that the homicide was committed unlawfully without legal excuse or justification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provocation sufficient to reduce an unlawful killing from murder to manslaughter is that provocation which would likely produce in the ordinary person such a state of passion, anger, fear, fright, or nervous excitement as would eclipse a person's capacity for reflection or restraint and actually did produce such a state of mind in the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another factor or circumstance which mitigates or reduces murder to manslaughter is when a person kills using excessive force in self-defense.... Specifically, if the person initiated an assault against the defendant so that the defendant reasonably feared that he was in danger of being killed or suffering grievous bodily harm at the hands of Mr. Doyle, then the defendant has the initial right to use whatever means were reasonably necessary to avert the threatened harm. But, if the defendant used excessive force, that is, more force than was reasonable or proper under the circumstances of this case or the defendant, himself, became the attacker and the use of such force resulted in the death of his assailant, then that would constitute manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a few hours of deliberation, the jury asked for clarification on unlawful killing, malice aforethought, burden of proof, and reasonable doubt. The jury then asked for clarification on the definition of manslaughter. The judge re-read the manslaughter instructions that she had previously given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these instructions, the state appeals court reasonably concluded that the jury must have found that McCambridge was provoked in some way, resulting in a sudden heat of passion, leading to physical conflict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> That is what McCambridge himself said and the jury accepted his version. The only evidence presented at trial regarding any possible provocation for the altercation was McCambridge's testimony that Doyle threatened him with the nine millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson after McCambridge had called him a child abuser, and that a conflict ensued. Thus the jury accepted McCambridge's story about Doyle's anger at being called a child abuser. Nothing could be added to this by having the fact of the child neglect conviction established or admitted into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state court also reasonably concluded that the jury necessarily found that McCambridge, in his self defense, used at least excessive force against Doyle (or that McCambridge turned into the attacker). Neither the fact of Doyle's conviction, nor the contested excerpt from the prosecutor's closing argument, is material to whether McCambridge used excessive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence overwhelmingly supports the jury's conclusion. McCambridge shot Doyle twice, once in the face and once in the back. The fact that Doyle was shot in the back is itself evidence of excessive force. Before shooting the second shot, McCambridge had to cock the trigger of his gun again before firing. This was not an automatic weapon, and the trigger pull was very heavy. The forensic evidence was that Doyle had time to draw in at least a couple of breaths before the second shot, and McCambridge pulled back from an initial shooting distance of about six inches to a distance of about three feet for the second shot. There was also evidence that Doyle's head had been struck with a billy club, and a billy club with his blood-type on it was found. Even by McCambridge's account, the drunken Doyle was simultaneously attempting to drive the van down one of Boston's busiest highways, and so could not have been free to fully engage in the altercation. McCambridge himself said he had had at least some success in pushing Doyle's gun hand down and away, again supporting the conclusion that McCambridge used more force than was needed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge makes an independent argument based on the other verdict. We reject McCambridge's argument that because the jury convicted him of the motor vehicle charges, they necessarily rejected his testimony about the argument and how it developed, and so the conviction record would have made a difference. The Appeals Court could reasonably conclude, supported by the expert testimony, that the jury concluded that once McCambridge shot Doyle, he pushed Doyle toward the back of the van and attempted to drive from the passenger's seat or the driver's seat. Either act would suffice for the motor vehicle charges. <i>See Commonwealth v. Ginnetti,</i> 400 Mass. 181, 508 N.E.2d 603, 605 (1987) (holding that, under Massachusetts statute criminalizing operating a motor vehicle under the influence and reckless operation of a motor vehicle, \"a person ... operates a motor vehicle by starting its engine or by making use of the power provided by its engine\"). <i>See generally</i> J.

The state trial judge's instructions made it clear to the jury that an individual need not be seated in the driver's seat in order to be \"operating\" a vehicle within the meaning of the law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> And there was evidence that McCambridge was in the driver's seat and sat in that seat after it was soaked with Doyle's blood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The overall import of McCambridge's argument as to prejudice is that the prosecution's closing went to McCambridge's credibility, and that, in turn, impugned the verdict. For a number of reasons, we think that the state court's conclusion that this did not impugn the verdict is not an unreasonable application of clearly established law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What mattered for McCambridge's defense was not the truth of the fact of conviction itself, but rather the fact that the two had argued based on McCambridge's accusing Doyle of having abused a child, and the subsequent threat supposedly made by Doyle. McCambridge was allowed to testify as to this. McCambridge argues that the inevitable result was that he was discredited before the jury and even before his own attorney &#8212; he posits that his attorney emphasized manslaughter in his closing, rather than self defense, because of the appearance that McCambridge had lied about the conviction story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the analysis in stages. First, under Massachusetts law, the conviction record would not normally have been admissible, even as corroborative evidence. <i>See Commonwealth v. Todd,</i> 408 Mass. 724, 563 N.E.2d 211, 214 (1990) (holding that exclusion of victim's conviction record was not error in part because what was important for the defense was the defendant's belief, not the fact of the convictions); <i>Commonwealth v. Fontes,</i> 396 Mass. 733, 488 N.E.2d 760, 762 (1986) (holding that defendant may introduce specific instances of victim's violent conduct to support self-defense theory only if such instances are recent and known to defendant at the time of the homicide). Since the conviction was inadmissible, we are left with the prosecution's statement at closing. To the extent that the prosecutor attempted to imply that McCambridge was lying about the existence of a conviction in his closing argument, an objection could have been made, but was not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if admissible, proof of the existence of the conviction was not material to the question of use of excessive force in self defense. As counsel for McCambridge had just said in his closing, there was no evidence one way or the other as to the conviction and this was not the point anyway. As the district court pointed out, an accusation of child abuse or molestation may be even more likely to provoke violent rage if it is baseless. Thus, as defense counsel suggested, it was the accusation of child abuse, whether true or not, which enraged Doyle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the effect of the lack of evidence of a conviction and the prosecutor's statement was minimal given the wealth of evidence supporting the conviction. The contested statement in the closing argument comprises only one short paragraph in a sixteen-page transcript. The judge instructed the jury that nothing in the closing argument was to be considered as evidence. And there was other evidence, particularly physical evidence, that undercuts McCambridge's credibility as to his assertion that he did no more than act properly to defend himself &#8212; the blood evidence indicating that Doyle was shot at least five minutes before the van flipped; the fact that no witness reported gun flashes, although at least one witness watched for two minutes before the crash; the fact that Doyle had been shot more than once and most likely was also hit over the head with the bloodied billy club, which McCambridge could not explain; the fact that the weapon was found in McCambridge's clothes, apparently tucked in there after the shooting; the trooper's testimony that the van's driver smashed into the windshield and remained in the front area of the van; the evidence indicating that Doyle was thrown hard into the passenger side door and then out the bottom of that door, and was neither trapped in the driver's seat nor thrown into the windshield; the blood on the seat of McCambridge's jeans, most likely from the bloodied driver's seat cushion; and the fact that Doyle was already gray-blue when the troopers first saw him. The physical evidence, notably the blood patterns, was simply inconsistent with McCambridge's theory that the shootings occurred within thirty seconds. At most, the prosecutor's statement was another stab at the already damaged credibility of the defendant, who was most likely viewed as telling some, but not all, of the truth. Jurors need not believe everything a witness says, nor need they believe witnesses are not selective in recounting events. Daily life experience refutes any such belief. The physical evidence, too, might well cause a jury to disbelieve McCambridge's convenient statement that he recalled everything up to the point he fired the first shot in self-defense, and recalled nothing after that. None of the arguments advanced by McCambridge \"put[s] the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555. Much less do these arguments lead us to conclude that the state court's judgment that there was no due process violation was unreasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparing the facts here with other cases, it is not unreasonable to conclude the <i>Brady</i> materiality/prejudice standard is not met. In <i>United States v. Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), the defendant also claimed self-defense, and objected to the prosecution's failure to disclose the victim's criminal record. <i>Id.</i> at 100-01, 96 S.Ct. 2392. The Court held that the non-disclosure \"did not deprive [the defendant] of a fair trial as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" The Court noted approvingly the trial judge's emphasis on the \"incongruity\" of a self-defense claim with \"the evidence of [the victim's] multiple wounds and [the defendant's] unscathed condition\"; the fact that the criminal record would not have contradicted any evidence offered by the prosecutor; and that the conviction record would be cumulative of evidence that the victim was armed with a knife at the time of the crime. <i>Id.</i> at 113-14, 96 S.Ct. 2392. Moreover, in <i>Agurs,</i> the trial court and appellate court had assumed the conviction record would be admissible, <i>id.</i> at 100-02 &amp; n. 3, 96 S.Ct. 2392, while in this case it was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Dumas,</i> this court considered a case in which the defendant claimed that he had been entrapped into a drug charge by his prison cellmate, and the prosecution failed to disclose evidence indicating that the cellmate had been put on suicide watch, and evidence that would corroborate the defendant's testimony as to how long the two had shared a cell. 207 F.3d 11, 13-15 (1st Cir.2000). Although the defense hinged on the defendant's credibility, we found that neither the corroborative nor the impeachment evidence was material for <i>Brady</i> purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 16-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court's decision in <i>United States v. Udechukwu,</i> 11 F.3d 1101 (1st Cir.1993), does not assist McCambridge, much less does it show that the state court's decision was an unreasonable application of federal constitutional law. In <i>Udechukwu,</i> the government, over objection, withheld evidence about a known drug trafficker, evidence that was favorable to the defendant. In closing, the prosecution questioned the existence of the trafficker when the prosecution knew that he existed. <i>Id.</i> at 1102-05. The court did not reach the question of whether there was reversible error in the government's failure to disclose. Rather, the court found a fatal taint from the prosecutor's \"persistent theme in closing argument suggesting the nonexistence of this information &#8212; and even the opposite of what the government knew.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1105. Here, in contrast, the prosecutor's closing had one line on this point; it was far from a persistent theme in a closing comprising sixteen pages of transcript. Here, the underlying information was not admissible. Here, in contrast to <i>Udechukwu,</i> there was no objection made to the prosecution's closing argument. And here it is far less clear that the failure involved government misconduct; rather, it was sloppiness. The prosecutor here had an incomplete report on which he relied. The prosecutor did not knowingly misrepresent to the jury. <i>Udechukwu</i> does not support McCambridge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On habeas review, McCambridge faces a double hurdle &#8212; showing both that there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different conclusion if it had the conviction record or if the prosecutor had not made the statement in the closing, and that the state appeals court determination on this point was unreasonable. Given the evidence here, he cannot clear either hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for writ of habeas corpus is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> He testified that it also could have been caused by attempts to resuscitate Doyle, but none of the witnesses recalled any attempts at resuscitation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Prior to trial, McCambridge, proceeding pro se, had unsuccessfully requested Doyle's \"rap sheet\" by means of a hand-written letter to the prosecutor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The now-withdrawn panel opinion of this court assumed that there had been a typographical error and that the transcript omitted the word \"no\" between \"absolutely\" and \"evidence.\" But the transcript sentence and the flow of the argument make perfect sense as stated. The prosecutor may well have meant that there was evidence of the conviction, or of the prior conversation, but no evidence of the alleged confrontation the night of Doyle's death. This was the transcript that the state court had and McCambridge's brief before the Massachusetts Appeals Court cited the passage as it appeared in the transcript, with no modifications. If there was an error in the transcript which worked against the defendant, under state law he should have sought to correct the transcript. Mass. R.App. Pro. 8(e). The first suggestion that a word was omitted from the transcript appears to be in the brief that the Commonwealth submitted before the panel of this court. Our holding here does not turn on whether or not the word \"no\" should have been included, and so we do not need to decide the point</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The court reversed the firearms conviction, agreeing that the judge should have instructed the jury on a necessity defense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This court invited the Federal Defender's Office to file an amicus brief in support of McCambridge and we thank the Office for its assistance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> For present purposes, we do not pass on the Commonwealth's arguments that McCambridge never objected to the prosecution's closing argument, or raised this as an independent issue in the state appeals court, and so has waived the issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Under our analysis, it matters not whether the jury thought this was manslaughter due to a heat of passion or to sudden combat. The defense did not differentiate (nor do the facts lend themselves to such differentiation) &#8212; the defense's essential argument was that McCambridge did kill Doyle but he did it in self-defense when Doyle reached for the gun during their altercation and McCambridge's response was not excessive. This brings the excessive force question into play</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The instructions were as follows:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A person operates a motor vehicle not only while doing all of the well-known and easily recognized things that drivers do as they travel along a street or highway but also in doing any acts which directly tend to set the vehicle in motion.

McCambridge's counsel could have requested this remedy even without the conviction record, since the court had already indicated that the question was McCambridge's state of mind. Of course, if the prosecutor had produced the conviction record as requested by McCambridge, he probably would not have ventured to accuse McCambridge of lying on this point, if that, contrary to how the trial transcript reads, is what he did</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the conviction, had it been available, might have undercut the defense, or at least it could be reasonably thought to do so.

Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). First, it ruled that McCambridge failed to object, as required, when the prosecutor refused to disclose the requested exculpatory evidence; namely, evidence of Doyle's conviction for child abuse. Second, the appeals court ruled that McCambridge could show no prejudice resulting from the prosecutor's wrongful suppression of that evidence. As a member of the panel that first reviewed this case, I concluded that the first ruling of the appeals court was contrary to clearly established federal law, and its second ruling constituted an unreasonable application of federal law. Despite the en banc proceedings and the thoughtful majority opinion, I continue to hold those views. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Nondisclosure of <i>Brady</i> Material</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court held as follows in <i>Brady v. Maryland:</i> \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused ... violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\" 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The favorable evidence at issue here is the criminal record of the victim, Doyle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> McCambridge testified at trial that Doyle had become violent when McCambridge called Doyle a derogatory name that referred to Doyle's conviction for child abuse. McCambridge also described an incident a few months prior to their automobile accident when he asked Doyle whether he had been convicted of child abuse and Doyle threatened to kill McCambridge if he were ever to mention the topic again. Therefore, Doyle's criminal conviction related to McCambridge's theory of self-defense because it provided an explanation for why Doyle might have become violent in the van. Additionally, McCambridge's testimony regarding Doyle's earlier threat afforded a significant evidentiary basis for the jury to assess McCambridge's state of mind at the time of the shooting in determining whether McCambridge had been in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In charging an unlawful killing, the Commonwealth assumed the burden of proving that McCambridge did not act in self-defense. <i>See Commonwealth v. Reed,</i> 427 Mass. 100, 691 N.E.2d 560, 563 (1998). The jury might not have found McCambridge guilty of any wrongful killing if it could not reject, beyond a reasonable doubt, McCambridge's testimony that he reasonably perceived that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm. McCambridge's credibility on this self-defense claim and his perception of Doyle's alleged actions in the van and his earlier threat were thus potentially determinative of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doyle had, in fact, been convicted of and imprisoned for child neglect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Yet, during trial, the prosecutor represented, both to defense counsel and the trial judge, that there was no such conviction on Doyle's official record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

There were three discussions at the bench. The first sidebar took place on the third day of the trial when Doyle's brother was testifying for the Commonwealth. Defense counsel informed the court and the prosecutor that McCambridge's testimony regarding the altercation in the van would refer to his understanding that Doyle had been convicted of child abuse. Defense counsel stated that he saw no reason to question Doyle's brother about the decedent's conviction unless the prosecutor intended to take the position that McCambridge was lying. The prosecutor responded that he had not yet decided whether he would challenge McCambridge's veracity regarding Doyle's conviction. Due to the prosecutor's ambivalence in this respect, the defense was unable to resolve, at this point, whether to question Doyle's brother about the conviction. Therefore, the court ordered that the witness be held over for possible later questioning by the defense. During this initial sidebar, the prosecutor was put on notice that the record of Doyle's conviction tended to exculpate McCambridge by corroborating McCambridge's anticipated testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second sidebar on the issue of Doyle's conviction occurred during defense counsel's direct examination of McCambridge. The prosecutor objected, on hearsay grounds, to McCambridge's reference to the conviction when he described the threat allegedly made by Doyle a month before the killing. The court overruled the prosecutor's objection on the ground that the testimony was not being offered for the truth of the conviction, but rather to establish McCambridge's state of mind with respect to his fear of being killed by Doyle. The prosecutor replied that he thought the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its probative value. The following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Do we have a conviction on this charge?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEFENSE: Do I have a certified copy of the conviction?

However, he also voiced concern that the prosecutor would use the absence of evidence confirming the conviction to cast doubt upon McCambridge's credibility. In addition, defense counsel directly asked the prosecutor for Doyle's record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During these sidebar discussions, the prosecutor made two kinds of statements about Doyle's criminal record. First, the prosecutor made qualified statements that Doyle had no criminal record by saying, \"as far as I know.\" However, at other moments, the prosecutor more definitively denied that Doyle had been convicted by answering the court's questions with a simple \"No, no\" or saying, \"I know he hasn't [been convicted] from the records that I've seen.\" Doyle's criminal record was in the Criminal Offender Record Information System (CORI) of Massachusetts. A person's CORI report lists his or her court appearances and convictions, if any.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> The Commonwealth has represented that at trial the prosecutor had only the first page of Doyle's three-page CORI report; the relevant conviction appears on the second page.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> The Commonwealth argues that it did not violate the requirements of <i>Brady</i> for three reasons. First, it says that the prosecutor disclosed all the information he had about Doyle's criminal record because the incomplete CORI print-out did not indicate that Doyle had ever been convicted of child abuse. Second, the Commonwealth contends that McCambridge should have been more diligent in requesting that the record be produced. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that McCambridge was required to object to the prosecutor's non-disclosure of Doyle's criminal record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p>1. Evidence in the possession of the government</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under well-settled law, a prosecutor's duty to disclose exculpatory evidence extends beyond his or her personal knowledge of such evidence. <i>See Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (describing the prosecutor's duty \"to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case\"). This duty exists because the prosecutor is the representative of the government in proceeding against a defendant in a criminal case. <i>See Giglio v. United States,</i> 405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (\"The prosecutor's office is ... the spokesman for the Government.\"). Therefore, a state prosecutor may be held accountable, in appropriate circumstances, for the nondisclosure of <i>Brady</i> material in the possession of a state agency without regard to the prosecutor's personal knowledge of the existence of that material. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 282, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (discussing nondisclosure of <i>Brady</i> material \"known to the Commonwealth\" but apparently not to the prosecutor); <i>United States v. Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. 97, 111, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the above cited cases involved evidence known to the police, their logic applies to the present case as well, since Doyle's criminal record was in the CORI database maintained by the Commonwealth. The prosecutor requested Doyle's criminal record from the Board, an agency established to coordinate the exchange of information among law enforcement personnel, including prosecutors and police officers. Based on the information he received from the Board, the prosecutor made inaccurate representations to the court and to the defense that Doyle had no criminal record. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth is responsible for the nondisclosure regardless of the prosecutor's actual personal knowledge. <i>See Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 437-38, 115 S.Ct. 1555 (holding that a prosecutor's ignorance of exculpatory evidence not produced by a state agency does not insulate the government from responsibility for a <i>Brady</i> violation). Accordingly, the prosecutor's statement that Doyle had no criminal record \"as far as I know\" does not relieve the Commonwealth of its obligations under <i>Brady</i> and its progeny because the prosecutor's personal awareness of Doyle's conviction is irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p>2. Defense obligation to request exculpatory evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argues that defense counsel should have filed a formal discovery request for Doyle's criminal record. There is no legal support for this contention. <i>Brady</i> obligations apply independently of any request by the defense. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (\"[T]he duty to disclose [exculpatory] evidence is applicable even though there has been no request by the accused.\") (citing <i>Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. at 107, 96 S.Ct. 2392). The prosecutor in this case was on notice from the time of the first sidebar conference that evidence substantiating McCambridge's claim that Doyle had a criminal record would be favorable to McCambridge's theory of self-defense. There was no need for McCambridge to request that evidence specifically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth also asserts that it was not obligated to disclose evidence of Doyle's conviction because the defense could have found that evidence through a reasonably diligent investigation. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 162 F.3d 135, 147 (1st Cir.1998) (\"The government has no <i>Brady</i> burden when the necessary facts... are readily available to a diligent defender.\"). However, as noted, McCambridge could not access the CORI database without a court order. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &#167; 172. Moreover, the Commonwealth's argument about the ready availability of evidence misses the point in an important way. This was not a case where the defense simply refused to look for evidence it knew existed and relied on the prosecution to disclose that evidence. Rather, the prosecutor misrepresented, to both defense counsel and the court, that the exculpatory evidence did not exist. Defense counsel was entitled to rely on that representation. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 283 n. 23, 119 S.Ct. 1936. Under these circumstances, McCambridge was not obligated to inquire further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argued before the panel that the prosecutor's statements that Doyle had no criminal record \"as far as I know\" should have alerted defense counsel to the possibility that such a record did exist but was simply not personally known to the prosecutor. Because the prosecutor expressed this uncertainty, the Commonwealth asserted, McCambridge and his counsel should have been more diligent in confirming whether the prosecutor's qualified statements were, in fact, true. The Commonwealth cites no authority for this argument, and I have found none. Under well-settled law, as I have explained, <i>Brady</i> obligations apply to a prosecutor's conduct even when the defense has not sought discovery of the exculpatory evidence. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936; <i>Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. at 107, 96 S.Ct. 2392. Moreover, McCambridge's counsel reasonably relied upon the prosecutor's representations that Doyle had never been convicted, <i>see Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 283 n. 23, 119 S.Ct. 1936, and because the prosecutor was acting in his capacity as representative for the government, <i>see Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, defense counsel was also reasonable in concluding that the prosecutor's denials indicated that such evidence of a conviction did not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p>3. Requirement to object to the nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Commonwealth argues that McCambridge was required to object to the prosecutor's inaccurate representation about Doyle's record, despite <i>Strickler</i>'s holding that \"defense counsel may reasonably rely\" on a prosecutor's representation that she has complied fully with <i>Brady, Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 283 n. 23, thus rendering unnecessary an objection to the nondisclosure of that evidence. In <i>Strickler,</i> the prosecutor maintained an \"open file\" policy, meaning that \"his entire prosecution file was made available to the defense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 283 n. 22, 119 S.Ct. 1936. While it is not clear from the record whether the Commonwealth maintained an open file policy in this case, the prosecutor's statements to defense counsel and to the court that Doyle had no criminal record constitute essentially the same representation at issue in <i>Strickler:</i> that the prosecution had fulfilled its constitutional duty under <i>Brady.</i> Under such circumstances, defense counsel is not required to object. Indeed, the Supreme Court rejected such a requirement in <i>Strickler:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The presumption, well established by tradition and experience, that prosecutors have fully discharged their official duties, is inconsistent with the novel suggestion that conscientious defense counsel have a procedural obligation to assert constitutional error on the basis of mere suspicion that some prosecutorial misstep may have occurred.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 286-87, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth has argued, again, that the prosecutor's occasional use of the words \"as far as I know\" excuses its failure to disclose the exculpatory evidence because such equivocal language should have indicated to the defense that a specific objection to the nondisclosure was necessary. This argument is unpersuasive for the same reasons it was unpersuasive in the context of McCambridge's failure to pursue a more thorough investigation of Doyle's criminal record: the Commonwealth cannot escape its <i>Brady</i> obligations by qualifying its nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence and then shifting its disclosure burden to defense counsel. Moreover, the potential mischief invited by the Commonwealth's argument provides strong reason for rejecting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The State Court Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge argued to the Massachusetts Appeals Court that the prosecution did not fulfill its disclosure obligations under <i>Brady.</i> For example, he stated in his opening brief:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suppression of material evidence favorable to the accused and requested by him violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 87 [83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215] (1963). In the case at bar, because the trial court refused to require the Commonwealth to produce Doyle's criminal record, the defendant cannot prove that exculpatory evidence was withheld. The defendant did everything he could to preserve this issue. Compare this case with <i>Commonwealth v. O'Brien,</i> 419 Mass. 470, 477 [645 N.E.2d 1170] (1995). Thus, this Court should order the Commonwealth to produce Doyle's criminal record so that an appellate decision can be made. In the alternative, the case should be remanded to the Superior Court for production of the document at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Doyle had a criminal record as described by the defendant at trial, then the withholding of that information and the misleading of the defense was intentional and prejudicial. <i>See Commonwealth v. Tucceri,</i> 412 Mass. 401 [589 N.E.2d 1216] (1992). A new trial would be required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this passage from McCambridge's brief reveals, he articulated a claim under <i>Brady,</i> with appropriate citations, and argued that the prosecutor's nondisclosure of Doyle's record &#8212; if the record indeed existed &#8212; prejudiced him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution finally disclosed Doyle's criminal record after McCambridge filed his brief to the appeals court. Following the Commonwealth's belated disclosure, McCambridge refined his <i>Brady</i> argument in his reply brief:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667 [105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481] (1985), the Supreme Court recognized that an incomplete response to a specific request for disclosure not only deprives the defense of the specific evidence, but also suggests to the defense that such evidence does not exist. The defense's reliance on such a misleading representation can result in important changes in trial strategy. In the case at bar, the defendant was specifically misinformed about Doyle's criminal record. The defendant then gave up his strategy of attempting to elicit information about that record from Doyle's brother or the Clerk of the Norfolk Superior Court. The prosecutor fully exploited his misrepresentation in closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state constitutional and/or common law standard for a <i>Brady</i> violation does consider the issue of bad faith. <i>See, Commonwealth v. Tucceri,</i> 412 Mass. 401 [589 N.E.2d 1216] (1992). Where bad faith has been demonstrated, and the withheld evidence might have affected the outcome of the trial, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. In the absence of bad faith, a new trial is necessary if the withheld evidence would have been a real factor in the jury's deliberation. In the case at bar, the defendant's truthfulness about the circumstances of his confrontation with Doyle was the central issue in the case. The blocking of the Commonwealth's claim, that the so-called argument about Doyle's child abuse record was only the defendant's attempt to assassinate Doyle's reputation, would have been a real factor in the jury's deliberation, and probably would have tipped the scales in favor of the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, McCambridge identified the proper legal authority for his <i>Brady</i> claim and explained why he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's failure to fulfill his disclosure obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge's <i>Brady</i> claim was thus fully presented to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. In its opinion affirming McCambridge's conviction and sentence, the appeals court addressed the issue of Doyle's record only briefly: \"While the defendant pressed for the introduction of the victim's criminal record at trial, he did not object when the judge did not order its production or request that the record be marked for identification. He cannot now be heard to complain that the judge failed to do so at the sentencing stage.\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 690 N.E.2d at 475. The court did not seem to recognize the <i>Brady</i> implications of Doyle's criminal record &#8212; despite McCambridge's argument on the issue in both his opening and reply briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the new standard for federal habeas review, we must examine the state court determination of McCambridge's <i>Brady</i> claim to determine whether it is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1). The Supreme Court has said the following with respect to the \"contrary to\" prong of &#167; 2254(d)(1):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The text of &#167; 2254(d)(1) therefore suggests that the state court's decision must be substantially different from the relevant precedent of this Court.... A state-court decision will certainly be contrary to our clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases.... A state-court decision will also be contrary to this Court's clearly established precedent if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The Massachusetts Appeals Court did not explicitly identify a legal rule in finding that McCambridge could not \"now be heard to complain\" about the nonproduction of Doyle's record because he did not object when the trial court judge failed to order its production. <i>McCambridge,</i> 690 N.E.2d at 475. However, implicit in this reasoning is a legal rule that would require a criminal defendant to object to the prosecution's nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence where the prosecution has represented that such evidence does not exist. <i>Strickler,</i> however, held that defense counsel is not required to object to the nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence where the prosecutor has represented that she has discharged fully her <i>Brady</i> obligations. <i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936. Accordingly, the opinion of the Massachusetts Appeals Court denying McCambridge's <i>Brady</i> claim, in part, because he failed to object at trial is contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Adequate and Independent State Ground</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth further maintains that our review of McCambridge's habeas petition is precluded because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the state appeals court decision. Federal courts \"will not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\" <i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> 501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). Noncompliance with a state procedural rule may preclude federal review: \"The [adequate and independent state ground] doctrine applies to bar federal habeas when a state court declined to address a prisoner's federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement. In these cases, the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 729-30, 111 S.Ct. 2546. In this case, the Commonwealth contends that the appeals court's reliance on the Massachusetts rule requiring contemporaneous objections provides such an adequate and independent state ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have already indicated that I would reject the Commonwealth's argument that McCambridge had an obligation to object to the government's failure to disclose <i>Brady</i> material. As I have explained, there is no such obligation under federal law. Indeed, the Commonwealth has not identified any authority supporting its assertion that McCambridge was required to object. My own review of Massachusetts caselaw has unearthed no case &#8212; except for the decision of the appeals court in this case &#8212; requiring an objection to the inaccurate representation by a prosecutor that exculpatory evidence sought by the defense has been disclosed. <i>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hill,</i> 432 Mass. 704, 739 N.E.2d 670 (2000); <i>Commonwealth v. Tucceri,</i> 412 Mass. 401, 589 N.E.2d 1216, 1224 (1992). For a state procedural rule to constitute an adequate and independent state ground barring federal habeas review, that rule must be consistently enforced in the state courts. <i>See Moore v. Ponte,</i> 186 F.3d 26, 32-33 (1st Cir.1999). Even if a Massachusetts procedural rule requiring an objection to the nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence had been consistently enforced, such a rule would be unconstitutional under <i>Strickler.</i> Accordingly, there is no adequate and independent state ground supporting the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court that precludes our review of McCambridge's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Prejudice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion that the ruling by the appeals court requiring an objection to the prosecutor's nondisclosure is contrary to clearly established federal law does not end the <i>Brady</i> inquiry. <i>Brady</i> established both a rule of conduct &#8212; that prosecutors must disclose exculpatory evidence in the possession and control of the government &#8212; and a standard of prejudice that petitioners must meet in order to obtain relief for a prosecutor's failure to comply with that rule. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (noting elements of a <i>Brady</i> claim). Accordingly, it is also necessary to assess whether the appeals court erred in its determination of prejudice under <i>Brady,</i> and if so, whether that erroneous determination constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on his <i>Brady</i> claim, McCambridge must show that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's failure to disclose the evidence of Doyle's criminal record. More specifically, he must demonstrate \"a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). \"A `reasonable probability' is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" <i>Id.</i> \"The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\" <i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 289-90, 119 S.Ct. 1936. <i>See also United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 152 (1st Cir.2000). That there was sufficient evidence on which to convict McCambridge does not establish that his trial was fair. <i>See Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems improbable that, standing by itself, McCambridge's inability to corroborate his testimony through the introduction of Doyle's conviction would have had an effect on the jury's verdict. However, as McCambridge has argued consistently, the prosecutor's summation, exploiting his misleading disclosure about Doyle's conviction, seriously prejudiced his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after the third sidebar, the defense rested and the parties made their closing arguments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> the pertinent parts of which follow:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DEFENSE:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, I want to talk about one other thing that's not evidence in this case. Mr. McCambridge told you on the stand the reason that he and Mr. Doyle got into the fight, besides that they were both drinking and probably neither one thinking with great clarity, there had been an incident a couple of months previously where Mr. McCambridge says he had been told something about Mr. Doyle and confronted him with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Judge admitted that evidence as evidence of Mr. McCambridge's state of mind; in other words, it's not evidence that Mr. Doyle ever did anything.</i> There is no evidence in this case that Mr. Doyle ever molested or abused any child.... There is also no evidence in this case that he did it. There is simply no evidence in this case one way or the other. You don't know as you sit here whether what transpired, what Mr. McCambridge says transpired between the two of them, has any backing in reality or not. There is no evidence. There is no evidence that he did it. There is no evidence that he didn't do it. It was admitted for a different purpose, which was the state of mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, you have to decide whether or not something like that could cause that explosion in the car, that eruption of bad blood when people had been drinking. Mr. McCambridge told you that he made some comment to this person that enraged him, and he had been threatened before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">PROSECUTION:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does the defendant have something for you to believe when he gets up there and says, oh, yeah, I had an argument with Richard Doyle because of child molestation? There is absolutely evidence of that.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> Was that put in there to tell you what his frame of mind was? No. <i>That was his third shot at the victim from the stand, assassinating his reputation with no evidence. That's what that was for, I suggest to you, not to show state of mind.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In compliance with the ruling of the judge, the defense argued in its summation that whether or not Doyle had in fact been convicted of child abuse was not at issue in the case, the testimony about Doyle's conviction having been admitted only to establish McCambridge's state of mind. In marked contrast, the prosecutor ignored the court's ruling, as well as his representation that he would abide by that ruling, and used the absence of the exculpatory evidence he had failed to produce to impugn McCambridge's credibility. For reasons that are not clear from the record, defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor's closing argument. Normally, such an omission by defense counsel would warrant requiring McCambridge to show cause for his failure to object and prejudice from the prosecutor's closing argument. However, I conclude that the Commonwealth failed to raise the issue of McCambridge's procedural default below and has thus waived that argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Waiver of Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts has a \"routinely enforced, consistently applied contemporaneous objection rule\" regarding improper closing argument. <i>Burks v. Dubois,</i> 55 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir.1995). Absent a timely objection, Massachusetts courts will not review appellate claims of improper summation unless cause and prejudice are demonstrated, except to ensure that a miscarriage of justice does not occur. <i>See Commonwealth v. State,</i> 433 Mass. 19, 739 N.E.2d 261, 268 (2000). When the Massachusetts courts apply the procedural default rule, federal review of an improper summation claim is similarly foreclosed because failure to observe state procedural rules can constitute an adequate and independent ground for the state court decision. <i>Palmariello v. Superintendent of M.C.I. Norfolk,</i> 873 F.2d 491, 493 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth did not argue in the federal district court that McCambridge procedurally defaulted by not objecting to the prosecutor's closing argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a> Indeed, even after receiving three extensions of time to file a brief in the federal district court, the Commonwealth failed to file a timely brief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> \"[T]his circuit religiously follows the rule that issues not presented to the district court cannot be raised on appeal.\" <i>Ouimette v.

In this case, the Commonwealth did not argue procedural default in any state proceedings. \"[P]rocedural default is normally a defense that the State is obligated to raise and preserve if it is not to lose the right to assert the defense thereafter.\" <i>Trest,</i> 522 U.S. at 89, 118 S.Ct. 478 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Commonwealth v. LaBriola,</i> 430 Mass. 569, 722 N.E.2d 13, 14 n. 1 (2000). We should enforce that rule here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. State Court Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next I examine the opinion of the Massachusetts Appeals Court to determine whether its conclusion that McCambridge was not prejudiced by the nondisclosure of the exculpatory evidence is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1). On the prejudice issue, the appeals court said the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, assuming without deciding that the prosecutor should have produced the victim's record, there was no prejudice to the defendant because he was aware of the victim's record and was prepared to offer such evidence at trial. Moreover, by convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about this offense to Doyle. <i>See Commonwealth v. Tucceri,</i> 412 Mass. 401, 412-414, 589 N.E.2d 1216 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I accept the majority's conclusion that the Massachusetts Appeals Court applied a standard of prejudice that is consistent with <i>Brady,</i> and that its decision was thus not contrary to federal law. However, I would hold that the state court's conclusion on prejudice is an unreasonable application of the <i>Brady</i> prejudice standard. To explain, I describe the evidence presented at McCambridge's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution alleged at trial that McCambridge shot and killed Doyle shortly after the two men left a bar in Cambridge at 1 a.m., and that McCambridge was driving, with Doyle's body in the back of the van, when a state trooper tried to stop the van. The prosecution further alleged that the van crashed when McCambridge reached for a gun with which he intended to shoot the police officer attempting to apprehend him. However, the evidence the Commonwealth presented at trial to prove this theory was conflicting and inconclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Time of death</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctor who performed the autopsy on Doyle testified that Doyle had last consumed alcohol approximately one and one-half hours before his death. It is undisputed that Doyle and McCambridge left the bar when it closed at 1 a.m. and that the accident occurred at about 2 a.m. Thus, if credited by the jury, the doctor's uncontradicted opinion tended to diminish any possibility that Doyle's death occurred much before the crash occurred, let alone just after the two men left the bar at 1 a.m. Another prosecution witness, an EMT who responded to the accident, testified that Doyle's skin was still warm when his body was found pinned beneath the van, thus tending to establish that Doyle died not long before the accident, particularly in light of the uncontradicted testimony that it was cold that night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The weapons</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence was also inconclusive with respect to McCambridge's ownership of and possession of a gun. The prosecution tried and failed to establish that McCambridge was carrying a gun in the waistband of his pants before he was in the van. The bartender testified that McCambridge became angry when the bartender started to close up the bar. He said that McCambridge stood up and brushed up against him, chest to chest, while pushing his coat back. When asked by the prosecutor whether he saw McCambridge \"reach for anything,\" the bartender said no. The bartender also testified that McCambridge did not seem to be angry with Doyle when the two men left the bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A firearms officer testified that McCambridge shot Doyle twice with a derringer. When emergency personnel were removing McCambridge's jacket after the accident, the derringer fell to the floor of the ambulance. However, the firearms officer did not trace the derringer to establish who owned it. Nor did he attempt to identify the owner of the 9 mm. pistol with which Doyle allegedly had threatened McCambridge. Another Massachusetts police officer testified that a box of ammunition fitting one of the two guns was found in the van. However, the box of ammunition, labeled \"Big Al's Gun Shop,\" was never introduced into evidence and the police officer had no other information about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Location of the bodies</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to bolster its theory that McCambridge had killed Doyle up to an hour before the accident, the prosecution attempted to establish that McCambridge was driving when the van crashed. Forensic witnesses testified that blood on the seat of McCambridge's pants was consistent with Doyle's blood, supporting an inference that McCambridge sat in the driver's seat at some point. However, there was also evidence that there was not enough blood on his pants to suggest that he sat there for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was other conflicting evidence about the probable location of McCambridge's body and Doyle's body at the time of the accident. A prosecution witness testified that: (1) the passenger-side window was broken; (2) glass from the passenger-side window was found on McCambridge's collar and under his jacket but none was found on Doyle; and (3) if someone had been sitting in the passenger seat at the time of impact, he would have been thrown to the right into the windshield or the passenger-door window. The prosecution offered no explanation as to how or why, under its theory of the case, McCambridge might have been in the passenger seat at the time of the impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense tried to show that it was not clear where the two bodies had been located prior to the crash and roll-over. The defense accident reconstructionist testified that the driver of the van could have been thrown between the bucket seats and out of the side door when the van was lifted into the air. The evidence was undisputed that after the accident the sliding door on the passenger side of the van was off its bottom hinges. The witnesses were in agreement that Doyle had been thrown from the car through this doorway. Because the fabric of Doyle's sweater had actually fused to the van, one investigator testified that Doyle's ejection must have been the result of a major impact that generated the heat necessary to accomplish the fusion. This evidence indicated that Doyle could have been driving at the time of the crash, and did not establish whether Doyle, if he had not been driving, was placed in the back of the van by McCambridge prior to the accident or was thrown there upon impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police officers, emergency medical personnel and civilians agreed that McCambridge was found wedged in the driver's seat area. Yet blood and hair sample tests established, without contradiction, that McCambridge's head hit the passenger side of the windshield during the crash. Uncontradicted testimony also established that McCambridge had a gash in his head and was covered with blood when he was found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. The police investigation and handling of evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were other questions left unanswered by the investigators. The accident reconstructionist for the state police had no photographs of the tire marks on the road and could not explain the absence of such important and apparently routine evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a> He also admitted during cross-examination that he had made mistakes in drawing the accident scene; he was unsure what one line was intended to indicate and a second line purporting to represent the track of one tire in fact traced the track of a different tire. Like the forensic chemist, he became confused regarding the physical principles governing the direction the bodies would have moved when the van hit the barrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another state investigator failed to document where things were located before they were removed from the van by the police. She was unaware of any inventory that might have been made of the \"heaps of stuff\" that had been in the van, which included trash bags, clothing, newspapers and debris. She also stated that the nine millimeter gun, which was loaded and cocked and allegedly used to threaten McCambridge, was found under a great deal of debris. Although the prosecution alleged that the van was weaving because McCambridge was reaching for this same gun in order to shoot the trooper who was trying to pull him over, there was no testimony as to whether the debris would have been on top of the gun before the crash or whether the gun itself would have moved during the crash. Moreover, the investigator could not say whether bloodstains of Doyle's blood type found in the back of the van were recent or even whether they had been made by the police as they removed items from the van. Some of the items that had fallen onto the road during the crash had been thrown back into the van before it was towed away, thus risking contamination and making it harder yet to reconstruct the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">e. Self-Defense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his self-defense claim, McCambridge testified that Doyle became aggressive after McCambridge called him a name referring to his conviction for child abuse. He also stated that he remembered nothing after the first shot he fired at Doyle until three to four days later when he was in the hospital. However, a medical expert, called by the defense, explained that a person might become more aggressive after receiving the type of wound Doyle received when hit by the first bullet. Dismissing McCambridge's amnesia as \"convenient,\" the prosecutor called no medical experts to challenge the inference that such a memory loss could be attributed both to shock and to the serious head wound McCambridge sustained in the accident. Other than McCambridge's own testimony, the record is devoid of evidence bearing on whether McCambridge was in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury or death when he shot Doyle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The verdict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury began deliberating at approximately 1:30 p.m. and returned its verdict the afternoon of the following day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> At the end of the first day of its deliberations, the jury requested clarification on (1) unlawful killing, (2) malice aforethought, (3) burden of proof, and (4) reasonable doubt. The following day, the jury asked the trial judge to clarify the elements of the manslaughter charge. That afternoon, the jury returned a verdict finding McCambridge guilty of the crime of manslaughter, unlawful possession of a firearm, operating under the influence, and operating to endanger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In returning a verdict of manslaughter, the jury rejected the prosecutor's theory that McCambridge acted with either premeditation or malice aforethought. Its rejection of the murder charge left the jury with only two options on the charge of unlawful killing: manslaughter or acquittal. The prosecutor's insinuation that McCambridge fabricated his testimony about Doyle's conviction to besmirch Doyle's reputation was the last thing the jury heard from either counsel. This improper undermining of McCambridge's credibility on the determinative question of self-defense, and perhaps of his credibility in general, may well have tipped the balance in favor of a manslaughter conviction. Thus, I conclude that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of McCambridge's trial would have been different if the existence of Doyle's conviction had been disclosed and the prosecutor had not suggested in closing argument that McCambridge was fabricating Doyle's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority disagrees with this prejudice analysis. To convict McCambridge of manslaughter, the majority reasons, \"the jury must have found that [he] was provoked in some way, resulting in a sudden heat of passion.\" The majority observes that \"[t]he only evidence presented at trial regarding any possible provocation for the altercation was McCambridge's testimony that Doyle threatened him with the nine millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson after McCambridge had called him a child abuser and that a conflict ensued.\" Thus, for the majority, \"the jury necessarily found that McCambridge, in his self defense, used at least excessive force against Doyle (or ... turned into the attacker).\" The majority concludes that \"the jury accepted McCambridge's story about Doyle's anger at being called a child abuser. Nothing could be added to this by having the fact of the child neglect conviction established or admitted into evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, this reasoning is unduly speculative. It assumes that if the jury convicted McCambridge of manslaughter, it must have believed his account of how the altercation with Doyle began. However, as the amicus explains:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could have disbelieved petitioner almost entirely, thus rejecting his self-defense testimony, and still found him guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. There was evidence outside petitioner's testimony that a struggle was occurring inside the van while driving on the highway shortly before the accident. Drivers saw the van rocking back and forth on the highway, and forensic evidence indicated that Doyle was shot shortly before the crash. There was independent evidence supporting petitioner's testimony that Doyle had pointed a cocked gun at him. There was also evidence that both petitioner and Doyle had been drinking. The court instructed the jury that it could find manslaughter if it found that petitioner had killed Doyle \"upon sudden combat.\" The court also instructed that what \"distinguished murder from manslaughter was the absence of malice aforethought.\" The jury could simply have concluded that the government failed to prove its case on the critical issue of intent given the paucity of the evidence supporting its theory of how and when petitioner killed Doyle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the jury could have found that the circumstantial evidence supported the conclusion that McCambridge killed Doyle upon sudden combat or in the heat of passion &#8212; for whatever reason &#8212; but that it was not sufficient to establish malice aforethought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> There is simply no basis for concluding that the jury must have believed McCambridge's account of what sparked the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the majority opinion convincing when it declares that \"[n]either the fact of Doyle's conviction, nor the contested excerpt from the prosecutor's closing argument, is material to whether McCambridge used excessive force.\" This argument assumes that the jury found that McCambridge acted in self-defense but with excessive force. Yet, again, the jury could have disbelieved his self-defense claim, but convicted him of manslaughter because the circumstantial evidence supported a finding of \"sudden combat\" (but failed to establish malice aforethought). If the jury had believed McCambridge's story about the origins of the altercation, it could have found that he acted in self-defense without excessive force, and thereby was entitled to an acquittal. It is simply wrong to say that the jury <i>must have</i> found that McCambridge used excessive force in self defense, when we do not know if the jury accepted his claim that he acted in self-defense in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority is also inconsistent in its assessment of the effect on McCambridge's credibility of the prosecutor's references in closing argument to McCambridge's unsupported claim about Doyle's conviction for child abuse. On the one hand, the majority asserts that \"[a]t most the prosecutor's statement was another stab at the already damaged credibility of the defendant,\" suggesting that McCambridge, generally speaking, was not a credible witness. Yet the majority also asserts that the jury must have believed McCambridge's testimony that he fired on Doyle in self-defense, in support of its theory that he was convicted of manslaughter because the jury decided he used excessive force in his self-defense. This seems to be a rather selective view of McCambridge's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My own view is that McCambridge's credibility was impugned in the eyes of the jury on the critical issue of self-defense, and there is at least a reasonable probability, the <i>Brady</i> prejudice standard, that this damage was attributable to the prosecutor's unfair closing argument. That view draws support from the jury's conviction of McCambridge on two of the three motor vehicle offenses. These convictions indicate unmistakably that they concluded that McCambridge was driving the van at some point, a determination that required rejecting substantial parts of his account of the altercation with Doyle, the shooting, and the accident. The majority suggests that \"[t]he Appeals Court could reasonably conclude... that once McCambridge shot Doyle, he pushed Doyle toward the back of the van and attempted to drive from the passenger's seat or the driver's seat.\" It is indeed possible that the jury reasoned as the majority describes, but a more straightforward explanation is that the jury simply disbelieved McCambridge's testimony that Doyle was driving the van when he was shot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My conclusion that McCambridge was prejudiced by the prosecutor's misconduct is consistent with our decision in <i>United States v. Udechukwu,</i> 11 F.3d 1101 (1st Cir.1993), where we considered the prejudicial effect of a prosecutor's closing argument questioning the existence of exculpatory evidence the defendant claimed existed but which the prosecution failed to disclose. The defendant in that case, charged with smuggling illegal drugs into the United States from Aruba, presented a defense of duress. She testified that a man named Michael Mouma had threatened to harm her children if she did not transport drugs for him. Defense counsel attempted to obtain evidence from the prosecution to corroborate the defendant's testimony regarding Mouma and the circumstances under which she had agreed to smuggle the drugs. Although the government had information that Mouma did exist, was in Aruba, and had been a drug trafficker, that exculpatory information was never disclosed to the defense. The prosecutor then used the absence of information about Mouma to challenge Udechukwu's credibility in closing argument. In <i>Udechukwu,</i> as here, the defendant asserted on direct appeal<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> that the prosecution's <i>Brady</i> violation was magnified by the improper summation. We stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inferences and the direct challenge to the existence of a source named Michael, however, when the prosecution had unearthed evidence that he existed and was a prominent dealer in narcotics, is indefensible. Here we find a kind of double-acting prosecutorial error: a failure to communicate salient information, which, under [<i>Brady</i> and <i>Giglio</i>] should be disclosed to the defense, and a deliberate insinuation that the truth is to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in the instant case, there was no question in <i>Udechukwu</i> that the defendant committed the acts alleged by the prosecution. Udechukwu's defense of duress, like McCambridge's claim of self-defense, depended entirely on her credibility. In <i>Udechukwu,</i> the evidence not disclosed by the prosecution only partly substantiated her defense because the fact that Mouma existed, lived in Aruba, and had been involved in illegal narcotics did not establish that Mouma ever threatened Udechukwu or asked her to smuggle drugs. Nevertheless, we reversed Udechukwu's conviction and remanded for a new trial because we concluded that she was prejudiced by the prosecutor's improper attack on the crucial issue of her credibility: \"Whether the government's failure to disclose this credibility-strengthening information could be said to be reversible error, we need not decide. We have no doubt, however, that the prosecutor's persistent theme in closing argument suggesting the nonexistence of this information ... did fatally taint the trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1105.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Thus, I conclude that the prosecutor's insinuation during closing argument that McCambridge had lied about Doyle's criminal record likewise tainted the McCambridge trial in the relevant <i>Brady</i> sense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> It deprived McCambridge of \"a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> <i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 289-90, 119 S.Ct. 1936.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, my conclusion that McCambridge was prejudiced by the prosecution's failure to disclose Doyle's conviction would not be sufficient to warrant the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. I must also conclude that the determination of the appeals court on this issue constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as articulated by the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1). The appeals court found no prejudice for two reasons. First, it observed that \"there was no prejudice to [McCambridge] because he was aware of the victim's record and was prepared to offer such evidence at trial.\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 690 N.E.2d at 475. That observation is entirely beside the point. McCambridge did not wish to offer proof of the victim's record because he agreed with the trial court that the truth about that record was irrelevant. McCambridge had referred to Doyle's record in his testimony and his closing argument only to explain the origin of the altercation. The truth of the record only became an issue at the end of the trial because of the prosecutor's unfair attack on McCambridge's credibility in closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the appeals court said that the jury must have believed McCambridge's account of the struggle and its cause given his conviction for manslaughter: \"By convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about [the conviction] to Doyle.\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 690 N.E.2d at 475. As I have explained in my analysis of the majority's similar assessment of the prejudice issue, the court's conclusion that the jury \"obviously credited\" McCambridge's testimony rests on a faulty, unduly speculative premise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> The jury may well have reached a manslaughter verdict for any number of reasons having nothing to do with its crediting of McCambridge's insistence that the struggle was precipitated by his remark about Doyle's conviction. All that can be said with certainty about the jury's evaluation of McCambridge's claim of self-defense is that the jury did not credit his testimony sufficiently to acquit him. Rather, their verdict strongly suggested a negative judgment about McCambridge's credibility, in a case where the Commonwealth's evidence was circumstantial and, on important points, inconclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, the state appeals court's conclusion that the outcome of McCambridge's trial would not have been different if the evidence of Doyle's conviction had been disclosed rests on an irrelevant observation and an unduly speculative premise. Under these circumstances, I must conclude that the court's no prejudice determination constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law regarding prejudice in the <i>Brady</i> context, and the writ of habeas corpus should be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Commonwealth does not dispute that the evidence of Doyle's conviction was favorable to McCambridge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Doyle's official record indicates that he was convicted of child neglect and was sentenced to two years, six months to be served and the remainder suspended, with the six month period of incarceration to be followed by a two year period of probation.

Although the majority suggests that the transcript should be read as written, the Commonwealth conceded in its brief to the panel that the prosecutor either said or intended to say \"absolutely<i>no</i> evidence.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In its brief to the panel, the Commonwealth, for the first time, did note in passing that there was no objection to its summation, but it did not mention the possibility of a procedural bar to federal habeas review.

The harm to McCambridge caused by the prosecutor's failure to abide by his representation to the judge and to defense counsel that he would not question the fact of Doyle's conviction vastly outweighs any advantage McCambridge gained by not having the jury learn that Doyle's conviction was for child neglect rather than child abuse</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> In distinguishing<i>Udechukwu,</i> the majority says that here the prosecutor did not make knowing misrepresentations to the jury.

The two had been out drinking together at a bar in Cambridge on the night of the incident, which occurred in the early hours of November 11, 1993. At the bar, McCambridge argued with the bartender, screaming at him either because of the television set, or because of McCambridge's attentions to the bartender's girlfriend. Leaving the bar around one a.m., Doyle and McCambridge drove off together in Doyle's van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about two a.m., a state trooper observed a traffic disturbance on the Southeast Expressway, which was caused by the van weaving through the southbound lanes and driving unusually slowly, about forty miles per hour, on this major road. The trooper turned on his lights and siren in an attempt to pull over the van, but the van continued to weave through the lanes. The van then accelerated to between fifty miles per hour and sixty-five miles per hour and swerved into the cement curbing on the right shoulder of the Expressway. After the van hit the right shoulder, it fish-tailed across the road, turning perpendicular to the Expressway and slowing to a speed of about thirty-five miles per hour. The van then struck the cement center median head-on, hitting first on the front right side, then with the whole front of the van. The van went up into the air, rising several feet, and landed with the driver's side down, facing the wrong way down the road. The van then skidded backwards about ten feet, rotating 360 degrees as it slid. The trooper also said that, as the van went into the center median, he saw a head in the driver's seat area; the head smashed into the windshield as the van hit the ground. The trooper estimated that about two minutes passed from when he first saw the van until the crash, and that the van had traveled about two or two-and-a-half miles, weaving and then crashing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second witness, an off-duty state trooper, saw the van weaving through the Expressway lanes, then fish-tailing into the right shoulder, crossing the Expressway into the center median, rising up into the air, and landing on the driver's side.

His clothing had been torn off around the neck area, leaving his chest completely exposed. The state troopers at the scene reported that his skin appeared blue or grayish, he was not breathing and he had no pulse, although one paramedic testified that Doyle was still warm to the touch when the paramedic arrived. There was no attempt to resuscitate him. Doyle was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. He had been shot once in the right cheek and once in the back (in the area of the right shoulder). He also had a head wound indicating that the back of his head had struck or been struck with a linear object that was at least three inches in length and had no sharp or rough edges. Doyle's blood alcohol level was 0.22%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the van, the troopers found a Smith &amp; Wesson semiautomatic pistol; the safety was off and the gun was cocked, loaded, and ready to fire. The police also found a billy club with blood on it that was consistent with Doyle's blood type and two boxes of ammunition, each corresponding to one of the two guns. Doyle had been living in the van prior to the crash, and the van was used by a homeless advocacy organization to transport individuals to shelters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution's theory at trial was that McCambridge had shot Doyle and was driving the van, en route to dumping the body, when the crash occurred. McCambridge admitted shooting Doyle, but argued he did so in self-defense. More specifically, McCambridge claimed that Doyle, in a drunken rage, was threatening to shoot him for implying that Doyle was a child abuser. McCambridge says that the derringer was Doyle's, which Doyle himself had placed on the dash-board, as he was on his way to sell the gun to a customer in Quincy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge testified that the argument in the van had its genesis in a conversation between Doyle and himself, a month or so before the shooting. In that conversation, McCambridge says he told Doyle that he had heard Doyle had been convicted for child abuse. Doyle, after initially denying the charge, admitted it was true, said he had done his time for it, and said he didn't want to hear any more. Doyle told McCambridge that \"if [McCambridge] ever threw it up to him, his face again ... he'd put a bullet in [McCambridge's] frigging head.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this warning, McCambridge says he raised the topic again in the van, just prior to the shooting. McCambridge testified that the argument began after leaving the bar, when McCambridge asked Doyle, who was driving, to give him a ride to his ex-wife's house. Doyle said he had to make a phone call and left the van. When he returned, Doyle said he had to go to Quincy because he had a customer for a derringer pistol. Doyle pulled the derringer out from under the seat and threw it on the dashboard. McCambridge again asked to be taken to his ex-wife's, but Doyle drove on toward Quincy. This angered McCambridge and so he told Doyle he was drunk and called Doyle a name implying that Doyle had abused a child. McCambridge testified that Doyle then pulled out a nine-millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson from his waist band, and threatened McCambridge with it. McCambridge testified that he pushed downward on Doyle's right hand, while Doyle pushed upwards, and that he begged Doyle to put the gun down. At the same time, McCambridge says he grabbed the derringer from the dashboard. He saw Doyle cock the hammer of the Smith &amp; Wesson, so he shot Doyle in the face with the derringer. McCambridge testified he had no memory of anything else until he woke up in the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to a ballistics expert's testimony at trial, Doyle had been shot with the derringer pistol that fell out of McCambridge's clothing at the accident scene. The ballistics expert testified that the derringer needed to be manually loaded, would only bear two cartridges, and needed to be manually cocked each time the weapon was fired. He further testified that it would take between thirteen and sixteen pounds of pressure to pull the trigger, which he characterized as \"a very heavy trigger pull.\" He also testified that he would expect a considerable flash when the gun was fired, \"enough to instantaneously brighten a darkened room.\" The state trooper pursuing the van testified that he saw no flash or other light from the van's interior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A forensic chemist testified at trial for the prosecution that, in her opinion, Doyle was shot while he was in the driver's seat of the van; but at the time of the accident, Doyle was probably near the sliding passenger's side door and McCambridge was in the driver's seat. This supported the prosecution's theory of the case, which was that McCambridge had shot Doyle sometime after leaving the bar, and then deposited his body in the back of the van. She testified that Doyle's blood was spattered in a downward and outward direction on the driver's side door in a manner suggesting a high-velocity impact, such as from a gunshot wound, with blood dripping down the door. This indicated that the van was in an upright position when the blood spattered on the door. She testified that the hardening around the edges of blood droplets suggested that the blood on the upper part of the window remained undisturbed for about three minutes and that the larger quantities of blood, dripping down the driver's side door, were undisturbed for at least five minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blood matching Doyle's type was found on the driver's seat and had soaked through the upholstery into the cushion, and a pool of Doyle's blood type had collected under the driver's seat. There was also blood on the seat of McCambridge's jeans that was consistent with Doyle's blood; the forensics expert testified that the stain was consistent with McCambridge sitting in blood, rather than merely wiping up against blood. More of the Doyle-type blood was found on the front leg of McCambridge's jeans; on a jacket belonging to McCambridge, which the police found in the back of the van after the crash; and on the billy club found in the van. Doyle's blood was also on the passenger's side sliding door, which was off the hinges at the bottom, and open \"like a flap.\" Fibers from Doyle's sweater were fused to the lower portion of the sliding door, indicating that the sweater had struck the door with great force. She also testified that, based on the stippling marks on Doyle's clothing, she believed the gunshot wound in Doyle's back was caused by a shot fired from a distance of three feet or greater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for McCambridge, the forensics expert found tissue, hair and blood on the upper passenger's side corner of the windshield and on the passenger's side dash-board that appeared to be McCambridge's, as well as on the rear-view mirror (which was detached from its proper place). McCambridge's blood was also found on his sweater and the jacket he was wearing at the time of the crash. The expert also found glass fragments from the windshield and the passenger's side window in McCambridge's clothes, indicating that McCambridge was probably in contact with the passenger's side window when it broke. (There was no such evidence that Doyle had come in contact with the broken windshield.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth had a specialist in accident reconstruction testify. He supported the witnesses' memories of the crash, and opined that Doyle's body must have been ejected from the flapping passenger's side sliding door at the first impact. He also testified that, upon impact, the occupants of the van would have been thrown forward and to the right. He further testified that the driver was likely to have been pinned behind the wheel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical examiner who testified for the Commonwealth stated that the manner in which Doyle's impact wounds bled suggested that it was possible that he was still alive at the time of the crash, but that he could not be sure. He based this upon the fact that there was blood in the tissues surrounding the impact abrasions, which could indicate that Doyle's heart was still pumping blood at the time of impact, but that could also be caused by the body being turned multiple times.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The medical examiner's opinion was that Doyle was shot first in the cheek, from a distance of six to eight inches to the right of the right cheek; this shot probably would have killed Doyle within eight minutes. He stated that the second gunshot, to the upper right back shoulder area, severed Doyle's aorta and thus probably would have killed Doyle in less than two to three minutes, and definitely in less than eight minutes. He also concluded that, based on the amount of blood that Doyle had inhaled into his lungs, Doyle had time to take at least a few breaths between the two shots. Based on Doyle's blood alcohol content and the fact that Doyle had absorbed all the alcohol in his stomach, the medical examiner estimated that Doyle had stopped drinking about ninety minutes prior to being killed. The medical expert also testified that Doyle's head wound was consistent with a blow from a billy club, such as was found in the van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge's forensics expert testified that, upon impact, the passenger would be propelled forward into the right-hand corner of the windshield, but that the steering wheel and console could prevent the driver from hitting the windshield, instead sending the driver back, through the twenty-nine inch space between the front bucket seats, and out the passenger's side sliding door. He further testified that the derringer has an average muzzle energy of 95 foot pounds, roughly equivalent to a punch from a professional boxer, whereas the Smith &amp; Wesson has an average muzzle energy of 355 foot pounds. Due to the relatively weak muzzle energy of the derringer, he testified that it was possible for Doyle to have been shot once and still have remained conscious, active, and possibly even more aggressive because of the wound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the habeas issue asserted is based on the question of evidence as to whether or not Doyle had been convicted of child abuse, we go into detail on this point. At trial, the prosecution called Doyle's brother. During the testimony, McCambridge's counsel asked for a side-bar and informed the court that, if the Commonwealth planned to challenge the truth of Doyle's conviction for child abuse, he would like the opportunity to cross-examine Doyle's brother about whether Doyle had served time for child abuse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At that point, the prosecution said it was not certain whether it intended to challenge the truth of the conviction. The court said that it would keep Doyle's brother available to be recalled as a witness if the prosecution decided to argue that Doyle had not been convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, during McCambridge's testimony, the prosecutor objected on hearsay and prejudice grounds to McCambridge referring to Doyle's conviction. The prosecutor said the prejudice outweighed any probative value. The court asked if there was a conviction on the charge. Defense counsel represented there was a conviction, but said \"whether it's true or not in some ways is irrelevant.\" At that point, the judge asked counsel whether either had checked Doyle's probation record. The prosecutor replied, \"It just says&#8212;it doesn't say what for. I have no idea what it's for.\" The judge allowed McCambridge to testify to his first conversation with Doyle about the conviction, agreeing that it went to McCambridge's state of mind, which was relevant to the self-defense theory, and not for the truth of the conviction, which was not relevant to self-defense. On cross-examination of McCambridge, the prosecutor raised the issue of the conviction, and then asked, \"You know Mr. Doyle is deceased?,\" to which McCambridge answered yes. The prosecutor then asked, \"He can't refute your allegations right now; can he?\" The defense objected to that question, and the objection was sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near the conclusion of the defense's case, defense counsel requested a side-bar to clarify whether he needed to recall Doyle's brother. That turned, he said, on whether the prosecution intended to impugn McCambridge's credibility by arguing that Doyle had never been convicted or in jail, when there was no evidence either way on this point. The prosecutor took the position that Doyle had not been in jail, that the defense counsel could ask the question of Doyle's brother if he wanted, and that it was up to the defense, not the prosecution, to put Doyle's criminal record into evidence. When asked by the court, the prosecutor said, \"He wasn't in jail, Judge,\" and then, when the court further asked if Doyle was convicted, the prosecutor responded \"No. No.\" The prosecutor said all he had seen on the record was spousal abuse, \"so far as [he knew, Doyle] had never been in jail,\" and that was all he could say on the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel said he did not have access to the criminal record and would like it produced. He said he did not want to make it part of the case but that he \"d[id]n't want to open it up for argument that [he] didn't prove that [Doyle] had one, and, therefore, [McCambridge] was lying.\" The court asked the prosecution what it intended to argue on the issue. The prosecutor replied that he had no problem if the defendant called the brother \"because, as far as I know, there is no record that Mr. Doyle had any convictions.\" When the judge inquired further, the prosecutor said he should not be put in the position of disclosing what his closing argument would be. He foreshadowed what he might do by saying McCambridge \"gets up there and says [Doyle's] done time when I know he hasn't from the records I've seen. And if [McCambridge has] got the record, he can [attempt to introduce it.]\" The court then interjected that the information had come in only for the state of mind of the defendant. The prosecutor said that was all he was going to argue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his closing argument, the defense counsel was careful to emphasize that McCambridge's testimony about Doyle's conviction was offered only to show his state of mind and that there was no evidence that Doyle ever molested or abused any child. He stated that \"[t]here is simply no evidence one way or another.... There is no evidence that he did it. There is no evidence that he didn't do it. It was admitted for ... the state of mind.\" The prosecutor, in turn, in his closing referred to the earlier conversation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does the defendant have something for you to believe when he gets up there and says, oh, yeah, I had an argument with Richard Doyle because of child molestation? There is absolutely evidence of that. Was that put in there to tell you what his frame of mind was? No. That was his third shot at the victim from the stand, assassinating his reputation with no evidence. That's what that was for, I suggest to you, not to show state of mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Literally read, the prosecution admitted there was evidence that defendant had an argument with Doyle in the aftermath of the child abuse accusation, but that the real purpose for the testimony was to impugn the victim, not to show McCambridge's state of mind.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Defense counsel did not object to the prosecution's closing statement. Nor was the closing statement presented as error to the state courts on McCambridge's direct appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, presenting three main arguments: that the derringer and his clothes were the product of an unlawful search and seizure and should have been suppressed; that the jury should have been instructed on the possibility of a necessity defense to the firearms charge; and that \"the trial court erred by not requiring Doyle's criminal record to be made part of the record, and the prosecutor may have violated the defendant's state and federal due process rights by not disclosing that record.\" On this third argument, McCambridge argued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suppression of material evidence favorable to the accused and requested by him violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. <i>Brady v.

The defendant claimed that Doyle's record would have supported his claim that Doyle had been convicted of child abuse, which would have corroborated the defendant's testimony at trial that Doyle pulled a gun on him when the defendant called Doyle a name indicating he was a child abuser, which accusation on a prior occasion had prompted Doyle to threaten the defendant's life if he ever accused him of this offense again. While the defendant pressed for the introduction of the victim's criminal record at trial, he did not object when the judge did not order its production or request that the record be marked for identification.

The district court referred to the Massachusetts Appeals Court holding cited above, noting that \"[p]rocedural default acts as an independent and adequate state ground to uphold the conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 155. The court further held that McCambridge had not shown that \"some objective factor external to the defense impeded defense counsel's efforts to comply with the state's procedural rule,\" <i>id.</i> at 155-56, nor had he shown \"actual prejudice\" from the prosecution's failure to produce the criminal conviction, <i>id.</i> at 156, nor any miscarriage of justice, <i>id.</i> The court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The actual contents of Doyle's criminal record are not relevant to this analysis because the details of the actual criminal record were not known to McCambridge at the time of the homicide.... Rather, McCambridge believed, from whatever source, that Doyle had a criminal history of child abuse, knew that accusations of child abuse were likely to provoke violence from Doyle, and after such provocation became fearful of his life when Doyle drew a gun. To these facts McCambridge testified at his trial, and the jury must have accepted that his provocation story at least raised some reasonable doubt in order to convict on manslaughter rather than first- or second-degree murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to issue a certificate of appealability.

The panel held that the state court's determination that McCambridge's counsel should have objected at trial to the failure of the court to order the prosecutor to produce the record and to mark it into evidence was contrary to clearly established federal law, and its conclusion that McCambridge suffered no prejudice was an unreasonable application of the law to the facts. The panel held that, under clearly established federal law, a defendant may rely on a prosecutor's representations that she has fully complied with her <i>Brady</i> disclosure requirements, and therefore, need not object. <i>Id.</i> at 17-18. Further, the panel held that the prosecutor's insinuation in his closing that McCambridge had invented the entire story about Doyle's criminal conviction prejudiced McCambridge and \"may well have tipped the balance in favor of a manslaughter conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A habeas petitioner must meet certain preliminary criteria before we can reach the merits of his claim.

The state court inquiry did focus on whether there was \"prejudice\" to the defendant, which is the relevant federal standard. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 281-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is no dispute that this is so. If the conviction survives this more lenient state standard, then, absent exceptional circumstances, it follows that the conviction would survive the federal standard, and we see no reason the state courts would be required to say explicitly that both standards are met. If there is a federal or state case that explicitly says that the state adheres to a standard that is more favorable to defendants than the federal standard (and it is correct in its characterization of the law), we will presume the federal law adjudication to be subsumed within the state law adjudication. <i>Cf.

They point to the prosecutor's closing comments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> saying he implied that Doyle was not convicted, after the prosecutor had not produced the conviction record and represented to the court there was no such conviction. They argue that this was a close case on the evidence and ultimately hinged on McCambridge's credibility, which they argue was deeply wounded by the prosecutor's comment. As support for this, they say that Doyle's blood alcohol level, subcutaneous bleeding, and the medical technician's testimony that Doyle was still warm indicate that Doyle was shot shortly before the crash; that the blood and tissue samples on the passenger side door and windshield indicate that McCambridge was in the passenger's seat at the time of the crash; that there was a cocked gun with the safety off in the van; and that the boxes of ammunition in the car indicate that both guns belonged to Doyle. They also argue that the state appellate court's reasoning that \"by convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about [the conviction] to Doyle,\" 690 N.E.2d at 475, is arbitrary and unsupported by the record, because the jury convicted McCambridge of driving offenses and therefore clearly did not credit his testimony as to how the fight began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth responds that, given the evidence presented to the jury, it was not unreasonable for the Massachusetts Appeals Court to conclude that, even if McCambridge had been able to corroborate his testimony with the conviction record and the prosecutor had not made his statement in closing, there was no \"reasonable probability that ... the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. at 682, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3375</span></a></span>. The result in this proceeding was that McCambridge was acquitted of first degree murder and convicted of manslaughter, so the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that the manslaughter verdict would have been different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To assess that question, we first turn to the state trial court's extensive jury instructions, which we quote in relevant part below. The trial judge explained the Commonwealth's burden to prove that McCambridge did not act in self-defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth must prove ... that one or more of the three requirements of self-defense was absent from this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... [T]hose three requirements are first that the defendant must have reasonably believed that he was being attacked or was immediately about to be attacked and that he was in immediate danger of being killed or seriously injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the defendant must have done everything that was reasonable under the circumstances to avoid physical combat before resorting to force and, third, that the defendant must have used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to protect himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She also gave thorough instructions on how to differentiate manslaughter upon provocation from self-defense and the role of excessive force:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manslaughter is an unlawful, intentional killing resulting from a sudden transport of the passions of fear, anger, fright, nervous excitement or heat of blood when there is no time to deliberate and when such passion or heat of blood is produced by adequate or reasonable provocation and without malice or upon sudden combat it would have been likely to produce in an ordinary person an abnormal state of mind and actually did produce such a state of mind in the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... The first element the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant inflicted an injury upon Mr. Doyle from which Mr. Doyle died; second, that the defendant injured Mr. Doyle as a result of sudden combat or in the heat of passion or using excessive force in self-defense; and, third, that the homicide was committed unlawfully without legal excuse or justification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provocation sufficient to reduce an unlawful killing from murder to manslaughter is that provocation which would likely produce in the ordinary person such a state of passion, anger, fear, fright, or nervous excitement as would eclipse a person's capacity for reflection or restraint and actually did produce such a state of mind in the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another factor or circumstance which mitigates or reduces murder to manslaughter is when a person kills using excessive force in self-defense.... Specifically, if the person initiated an assault against the defendant so that the defendant reasonably feared that he was in danger of being killed or suffering grievous bodily harm at the hands of Mr. Doyle, then the defendant has the initial right to use whatever means were reasonably necessary to avert the threatened harm. But, if the defendant used excessive force, that is, more force than was reasonable or proper under the circumstances of this case or the defendant, himself, became the attacker and the use of such force resulted in the death of his assailant, then that would constitute manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a few hours of deliberation, the jury asked for clarification on unlawful killing, malice aforethought, burden of proof, and reasonable doubt. The jury then asked for clarification on the definition of manslaughter. The judge re-read the manslaughter instructions that she had previously given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these instructions, the state appeals court reasonably concluded that the jury must have found that McCambridge was provoked in some way, resulting in a sudden heat of passion, leading to physical conflict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> That is what McCambridge himself said and the jury accepted his version. The only evidence presented at trial regarding any possible provocation for the altercation was McCambridge's testimony that Doyle threatened him with the nine millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson after McCambridge had called him a child abuser, and that a conflict ensued. Thus the jury accepted McCambridge's story about Doyle's anger at being called a child abuser. Nothing could be added to this by having the fact of the child neglect conviction established or admitted into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state court also reasonably concluded that the jury necessarily found that McCambridge, in his self defense, used at least excessive force against Doyle (or that McCambridge turned into the attacker). Neither the fact of Doyle's conviction, nor the contested excerpt from the prosecutor's closing argument, is material to whether McCambridge used excessive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence overwhelmingly supports the jury's conclusion. McCambridge shot Doyle twice, once in the face and once in the back. The fact that Doyle was shot in the back is itself evidence of excessive force. Before shooting the second shot, McCambridge had to cock the trigger of his gun again before firing. This was not an automatic weapon, and the trigger pull was very heavy. The forensic evidence was that Doyle had time to draw in at least a couple of breaths before the second shot, and McCambridge pulled back from an initial shooting distance of about six inches to a distance of about three feet for the second shot. There was also evidence that Doyle's head had been struck with a billy club, and a billy club with his blood-type on it was found. Even by McCambridge's account, the drunken Doyle was simultaneously attempting to drive the van down one of Boston's busiest highways, and so could not have been free to fully engage in the altercation. McCambridge himself said he had had at least some success in pushing Doyle's gun hand down and away, again supporting the conclusion that McCambridge used more force than was needed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge makes an independent argument based on the other verdict. We reject McCambridge's argument that because the jury convicted him of the motor vehicle charges, they necessarily rejected his testimony about the argument and how it developed, and so the conviction record would have made a difference. The Appeals Court could reasonably conclude, supported by the expert testimony, that the jury concluded that once McCambridge shot Doyle, he pushed Doyle toward the back of the van and attempted to drive from the passenger's seat or the driver's seat. Either act would suffice for the motor vehicle charges. <i>See Commonwealth v.

The state trial judge's instructions made it clear to the jury that an individual need not be seated in the driver's seat in order to be \"operating\" a vehicle within the meaning of the law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> And there was evidence that McCambridge was in the driver's seat and sat in that seat after it was soaked with Doyle's blood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The overall import of McCambridge's argument as to prejudice is that the prosecution's closing went to McCambridge's credibility, and that, in turn, impugned the verdict. For a number of reasons, we think that the state court's conclusion that this did not impugn the verdict is not an unreasonable application of clearly established law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What mattered for McCambridge's defense was not the truth of the fact of conviction itself, but rather the fact that the two had argued based on McCambridge's accusing Doyle of having abused a child, and the subsequent threat supposedly made by Doyle. McCambridge was allowed to testify as to this. McCambridge argues that the inevitable result was that he was discredited before the jury and even before his own attorney &#8212; he posits that his attorney emphasized manslaughter in his closing, rather than self defense, because of the appearance that McCambridge had lied about the conviction story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the analysis in stages. First, under Massachusetts law, the conviction record would not normally have been admissible, even as corroborative evidence. <i>See Commonwealth v. Todd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2167726\"><a href=\"/opinion/2167726/commonwealth-v-todd/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2167726\"><a href=\"/opinion/2167726/commonwealth-v-todd/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 214 (1990) (holding that exclusion of victim's conviction record was not error in part because what was important for the defense was the defendant's belief, not the fact of the convictions); <i>Commonwealth v. Fontes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2036947\"><a href=\"/opinion/2036947/commonwealth-v-fontes/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2036947\"><a href=\"/opinion/2036947/commonwealth-v-fontes/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span>, 762 (1986) (holding that defendant may introduce specific instances of victim's violent conduct to support self-defense theory only if such instances are recent and known to defendant at the time of the homicide). Since the conviction was inadmissible, we are left with the prosecution's statement at closing. To the extent that the prosecutor attempted to imply that McCambridge was lying about the existence of a conviction in his closing argument, an objection could have been made, but was not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if admissible, proof of the existence of the conviction was not material to the question of use of excessive force in self defense. As counsel for McCambridge had just said in his closing, there was no evidence one way or the other as to the conviction and this was not the point anyway. As the district court pointed out, an accusation of child abuse or molestation may be even more likely to provoke violent rage if it is baseless. Thus, as defense counsel suggested, it was the accusation of child abuse, whether true or not, which enraged Doyle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the effect of the lack of evidence of a conviction and the prosecutor's statement was minimal given the wealth of evidence supporting the conviction. The contested statement in the closing argument comprises only one short paragraph in a sixteen-page transcript. The judge instructed the jury that nothing in the closing argument was to be considered as evidence. And there was other evidence, particularly physical evidence, that undercuts McCambridge's credibility as to his assertion that he did no more than act properly to defend himself &#8212; the blood evidence indicating that Doyle was shot at least five minutes before the van flipped; the fact that no witness reported gun flashes, although at least one witness watched for two minutes before the crash; the fact that Doyle had been shot more than once and most likely was also hit over the head with the bloodied billy club, which McCambridge could not explain; the fact that the weapon was found in McCambridge's clothes, apparently tucked in there after the shooting; the trooper's testimony that the van's driver smashed into the windshield and remained in the front area of the van; the evidence indicating that Doyle was thrown hard into the passenger side door and then out the bottom of that door, and was neither trapped in the driver's seat nor thrown into the windshield; the blood on the seat of McCambridge's jeans, most likely from the bloodied driver's seat cushion; and the fact that Doyle was already gray-blue when the troopers first saw him. The physical evidence, notably the blood patterns, was simply inconsistent with McCambridge's theory that the shootings occurred within thirty seconds. At most, the prosecutor's statement was another stab at the already damaged credibility of the defendant, who was most likely viewed as telling some, but not all, of the truth. Jurors need not believe everything a witness says, nor need they believe witnesses are not selective in recounting events. Daily life experience refutes any such belief. The physical evidence, too, might well cause a jury to disbelieve McCambridge's convenient statement that he recalled everything up to the point he fired the first shot in self-defense, and recalled nothing after that. None of the arguments advanced by McCambridge \"put[s] the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 435, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The defense did not differentiate (nor do the facts lend themselves to such differentiation) &#8212; the defense's essential argument was that McCambridge did kill Doyle but he did it in self-defense when Doyle reached for the gun during their altercation and McCambridge's response was not excessive.

McCambridge's counsel could have requested this remedy even without the conviction record, since the court had already indicated that the question was McCambridge's state of mind. Of course, if the prosecutor had produced the conviction record as requested by McCambridge, he probably would not have ventured to accuse McCambridge of lying on this point, if that, contrary to how the trial transcript reads, is what he did</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the conviction, had it been available, might have undercut the defense, or at least it could be reasonably thought to do so.

First, it ruled that McCambridge failed to object, as required, when the prosecutor refused to disclose the requested exculpatory evidence; namely, evidence of Doyle's conviction for child abuse. Second, the appeals court ruled that McCambridge could show no prejudice resulting from the prosecutor's wrongful suppression of that evidence. As a member of the panel that first reviewed this case, I concluded that the first ruling of the appeals court was contrary to clearly established federal law, and its second ruling constituted an unreasonable application of federal law.

The favorable evidence at issue here is the criminal record of the victim, Doyle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> McCambridge testified at trial that Doyle had become violent when McCambridge called Doyle a derogatory name that referred to Doyle's conviction for child abuse. McCambridge also described an incident a few months prior to their automobile accident when he asked Doyle whether he had been convicted of child abuse and Doyle threatened to kill McCambridge if he were ever to mention the topic again. Therefore, Doyle's criminal conviction related to McCambridge's theory of self-defense because it provided an explanation for why Doyle might have become violent in the van. Additionally, McCambridge's testimony regarding Doyle's earlier threat afforded a significant evidentiary basis for the jury to assess McCambridge's state of mind at the time of the shooting in determining whether McCambridge had been in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In charging an unlawful killing, the Commonwealth assumed the burden of proving that McCambridge did not act in self-defense. <i>See Commonwealth v. Reed,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></span>, 563 (1998). The jury might not have found McCambridge guilty of any wrongful killing if it could not reject, beyond a reasonable doubt, McCambridge's testimony that he reasonably perceived that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm. McCambridge's credibility on this self-defense claim and his perception of Doyle's alleged actions in the van and his earlier threat were thus potentially determinative of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doyle had, in fact, been convicted of and imprisoned for child neglect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Yet, during trial, the prosecutor represented, both to defense counsel and the trial judge, that there was no such conviction on Doyle's official record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

There were three discussions at the bench. The first sidebar took place on the third day of the trial when Doyle's brother was testifying for the Commonwealth. Defense counsel informed the court and the prosecutor that McCambridge's testimony regarding the altercation in the van would refer to his understanding that Doyle had been convicted of child abuse. Defense counsel stated that he saw no reason to question Doyle's brother about the decedent's conviction unless the prosecutor intended to take the position that McCambridge was lying. The prosecutor responded that he had not yet decided whether he would challenge McCambridge's veracity regarding Doyle's conviction. Due to the prosecutor's ambivalence in this respect, the defense was unable to resolve, at this point, whether to question Doyle's brother about the conviction. Therefore, the court ordered that the witness be held over for possible later questioning by the defense. During this initial sidebar, the prosecutor was put on notice that the record of Doyle's conviction tended to exculpate McCambridge by corroborating McCambridge's anticipated testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second sidebar on the issue of Doyle's conviction occurred during defense counsel's direct examination of McCambridge. The prosecutor objected, on hearsay grounds, to McCambridge's reference to the conviction when he described the threat allegedly made by Doyle a month before the killing. The court overruled the prosecutor's objection on the ground that the testimony was not being offered for the truth of the conviction, but rather to establish McCambridge's state of mind with respect to his fear of being killed by Doyle. The prosecutor replied that he thought the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its probative value. The following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Do we have a conviction on this charge?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEFENSE: Do I have a certified copy of the conviction? I do not. But I assert that it is true, that he was convicted for this charge.... I don't think my brother can say to your Honor that, in fact, he was not convicted. I've read the newspaper articles about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COURT: Has anyone checked his probation record?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PROSECUTOR: It just says &#8212; it doesn't say what for.

Despite the court's ruling that the jury would be told that McCambridge's testimony regarding Doyle's conviction was not being offered for the truth of the matter, the prosecutor attempted to raise doubts about the fact of the conviction during his cross-examination of the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PROSECUTOR: You said that you had an argument with Mr. Doyle sometime prior to this in September and you said that he was involved in a problem of child molestation; is that correct?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEFENDANT: I was told that....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PROSECUTOR: You know Mr. Doyle is deceased; isn't that correct, sir?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEFENDANT: He certainly is.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PROSECUTOR: He can't refute your allegations right now; can he?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEFENSE: Objection to that, your Honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of questioning foreshadowed the prosecutor's reference to Doyle's conviction in closing argument.

A person's CORI report lists his or her court appearances and convictions, if any.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> The Commonwealth has represented that at trial the prosecutor had only the first page of Doyle's three-page CORI report; the relevant conviction appears on the second page.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> The Commonwealth argues that it did not violate the requirements of <i>Brady</i> for three reasons. First, it says that the prosecutor disclosed all the information he had about Doyle's criminal record because the incomplete CORI print-out did not indicate that Doyle had ever been convicted of child abuse. Second, the Commonwealth contends that McCambridge should have been more diligent in requesting that the record be produced. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that McCambridge was required to object to the prosecutor's non-disclosure of Doyle's criminal record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p>1.

The prosecutor requested Doyle's criminal record from the Board, an agency established to coordinate the exchange of information among law enforcement personnel, including prosecutors and police officers. Based on the information he received from the Board, the prosecutor made inaccurate representations to the court and to the defense that Doyle had no criminal record. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth is responsible for the nondisclosure regardless of the prosecutor's actual personal knowledge. <i>See Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 437-38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The prosecutor in this case was on notice from the time of the first sidebar conference that evidence substantiating McCambridge's claim that Doyle had a criminal record would be favorable to McCambridge's theory of self-defense. There was no need for McCambridge to request that evidence specifically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth also asserts that it was not obligated to disclose evidence of Doyle's conviction because the defense could have found that evidence through a reasonably diligent investigation. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

However, as noted, McCambridge could not access the CORI database without a court order. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &#167; 172. Moreover, the Commonwealth's argument about the ready availability of evidence misses the point in an important way. This was not a case where the defense simply refused to look for evidence it knew existed and relied on the prosecution to disclose that evidence. Rather, the prosecutor misrepresented, to both defense counsel and the court, that the exculpatory evidence did not exist. Defense counsel was entitled to rely on that representation. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 283 n. 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the prosecutor expressed this uncertainty, the Commonwealth asserted, McCambridge and his counsel should have been more diligent in confirming whether the prosecutor's qualified statements were, in fact, true. The Commonwealth cites no authority for this argument, and I have found none. Under well-settled law, as I have explained, <i>Brady</i> obligations apply to a prosecutor's conduct even when the defense has not sought discovery of the exculpatory evidence. <i>See Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, McCambridge's counsel reasonably relied upon the prosecutor's representations that Doyle had never been convicted, <i>see Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 283 n. 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Strickler,</i> the prosecutor maintained an \"open file\" policy, meaning that \"his entire prosecution file was made available to the defense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 283 n. 22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While it is not clear from the record whether the Commonwealth maintained an open file policy in this case, the prosecutor's statements to defense counsel and to the court that Doyle had no criminal record constitute essentially the same representation at issue in <i>Strickler:</i> that the prosecution had fulfilled its constitutional duty under <i>Brady.</i> Under such circumstances, defense counsel is not required to object.

This argument is unpersuasive for the same reasons it was unpersuasive in the context of McCambridge's failure to pursue a more thorough investigation of Doyle's criminal record: the Commonwealth cannot escape its <i>Brady</i> obligations by qualifying its nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence and then shifting its disclosure burden to defense counsel.

In the case at bar, because the trial court refused to require the Commonwealth to produce Doyle's criminal record, the defendant cannot prove that exculpatory evidence was withheld.

The defense's reliance on such a misleading representation can result in important changes in trial strategy. In the case at bar, the defendant was specifically misinformed about Doyle's criminal record.

In the absence of bad faith, a new trial is necessary if the withheld evidence would have been a real factor in the jury's deliberation. In the case at bar, the defendant's truthfulness about the circumstances of his confrontation with Doyle was the central issue in the case. The blocking of the Commonwealth's claim, that the so-called argument about Doyle's child abuse record was only the defendant's attempt to assassinate Doyle's reputation, would have been a real factor in the jury's deliberation, and probably would have tipped the scales in favor of the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, McCambridge identified the proper legal authority for his <i>Brady</i> claim and explained why he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's failure to fulfill his disclosure obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCambridge's <i>Brady</i> claim was thus fully presented to the Massachusetts Appeals Court.

Noncompliance with a state procedural rule may preclude federal review: \"The [adequate and independent state ground] doctrine applies to bar federal habeas when a state court declined to address a prisoner's federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement.

In this case, the Commonwealth contends that the appeals court's reliance on the Massachusetts rule requiring contemporaneous objections provides such an adequate and independent state ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have already indicated that I would reject the Commonwealth's argument that McCambridge had an obligation to object to the government's failure to disclose <i>Brady</i> material. As I have explained, there is no such obligation under federal law. Indeed, the Commonwealth has not identified any authority supporting its assertion that McCambridge was required to object. My own review of Massachusetts caselaw has unearthed no case &#8212; except for the decision of the appeals court in this case &#8212; requiring an objection to the inaccurate representation by a prosecutor that exculpatory evidence sought by the defense has been disclosed. <i>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></span> (2000); <i>Commonwealth v.

For a state procedural rule to constitute an adequate and independent state ground barring federal habeas review, that rule must be consistently enforced in the state courts. <i>See Moore v.

Even if a Massachusetts procedural rule requiring an objection to the nondisclosure of exculpatory evidence had been consistently enforced, such a rule would be unconstitutional under <i>Strickler.</i> Accordingly, there is no adequate and independent state ground supporting the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court that precludes our review of McCambridge's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

However, as McCambridge has argued consistently, the prosecutor's summation, exploiting his misleading disclosure about Doyle's conviction, seriously prejudiced his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after the third sidebar, the defense rested and the parties made their closing arguments,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> the pertinent parts of which follow:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DEFENSE:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, I want to talk about one other thing that's not evidence in this case. Mr. McCambridge told you on the stand the reason that he and Mr. Doyle got into the fight, besides that they were both drinking and probably neither one thinking with great clarity, there had been an incident a couple of months previously where Mr. McCambridge says he had been told something about Mr. Doyle and confronted him with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Judge admitted that evidence as evidence of Mr. McCambridge's state of mind; in other words, it's not evidence that Mr. Doyle ever did anything.</i> There is no evidence in this case that Mr. Doyle ever molested or abused any child.... There is also no evidence in this case that he did it. There is simply no evidence in this case one way or the other. You don't know as you sit here whether what transpired, what Mr. McCambridge says transpired between the two of them, has any backing in reality or not. There is no evidence. There is no evidence that he did it. There is no evidence that he didn't do it.

In marked contrast, the prosecutor ignored the court's ruling, as well as his representation that he would abide by that ruling, and used the absence of the exculpatory evidence he had failed to produce to impugn McCambridge's credibility. For reasons that are not clear from the record, defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor's closing argument. Normally, such an omission by defense counsel would warrant requiring McCambridge to show cause for his failure to object and prejudice from the prosecutor's closing argument. However, I conclude that the Commonwealth failed to raise the issue of McCambridge's procedural default below and has thus waived that argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Waiver of Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts has a \"routinely enforced, consistently applied contemporaneous objection rule\" regarding improper closing argument. <i>Burks v.

Absent a timely objection, Massachusetts courts will not review appellate claims of improper summation unless cause and prejudice are demonstrated, except to ensure that a miscarriage of justice does not occur. <i>See Commonwealth v.

Moreover, by convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about this offense to Doyle. <i>See Commonwealth v.

However, I would hold that the state court's conclusion on prejudice is an unreasonable application of the <i>Brady</i> prejudice standard. To explain, I describe the evidence presented at McCambridge's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution alleged at trial that McCambridge shot and killed Doyle shortly after the two men left a bar in Cambridge at 1 a.m., and that McCambridge was driving, with Doyle's body in the back of the van, when a state trooper tried to stop the van. The prosecution further alleged that the van crashed when McCambridge reached for a gun with which he intended to shoot the police officer attempting to apprehend him. However, the evidence the Commonwealth presented at trial to prove this theory was conflicting and inconclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Time of death</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctor who performed the autopsy on Doyle testified that Doyle had last consumed alcohol approximately one and one-half hours before his death. It is undisputed that Doyle and McCambridge left the bar when it closed at 1 a.m. and that the accident occurred at about 2 a.m. Thus, if credited by the jury, the doctor's uncontradicted opinion tended to diminish any possibility that Doyle's death occurred much before the crash occurred, let alone just after the two men left the bar at 1 a.m. Another prosecution witness, an EMT who responded to the accident, testified that Doyle's skin was still warm when his body was found pinned beneath the van, thus tending to establish that Doyle died not long before the accident, particularly in light of the uncontradicted testimony that it was cold that night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The weapons</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence was also inconclusive with respect to McCambridge's ownership of and possession of a gun. The prosecution tried and failed to establish that McCambridge was carrying a gun in the waistband of his pants before he was in the van. The bartender testified that McCambridge became angry when the bartender started to close up the bar. He said that McCambridge stood up and brushed up against him, chest to chest, while pushing his coat back. When asked by the prosecutor whether he saw McCambridge \"reach for anything,\" the bartender said no. The bartender also testified that McCambridge did not seem to be angry with Doyle when the two men left the bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A firearms officer testified that McCambridge shot Doyle twice with a derringer. When emergency personnel were removing McCambridge's jacket after the accident, the derringer fell to the floor of the ambulance. However, the firearms officer did not trace the derringer to establish who owned it. Nor did he attempt to identify the owner of the 9 mm. pistol with which Doyle allegedly had threatened McCambridge. Another Massachusetts police officer testified that a box of ammunition fitting one of the two guns was found in the van. However, the box of ammunition, labeled \"Big Al's Gun Shop,\" was never introduced into evidence and the police officer had no other information about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Location of the bodies</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to bolster its theory that McCambridge had killed Doyle up to an hour before the accident, the prosecution attempted to establish that McCambridge was driving when the van crashed. Forensic witnesses testified that blood on the seat of McCambridge's pants was consistent with Doyle's blood, supporting an inference that McCambridge sat in the driver's seat at some point. However, there was also evidence that there was not enough blood on his pants to suggest that he sat there for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was other conflicting evidence about the probable location of McCambridge's body and Doyle's body at the time of the accident. A prosecution witness testified that: (1) the passenger-side window was broken; (2) glass from the passenger-side window was found on McCambridge's collar and under his jacket but none was found on Doyle; and (3) if someone had been sitting in the passenger seat at the time of impact, he would have been thrown to the right into the windshield or the passenger-door window. The prosecution offered no explanation as to how or why, under its theory of the case, McCambridge might have been in the passenger seat at the time of the impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense tried to show that it was not clear where the two bodies had been located prior to the crash and roll-over. The defense accident reconstructionist testified that the driver of the van could have been thrown between the bucket seats and out of the side door when the van was lifted into the air. The evidence was undisputed that after the accident the sliding door on the passenger side of the van was off its bottom hinges. The witnesses were in agreement that Doyle had been thrown from the car through this doorway. Because the fabric of Doyle's sweater had actually fused to the van, one investigator testified that Doyle's ejection must have been the result of a major impact that generated the heat necessary to accomplish the fusion. This evidence indicated that Doyle could have been driving at the time of the crash, and did not establish whether Doyle, if he had not been driving, was placed in the back of the van by McCambridge prior to the accident or was thrown there upon impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police officers, emergency medical personnel and civilians agreed that McCambridge was found wedged in the driver's seat area. Yet blood and hair sample tests established, without contradiction, that McCambridge's head hit the passenger side of the windshield during the crash. Uncontradicted testimony also established that McCambridge had a gash in his head and was covered with blood when he was found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. The police investigation and handling of evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were other questions left unanswered by the investigators. The accident reconstructionist for the state police had no photographs of the tire marks on the road and could not explain the absence of such important and apparently routine evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a> He also admitted during cross-examination that he had made mistakes in drawing the accident scene; he was unsure what one line was intended to indicate and a second line purporting to represent the track of one tire in fact traced the track of a different tire. Like the forensic chemist, he became confused regarding the physical principles governing the direction the bodies would have moved when the van hit the barrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another state investigator failed to document where things were located before they were removed from the van by the police. She was unaware of any inventory that might have been made of the \"heaps of stuff\" that had been in the van, which included trash bags, clothing, newspapers and debris. She also stated that the nine millimeter gun, which was loaded and cocked and allegedly used to threaten McCambridge, was found under a great deal of debris. Although the prosecution alleged that the van was weaving because McCambridge was reaching for this same gun in order to shoot the trooper who was trying to pull him over, there was no testimony as to whether the debris would have been on top of the gun before the crash or whether the gun itself would have moved during the crash. Moreover, the investigator could not say whether bloodstains of Doyle's blood type found in the back of the van were recent or even whether they had been made by the police as they removed items from the van. Some of the items that had fallen onto the road during the crash had been thrown back into the van before it was towed away, thus risking contamination and making it harder yet to reconstruct the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">e. Self-Defense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his self-defense claim, McCambridge testified that Doyle became aggressive after McCambridge called him a name referring to his conviction for child abuse. He also stated that he remembered nothing after the first shot he fired at Doyle until three to four days later when he was in the hospital. However, a medical expert, called by the defense, explained that a person might become more aggressive after receiving the type of wound Doyle received when hit by the first bullet. Dismissing McCambridge's amnesia as \"convenient,\" the prosecutor called no medical experts to challenge the inference that such a memory loss could be attributed both to shock and to the serious head wound McCambridge sustained in the accident. Other than McCambridge's own testimony, the record is devoid of evidence bearing on whether McCambridge was in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury or death when he shot Doyle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The verdict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury began deliberating at approximately 1:30 p.m. and returned its verdict the afternoon of the following day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> At the end of the first day of its deliberations, the jury requested clarification on (1) unlawful killing, (2) malice aforethought, (3) burden of proof, and (4) reasonable doubt. The following day, the jury asked the trial judge to clarify the elements of the manslaughter charge. That afternoon, the jury returned a verdict finding McCambridge guilty of the crime of manslaughter, unlawful possession of a firearm, operating under the influence, and operating to endanger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In returning a verdict of manslaughter, the jury rejected the prosecutor's theory that McCambridge acted with either premeditation or malice aforethought. Its rejection of the murder charge left the jury with only two options on the charge of unlawful killing: manslaughter or acquittal. The prosecutor's insinuation that McCambridge fabricated his testimony about Doyle's conviction to besmirch Doyle's reputation was the last thing the jury heard from either counsel. This improper undermining of McCambridge's credibility on the determinative question of self-defense, and perhaps of his credibility in general, may well have tipped the balance in favor of a manslaughter conviction. Thus, I conclude that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of McCambridge's trial would have been different if the existence of Doyle's conviction had been disclosed and the prosecutor had not suggested in closing argument that McCambridge was fabricating Doyle's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority disagrees with this prejudice analysis. To convict McCambridge of manslaughter, the majority reasons, \"the jury must have found that [he] was provoked in some way, resulting in a sudden heat of passion.\" The majority observes that \"[t]he only evidence presented at trial regarding any possible provocation for the altercation was McCambridge's testimony that Doyle threatened him with the nine millimeter Smith &amp; Wesson after McCambridge had called him a child abuser and that a conflict ensued.\" Thus, for the majority, \"the jury necessarily found that McCambridge, in his self defense, used at least excessive force against Doyle (or ... turned into the attacker).\" The majority concludes that \"the jury accepted McCambridge's story about Doyle's anger at being called a child abuser. Nothing could be added to this by having the fact of the child neglect conviction established or admitted into evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, this reasoning is unduly speculative. It assumes that if the jury convicted McCambridge of manslaughter, it must have believed his account of how the altercation with Doyle began. However, as the amicus explains:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could have disbelieved petitioner almost entirely, thus rejecting his self-defense testimony, and still found him guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. There was evidence outside petitioner's testimony that a struggle was occurring inside the van while driving on the highway shortly before the accident. Drivers saw the van rocking back and forth on the highway, and forensic evidence indicated that Doyle was shot shortly before the crash. There was independent evidence supporting petitioner's testimony that Doyle had pointed a cocked gun at him. There was also evidence that both petitioner and Doyle had been drinking. The court instructed the jury that it could find manslaughter if it found that petitioner had killed Doyle \"upon sudden combat.\" The court also instructed that what \"distinguished murder from manslaughter was the absence of malice aforethought.\" The jury could simply have concluded that the government failed to prove its case on the critical issue of intent given the paucity of the evidence supporting its theory of how and when petitioner killed Doyle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the jury could have found that the circumstantial evidence supported the conclusion that McCambridge killed Doyle upon sudden combat or in the heat of passion &#8212; for whatever reason &#8212; but that it was not sufficient to establish malice aforethought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> There is simply no basis for concluding that the jury must have believed McCambridge's account of what sparked the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the majority opinion convincing when it declares that \"[n]either the fact of Doyle's conviction, nor the contested excerpt from the prosecutor's closing argument, is material to whether McCambridge used excessive force.\" This argument assumes that the jury found that McCambridge acted in self-defense but with excessive force. Yet, again, the jury could have disbelieved his self-defense claim, but convicted him of manslaughter because the circumstantial evidence supported a finding of \"sudden combat\" (but failed to establish malice aforethought). If the jury had believed McCambridge's story about the origins of the altercation, it could have found that he acted in self-defense without excessive force, and thereby was entitled to an acquittal. It is simply wrong to say that the jury <i>must have</i> found that McCambridge used excessive force in self defense, when we do not know if the jury accepted his claim that he acted in self-defense in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority is also inconsistent in its assessment of the effect on McCambridge's credibility of the prosecutor's references in closing argument to McCambridge's unsupported claim about Doyle's conviction for child abuse. On the one hand, the majority asserts that \"[a]t most the prosecutor's statement was another stab at the already damaged credibility of the defendant,\" suggesting that McCambridge, generally speaking, was not a credible witness. Yet the majority also asserts that the jury must have believed McCambridge's testimony that he fired on Doyle in self-defense, in support of its theory that he was convicted of manslaughter because the jury decided he used excessive force in his self-defense. This seems to be a rather selective view of McCambridge's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My own view is that McCambridge's credibility was impugned in the eyes of the jury on the critical issue of self-defense, and there is at least a reasonable probability, the <i>Brady</i> prejudice standard, that this damage was attributable to the prosecutor's unfair closing argument. That view draws support from the jury's conviction of McCambridge on two of the three motor vehicle offenses. These convictions indicate unmistakably that they concluded that McCambridge was driving the van at some point, a determination that required rejecting substantial parts of his account of the altercation with Doyle, the shooting, and the accident. The majority suggests that \"[t]he Appeals Court could reasonably conclude... that once McCambridge shot Doyle, he pushed Doyle toward the back of the van and attempted to drive from the passenger's seat or the driver's seat.\" It is indeed possible that the jury reasoned as the majority describes, but a more straightforward explanation is that the jury simply disbelieved McCambridge's testimony that Doyle was driving the van when he was shot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My conclusion that McCambridge was prejudiced by the prosecutor's misconduct is consistent with our decision in <i>United States v. Udechukwu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195102\"><a href=\"/opinion/195102/united-states-v-udechukwu/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993), where we considered the prejudicial effect of a prosecutor's closing argument questioning the existence of exculpatory evidence the defendant claimed existed but which the prosecution failed to disclose. The defendant in that case, charged with smuggling illegal drugs into the United States from Aruba, presented a defense of duress. She testified that a man named Michael Mouma had threatened to harm her children if she did not transport drugs for him. Defense counsel attempted to obtain evidence from the prosecution to corroborate the defendant's testimony regarding Mouma and the circumstances under which she had agreed to smuggle the drugs. Although the government had information that Mouma did exist, was in Aruba, and had been a drug trafficker, that exculpatory information was never disclosed to the defense. The prosecutor then used the absence of information about Mouma to challenge Udechukwu's credibility in closing argument. In <i>Udechukwu,</i> as here, the defendant asserted on direct appeal<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> that the prosecution's <i>Brady</i> violation was magnified by the improper summation. We stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inferences and the direct challenge to the existence of a source named Michael, however, when the prosecution had unearthed evidence that he existed and was a prominent dealer in narcotics, is indefensible. Here we find a kind of double-acting prosecutorial error: a failure to communicate salient information, which, under [<i>Brady</i> and <i>Giglio</i>] should be disclosed to the defense, and a deliberate insinuation that the truth is to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in the instant case, there was no question in <i>Udechukwu</i> that the defendant committed the acts alleged by the prosecution. Udechukwu's defense of duress, like McCambridge's claim of self-defense, depended entirely on her credibility. In <i>Udechukwu,</i> the evidence not disclosed by the prosecution only partly substantiated her defense because the fact that Mouma existed, lived in Aruba, and had been involved in illegal narcotics did not establish that Mouma ever threatened Udechukwu or asked her to smuggle drugs. Nevertheless, we reversed Udechukwu's conviction and remanded for a new trial because we concluded that she was prejudiced by the prosecutor's improper attack on the crucial issue of her credibility: \"Whether the government's failure to disclose this credibility-strengthening information could be said to be reversible error, we need not decide. We have no doubt, however, that the prosecutor's persistent theme in closing argument suggesting the nonexistence of this information ... did fatally taint the trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1105.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Thus, I conclude that the prosecutor's insinuation during closing argument that McCambridge had lied about Doyle's criminal record likewise tainted the McCambridge trial in the relevant <i>Brady</i> sense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> It deprived McCambridge of \"a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> <i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 289-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I must also conclude that the determination of the appeals court on this issue constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as articulated by the Supreme Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1). The appeals court found no prejudice for two reasons. First, it observed that \"there was no prejudice to [McCambridge] because he was aware of the victim's record and was prepared to offer such evidence at trial.\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 690 N.E.2d at 475. That observation is entirely beside the point. McCambridge did not wish to offer proof of the victim's record because he agreed with the trial court that the truth about that record was irrelevant. McCambridge had referred to Doyle's record in his testimony and his closing argument only to explain the origin of the altercation. The truth of the record only became an issue at the end of the trial because of the prosecutor's unfair attack on McCambridge's credibility in closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the appeals court said that the jury must have believed McCambridge's account of the struggle and its cause given his conviction for manslaughter: \"By convicting the defendant of manslaughter, the jury obviously credited the defendant's testimony that the struggle in the van was precipitated by the defendant's remark about [the conviction] to Doyle.\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 690 N.E.2d at 475. As I have explained in my analysis of the majority's similar assessment of the prejudice issue, the court's conclusion that the jury \"obviously credited\" McCambridge's testimony rests on a faulty, unduly speculative premise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> The jury may well have reached a manslaughter verdict for any number of reasons having nothing to do with its crediting of McCambridge's insistence that the struggle was precipitated by his remark about Doyle's conviction. All that can be said with certainty about the jury's evaluation of McCambridge's claim of self-defense is that the jury did not credit his testimony sufficiently to acquit him. Rather, their verdict strongly suggested a negative judgment about McCambridge's credibility, in a case where the Commonwealth's evidence was circumstantial and, on important points, inconclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, the state appeals court's conclusion that the outcome of McCambridge's trial would not have been different if the evidence of Doyle's conviction had been disclosed rests on an irrelevant observation and an unduly speculative premise. Under these circumstances, I must conclude that the court's no prejudice determination constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law regarding prejudice in the <i>Brady</i> context, and the writ of habeas corpus should be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Commonwealth does not dispute that the evidence of Doyle's conviction was favorable to McCambridge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Doyle's official record indicates that he was convicted of child neglect and was sentenced to two years, six months to be served and the remainder suspended, with the six month period of incarceration to be followed by a two year period of probation.

Defense counsel, during his closing, had already expressly conceded this point by stating: `There's no evidence in this case that Mr. Doyle ever molested or abused any child.' In any event, the petitioner did not object to the prosecutor's closing and the judge instructed the jury that counsel's arguments were not evidence.\" This statement is patently insufficient to raise an adequate and independent state ground argument with respect to the failure of the defendant to object to the Commonwealth's closing argument<i>See United States v.
