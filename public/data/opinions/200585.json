Donovan, Clerk\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge (with whom BOUDIN, Chief Judge, and\n\nLYNCH and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, join).             The plaintiffs, all of\n\nwhom were arrested in Rhode Island for non-violent, non-drug-\n\nrelated misdemeanors, were subjected to unconstitutional searches\n\nof   their   persons    incident   to     their   detention    at   the   Adult\n\nCorrectional Institutions (the ACI).              These searches, conducted\n\npursuant to a longstanding institutional policy, encompassed both\n\nstrip searches (i.e., visual inspections of the naked body) and\n\nvisual body cavity searches (i.e., inspections of the anal and\n\ngenital areas).1       After the courts struck down the strip search\n\npolicy, the plaintiffs sued the State of Rhode Island and a number\n\nof prison officials for damages sustained as a result of the\n\nillegal intrusions.\n\n             The plaintiffs' suit invoked 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000).\n\nBecause the State is immune from suits for damages under section\n\n1983, see Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71\n\n(1989); Johnson v. Rodriguez, 943 F.2d 104, 108-09 (1st Cir. 1991),\n\nthe controversy before us focuses on the liability vel non of the\n\nindividual defendants.         After some preliminary skirmishing, the\n\ndistrict     court   entered    summary    judgment    in   favor   of    those\n\ndefendants on the basis of qualified immunity.                A panel of this\n\ncourt reversed that ruling, but the full court subsequently granted\n\n\n\n      1\n      For ease in reference, we sometimes use the shorthand term\n\"strip search\" to describe both practices.\n\n                                    -3-\n\frehearing en banc and (as is customary in such instances) ordered\n\nthe panel opinion withdrawn.          The court now divides equally and\n\nthus affirms the district court's ruling. The judges who subscribe\n\nto this opinion believe that affirmance is fully warranted:                 upon\n\na broad review of the preexisting law and its application to the\n\nunusual situation at the ACI, we conclude that, when the underlying\n\nevents occurred, prudent prison officials reasonably could have\n\nbelieved     that     Rhode    Island's       strip    search    policy      was\n\nconstitutional.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n             In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we rehearse the\n\nfacts in the light most sympathetic to the non-moving parties\n\n(here, the plaintiffs), indulging all reasonable inferences in\n\ntheir favor.    See, e.g., Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49,\n\n53 (1st Cir. 2000). Here, however, that praxis has little bearing,\n\nfor the facts upon which our decision turns are largely undisputed.\n\n            Unlike other states, Rhode Island has no regional or\n\ncounty detention facilities.           It operates only a single, all-\n\npurpose penitentiary:         the ACI.      Centrally located in Cranston,\n\nRhode Island, the ACI comprises seven separate maximum security\n\nfacilities.     Two of those units — one for women and the other for\n\nmen   —   receive   all   persons    committed    to   the   custody   of    the\n\nDepartment    of    Corrections     regardless   of    the   nature   of   their\n\noffenses.     At the times material hereto, these intake facilities\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fhoused an array of prisoners ranging from newly sentenced felons to\n\nconvicts    under   protective   custody     to     pretrial    detainees   to\n\narrestees.    All of these individuals, except for detainees held in\n\nprotective custody, were commingled while in various parts of the\n\nintake facilities.     Detainees held in protective custody used the\n\nsame areas as other inmates but at different times.\n\n            During the currency of this arrangement, Rhode Island\n\nmaintained written policies that required all new entrants into the\n\nACI, including misdemeanant arrestees, to undergo strip and body\n\ncavity searches.     In 1999, Craig Roberts ran afoul of this policy.\n\nLocal police, having made a routine stop of a motor vehicle in\n\nwhich Roberts was a passenger, learned that the Rhode Island Family\n\nCourt had issued a body attachment — the functional equivalent of\n\na writ of arrest — addressed to him.          Although Roberts protested\n\nthat the body attachment had been withdrawn and produced what\n\npurported to be documentation to that effect, the police detained\n\nhim.\n\n             In accordance with the customary procedure, the police\n\ntransported Roberts to the ACI.         Upon his admission, he was twice\n\nsubjected to strip and body cavity searches.                   These searches\n\nuncovered    no   drugs,   weapons,    or   other    contraband.      Shortly\n\nthereafter, a sheriff verified that the body attachment had been\n\nwithdrawn.    Roberts was released.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Roberts was gone but not forgotten.   He brought suit in\n\nthe federal district court alleging that the strip searches had\n\nviolated his constitutional rights. Upon cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, the district court ruled that the strip searches had\n\noffended Roberts's rights under the Fourth Amendment and enjoined\n\nthe State from continuing to enforce the written policies then in\n\neffect.   Roberts v. Rhode Island, 175 F. Supp. 2d 176, 183 (D.R.I.\n\n2000) (Roberts I).   We affirmed. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d\n\n107, 113 (1st Cir. 2001) (Roberts II).\n\n            Rhode Island abandoned the proscribed policy from and\n\nafter the date of the district court's decision (March 17, 2000).\n\nThereafter, eighteen plaintiffs — all of whom had been arrested for\n\nnon-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors and subjected to strip\n\nand body cavity searches prior to that date — brought a new action\n\nin the federal district court on behalf of themselves and all\n\nothers similarly situated.     In their class-action complaint, the\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the searches violated their constitutional\n\nrights and sought money damages.\n\n            The suit named as defendants the State and a galaxy of\n\nprison officials.    Upon the defendants' motion, the district court\n\ndismissed Roberts's claim for damages based on the doctrine of res\n\njudicata.    See, e.g., Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980)\n\n(stating that res judicata precludes a plaintiff from relitigating\n\nissues that were or could have been raised in an earlier action\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fagainst the       same   defendant      prescinding         from     the   same    set   of\n\noperative facts); Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 1161, 1165-66\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (same).             The court thereafter entered summary\n\njudgment against the remaining plaintiffs.                      The court reasoned\n\nthat, prior to the decision in Roberts I, it was not clearly\n\nestablished       that   prison    officials         needed    some     particularized\n\nsuspicion before strip-searching misdemeanant arrestees who were\n\nabout to be introduced into the general population at a maximum\n\nsecurity prison (and, therefore, that the defendants enjoyed the\n\nprotection of qualified immunity).               This appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            We review orders granting summary judgment de novo.\n\nPlumley v. S. Container, Inc., 303 F.3d 364, 369 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nWhere, as here, a party's entitlement to summary judgment hinges on\n\na   claim   of    qualified   immunity,         we   must     balance      the    need   to\n\nvindicate constitutional rights against the need to insulate public\n\nofficials from civil litigation that might unduly inhibit the\n\nassiduous discharge of their duties.                  See Anderson v. Creighton,\n\n483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987).          In balancing those           competing needs, we\n\nemploy a three-part algorithm.            Suboh v. Dist. Att'y's Office, 298\n\nF.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002); Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth and\n\nTheir Families, 274 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 2001).                           The threshold\n\nquestion     is     whether       the     plaintiffs          have     established        a\n\nconstitutional violation.               Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 736\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f(2002); Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).             The second\n\nquestion deals with fair warning; it asks whether the law was\n\nclearly established at the time of the constitutional violation.\n\nHope, 536 U.S. at 739-41; Anderson, 483 U.S. at 638-40.          The final\n\nquestion is whether a reasonable official, situated similarly to\n\nthe defendant(s), would have understood that the conduct at issue\n\ncontravened the clearly established law. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.\n\n            In this case, the first part of the algorithm need not\n\ndetain us.    We acknowledge that strip searches are intrusive and\n\ndegrading (and, therefore, should not be unreservedly available to\n\nlaw enforcement officers).         The Roberts decisions exemplify this\n\nthinking; they hold unequivocally that the ACI's policy of strip-\n\nsearching    persons    arrested    for    non-violent,   non-drug-related\n\nmisdemeanors, in the absence of particularized suspicion, violated\n\nthe Constitution.      See Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 113; Roberts I, 175\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 183.       The questions on which this appeal turns,\n\ntherefore, involve the second and third branches of the qualified\n\nimmunity algorithm.     We must determine whether the law was clearly\n\nestablished, prior to March 17, 2000, to the effect that prison\n\nofficials need at least reasonable suspicion before subjecting\n\nmisdemeanant arrestees to strip searches when introducing them into\n\nthe general population of a maximum security prison, and whether a\n\nreasonable prison official, situated similarly to the defendants,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fwould have understood at that time that the policy in place at the\n\nACI transgressed the Constitution.\n\n          Although    the   bases   for    these    determinations      often\n\noverlap, the instant plaintiffs cannot prevail unless we determine\n\nboth questions favorably to them. Thus, we begin our analysis with\n\nan examination of whether the law can be said to have been \"clearly\n\nestablished\" at or before the critical time (March 17, 2000).2            The\n\ndegree to which the law was clearly established as of a particular\n\ndate is a matter for the court to determine.          Elder v. Holloway,\n\n510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994); Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232\n\n(1991); Diaz v. Martinez, 112 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          The fundamental justification for the qualified immunity\n\ndefense is that public officials performing discretionary functions\n\nshould be free to act without fear of punitive litigation except\n\nwhen they fairly can anticipate that their conduct will give rise\n\nto liability for damages.      Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 195\n\n(1984). That anticipation depends, in large part, on the extent to\n\nwhich legal rules are clearly established.          Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).        The standard is an objective one.\n\nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 639; Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).      It follows, then, that an inquiry into the\n\nreasonableness   of   an    officer's     conduct   must   focus   on    the\n\n\n     2\n      Because we answer this question in the negative, see text\ninfra, we need not address the final prong of the qualified\nimmunity algorithm.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdiscernible contours of the law at the time of the alleged act or\n\nomission.       Hatch, 274 F.3d at 22-23.\n\n            To attain the necessary perspective, an inquiring court\n\nmust look back in time and conduct the juridical equivalent of an\n\narcheological dig. The court must canvass controlling authority in\n\nits own jurisdiction and, if none exists, attempt to fathom whether\n\nthere is a consensus of persuasive authority elsewhere. See Wilson\n\nv. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999); Brady v. Dill, 187 F.3d 104,\n\n116 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            This exploration is not limited to cases directly on\n\npoint.      Because \"officials can still be on notice that their\n\nconduct     violates     established          law   even    in    novel    factual\n\ncircumstances,\" Hope, 536 U.S. at 741, overcoming a qualified\n\nimmunity defense does not require a plaintiff to show that either\n\nthe   particular       conduct     complained       of     or    some   materially\n\nindistinguishable conduct has previously been found unlawful.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 268-71 (1997); Mitchell v.\n\nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 535 n.12 (1985).              Still, the relevant legal\n\nrights    and    obligations     must    be     particularized    enough   that   a\n\nreasonable official can be expected to extrapolate from them and\n\nconclude that a certain course of conduct will violate the law.\n\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201-02.            Consequently, if the operative legal\n\nprinciples are clearly established only at a level of generality so\n\nhigh that officials cannot fairly anticipate the legal consequences\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fof specific actions, then the requisite notice is lacking.                The\n\nbottom line is that the qualified immunity defense prevails unless\n\nthe    unlawfulness    of    the   challenged   conduct    is     \"apparent.\"\n\nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640.\n\n           Against this backdrop, we turn to the degree of clarity\n\nin the law relevant to this case.        In conducting our appraisal, we\n\nhave endeavored to take into account all the decisional law, in and\n\nout of our own circuit, that was on the books at the time of the\n\nevents in question.         See Lanier, 520 U.S. at 268-69; Hatch, 274\n\nF.3d at 23.\n\n           At the margins, the lines are easily plotted. On the one\n\nhand, courts long have viewed blanket strip searches as extreme\n\nintrusions upon Fourth Amendment rights.             See, e.g., Bell v.\n\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558 (1979); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\n\n723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).         On the other hand, security\n\nis a paramount concern in prison environments, and courts long have\n\nrecognized that unpleasantly intrusive security measures, up to and\n\nincluding blanket strip searches, may be proper in such settings.\n\nSee Bell, 441 U.S. at 560-62; Bonitz v. Fair, 804 F.2d 164, 170\n\n(1st   Cir.   1986).        The    constitutional   line   that     separates\n\npermissible from impermissible uses of these methods is imprecise\n\nand context-specific.        In the last analysis, plotting that line\n\nrequires a determination of what is reasonable under a given set of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fcircumstances.      Bell, 441 U.S. at 559; United States v. Chamorro,\n\n687 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n              The difficulty, of course, is that this formulation,\n\nwhile legally respectable, does not go very far toward curing the\n\nimprecision with which decisionmakers must grapple.                     This is\n\ninevitable — or nearly so — given the subject matter.                In the best\n\nof circumstances, \"[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth\n\nAmendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical\n\napplication.\"       Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.         Indeed, the Supreme Court\n\nitself   has    acknowledged,   in    a     qualified     immunity   case,   \"the\n\ndifficulty of determining whether particular searches or seizures\n\ncomport with the Fourth Amendment.\"               Anderson, 483 U.S. at 644.\n\nAnd that difficulty is compounded where, as here, the determination\n\ninvolves gauging whether a serious intrusion is reasonable in an\n\nincarcerative environment.       See      Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              With these basic tenets in mind, we examine the two First\n\nCircuit decisions that bear most closely on this case.                  Neither\n\ncomparison is very exact.\n\n              We start with Swain.     There, police arrested a woman on\n\nsuspicion of narcotics possession and temporarily held her in a\n\njail   cell    by   herself.    Id.    at    8.     The   officers,   following\n\ninstitutional practice, strip-searched her.                  Id. at 4-5.      We\n\ndeclared the strip search unconstitutional, holding that strip-\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fsearching an arrestee ordinarily requires at least reasonable\n\nsuspicion that the person arrested is concealing contraband or\n\nweapons.     Id. at 7.   We pointed out that, in Swain's case, there\n\nwas no basis for any such suspicion.            Id. at 8-9.   Moreover, she\n\nwas being held in virtual isolation, so there was no risk that she\n\nwould come in contact with other prisoners (and, thus, succeed in\n\nsmuggling contraband or weapons into the jail).           Id. at 8.\n\n             The plaintiffs contend that Swain clearly established the\n\nlaw relevant to this case.        It is, however, an oversimplification\n\nto say that, because we applied the reasonable suspicion standard\n\nto   strip    searches   in   a    particular     custodial   context,   the\n\nhandwriting was on the wall that the same standard would apply to\n\nthe ACI as well. There are important differences between detaining\n\nan arrestee in virtual isolation and introducing an arrestee into\n\nthe general population of a maximum security prison.\n\n             Making this point brings us to our second case — a\n\ndecision that the defendants insist has decretory significance\n\nhere.   That case is Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983)\n\n(Breyer, J.).    There, we upheld a blanket strip search policy with\n\nregard to prison inmates.         Id. at 888.     We reasoned that because\n\nthe searches involved the most dangerous of prisoners as they\n\ndeparted from, and entered into, a particularly sensitive area of\n\na maximum security prison, security concerns provided a compelling\n\njustification for the institution's policy.           Id. at 887-88.\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          As in Arruda, the defendants in this case attempt to\n\njustify their blanket strip search policy as a necessary (or, at\n\nleast, reasonable) means of ensuring institutional security.    They\n\nmaintain that the unique nature of the ACI's intake facilities, in\n\nwhich arrestees are intermingled with maximum security prisoners,\n\nraises concerns similar to those raised in Arruda and warrants the\n\nimplementation of such a policy.      This argument has considerable\n\nforce, for Arruda reasonably can be read as saying that the risk\n\nthat any prisoner in a maximum security facility might receive\n\nweapons or contraband from visitors, renegade guards, or others is\n\nenough to justify a blanket strip search policy.     But despite its\n\nbroad language, Arruda involved strip searches of convicted felons,\n\nnot misdemeanant arrestees — and that disparity cannot idly be\n\nbrushed aside.\n\n          In the end, we recognize that both Swain and Arruda offer\n\nvaluable insights, but that neither is a very exact match.     While\n\nSwain makes clear that strip searches ought not lightly to be\n\nindulged, the factual context of the case presented rather minimal\n\nsecurity concerns. And while Arruda makes clear that institutional\n\nsecurity needs may require intrusive measures in a maximum security\n\nsetting, that case dealt not with persons arrested for relatively\n\ninnocuous misdemeanors, but, rather, with hardened criminals.     So\n\nlong as the facts in these cases are distinguishable in a fair way\n\nfrom the facts at hand — and we believe that they are — then\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fneither of them can be said to have clearly established the law for\n\npurposes of a qualified immunity determination in the instant case.\n\nSee Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202-03.\n\n            We recognized much the same point in Roberts II, 239 F.3d\n\nat 111 (noting that \"[t]he institutional security concerns in play\n\nhere fall somewhere between those exhibited in Swain, which were\n\ninsufficient to support a search, and those in Arruda and Bell,\n\nwhich   made     broad-based   searches   without   individual   suspicion\n\nreasonable\").      To be sure, we ultimately placed the case \"on the\n\nSwain     side   of   the   constitutional   line.\"      Id.     But   our\n\nacknowledgment that the ACI's strip search policy fell into the\n\ngray area between Swain and Arruda carries more weight for present\n\npurposes than our actual holding.         A holding on the merits is not\n\ndispositive on the issue of qualified immunity.           See Cookish v.\n\nPowell, 945 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1991); Morales v. Ramirez, 906\n\nF.2d 784, 787 (1st Cir. 1990).        The law does not expect a public\n\nofficial, faced with the need to make an objectively reasonable\n\nreal-world judgment, to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions\n\nthat will be reached by a panel of federal appellate judges after\n\nbriefing, arguments, and full-fledged review. See Wilson, 526 U.S.\n\nat 617.\n\n            The plaintiffs, ably represented, go beyond Swain and\n\nArruda in an effort to convince us that reasonable correctional\n\nofficials should have realized the unconstitutionality of the ACI's\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fstrip search policy prior to March 17, 2000.                    They point to a line\n\nof cases stating that blanket strip searches of misdemeanant\n\narrestees,           conducted      without     particularized        suspicion,      are\n\nunconstitutional.            See, e.g., Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248,\n\n1255 (6th Cir. 1989); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 804 (2d Cir.\n\n1986); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir.\n\n1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 618-19 (9th Cir. 1984);\n\nHill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394-95 (10th Cir. 1984).                       These cases\n\ncome as no surprise; we cited many of them in Roberts II, 239 F.3d\n\nat 111-13.           For qualified immunity purposes, however, there are\n\nimportant distinctions between these cases and the case at hand.\n\n                In    the   first    place,     all   the    cases    upon    which   the\n\nplaintiffs rely deal with detentions in local jails and police\n\nstations.        In contrast, the case before us involves detentions in\n\na maximum security prison.               This distinction is quite meaningful:\n\nthe       case       law     emphasizes        that    prison        regulations      may\n\nconstitutionally impinge upon fundamental rights so long as such\n\nregulations          are    reasonably    related     to     legitimate      penological\n\ninterests.           See, e.g., Overton v. Bazzetta, 123 S. Ct. 2162, 2167\n\n(2003); Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 87 (1987).                     Within the walls\n\nof    a   maximum      security      prison,    the   need    to   preserve    internal\n\nsecurity is compelling.               Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-27\n\n(1984); Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir. 1996).                             We\n\nthink      it    follows      that    Rhode     Island      correctional      officials\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\freasonably could have regarded the stark differences between local\n\nlockups and maximum security prisons as pivotal in deciding whether\n\na particular security-oriented policy was necessary.     We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n           The population of a maximum security prison tends to be\n\nmuch more volatile and much less transient than that of a county\n\njail.   See Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 65 (2d Cir. 2001).   Thus,\n\nit is fairly debatable whether inmates in such a facility may be\n\nlikely to arrange for an outsider to bring them weapons or other\n\ncontraband by being arrested for a minor offense.     Compare, e.g.,\n\nWatt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't, 849 F.2d 195, 198 (5th\n\nCir. 1988) (declaring that \"a suspect jailed even temporarily on a\n\nminor offense could have the opportunity, if not searched, to\n\nsmuggle in weapons or contraband,\" so that strip-searching such\n\nsuspects \"is not an irrational attempt to foster . . . security\"),\n\nwith, e.g., Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 69 (2d Cir. 1988)\n\n(declaring that \"the risk of a misdemeanor arrestee's introducing\n\ncontraband into the general jail population simply d[oes] not\n\nwarrant a strip search of all arrestees\"). The debatable nature of\n\nthe question argues in favor of qualified immunity.    See Goyco de\n\nMaldonado v. Rivera, 849 F.2d 683, 688 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating\n\nthat an official \"need show no more than that [the question is\n\nclose] to prevail on his qualified immunity defense\"); Vazquez Rios\n\nv. Hernandez Colon, 819 F.2d 319, 328 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting that\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f\"the closeness of the call suggests that [the law] could not have\n\nbeen 'clearly established'\").\n\n          The   cases   upon    which   the   plaintiffs   rely   are\n\ndistinguishable in yet another salient respect. Those cases do not\n\ngainsay that the security concerns arising out of the intermingling\n\nof inmates are a significant counterweight in the balance that must\n\nbe struck between personal rights and practical necessities.      Read\n\nfor all they are worth, the plaintiffs' cases at most deny that\n\nthis counterweight is a sufficient justification in particular\n\ncircumstances (invariably, circumstances attending an arrestee's\n\ndetention at facilities such as jails and police stations).       See,\n\ne.g., Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255; Hill, 735 F.2d at 394; Logan v.\n\nShealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981).        Given the unique\n\nfeatures of the ACI's intake facilities, the composition of the\n\ninmate population, and the fact that the misdemeanant arrestees\n\ngenerally were not searched prior to their arrival at the ACI, it\n\nwas hardly unreasonable for Rhode Island correctional officials to\n\ncalibrate the balance differently.\n\n          In point of fact, a separate line of cases has emphasized\n\nthe need to defer to the judgment of correctional officials in\n\naddressing institutional security needs.      See, e.g., Overton, 123\n\nS. Ct. at 2167; Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404-05 (1974);\n\nHay v. Waldron, 834 F.2d 481, 486 (5th Cir. 1987); see also Bell,\n\n441 U.S. at 547-48.   After all, institutional security is \"perhaps\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fthe most legitimate of all penological goals.\" Overton, 123 S. Ct.\n\nat 2168; accord Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823 (1974).\n\n             In an opinion that is closer to this case than any other,\n\nthe Second Circuit upheld a policy in which a prison facility\n\nconducted random strip searches of all inmates, including pretrial\n\ndetainees.    See Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 1992).\n\nAdverting, among other things, to the fact that the plaintiff (a\n\npretrial     detainee)    commingled     with   sentenced   inmates   who   had\n\nhistories of violence and substance abuse, the court concluded that\n\nthe prison's policy was a reasonable response to the officials'\n\nconcerns.3    Id. at 78-79.\n\n             The short of the matter is that, throughout the last\n\nquarter of the twentieth century, courts had pursued two divergent\n\nlines of precedent.       This case, as we said in Roberts II, 239 F.3d\n\nat 111, fell along neither axis, but, rather, into the tenebrous\n\nmiddle.    We are mindful that there is a distinction for qualified\n\nimmunity purposes        between   an    unconstitutional   but   objectively\n\nreasonable act and a blatantly unconstitutional act.              Saucier, 533\n\nU.S. at 206; Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641.              Here, the lack of any\n\ndirect precedent and the undulating contours of the law during the\n\nrelevant period combine to persuade us that the constitutional\n\n\n     3\n      Of course, the plaintiff there had been arrested for an\noffense more serious than those attributed to the plaintiffs in\nthis case. Covino, 967 F.2d at 75 n.1. The Second Circuit did not\nbase its decision on this distinction, however, nor did it limit\nits holding to blanket strip searches of \"major\" offenders.\n\n                                        -19-\n\fviolation was not obvious; the defendants reasonably could have\n\nthought, prior to Roberts I, that there was room in the law for the\n\nACI's strip search policy.\n\n           The plaintiffs pose one last challenge to the assertion\n\nof a qualified immunity defense.       They note that, rather than\n\nstrip-searching all arrestees, officials at the ACI could have\n\nemployed less extreme measures such as conducting pat-down searches\n\nor segregating misdemeanant arrestees from the rest of the prison\n\npopulation.   In support of this view, they point to our conclusion\n\nthat the search policy was almost entirely unnecessary to control\n\nthe entry of contraband into the ACI.   See Roberts II, 239 F.3d at\n\n112.   But this too involves a judgment call.    In the relevant time\n\nframe, some cases indicated that blanket strip searches are never\n\nconstitutional when the security needs they address could be met by\n\nless intrusive means.     E.g., Giles, 746 F.2d at 617; Sostre v.\n\nPreiser, 519 F.2d 763, 764 (2d Cir. 1975).      Other cases suggested\n\nthat the availability of less intrusive means is irrelevant to the\n\nanalysis so long as officials reasonably could have concluded that\n\nsuch measures were more burdensome and less efficacious than\n\nblanket strip searches.    See, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 559 n.40;\n\nHay, 834 F.2d at 485; Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 566 (1st\n\nCir. 1985); see also Turner, 482 U.S. at 90-91 (emphasizing that\n\n\"prison officials do not have to set up and then shoot down every\n\nconceivable alternative method of accommodating the claimant's\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fconstitutional complaint\").4   Given this split in authority, we\n\nfind that the law on this matter was also not clearly established.\n\nTherefore, the defendants reasonably could have believed (until the\n\nfederal court declared Rhode Island's blanket strip search policy\n\nunconstitutional) that they were under no legal obligation to\n\nresort to alternative measures.\n\n          Our brethren suggest that we require an exact match with\n\nthe facts of previously decided cases before we will deny a\n\ndefendant the shield of qualified immunity. That is simply not so.\n\nWhat is so is that \"[t]he meaning of reasonableness [of a search]\n\nfor Fourth Amendment purposes is highly situational\" and requires\n\n\"a balancing of the need to search against the invasion which the\n\nsearch entails.\"   Wood, 89 F.3d at 928 (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).   The cases that our brethren cite in an\n\neffort to show that reasonable suspicion was clearly established as\n\na condition precedent to a strip search of a person in custody are\n\nno more on point than the cases, cited above, that authorize\n\nvarious exceptions to that generality.    Given this cacophony of\n\nvoices, a reasonable prison official, faced with the novel factual\n\nsituation that confronted those who were in charge of the ACI, had\n\nno way of knowing which voice should guide him in drawing the\n\n\n\n     4\n      Indeed, the Bell Court suggested that the lack of a history\nof discovered contraband on inmates' bodies might attest to the\neffectiveness of this search modality as a deterrent. Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559.\n\n                               -21-\n\fFourth Amendment balance. It is the absence of clear guidance, not\n\nthe absence of a perfect precedential match, that makes qualified\n\nimmunity appropriate here.\n\n           In this regard, our colleagues reprove us for attributing\n\nsignificant weight both to the dangers inherent in commingling\n\nviolent felons with misdemeanant arrestees and to distinctions\n\nbetween jails and maximum security prisons.           We plead guilty to\n\nthat charge.   But we attach weight to those factors because of our\n\nrespect for those who must maintain institutional security in the\n\nmost difficult of settings.      Correctional officials charged with\n\nthe operation of maximum security prisons have an unenviable task\n\n— and courts should be reluctant casually to impose on them\n\npersonal   liability   for   damages   in   the   absence   of     \"standards\n\nsufficiently clear and simple to be applied with a fair prospect of\n\nsurviving judicial     second-guessing      months   and   years    [later].\"\n\nAtwater v. City of Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 349 (2001).\n\n           To sum up, the district court mortally wounded the ACI's\n\nblanket strip search policy in Roberts I, and we administered the\n\nlast rites in Roberts II.       That policy is now dead and buried.\n\nWhile we have found the defendants' resolution of the Fourth\n\nAmendment balance incorrect, see Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 112-13, we\n\nconclude that, given the mixed signals sent by the case law, the\n\ndifficulties inherent in Fourth Amendment balancing in the prison\n\ncontext, the special features of the ACI, and the wide berth called\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\ffor by the qualified immunity doctrine, the defendants, prior to\n\nMarch 17, 2000, reasonably could have believed the ACI's policy to\n\nbe    both   justified    and    constitutional.     Put    another   way,   the\n\ndefendants did not have fair warning, prior to March 17, 2000, that\n\ntheir conduct was unlawful.           If judges can span the spectrum on\n\nthis sort of constitutional question, it would certainly be unfair\n\nto hold the defendants liable for doing nothing more blameworthy\n\nthan guessing incorrectly about how the courts ultimately would\n\nresolve the issue.        See Wilson, 526 U.S. at 618.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further.         This is a close case, but we do\n\nnot    require    public        officials   to   foretell    the   course    of\n\nconstitutional law with absolute accuracy in order to obtain the\n\nbalm of qualified immunity.            Id. at 617.    To the contrary, the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity is designed to protect \"all but the\n\nplainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"\n\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).           Concluding, as we do,\n\nthat the law as it existed when the events at issue occurred did\n\nnot clearly establish that the ACI's policy authorizing blanket\n\nstrip and body cavity searches violated the plaintiffs' Fourth\n\nAmendment rights, we would uphold the entry of summary judgment in\n\nthe defendants' favor on the basis of qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n                         — Separate Opinion Follows —\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f            BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, with whom COFFIN, Senior\n\nCircuit Judge, TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge,\n\njoin.   The defendants in this case were granted qualified immunity\n\nbecause, according to the district court, the law did not \"clearly\n\nestablish\" that reasonable suspicion was needed to strip search\n\npeople arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses.\n\nOur four respected colleagues agree with this analysis. We do not.\n\nThe opinion of our colleagues is wrong on the law, the logic that\n\nthey adopt is at odds with recent Supreme Court precedent regarding\n\nqualified   immunity,   and   we   believe   their   reasoning   will   put\n\nconstitutional rights at risk.\n\n            It is important to keep in mind what we are dealing with\n\nin this case.   The strip searches conducted here are \"perhaps 'the\n\ngreatest personal indignity' searching officials can visit upon an\n\nindividual.\"    Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 564 (1st Cir. 1985)\n\n(quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 594 (1979)).        According to\n\nRhode Island's written policies, these searches included a \"visual\n\nexamination of [the] groin and rectum.\"              Male arrestees were\n\nrequired to \"lift their penises and testicles on the officer's\n\ncommand to provide a clear view of the groin area.\"        Both male and\n\nfemale arrestees were required \"to bend over and spread the rectum\n\nto provide a clear view of the area.\"         Moreover, these searches\n\nwere conducted against harmless individuals. All of the plaintiffs\n\nin this case were arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\foffenses. By way of example, one of the plaintiffs, George Barber,\n\nloaned his car to his son in 1993 and the son received a traffic\n\nticket that was never paid.      Six years later, Barber was arrested\n\nbecause of the unpaid ticket, held at the Adult Correctional\n\nInstitutions    (\"the   ACI\")   overnight   and   strip   searched   twice.\n\nAnother plaintiff, Stephanie Clark, called police for assistance\n\nafter an auto accident and was arrested because a computer check\n\nshowed an outstanding arrest warrant for her failure to appear at\n\na probation review.     Clark had already finished her probation and\n\nthe warrant was issued in error.          She was taken to the ACI and\n\nstrip searched twice.\n\n             With these facts in mind, we turn to the legal issues in\n\nthis case.    We begin with whether it was the \"clearly established\"\n\nlaw in this circuit, as of March 17, 2000, that prison officials\n\nneeded reasonable suspicion to strip search non-violent, non-drug\n\nrelated minor offense arrestees.5           \"One tried and true way of\n\ndetermining whether [a] right was clearly established . . . is to\n\n\n     5\n      We note at the outset that the reasonable suspicion standard\nis not particularly demanding. Reasonable suspicion is \"something\nstronger than a mere hunch, but something weaker than probable\ncause.\"    Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 929 (1st Cir. 1996)\n(citation and quotation marks omitted). It is a standard that can\nbe satisfied by a wide range of circumstances, including \"the crime\ncharged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the\ncircumstances of the arrest.\" Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d\nCir. 1986); see also Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 113\n(1st Cir. 2001) (Roberts II) (stating that reasonable suspicion can\nbe based on \"observations of a particular inmate during a less\ninvasive pat-down frisk and clothing search, or based on contraband\nfound during that search\").\n\n                                   -25-\n\fask whether existing case law gave the defendants fair warning that\n\ntheir conduct violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\"\n\nSuboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office of the Suffolk Dist., 298 F.3d 81,\n\n93 (1st Cir. 2002).     Our colleagues describe this inquiry as an\n\narcheological dig, yet focus on only the top and bottom layers of\n\nthe excavation.   See Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997);\n\nArruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983).             Our colleagues\n\nchoose to ignore the cases that lie in the layers in between,\n\nthereby omitting consideration of relevant precedent.             A proper\n\nqualified immunity analysis requires a court to look \"at all\n\navailable case law.\"    Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth and Their\n\nFamilies, 274 F.3d 12, 23 (1st Cir. 2001).           We will therefore\n\nbriefly   trace   the   development   of   this   circuit's      reasonable\n\nsuspicion standard as it applies to strip searches.\n\n           The place to start is the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).        In that case, the Court\n\nupheld a strip and visual body cavity search of pretrial detainees\n\nwho had contact with prison visitors.       Id. at 560.     In doing so,\n\nthe Court conducted an analysis that balanced the need for the\n\nsearches against the invasion of personal rights.          Id.    Although\n\nthe Court said that the practice of strip searching individuals\n\n\"instinctively gives us the most pause,\" it found the searches\n\nconstitutional because of the security needs of the prison, i.e.,\n\nthe realistic possibility that contraband could pass from visitor\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fto detainee.      Id. at 558.    But the Court was clear to delineate the\n\nscope of its holding:\n\n             [W]e deal here with the question whether\n             visual body-cavity inspections . . . can ever\n             be conducted on less than probable cause.\n             Balancing the significant and legitimate\n             security interests of the institution against\n             the privacy interests of the inmates, we\n             conclude that they can.\n\nId.   at   560    (emphasis     in   original).   In   other   words,   Bell\n\nestablished the ceiling; it made clear that prison officials did\n\nnot necessarily need probable cause to strip search pretrial\n\ndetainees.       But Bell left the floor undefined.      Still unanswered\n\nwas the question of whether prison officials needed any level of\n\nparticularized suspicion that detainees were carrying contraband or\n\nweapons or in a position to receive them from others before\n\nconducting strip searches.\n\n             Our early cases applying Bell to the prison environment\n\ndealt largely with situations involving prison visitors. In one of\n\nour first prison visitor cases, Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556\n\n(1st Cir. 1985), we held that:\n\n             [T]he    Constitution    requires    a    more\n             particularized level of suspicion to justify\n             the   humiliating   and   intrusive   searches\n             conducted here. While we need not define here\n             precisely   what   level   of   individualized\n             suspicion is required . . . a rule unabashedly\n             requiring none cannot be reconciled with the\n             Fourth Amendment.\n\nId. at 567; see also Cochrane v. Quattrocchi, 949 F.2d 11, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).       It is also noteworthy that we surveyed the legal\n\n                                       -27-\n\flandscape as it existed at the time and grouped arrestees into the\n\ncategory    of    strip   search     scenarios     in    which   particularized\n\nsuspicion was necessary.           See Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 565.          This\n\ngrouping was merely a foreshadowing of things to come.\n\n            In Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922 (1st Cir. 1996), we\n\nclarified that the level of particularized suspicion required\n\nbefore subjecting prison visitors to strip searches was \"reasonable\n\nsuspicion.\"      Id. at 929.    We said that \"a strip search cannot be\n\njustified absent some quantum of individualized suspicion.                      In\n\ndetermining the level of individualized suspicion . . . courts have\n\nconverged upon one common benchmark:             the standard of 'reasonable\n\nsuspicion.'\"        Id.   at   928   (emphasis     in    original)     (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            Our cases addressing the reasonable suspicion standard in\n\nthe context of strip and visual body cavity searches were not\n\nlimited to prison visitors.          We required reasonable suspicion for\n\nstrip   searches     at   border     crossings.         See   United   States   v.\n\nUricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir. 1991).                 And most\n\nsignificantly for this case, we held in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d\n\n1 (1st Cir. 1997), that there must be reasonable suspicion to\n\nconduct strip searches of arrestees.             Id. at 7.\n\n            In Swain, we examined our prior cases dealing with prison\n\nvisitors and border searches, as well as relevant cases from other\n\ncircuits.        We concluded that \"it is clear that at least the\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\freasonable suspicion standard governs strip and visual body cavity\n\nsearches in the arrestee context as well.\"              Id.    This ruling was\n\nconsistent with cases from numerous other circuits.6\n\n               Our brethren mischaracterize the holding in Swain.           They\n\nparaphrase       Swain   as    holding    that    reasonable    suspicion     is\n\n\"ordinarily\" required for arrestees and that strip searches \"ought\n\nnot lightly to be indulged.\"             We respectfully disagree with our\n\ncolleagues' description of Swain's holding.               Swain's holding is\n\nclear    and    unqualified.      Swain    does   not   say   that   reasonable\n\nsuspicion is only sometimes required.             Rather than paraphrase the\n\nwords of Swain, we shall quote its holding directly: \"A strip and\n\nvisual body cavity search of an arrestee must be justified, at the\n\nleast, by a reasonable suspicion.\"           117 F.3d at 5.      It is hard to\n\nimagine a more clear statement of the law.\n\n               Our colleagues fail to mention that Swain contained\n\nanother holding that is especially relevant to this case.                   When\n\nanalyzing the issue of qualified immunity we stated:\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      See Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193\n(11th Cir. 1992); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.\n1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d\n796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1020 (1987); Jones\nv. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 742 (8th Cir. 1985); Stewart v. Lubbock\nCounty, Tex., 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 475\nU.S. 1053 (1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 618 (9th Cir.\n1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053 (1985); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d\n391, 394 (10th Cir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007,\n1013 (4th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 942 (1982).\n\n                                     -29-\n\f          Furthermore, while some courts have suggested\n          that a higher standard may be necessary to\n          justify a strip search and visual body cavity\n          inspection, it was clearly established at the\n          time of the search [May 18, 1993] that the\n          Fourth   Amendment   requires   at   least   a\n          reasonable suspicion to conduct these types of\n          searches.\n\n\nId. (emphasis in original).     This ruling too was in accord with\n\ndecisions by other circuits.7\n\n          In short, Swain states unequivocally that reasonable\n\nsuspicion is required to strip search arrestees and that this\n\nrequirement was clearly established as early as 1993, well before\n\nthe dates in question here.    These rulings were in conformity with\n\ncircuits across the country.\n\n          Despite this overwhelming precedent, our colleagues claim\n\nthat Swain's holdings could not have given the defendants fair\n\n\n     7\n      See Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 398 (10th Cir. 1993)\n(holding that it was clearly established that a strip search policy\napplied to minor offense detainees without particularized\nreasonable suspicion was unlawful); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255 (\"The\ndecisions of all the federal courts of appeals that have considered\nthe issue reached the same conclusion: a strip search of a person\narrested for a traffic violation or other minor offense not\nnormally associated with violence and concerning whom there is no\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is carrying\nor concealing a weapon or other contraband, is unreasonable. We\nbelieve the right of such a person to be free of such a search was\n'clearly established' on October 21, 1986.\"); Weber, 804 F.2d at\n803 (denying qualified immunity for defendants who performed\nsuspicionless strip searches on arrestees because \"at least eleven\ncircuit   court   decisions   .   .   .   hold   similar   policies\nunconstitutional\"); Jones, 770 F.2d at 742 n.4 (denying defendants\nqualified immunity because the Fourth Amendment's protection\nagainst suspicionless strip searches of arrestees was well\nestablished).\n\n                                 -30-\n\fwarning that the reasonable suspicion standard would apply to them.\n\nThey say that Swain involved an arrestee who was held alone in a\n\nsingle cell, whereas the plaintiffs in this case were commingled\n\nwith other prisoners.   Admittedly, our precedent does not speak to\n\ncommingling specifically.      But that fact does not mean that the\n\ndefendants are entitled to qualified immunity. See Hatch, 274 F.3d\n\nat 23 (although \"[o]ur own precedents are . . . inconclusive,\" the\n\nlaw was clearly established by \"an emerging body of decisional law\n\noutside our own circuit\").       Commingling may not always pose a\n\nsecurity risk.   It is not commingling, per se, that presents a\n\nsecurity problem; it is commingling that involves a risk of illegal\n\ntraffic among the commingled inmates.\n\n          As early as Blackburn, we rejected the argument that \"the\n\nsecurity needs of a prison can, standing alone, properly justify\n\nthe 'complete withdrawal' of Fourth Amendment rights from all who\n\nenter [a prison].\"    771 F.2d at 563 (emphasis in original); see\n\nalso Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (\"An indiscriminate strip search\n\npolicy   routinely   applied    to   detainees   .   .   .   cannot   be\n\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative\n\nease in attending to security considerations.\").\n\n          Cases from other circuits are more explicit in rejecting\n\nthe commingling argument advanced by the defendants.8 Most notable\n\n\n     8\n      See Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 68, 69 (2d Cir. 1988) (ruling\nthat a blanket strip search of all misdemeanor arrestees was not\npermissible simply because those arrestees were commingled among\n\n                                 -31-\n\fis the Sixth Circuit's holding in Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248\n\n(6th Cir. 1989):\n\n          [T]he fact of intermingling [with other prison\n          inmates] alone has never been found to justify\n          such a search without consideration of the\n          nature of the offense and the question of\n          whether there is any reasonable basis for\n          concern that the particular detainee will\n          attempt   to   introduce  weapons   or   other\n          contraband into the institution.\n\nId. at 1254.   In short, the cases from other circuits, when read in\n\nconjunction with our own precedent, would not permit a reasonable\n\nprison official to conclude that minor offense arrestees could be\n\nstrip searched without reasonable suspicion simply because the\n\nprison officials decide to mix the arrestees with other prisoners.\n\n          Our colleagues say that Swain could not have provided\n\nfair warning for another reason. According to our brethren, Swain,\n\nas well as the cases from other circuits upon which it relied,\n\ninvolved local jails rather than prisons, like the ACI.         The\n\ndistinction between jails and maximum security prisons is a crucial\n\nleg upon which our colleagues' opinion rests.      It is here that\n\n\narraigned inmates); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617-18 (9th\nCir. 1984) (\"Defendants' heavy reliance on the intermingling of its\ntemporary detainees with the general [jail] population is misplaced\nbecause     such    intermingling     is    both    limited     and\navoidable.\")(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)\n(alteration in original); Chapman, 989 F.2d at 396 (rejecting the\ndefendant's argument \"that the invasion posed by his policy is\njustified by the need for jail security because women detainees\nmust be incarcerated in one cell with the general jail\npopulation\"); Hill, 735 F.2d at 394 (rejecting intermingling\nargument because \"intermingling is only one factor to consider in\njudging the constitutionality of a strip search\").\n\n                                -32-\n\ftheir   incomplete    archeological     excavation     which    we   mentioned\n\nearlier becomes important.     The cases that our colleagues ignored\n\ninvolved the early development of our reasonable suspicion standard\n\nas it applied to strip searches of prison visitors.              At issue in\n\nthose cases were both jails and prisons.        See Wood, 89 F.3d at 925\n\n(prison); Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 559 (county jail).\n\n           Even more relevant is the fact that one of those cases\n\ndealt with the ACI.    See Cochrane, 949 F.2d at 12.       In Cochrane, we\n\nvacated a judgment granting directed verdicts for ACI officials\n\ndefending the strip search of an inmate's daughter.             We said that:\n\n           [A]bsent any evidence that appellant ever\n           violated a prison visitation rule, or even\n           supplied Cochrane with drugs, a reasonable\n           juror could have concluded that Cochrane's\n           contraband drugs were supplied by prison\n           officials or other inmates.   Thus, the jury\n           could have found that the strip search of\n           appellant was unreasonable because it was\n           based on no \"individualized suspicion.\"\n\n\nId. at 13 (emphasis in original). Our colleagues maintain that the\n\ndefendants were justified in believing that no reasonable suspicion\n\nwas required in this case in part because the defendants \"must\n\nmaintain institutional security in the most difficult of settings.\"\n\nYet the same setting and security considerations were not enough to\n\ndefeat the requirement for individualized suspicion in Cochrane.\n\nWe do not understand on what legal basis our colleagues can now say\n\nthat    those   same     security     needs     made     the      defendants'\n\nunconstitutional     strip   searches      reasonable.         Certainly   the\n\n                                    -33-\n\fdefendants had fair warning that the reasonable suspicion standard\n\nwould be applied to them because, in fact, they had already been\n\nheld to that standard in the past.\n\n           Of   course,   one    difference   between   Cochrane   and    the\n\npresent case is that Cochrane involved prison visitors, not minor\n\noffense arrestees.    But this fact does not help the defendants; if\n\nanything, it further highlights why the defendants had fair warning\n\nthat their strip search policies were unreasonable.\n\n           The Supreme Court has explained that prison visitors\n\n\"invite a host of security problems\" because they can pass weapons\n\nand contraband \"to an inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant\n\nobservers.\"     Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 586 (1984).           It is\n\nwell   recognized,   however,     that   individuals    arrested   for   non-\n\nviolent, non-drug related minor offenses do not present the same\n\nsecurity risk as prison visitors.        See Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 111;\n\nGiles, 746 F.2d at 617.         This is because arrests, unlike visits,\n\nare not planned events.          They are random and do not afford an\n\narrestee the opportunity to hatch a scheme to smuggle contraband\n\ninto a prison.     As the Second Circuit has explained:\n\n           It is far less obvious that misdemeanor\n           arrestees frequently or even occasionally hide\n           contraband in their bodily orifices. Unlike\n           persons already in jail who receive contact\n           visits, arrestees do not ordinarily have\n           notice that they are about to be arrested and\n           thus an opportunity to hide something. For the\n           exceptions--for example, a person who is\n           allowed to visit the bathroom unescorted\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\f          before an arrest--reasonable suspicion may\n          well exist.\nShain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2001). Our brethren\n\noverlook the important fact that the Court in Bell authorized strip\n\nsearches of detainees only after the detainees had come into\n\ncontact with prison visitors.    See 441 U.S. at 558.   The present\n\ncase involves people brought to the ACI because they were arrested,\n\nsometimes mistakenly as the record reveals, for non-violent, non-\n\ndrug related minor offenses.    They did not come into contact with\n\nprison visitors.\n\n          Our colleagues concoct a hypothetical situation in which\n\nan inmate arranges for an outsider to bring weapons or contraband\n\ninside the prison by staging an incident that would lead to the\n\noutsider being arrested for a minor offense.     With due respect,\n\nthis is chimerical.   The only case our colleagues have exhumed to\n\nsupport their scenario is Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't,\n\n849 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1988).   They claim Watt stands for the idea\n\nthat \"a suspect jailed even temporarily on a minor offense could\n\nhave the opportunity, if not searched, to smuggle weapons or\n\ncontraband.\"   Id. at 198.      The very next sentence from Watt,\n\nhowever, shows that the quote upon which they rely is applicable\n\nonly to those arrestees charged with weapons, shoplifting or drug\n\noffenses or those with a history of such offenses.         See id.\n\n(\"Limiting the searches generally to those offenders charged with\n\nor having a criminal history of narcotics, shoplifting or weapons\n\n\n                                -35-\n\fcharges is not an irrational attempt to foster jail security . . .\n\n.\").    Watt does not support our colleagues' theory that non-\n\nviolent, non-drug related minor offense arrestees will conduct\n\ncoordinated smuggling schemes to infiltrate prisons with contraband\n\nand weapons.\n\n           Perhaps more importantly, there is no evidence in the\n\nrecord to support our colleagues' hypothetical.            In fact, the\n\nrecord undermines it.   At no time has the ACI ever found weapons or\n\ncontraband in an arrestee's rectum or genital area.         Roberts II,\n\n239 F.3d at 112 n.6.      Only on one occasion has the ACI found\n\ncontraband in the body cavity of a minor offense arrestee.       Id.    In\n\nthat instance, the arrestee was hiding a bag of drugs in his mouth.\n\nId.    All the other contraband that the ACI has found on minor\n\noffense arrestees has been discovered in their clothing.             It is\n\nobvious that the intrusive and degrading searches that the ACI\n\nchose to institute were not required to find this contraband.          Id.\n\n           No historical analysis of our strip search cases would be\n\ncomplete without a close examination of our holding in Arruda v.\n\nFair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983).     Our colleagues say that Arruda\n\nis a case with \"considerable force\" because it \"reasonably can be\n\nread as saying that the risk that any prisoner in a maximum\n\nsecurity   facility   might   receive   weapons    or   contraband    from\n\nvisitors, renegade guards, or others is enough to justify a blanket\n\nstrip search policy.\" (emphasis added).           Characterized in this\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\fmanner,     Arruda    forms       another       critical     leg    upon     which    our\n\ncolleagues' opinion stands.           Their expansive reading of Arruda is\n\nunwarranted.    Arruda is a totally different case than what we face\n\nhere.     It is so different that no reasonable official could have\n\nread Arruda to authorize suspicionless strip searches of minor\n\noffense arrestees.      This is true for three reasons.\n\n            First, Arruda was decided twenty years ago and, as we\n\nhave already discussed, our cases since Arruda have made clear that\n\nreasonable suspicion is required to strip search arrestees.                           See\n\nSwain, 117 F.3d at 7.\n\n            Second,    Arruda       was     a    case    involving     \"particularly\n\ndangerous prisoners.\"             710 F.2d at 887.            These prisoners were\n\nconvicted    felons    assigned      to     a   special      cell   block,    which   we\n\ndescribed as a \"'prison within a prison,' designed to hold the most\n\ndangerous inmates.\" Id. The plaintiff himself was assigned to this\n\nspecial cell block for assaulting another prisoner.                            Id.    In\n\naddition, the plaintiff testified that, while a prisoner, he\n\npossessed    drugs    and     a    weapon.       Id.    at   888.     It     is   beyond\n\ncomprehension how the defendants can equate extraordinarily violent\n\nconvicted felons with people who have been arrested for minor\n\noffenses.\n\n            Third, and most pertinently, what we identified in Arruda\n\nas the \"closest question,\" id.,                  most analogous to the instant\n\ncase, was whether prisoners who were convicted felons needed to be\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\fsearched en route from cell to library or infirmary, even though\n\naccompanied by a guard. Like the misdemeanor arrestees here, there\n\nwould seem to be no basis for any suspicion that such inmates would\n\npossess contraband.      The record in Arruda, however, revealed a\n\nnumber of instances when guards were found to be involved in\n\nsmuggling drugs to prisoners. This caused us to hold, \"[G]iven the\n\nproblem   of   prison   employee    involvement   with   contraband,   the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion is not unreasonable.\" Id.; but see id.\n\nat 891, 890 (Maletz, J., dissenting in part) (\"When one of the\n\nprimary justifications for strip searches in these circumstances\n\nrests on the institution's inability to control its own staff the\n\nscales tip decidedly in favor of the inmate. . . . I am constrained\n\nto conclude that routine visual strip searches before and after\n\nvisits to the prison library and prison hospital are unreasonable,\n\nabsent some level of cause.\").\n\n           Twenty years have passed since we decided Arruda and the\n\ncase law barring suspicionless strip searches of minor offense\n\narrestees has proliferated.        And Swain, with its clear recognition\n\nthat a strip search requires reasonable suspicion, has been on the\n\nbooks of this circuit since 1997.       The record in this case does not\n\nreveal a prison employee drug smuggling problem.           There remains\n\nonly the speculative risk that a non-violent, non-drug related\n\nmisdemeanant, randomly arrested, might fortuitously be a bearer of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\fcontraband.    That   is   not   enough,   in    our   view,   to   permit   the\n\ndefendants to escape liability for their unconstitutional acts.\n\n            The only similarity between Arruda and the present case\n\nis that the correctional facilities in both cases are maximum\n\nsecurity prisons.      This is the vital similarity upon which the\n\ndefendants' argument relies.        Despite the key differences I have\n\ndescribed above, our colleagues are persuaded by this single\n\nsimilarity.     Our colleagues say that prison officials cannot be\n\nexpected to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions that we\n\njudges will make after full briefing and argument.              We agree with\n\nthat statement as a general matter.             But that is not to say that\n\nprison officials have no responsibility to analyze the law. All of\n\nthe individual defendants here are high level prison officials.9\n\nThey are not entry-level prison guards who have no access to legal\n\nadvice and have superiors who have failed to supply any training on\n\nconstitutional law whatsoever. The defendants in this case are the\n\nsuperiors and should be held to the standard of a \"reasonably\n\ncompetent public official [who] should know the law governing his\n\nconduct.\"     Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 819 (1982).                The\n\nqualified immunity analysis is based on an objective standard. See\n\n\n\n     9\n      The individual defendants include the former and current\ndirector of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, the former\nand current warden of the Intake Services Center at the ACI, the\nwarden of the women's facility at the ACI, and the chief of\nrecruitment and training at the Rhode Island Department of\nCorrections.\n\n                                    -39-\n\fSuboh, 298 F.3d at 95.      This necessarily implies some informed and\n\nprofessional analysis.          Merely to take refuge in the concept that\n\nthe ACI is a maximum security prison, without identifying any\n\nrealistic distinction between the situation in Arruda and the\n\nsituation that the defendants were confronted with at the ACI,\n\nfalls far short of any credible analysis of the state of the law\n\nboth within and outside this circuit.\n\n            We    close   our    review   of   the   relevant   legal   history\n\nregarding strip searches with an important observation.                     Our\n\ncolleagues do not cite to a single case which permits suspicionless\n\nstrip searches of non-violent, non-drug related minor offense\n\narrestees.       It is quite amazing that they can claim the law is\n\nambiguous but fail to provide a single case that directly supports\n\ntheir position.      The only case our colleagues offer is Covino v.\n\nPatrissi, 967 F.2d 73 (2d Cir. 1992).                But that case, as our\n\ncolleagues readily admit, is not on point. The plaintiff in Covino\n\nwas not arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses\n\nlike the plaintiffs in this case.          He was arrested for kidnaping a\n\nchild under the age of sixteen and was ultimately sentenced to 20\n\nto 35 years in prison.          Id. at 75 n.1.       In addition, the prison\n\nsuperintendent in Covino testified that \"occasionally contraband\n\nand drugs were found secreted in an inmate's rectum.\"              Id. at 79.\n\nAs we have already explained, the evidence in this case is to the\n\ncontrary.\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\f              Without direct legal support, our brethren are forced to\n\nargue that generalized statements from certain cases made the law\n\nso ambiguous that the defendants could not have had fair warning.\n\nOur colleagues argue, for example, that there exists \"a separate\n\nline of cases [that] has emphasized the need to defer to the\n\njudgment of correctional officials in addressing institutional\n\nsecurity needs.\"        If these types of sweeping statements are enough\n\nto   shield    prison    officials   from   liability   for   their   illegal\n\nactions, then there is the significant risk that qualified immunity\n\nwill always attach.\n\n              It is this concern that brings us to our final point.        Up\n\nto now, we have argued that our colleagues analysis of our legal\n\nhistory is incomplete and untenable.         This is not the only flaw in\n\ntheir opinion. We are deeply troubled by the weight our colleagues\n\ngive to our statement in Roberts II that institutional security\n\nconcerns in this case \"fall somewhere between\" those exhibited in\n\nSwain and Arruda.        239 F.3d at 111.    Our colleagues describe this\n\nstatement as an acknowledgment that the ACI's strip search policy\n\nfell into a \"gray area\" of the law.         We respectfully disagree.     The\n\nRoberts II statement merely recognizes the obvious: that the facts\n\nof the present case fall somewhere between those of Swain and\n\nArruda. Such an observation is not surprising. Indeed, most cases\n\nwill fall somewhere between Swain and Arruda because those two\n\ncases represent the opposite ends of the spectrum.              Swain was a\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\fcase involving an arrestee who was placed in a cell in a local\n\npolice station.         In contrast, Arruda involved extraordinarily\n\nviolent convicted felons who were confined to a special security\n\nsection of a maximum security prison.                What our colleagues have\n\ndone is to construe a dictum probably intended to soften criticism\n\nof the prison officials into a sweeping carte blanche, protecting\n\nofficials    for    a   wide   swath   of     conduct    elsewhere     long   since\n\nforbidden.\n\n             Placing so much weight on the Roberts II statement runs\n\nthe   risk   of    creating    an   impenetrable      defense    for   government\n\nofficials.     Our colleagues' reliance on the Roberts II statement\n\nimplies that qualified immunity will only be denied in this circuit\n\nwhen the facts of the case at bar are the same as those in\n\npreviously    decided     cases.       This    risk     is   compounded   by   our\n\ncolleagues' statement that Swain could not give the defendants fair\n\nwarning because it is not \"a very exact match\" to the facts of this\n\ncase.\n\n             Such reasoning flouts the Supreme Court's holding in Hope\n\nv. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002).         In Hope, the Court admonished the\n\nEleventh Circuit for finding the law clearly established only when\n\nthe facts of previous cases were \"fundamentally similar\" to the\n\npresent case.      Id. at 739.      The Court said that such an approach\n\nwas a \"rigid gloss on the qualified immunity standard . . . [that]\n\nis not consistent with our cases.\"             Id.    The Court explained that\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\f\"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates\n\nestablished law even in novel factual circumstances,\" and that\n\n\"[a]lthough earlier cases involving 'fundamentally similar' facts\n\ncan provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law\n\nis clearly established, they are not necessary to such a finding.\n\nThe same is true of cases with 'materially similar' facts.\"           Id. at\n\n741.\n\n            Our colleagues respond by saying that \"[i]t is the\n\nabsence    of   clear    guidance,    not   the   absence   of   a   perfect\n\nprecedential    match,    that    makes   qualified   immunity   appropriate\n\nhere.\"     In short, they reject Swain as giving \"clear guidance\"\n\nbecause of factual differences, while claiming allegiance to Hope's\n\nruling that \"fundamentally similar\" facts are not necessary.            This\n\nseems to us an attempt to have it both ways.\n\n            Our colleagues may well be correct that the strip search\n\npolicy at issue in this case, and others like it, are \"dead and\n\nburied.\"    But their qualified immunity analysis will live on; it\n\nwill undoubtedly be used in future cases involving other important\n\nconstitutional rights.           The qualified immunity defense is \"an\n\nattempt to balance competing values: not only the importance of a\n\ndamages remedy to protect the rights of citizens . . . but also\n\n'the need to protect officials who are required to exercise their\n\ndiscretion and the related public interest in encouraging the\n\nvigorous exercise of official authority.'\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 807\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\f(quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 504-06 (1978)).                           By\n\nfinding ambiguity in our cases where there is none, and by implying\n\nthat previous cases must be \"a very exact match\" before they can\n\ngive fair warning for purposes of the qualified immunity analysis,\n\nour brethren have tipped the balance away from the Constitution.\n\nThey have gone far toward granting absolute immunity under the\n\ncloak of qualified immunity.               We believe that this court is\n\nobliged    not   only   to    give   due    deference     to   the   judgment      of\n\ngovernment officials but to insist that the constitutional rights\n\nof individuals be vigilantly protected.\n\n            If   the    bar    to    a    remedy    is   set   too     high,      then\n\nconstitutional rights are in jeopardy.              Government officials will\n\nhave less incentive to change their illegal policies on their own\n\naccord    because   the      deterrent     effect   of   damages     is    lacking.\n\nAggrieved individuals will have less incentive to challenge those\n\npolicies    because     monetary     compensation        for   their      harms     is\n\nunavailable.     In the end, unconstitutional government action is\n\nmore likely to go unchanged.                That is our ultimate concern.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -44-\n\f",

These searches, conducted pursuant to a longstanding institutional policy, encompassed both strip searches (i.e., visual inspections of the naked body) and visual body cavity searches (i.e., inspections of the anal and genital areas).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After the courts struck down the strip search policy, the plaintiffs sued the State of Rhode Island and a number of prison officials for damages sustained as a result of the illegal intrusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' suit invoked 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000). Because the State is immune from suits for damages under section 1983, <i>see Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police,</i> 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <i>Johnson v. Rodriguez,</i> 943 F.2d 104, 108-09 (1st Cir.1991), the controversy before us focuses on the liability vel non of the individual defendants. After some preliminary skirmishing, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of those defendants on the basis of qualified immunity. A panel of this court reversed that ruling, but the full court subsequently granted rehearing en banc and (as is customary in such instances) ordered the panel opinion withdrawn. The court now divides equally and thus affirms the district court's ruling. The judges who subscribe to this opinion believe that affirmance is fully warranted: upon a broad review of the preexisting law and its application to the unusual situation at the ACI, we conclude that, when the underlying events occurred, prudent prison officials reasonably could have believed that Rhode Island's strip search policy was constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we rehearse the facts in the light most sympathetic to the non-moving parties (here, the plaintiffs), indulging all reasonable inferences in their favor. <i>See, e.g., Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2000). Here, however, that praxis has little bearing, for the facts upon which our decision turns are largely undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike other states, Rhode Island has no regional or county detention facilities. It operates only a single, all-purpose penitentiary: the ACI. Centrally located in Cranston, Rhode Island, the ACI comprises seven separate maximum security facilities. Two of those units &#8212; one for women and the other for men &#8212; receive all persons committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections regardless of the nature of their offenses. At the times material hereto, these intake facilities housed an array of prisoners ranging from newly sentenced felons to convicts under protective custody to pretrial detainees to arrestees. All of these individuals, except for detainees held in protective custody, were commingled while in various parts of the intake facilities. Detainees held in protective custody used the same areas as other inmates but at different times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the currency of this arrangement, Rhode Island maintained written policies that required all new entrants into the ACI, including misdemeanant arrestees, to undergo strip and body cavity searches. In 1999, Craig Roberts ran afoul of this policy. Local police, having made a routine stop of a motor vehicle in which Roberts was a passenger, learned that the Rhode Island Family Court had issued a body attachment &#8212; the functional equivalent of a writ of arrest &#8212; addressed to him. Although Roberts protested that the body attachment had been withdrawn and produced what purported to be documentation to that effect, the police detained him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with the customary procedure, the police transported Roberts to the ACI. Upon his admission, he was twice subjected to strip and body cavity searches. These searches uncovered no drugs, weapons, or other contraband. Shortly thereafter, a sheriff verified that the body attachment had been withdrawn. Roberts was released.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberts was gone but not forgotten. He brought suit in the federal district court alleging that the strip searches had violated his constitutional rights. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that the strip searches had offended Roberts's rights under the Fourth Amendment and enjoined the State from continuing to enforce the written policies then in effect. <i>Roberts v. Rhode Island,</i> 175 F.Supp.2d 176, 183 (D.R.I.2000) (<i>Roberts I</i>). We affirmed. <i>Roberts v. Rhode Island,</i> 239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir. 2001) (<i>Roberts II</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rhode Island abandoned the proscribed policy from and after the date of the district court's decision (March 17, 2000). Thereafter, eighteen plaintiffs &#8212; all of whom had been arrested for non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors and subjected to strip and body cavity searches prior to that date &#8212; brought a new action in the federal district court on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. In their class-action complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the searches violated their constitutional rights and sought money damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit named as defendants the State and a galaxy of prison officials. Upon the defendants' motion, the district court dismissed Roberts's claim for damages based on the doctrine of res judicata. <i>See, e.g., Allen v. McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980) (stating that res judicata precludes a plaintiff from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in an earlier action against the same defendant prescinding from the same set of operative facts); <i>Kale v. Combined Ins. Co.,</i> 924 F.2d 1161, 1165-66 (1st Cir. 1991) (same). The court thereafter entered summary judgment against the remaining plaintiffs. The court reasoned that, prior to the decision in <i>Roberts I,</i> it was not clearly established that prison officials needed some particularized suspicion before strip-searching misdemeanant arrestees who were about to be introduced into the general population at a maximum security prison (and, therefore, that the defendants enjoyed the protection of qualified immunity). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review orders granting summary judgment de novo. <i>Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 364, 369 (1st Cir.2002). Where, as here, a party's entitlement to summary judgment hinges on a claim of qualified immunity, we must balance the need to vindicate constitutional rights against the need to insulate public officials from civil litigation that might unduly inhibit the assiduous discharge of their duties. <i>See Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). In balancing those competing needs, we employ a three-part algorithm. <i>Suboh v. Dist. Att'y's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth and Their Families,</i> 274 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir.2001). The threshold question is whether the plaintiffs have established a constitutional violation. <i>Hope v. Pelzer,</i> 536 U.S. 730, 736, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002); <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). The second question deals with fair warning; it asks whether the law was clearly established at the time of the constitutional violation. <i>Hope,</i> 536 U.S. at 739-41, 122 S.Ct. 2508; <i>Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 638-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034. The final question is whether a reasonable official, situated similarly to the defendant(s), would have understood that the conduct at issue contravened the clearly established law. <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the first part of the algorithm need not detain us. We acknowledge that strip searches are intrusive and degrading (and, therefore, should not be unreservedly available to law enforcement officers). The <i>Roberts</i> decisions exemplify this thinking; they hold unequivocally that the ACI's policy of strip-searching persons arrested for non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors, in the absence of particularized suspicion, violated the Constitution. <i>See Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 113; <i>Roberts I,</i> 175 F.Supp.2d at 183. The questions on which this appeal turns, therefore, involve the second and third branches of the qualified immunity algorithm. We must determine whether the law was clearly established, prior to March 17, 2000, to the effect that prison officials need at least reasonable suspicion before subjecting misdemeanant arrestees to strip searches when introducing them into the general population of a maximum security prison, and whether a reasonable prison official, situated similarly to the defendants, would have understood at that time that the policy in place at the ACI transgressed the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bases for these determinations often overlap, the instant plaintiffs cannot prevail unless we determine both questions favorably to them. Thus, we begin our analysis with an examination of whether the law can be said to have been \"clearly established\" at or before the critical time (March 17, 2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The degree to which the law was clearly established as of a particular date is a matter for the court to determine. <i>Elder v. Holloway,</i> 510 U.S. 510, 516, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 127 L.Ed.2d 344 (1994); <i>Siegert v. Gilley,</i> 500 U.S. 226, 232, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991); <i>Diaz v. Martinez,</i> 112 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fundamental justification for the qualified immunity defense is that public officials performing discretionary functions should be free to act without fear of punitive litigation except when they fairly can anticipate that their conduct will give rise to liability for damages. <i>Davis v. Scherer,</i> 468 U.S. 183, 195, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984). That anticipation depends, in large part, on the extent to which legal rules are clearly established. <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The standard is an objective one. <i>Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034; <i>Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> 193 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.1999). It follows, then, that an inquiry into the reasonableness of an officer's conduct must focus on the discernible contours of the law at the time of the alleged act or omission. <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 22-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To attain the necessary perspective, an inquiring court must look back in time and conduct the juridical equivalent of an archeological dig. The court must canvass controlling authority in its own jurisdiction and, if none exists, attempt to fathom whether there is a consensus of persuasive authority elsewhere. <i>See Wilson v. Layne,</i> 526 U.S. 603, 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999); <i>Brady v. Dill,</i> 187 F.3d 104, 116 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exploration is not limited to cases directly on point. Because \"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances,\" <i>Hope,</i> 536 U.S. at 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508, overcoming a qualified immunity defense does not require a plaintiff to show that either the particular conduct complained of or some materially indistinguishable conduct has previously been found unlawful. <i>See United States v. Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. 259, 268-71, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997); <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 535 n. 12, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). Still, the relevant legal rights and obligations must be particularized enough that a reasonable official can be expected to extrapolate from them and conclude that a certain course of conduct will violate the law. <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Consequently, if the operative legal principles are clearly established only at a level of generality so high that officials cannot fairly anticipate the legal consequences of specific actions, then the requisite notice is lacking. The bottom line is that the qualified immunity defense prevails unless the unlawfulness of the challenged conduct is \"apparent.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the degree of clarity in the law relevant to this case. In conducting our appraisal, we have endeavored to take into account all the decisional law, in and out of our own circuit, that was on the books at the time of the events in question. <i>See Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 268-69, 117 S.Ct. 1219; <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the margins, the lines are easily plotted. On the one hand, courts long have viewed blanket strip searches as extreme intrusions upon Fourth Amendment rights. <i>See, e.g., Bell v. Wolfish,</i> 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); <i>Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,</i> 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983). On the other hand, security is a paramount concern in prison environments, and courts long have recognized that unpleasantly intrusive security measures, up to and including blanket strip searches, may be proper in such settings. <i>See Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 560-62, 99 S.Ct. 1861; <i>Bonitz v. Fair,</i> 804 F.2d 164, 170 (1st Cir.1986). The constitutional line that separates permissible from impermissible uses of these methods is imprecise and context-specific. In the last analysis, plotting that line requires a determination of what is reasonable under a given set of circumstances. <i>Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861; <i>United States v. Chamorro,</i> 687 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty, of course, is that this formulation, while legally respectable, does not go very far toward curing the imprecision with which decisionmakers must grapple. This is inevitable &#8212; or nearly so &#8212; given the subject matter. In the best of circumstances, \"[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.\" <i>Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has acknowledged, in a qualified immunity case, \"the difficulty of determining whether particular searches or seizures comport with the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 644, 107 S.Ct. 3034. And that difficulty is compounded where, as here, the determination involves gauging whether a serious intrusion is reasonable in an incarcerative environment. <i>See Swain v. Spinney,</i> 117 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these basic tenets in mind, we examine the two First Circuit decisions that bear most closely on this case. Neither comparison is very exact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with <i>Swain.</i> There, police arrested a woman on suspicion of narcotics possession and temporarily held her in a jail cell by herself. <i>Id.</i> at 8. The officers, following institutional practice, strip-searched her. <i>Id.</i> at 4-5. We declared the strip search unconstitutional, holding that strip-searching an arrestee ordinarily requires at least reasonable suspicion that the person arrested is concealing contraband or weapons. <i>Id.</i> at 7. We pointed out that, in Swain's case, there was no basis for any such suspicion. <i>Id.</i> at 8-9. Moreover, she was being held in virtual isolation, so there was no risk that she would come in contact with other prisoners (and, thus, succeed in smuggling contraband or weapons into the jail). <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs contend that <i>Swain</i> clearly established the law relevant to this case. It is, however, an oversimplification to say that, because we applied the reasonable suspicion standard to strip searches in a particular custodial context, the handwriting was on the wall that the same standard would apply to the ACI as well. There are important differences between detaining an arrestee in virtual isolation and introducing an arrestee into the general population of a maximum security prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Making this point brings us to our second case &#8212; a decision that the defendants insist has decretory significance here. That case is <i>Arruda v. Fair,</i> 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983) (Breyer, J.). There, we upheld a blanket strip search policy with regard to prison inmates. <i>Id.</i> at 888. We reasoned that because the searches involved the most dangerous of prisoners as they departed from, and entered into, a particularly sensitive area of a maximum security prison, security concerns provided a compelling justification for the institution's policy. <i>Id.</i> at 887-88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Arruda,</i> the defendants in this case attempt to justify their blanket strip search policy as a necessary (or, at least, reasonable) means of ensuring institutional security. They maintain that the unique nature of the ACI's intake facilities, in which arrestees are intermingled with maximum security prisoners, raises concerns similar to those raised in <i>Arruda</i> and warrants the implementation of such a policy. This argument has considerable force, for <i>Arruda</i> reasonably can be read as saying that the risk that any prisoner in a maximum security facility might receive weapons or contraband from visitors, renegade guards, or others is enough to justify a blanket strip search policy. But despite its broad language, <i>Arruda</i> involved strip searches of convicted felons, not misdemeanant arrestees &#8212; and that disparity cannot idly be brushed aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we recognize that both <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda</i> offer valuable insights, but that neither is a very exact match. While <i>Swain</i> makes clear that strip searches ought not lightly to be indulged, the factual context of the case presented rather minimal security concerns. And while <i>Arruda</i> makes clear that institutional security needs may require intrusive measures in a maximum security setting, that case dealt not with persons arrested for relatively innocuous misdemeanors, but, rather, with hardened criminals. So long as the facts in these cases are distinguishable in a fair way from the facts at hand &#8212; and we believe that they are &#8212; then neither of them can be said to have clearly established the law for purposes of a qualified immunity determination in the instant case. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 202-03, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognized much the same point in <i>Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 111 (noting that \"[t]he institutional security concerns in play here fall somewhere between those exhibited in <i>Swain,</i> which were insufficient to support a search, and those in <i>Arruda</i> and <i>Bell,</i> which made broad-based searches without individual suspicion reasonable\"). To be sure, we ultimately placed the case \"on the <i>Swain</i> side of the constitutional line.\" <i>Id.</i> But our acknowledgment that the ACI's strip search policy fell into the gray area between <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda</i> carries more weight for present purposes than our actual holding. A holding on the merits is not dispositive on the issue of qualified immunity. <i>See Cookish v. Powell,</i> 945 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir.1991); <i>Morales v. Ramirez,</i> 906 F.2d 784, 787 (1st Cir.1990). The law does not expect a public official, faced with the need to make an objectively reasonable real-world judgment, to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions that will be reached by a panel of federal appellate judges after briefing, arguments, and full-fledged review. <i>See Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, ably represented, go beyond <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda</i> in an effort to convince us that reasonable correctional officials should have realized the unconstitutionality of the ACI's strip search policy prior to March 17, 2000. They point to a line of cases stating that blanket strip searches of misdemeanant arrestees, conducted without particularized suspicion, are unconstitutional. <i>See, e.g., Masters v. Crouch,</i> 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989); <i>Weber v. Dell,</i> 804 F.2d 796, 804 (2d Cir. 1986); <i>Stewart v. Lubbock County,</i> 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir.1985); <i>Giles v. Ackerman,</i> 746 F.2d 614, 618-19 (9th Cir. 1984); <i>Hill v. Bogans,</i> 735 F.2d 391, 394-95 (10th Cir.1984). These cases come as no surprise; we cited many of them in <i>Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 111-13. For qualified immunity purposes, however, there are important distinctions between these cases and the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, all the cases upon which the plaintiffs rely deal with detentions in local jails and police stations. In contrast, the case before us involves detentions in a maximum security prison. This distinction is quite meaningful: the case law emphasizes that prison regulations may constitutionally impinge upon fundamental rights so long as such regulations are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. <i>See, e.g., Overton v. Bazzetta,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 2167, 156 L.Ed.2d 162 (2003); <i>Turner v. Safley,</i> 482 U.S. 78, 87, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). Within the walls of a maximum security prison, the need to preserve internal security is compelling. <i>Hudson v. Palmer,</i> 468 U.S. 517, 526-27, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <i>Wood v. Clemons,</i> 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996). We think it follows that Rhode Island correctional officials reasonably could have regarded the stark differences between local lockups and maximum security prisons as pivotal in deciding whether a particular security-oriented policy was necessary. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The population of a maximum security prison tends to be much more volatile and much less transient than that of a county jail. <i>See Shain v. Ellison,</i> 273 F.3d 56, 65 (2d Cir.2001). Thus, it is fairly debatable whether inmates in such a facility may be likely to arrange for an outsider to bring them weapons or other contraband by being arrested for a minor offense. <i>Compare, e.g., Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't,</i> 849 F.2d 195, 198 (5th Cir.1988) (declaring that \"a suspect jailed even temporarily on a minor offense could have the opportunity, if not searched, to smuggle in weapons or contraband,\" so that strip-searching such suspects \"is not an irrational attempt to foster ... security\"), <i>with, e.g., Walsh v. Franco,</i> 849 F.2d 66, 69 (2d Cir.1988) (declaring that \"the risk of a misdemeanor arrestee's introducing contraband into the general jail population simply d[oes] not warrant a strip search of all arrestees\"). The debatable nature of the question argues in favor of qualified immunity. <i>See Goyco de Maldonado v. Rivera,</i> 849 F.2d 683, 688 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that an official \"need show no more than that [the question is close] to prevail on his qualified immunity defense\"); <i>Vazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon,</i> 819 F.2d 319, 328 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that \"the closeness of the call suggests that [the law] could not have been `clearly established'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases upon which the plaintiffs rely are distinguishable in yet another salient respect. Those cases do not gainsay that the security concerns arising out of the intermingling of inmates are a significant counterweight in the balance that must be struck between personal rights and practical necessities. Read for all they are worth, the plaintiffs' cases at most deny that this counterweight is a sufficient justification in particular circumstances (invariably, circumstances attending an arrestee's detention at facilities such as jails and police stations). <i>See, e.g., Masters,</i> 872 F.2d at 1255; <i>Hill,</i> 735 F.2d at 394; <i>Logan v. Shealy,</i> 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981). Given the unique features of the ACI's intake facilities, the composition of the inmate population, and the fact that the misdemeanant arrestees generally were not searched prior to their arrival at the ACI, it was hardly unreasonable for Rhode Island correctional officials to calibrate the balance differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In point of fact, a separate line of cases has emphasized the need to defer to the judgment of correctional officials in addressing institutional security needs. <i>See, e.g., Overton,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 2167; <i>Procunier v. Martinez,</i> 416 U.S. 396, 404-05, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); <i>Hay v. Waldron,</i> 834 F.2d 481, 486 (5th Cir.1987); <i>see also Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 547-48, 99 S.Ct. 1861. After all, institutional security is \"perhaps the most legitimate of all penological goals.\" <i>Overton,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 2168; <i>accord Pell v. Procunier,</i> 417 U.S. 817, 823, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an opinion that is closer to this case than any other, the Second Circuit upheld a policy in which a prison facility conducted random strip searches of all inmates, including pretrial detainees. <i>See Covino v. Patrissi,</i> 967 F.2d 73, 80 (2d Cir.1992). Adverting, among other things, to the fact that the plaintiff (a pretrial detainee) commingled with sentenced inmates who had histories of violence and substance abuse, the court concluded that the prison's policy was a reasonable response to the officials' concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> at 78-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that, throughout the last quarter of the twentieth century, courts had pursued two divergent lines of precedent. This case, as we said in <i>Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 111, fell along neither axis, but, rather, into the tenebrious middle. We are mindful that there is a distinction for qualified immunity purposes between an unconstitutional but objectively reasonable act and a blatantly unconstitutional act. <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 206, 121 S.Ct. 2151; <i>Anderson,</i> 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034. Here, the lack of any direct precedent and the undulating contours of the law during the relevant period combine to persuade us that the constitutional violation was not obvious; the defendants reasonably could have thought, prior to <i>Roberts I,</i> that there was room in the law for the ACI's strip search policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs pose one last challenge to the assertion of a qualified immunity defense. They note that, rather than strip-searching all arrestees, officials at the ACI could have employed less extreme measures such as conducting pat-down searches or segregating misdemeanant arrestees from the rest of the prison population. In support of this view, they point to our conclusion that the search policy was almost entirely unnecessary to control the entry of contraband into the ACI. <i>See Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 112. But this too involves a judgment call. In the relevant time frame, some cases indicated that blanket strip searches are never constitutional when the security needs they address could be met by less intrusive means. <i>E.g., Giles,</i> 746 F.2d at 617; <i>Sostre v. Preiser,</i> 519 F.2d 763, 764 (2d Cir. 1975). Other cases suggested that the availability of less intrusive means is irrelevant to the analysis so long as officials reasonably could have concluded that such measures were more burdensome and less efficacious than blanket strip searches. <i>See, e.g., Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 559 n. 40, 99 S.Ct. 1861; <i>Hay,</i> 834 F.2d at 485; <i>Blackburn v. Snow,</i> 771 F.2d 556, 566 (1st Cir. 1985); <i>see also Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (emphasizing that \"prison officials do not have to set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of accommodating the claimant's constitutional complaint\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Given this split in authority, we find that the law on this matter was also not clearly established. Therefore, the defendants reasonably could have believed (until the federal court declared Rhode Island's blanket strip search policy unconstitutional) that they were under no legal obligation to resort to alternative measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our brethren suggest that we require an exact match with the facts of previously decided cases before we will deny a defendant the shield of qualified immunity. That is simply not so. What is so is that \"[t]he meaning of reasonableness [of a search] for Fourth Amendment purposes is highly situational\" and requires \"a balancing of the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\" Wood, 89 F.3d at 928 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The cases that our brethren cite in an effort to show that reasonable suspicion was clearly established as a condition precedent to a strip search of a person in custody are no more on point than the cases, cited above, that authorize various exceptions to that generality. Given this cacophony of voices, a reasonable prison official, faced with the novel factual situation that confronted those who were in charge of the ACI, had no way of knowing which voice should guide him in drawing the Fourth Amendment balance. It is the absence of clear guidance, not the absence of a perfect precedential match, that makes qualified immunity appropriate here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this regard, our colleagues reprove us for attributing significant weight both to the dangers inherent in commingling violent felons with misdemeanant arrestees and to distinctions between jails and maximum security prisons. We plead guilty to that charge. But we attach weight to those factors because of our respect for those who must maintain institutional security in the most difficult of settings. Correctional officials charged with the operation of maximum security prisons have an unenviable task &#8212; and courts should be reluctant casually to impose on them personal liability for damages in the absence of \"standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied with a fair prospect of surviving judicial second-guessing months and years [later].\" <i>Atwater v. City of Lago Vista,</i> 532 U.S. 318, 349, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the district court mortally wounded the ACI's blanket strip search policy in <i>Roberts I,</i> and we administered the last rites in <i>Roberts II.</i> That policy is now dead and buried. While we have found the defendants' resolution of the Fourth Amendment balance incorrect, <i>see Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 112-13, we conclude that, given the mixed signals sent by the case law, the difficulties inherent in Fourth Amendment balancing in the prison context, the special features of the ACI, and the wide berth called for by the qualified immunity doctrine, the defendants, prior to March 17, 2000, reasonably could have believed the ACI's policy to be both justified and constitutional. Put another way, the defendants did not have fair warning, prior to March 17, 2000, that their conduct was unlawful. If judges can span the spectrum on this sort of constitutional question, it would certainly be unfair to hold the defendants liable for doing nothing more blameworthy than guessing incorrectly about how the courts ultimately would resolve the issue. <i>See Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 618, 119 S.Ct. 1692.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. This is a close case, but we do not require public officials to foretell the course of constitutional law with absolute accuracy in order to obtain the balm of qualified immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692. To the contrary, the doctrine of qualified immunity is designed to protect \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). Concluding, as we do, that the law as it existed when the events at issue occurred did not clearly establish that the ACI's policy authorizing blanket strip and body cavity searches violated the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights, we would uphold the entry of summary judgment in the defendants' favor on the basis of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For ease in reference, we sometimes use the shorthand term \"strip search\" to describe both practices</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because we answer this question in the negative,<i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we need not address the final prong of the qualified immunity algorithm.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Of course, the plaintiff there had been arrested for an offense more serious than those attributed to the plaintiffs in this case<i>Covino,</i> 967 F.2d at 75 n. 1.

Our four respected colleagues agree with this analysis. We do not. The opinion of our colleagues is wrong on the law, the logic that they adopt is at odds with recent Supreme Court precedent regarding qualified immunity, and we believe their reasoning will put constitutional rights at risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to keep in mind what we are dealing with in this case. The strip searches conducted here are \"perhaps `the greatest personal indignity' searching officials can visit upon an individual.\" <i>Blackburn v. Snow,</i> 771 F.2d 556, 564 (1st Cir. 1985) (quoting <i>Bell v. Wolfish,</i> 441 U.S. 520, 594, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)). According to Rhode Island's written policies, these searches included a \"visual examination of [the] groin and rectum.\" Male arrestees were required to \"lift their penises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a clear view of the groin area.\" Both male and female arrestees were required \"to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear view of the area.\" Moreover, these searches were conducted against harmless individuals. All of the plaintiffs in this case were arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses. By way of example, one of the plaintiffs, George Barber, loaned his car to his son in 1993 and the son received a traffic ticket that was never paid. Six years later, Barber was arrested because of the unpaid ticket, held at the Adult Correctional Institutions (\"the ACI\") overnight and strip searched twice. Another plaintiff, Stephanie Clark, called police for assistance after an auto accident and was arrested because a computer check showed an outstanding arrest warrant for her failure to appear at a probation review. Clark had already finished her probation and the warrant was issued in error. She was taken to the ACI and strip searched twice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these facts in mind, we turn to the legal issues in this case. We begin with whether it was the \"clearly established\" law in this circuit, as of March 17, 2000, that prison officials needed reasonable suspicion to strip search non-violent, non-drug related minor offense arrestees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> \"One tried and true way of determining whether [a] right was clearly established ... is to ask whether existing case law gave the defendants fair warning that their conduct violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\" <i>Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office of the Suffolk Dist.,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 93 (1st Cir.2002). Our colleagues describe this inquiry as an archeological dig, yet focus on only the top and bottom layers of the excavation. <i>See Swain v. Spinney,</i> 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Arruda v. Fair,</i> 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983). Our colleagues choose to ignore the cases that lie in the layers in between, thereby omitting consideration of relevant precedent. A proper qualified immunity analysis requires a court to look \"at all available case law.\" <i>Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth and Their Families,</i> 274 F.3d 12, 23 (1st Cir. 2001). We will therefore briefly trace the development of this circuit's reasonable suspicion standard as it applies to strip searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The place to start is the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Bell v. Wolfish,</i> 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In that case, the Court upheld a strip and visual body cavity search of pretrial detainees who had contact with prison visitors. <i>Id.</i> at 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861. In doing so, the Court conducted an analysis that balanced the need for the searches against the invasion of personal rights. <i>Id.</i> Although the Court said that the practice of strip searching individuals \"instinctively gives us the most pause,\" it found the searches constitutional because of the security needs of the prison, i.e., the realistic possibility that contraband could pass from visitor to detainee. <i>Id.</i> at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. But the Court was clear to delineate the scope of its holding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e deal here with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections ... can <i>ever</i> be conducted on less than probable cause. Balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 560 (emphasis in original). In other words, <i>Bell</i> established the ceiling; it made clear that prison officials did not necessarily need probable cause to strip search pretrial detainees. But <i>Bell</i> left the floor undefined. Still unanswered was the question of whether prison officials needed any level of particularized suspicion that detainees were carrying contraband or weapons or in a position to receive them from others before conducting strip searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our early cases applying <i>Bell</i> to the prison environment dealt largely with situations involving prison visitors. In one of our first prison visitor cases, <i>Blackburn v. Snow,</i> 771 F.2d 556 (1st Cir.1985), we held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Constitution requires a more particularized level of suspicion to justify the humiliating and intrusive searches conducted here. While we need not define here precisely what level of individualized suspicion is required ... a rule unabashedly requiring none cannot be reconciled with the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 567; <i>see also Cochrane v. Quattrocchi,</i> 949 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1991). It is also noteworthy that we surveyed the legal landscape as it existed at the time and grouped arrestees into the category of strip search scenarios in which particularized suspicion was necessary. <i>See Blackburn,</i> 771 F.2d at 565. This grouping was merely a foreshadowing of things to come.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Wood v. Clemons,</i> 89 F.3d 922 (1st Cir.1996), we clarified that the level of particularized suspicion required before subjecting prison visitors to strip searches was \"reasonable suspicion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 929. We said that \"a strip search cannot be justified absent some quantum of <i>individualized suspicion.</i> In determining the <i>level</i> of individualized suspicion ... courts have converged upon one common benchmark: the standard of `reasonable suspicion.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 928 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our cases addressing the reasonable suspicion standard in the context of strip and visual body cavity searches were not limited to prison visitors. We required reasonable suspicion for strip searches at border crossings. <i>See United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas,</i> 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.1991). And most significantly for this case, we held in <i>Swain v. Spinney,</i> 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997), that there must be reasonable suspicion to conduct strip searches of arrestees. <i>Id.</i> at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Swain,</i> we examined our prior cases dealing with prison visitors and border searches, as well as relevant cases from other circuits. We concluded that \"it is clear that at least the reasonable suspicion standard governs strip and visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context as well.\" <i>Id.</i> This ruling was consistent with cases from numerous other circuits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our brethren mischaracterize the holding in <i>Swain.</i> They paraphrase <i>Swain</i> as holding that reasonable suspicion is \"ordinarily\" required for arrestees and that strip searches \"ought not lightly to be indulged.\" We respectfully disagree with our colleagues' description of <i>Swain's</i> holding. <i>Swain's</i> holding is clear and unqualified. <i>Swain</i> does not say that reasonable suspicion is only sometimes required. Rather than paraphrase the words of <i>Swain,</i> we shall quote its holding directly: \"A strip and visual body cavity search of an arrestee must be justified, at the least, by a reasonable suspicion.\" 117 F.3d at 5. It is hard to imagine a more clear statement of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our colleagues fail to mention that <i>Swain</i> contained another holding that is especially relevant to this case. When analyzing the issue of qualified immunity we stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, while some courts have suggested that a <i>higher</i> standard may be necessary to justify a strip search and visual body cavity inspection, it was clearly established at the time of the search [May 18, 1993] that the Fourth Amendment requires <i>at least</i> a reasonable suspicion to conduct these types of searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). This ruling too was in accord with decisions by other circuits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, <i>Swain</i> states unequivocally that reasonable suspicion is required to strip search arrestees and that this requirement was clearly established as early as 1993, well before the dates in question here. These rulings were in conformity with circuits across the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this overwhelming precedent, our colleagues claim that <i>Swain's</i> holdings could not have given the defendants fair warning that the reasonable suspicion standard would apply to them. They say that <i>Swain</i> involved an arrestee who was held alone in a single cell, whereas the plaintiffs in this case were commingled with other prisoners. Admittedly, our precedent does not speak to commingling specifically. But that fact does not mean that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 23 (although \"[o]ur own precedents are ... inconclusive,\" the law was clearly established by \"an emerging body of decisional law outside our own circuit\"). Commingling may not always pose a security risk. It is not commingling, per se, that presents a security problem; it is commingling that involves a risk of illegal traffic among the commingled inmates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as <i>Blackburn,</i> we rejected the argument that \"the security needs of a prison can, <i>standing alone,</i> properly justify the `complete withdrawal' of Fourth Amendment rights from <i>all</i> who enter [a prison].\" 771 F.2d at 563 (emphasis in original); <i>see also Logan,</i> 660 F.2d at 1013 (\"An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to detainees ... cannot be constitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cases from other circuits are more explicit in rejecting the commingling argument advanced by the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Most notable is the Sixth Circuit's holding in <i>Masters v. Crouch,</i> 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.1989):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he fact of intermingling [with other prison inmates] alone has never been found to justify such a search without consideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there is any reasonable basis for concern that the particular detainee will attempt to introduce weapons or other contraband into the institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1254. In short, the cases from other circuits, when read in conjunction with our own precedent, would not permit a reasonable prison official to conclude that minor offense arrestees could be strip searched without reasonable suspicion simply because the prison officials decide to mix the arrestees with other prisoners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our colleagues say that <i>Swain</i> could not have provided fair warning for another reason. According to our brethren, <i>Swain,</i> as well as the cases from other circuits upon which it relied, involved local jails rather than prisons, like the ACI. The distinction between jails and maximum security prisons is a crucial leg upon which our colleagues' opinion rests. It is here that their incomplete archeological excavation which we mentioned earlier becomes important. The cases that our colleagues ignored involved the early development of our reasonable suspicion standard as it applied to strip searches of prison visitors. At issue in those cases were both jails <i>and</i> prisons. <i>See Wood,</i> 89 F.3d at 925 (prison); <i>Blackburn,</i> 771 F.2d at 559 (county jail).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more relevant is the fact that one of those cases dealt with the ACI. <i>See Cochrane,</i> 949 F.2d at 12. In <i>Cochrane,</i> we vacated a judgment granting directed verdicts for ACI officials defending the strip search of an inmate's daughter. We said that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]bsent any evidence that appellant ever violated a prison visitation rule, or even supplied Cochrane with drugs, a reasonable juror could have concluded that Cochrane's contraband drugs were supplied by prison officials or other inmates. Thus, the jury could have found that the strip search of appellant was unreasonable because it was based on <i>no</i> \"individualized suspicion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 13 (emphasis in original). Our colleagues maintain that the defendants were justified in believing that no reasonable suspicion was required in this case in part because the defendants \"must maintain institutional security in the most difficult of settings.\" Yet the same setting and security considerations were not enough to defeat the requirement for individualized suspicion in <i>Cochrane.</i> We do not understand on what legal basis our colleagues can now say that those same security needs made the defendants' unconstitutional strip searches reasonable. Certainly the defendants had fair warning that the reasonable suspicion standard would be applied to them because, in fact, they had already been held to that standard in the past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one difference between <i>Cochrane</i> and the present case is that <i>Cochrane</i> involved prison visitors, not minor offense arrestees. But this fact does not help the defendants; if anything, it further highlights why the defendants had fair warning that their strip search policies were unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has explained that prison visitors \"invite a host of security problems\" because they can pass weapons and contraband \"to an inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers.\" <i>Block v. Rutherford,</i> 468 U.S. 576, 586, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). It is well recognized, however, that individuals arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses do not present the same security risk as prison visitors. <i>See Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 111; <i>Giles,</i> 746 F.2d at 617. This is because arrests, unlike visits, are not planned events. They are random and do not afford an arrestee the opportunity to hatch a scheme to smuggle contraband into a prison. As the Second Circuit has explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is far less obvious that misdemeanor arrestees frequently or even occasionally hide contraband in their bodily orifices. Unlike persons already in jail who receive contact visits, arrestees do not ordinarily have notice that they are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide something. For the exceptions &#8212; for example, a person who is allowed to visit the bathroom unescorted before an arrest &#8212; reasonable suspicion may well exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Shain v. Ellison,</i> 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2001). Our brethren overlook the important fact that the Court in <i>Bell</i> authorized strip searches of detainees only after the detainees had come into contact with prison visitors. <i>See</i> 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The present case involves people brought to the ACI because they were arrested, sometimes mistakenly as the record reveals, for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses. They did not come into contact with prison visitors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our colleagues concoct a hypothetical situation in which an inmate arranges for an outsider to bring weapons or contraband inside the prison by staging an incident that would lead to the outsider being arrested for a minor offense. With due respect, this is chimerical. The only case our colleagues have exhumed to support their scenario is <i>Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't,</i> 849 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1988). They claim <i>Watt</i> stands for the idea that \"a suspect jailed even temporarily on a minor offense could have the opportunity, if not searched, to smuggle weapons or contraband.\" <i>Id.</i> at 198. The very next sentence from <i>Watt,</i> however, shows that the quote upon which they rely is applicable only to those arrestees charged with weapons, shoplifting or drug offenses or those with a history of such offenses. <i>See id.</i> (\"Limiting the searches generally to those offenders charged with or having a criminal history of narcotics, shoplifting or weapons charges is not an irrational attempt to foster jail security....\"). <i>Watt</i> does not support our colleagues' theory that non-violent, non-drug related minor offense arrestees will conduct coordinated smuggling schemes to infiltrate prisons with contraband and weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps more importantly, there is no evidence in the record to support our colleagues' hypothetical. In fact, the record undermines it. At no time has the ACI ever found weapons or contraband in an arrestee's rectum or genital area. <i>Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 112 n. 6. Only on one occasion has the ACI found contraband in the body cavity of a minor offense arrestee. <i>Id.</i> In that instance, the arrestee was hiding a bag of drugs in his mouth. <i>Id.</i> All the other contraband that the ACI has found on minor offense arrestees has been discovered in their clothing. It is obvious that the intrusive and degrading searches that the ACI chose to institute were not required to find this contraband. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No historical analysis of our strip search cases would be complete without a close examination of our holding in <i>Arruda v. Fair,</i> 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983). Our colleagues say that <i>Arruda</i> is a case with \"considerable force\" because it \"reasonably can be read as saying that the risk that <i>any prisoner</i> in a maximum security facility might receive weapons or contraband from visitors, renegade guards, <i>or others</i> is enough to justify a blanket strip search policy.\" (emphasis added). Characterized in this manner, <i>Arruda</i> forms another critical leg upon which our colleagues' opinion stands. Their expansive reading of <i>Arruda</i> is unwarranted. <i>Arruda</i> is a totally different case than what we face here. It is so different that no reasonable official could have read <i>Arruda</i> to authorize suspicionless strip searches of minor offense arrestees. This is true for three reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, <i>Arruda</i> was decided twenty years ago and, as we have already discussed, our cases since <i>Arruda</i> have made clear that reasonable suspicion is required to strip search arrestees. <i>See Swain,</i> 117 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Arruda</i> was a case involving \"particularly dangerous prisoners.\" 710 F.2d at 887. These prisoners were convicted felons assigned to a special cell block, which we described as a \"`prison within a prison,' designed to hold the most dangerous inmates.\" <i>Id.</i> The plaintiff himself was assigned to this special cell block for assaulting another prisoner. <i>Id.</i> In addition, the plaintiff testified that, while a prisoner, he possessed drugs and a weapon. <i>Id.</i> at 888. It is beyond comprehension how the defendants can equate extraordinarily violent convicted felons with people who have been arrested for minor offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and most pertinently, what we identified in <i>Arruda</i> as the \"closest question,\" <i>id.,</i> most analogous to the instant case, was whether prisoners who were convicted felons needed to be searched en route from cell to library or infirmary, even though accompanied by a guard. Like the misdemeanor arrestees here, there would seem to be no basis for any suspicion that such inmates would possess contraband. The record in <i>Arruda,</i> however, revealed a number of instances when guards were found to be involved in smuggling drugs to prisoners. This caused us to hold, \"[G]iven the problem of prison employee involvement with contraband, the district court's conclusion is not unreasonable.\" <i>Id.; but see id.</i> at 891, 890 (Maletz, J., dissenting in part) (\"When one of the primary justifications for strip searches in these circumstances rests on the institution's inability to control its own staff the scales tip decidedly in favor of the inmate.... I am constrained to conclude that routine visual strip searches before and after visits to the prison library and prison hospital are unreasonable, absent some level of cause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twenty years have passed since we decided <i>Arruda</i> and the case law barring suspicionless strip searches of minor offense arrestees has proliferated. And <i>Swain,</i> with its clear recognition that a strip search requires reasonable suspicion, has been on the books of this circuit since 1997. The record in this case does not reveal a prison employee drug smuggling problem. There remains only the speculative risk that a non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanant, randomly arrested, might fortuitously be a bearer of contraband. That is not enough, in our view, to permit the defendants to escape liability for their unconstitutional acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only similarity between <i>Arruda</i> and the present case is that the correctional facilities in both cases are maximum security prisons. This is the vital similarity upon which the defendants' argument relies. Despite the key differences I have described above, our colleagues are persuaded by this single similarity. Our colleagues say that prison officials cannot be expected to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions that we judges will make after full briefing and argument. We agree with that statement as a general matter. But that is not to say that prison officials have no responsibility to analyze the law. All of the individual defendants here are high level prison officials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> They are not entry-level prison guards who have no access to legal advice and have superiors who have failed to supply any training on constitutional law whatsoever. The defendants in this case <i>are</i> the superiors and should be held to the standard of a \"reasonably competent public official [who] should know the law governing his conduct.\" <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 819, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The qualified immunity analysis is based on an objective standard. <i>See Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 95. This necessarily implies some informed and professional analysis. Merely to take refuge in the concept that the ACI is a maximum security prison, without identifying any realistic distinction between the situation in <i>Arruda</i> and the situation that the defendants were confronted with at the ACI, falls far short of any credible analysis of the state of the law both within and outside this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We close our review of the relevant legal history regarding strip searches with an important observation. Our colleagues do not cite to a single case which permits suspicionless strip searches of non-violent, non-drug related minor offense arrestees. It is quite amazing that they can claim the law is ambiguous but fail to provide a single case that directly supports their position. The only case our colleagues offer is <i>Covino v. Patrissi,</i> 967 F.2d 73 (2d Cir.1992). But that case, as our colleagues readily admit, is not on point. The plaintiff in <i>Covino</i> was not arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses like the plaintiffs in this case. He was arrested for kidnaping a child under the age of sixteen and was ultimately sentenced to 20 to 35 years in prison. <i>Id.</i> at 75 n. 1. In addition, the prison superintendent in <i>Covino</i> testified that \"occasionally contraband and drugs were found secreted in an inmate's rectum.\" <i>Id.</i> at 79. As we have already explained, the evidence in this case is to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without direct legal support, our brethren are forced to argue that generalized statements from certain cases made the law so ambiguous that the defendants could not have had fair warning. Our colleagues argue, for example, that there exists \"a separate line of cases [that] has emphasized the need to defer to the judgment of correctional officials in addressing institutional security needs.\" If these types of sweeping statements are enough to shield prison officials from liability for their illegal actions, then there is the significant risk that qualified immunity will always attach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this concern that brings us to our final point. Up to now, we have argued that our colleagues analysis of our legal history is incomplete and untenable. This is not the only flaw in their opinion. We are deeply troubled by the weight our colleagues give to our statement in <i>Roberts II</i> that institutional security concerns in this case \"fall somewhere between\" those exhibited in <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda.</i> 239 F.3d at 111. Our colleagues describe this statement as an acknowledgment that the ACI's strip search policy fell into a \"gray area\" of the law. We respectfully disagree. The <i>Roberts II</i> statement merely recognizes the obvious: that the facts of the present case fall somewhere between those of <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda.</i> Such an observation is not surprising. Indeed, most cases will fall somewhere between <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda</i> because those two cases represent the opposite ends of the spectrum. <i>Swain</i> was a case involving an arrestee who was placed in a cell in a local police station. In contrast, <i>Arruda</i> involved extraordinarily violent convicted felons who were confined to a special security section of a maximum security prison. What our colleagues have done is to construe a dictum probably intended to soften criticism of the prison officials into a sweeping carte blanche, protecting officials for a wide swath of conduct elsewhere long since forbidden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placing so much weight on the <i>Roberts II</i> statement runs the risk of creating an impenetrable defense for government officials. Our colleagues' reliance on the <i>Roberts II</i> statement implies that qualified immunity will only be denied in this circuit when the facts of the case at bar are the same as those in previously decided cases. This risk is compounded by our colleagues' statement that <i>Swain</i> could not give the defendants fair warning because it is not \"a very exact match\" to the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such reasoning flouts the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Hope v. Pelzer,</i> 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). In <i>Hope,</i> the Court admonished the Eleventh Circuit for finding the law clearly established only when the facts of previous cases were \"fundamentally similar\" to the present case. <i>Id.</i> at 739, 122 S.Ct. 2508. The Court said that such an approach was a \"rigid gloss on the qualified immunity standard ... [that] is not consistent with our cases.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court explained that \"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances,\" and that \"[a]lthough earlier cases involving `fundamentally similar' facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established, they are not necessary to such a finding. The same is true of cases with `materially similar' facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our colleagues respond by saying that \"[i]t is the absence of clear guidance, not the absence of a perfect precedential match, that makes qualified immunity appropriate here.\" In short, they reject <i>Swain</i> as giving \"clear guidance\" because of factual differences, while claiming allegiance to <i>Hope's</i> ruling that \"fundamentally similar\" facts are not necessary. This seems to us an attempt to have it both ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our colleagues may well be correct that the strip search policy at issue in this case, and others like it, are \"dead and buried.\" But their qualified immunity analysis will live on; it will undoubtedly be used in future cases involving other important constitutional rights. The qualified immunity defense is \"an attempt to balance competing values: not only the importance of a damages remedy to protect the rights of citizens ... but also `the need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.'\" <i>Harlow,</i> 457 U.S. at 807, 102 S.Ct. 2727 (quoting <i>Butz v. Economou,</i> 438 U.S. 478, 504-06, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978)). By finding ambiguity in our cases where there is none, and by implying that previous cases must be \"a very exact match\" before they can give fair warning for purposes of the qualified immunity analysis, our brethren have tipped the balance away from the Constitution. They have gone far toward granting absolute immunity under the cloak of qualified immunity. We believe that this court is obliged not only to give due deference to the judgment of government officials but to insist that the constitutional rights of individuals be vigilantly protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the bar to a remedy is set too high, then constitutional rights are in jeopardy. Government officials will have less incentive to change their illegal policies on their own accord because the deterrent effect of damages is lacking. Aggrieved individuals will have less incentive to challenge those policies because monetary compensation for their harms is unavailable. In the end, unconstitutional government action is more likely to go unchanged. That is our ultimate concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note at the outset that the reasonable suspicion standard is not particularly demanding.

These searches, conducted pursuant to a longstanding institutional policy, encompassed both strip searches (i.e., visual inspections of the naked body) and visual body cavity searches (i.e., inspections of the anal and genital areas).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After the courts struck down the strip search policy, the plaintiffs sued the State of Rhode Island and a number of prison officials for damages sustained as a result of the illegal intrusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' suit invoked 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000).

After some preliminary skirmishing, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of those defendants on the basis of qualified immunity. A panel of this court reversed that ruling, but the full court subsequently granted rehearing en banc and (as is customary in such instances) ordered the panel opinion withdrawn. The court now divides equally and thus affirms the district court's ruling. The judges who subscribe to this opinion believe that affirmance is fully warranted: upon a broad review of the preexisting law and its application to the unusual situation at the ACI, we conclude that, when the underlying events occurred, prudent prison officials reasonably could have believed that Rhode Island's strip search policy was constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we rehearse the facts in the light most sympathetic to the non-moving parties (here, the plaintiffs), indulging all reasonable inferences in their favor. <i>See, e.g., Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770706\"><a href=\"/opinion/770706/ramon-m-suarez-v-pueblo-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2000). Here, however, that praxis has little bearing, for the facts upon which our decision turns are largely undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike other states, Rhode Island has no regional or county detention facilities. It operates only a single, all-purpose penitentiary: the ACI. Centrally located in Cranston, Rhode Island, the ACI comprises seven separate maximum security facilities. Two of those units &#8212; one for women and the other for men &#8212; receive all persons committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections regardless of the nature of their offenses. At the times material hereto, these intake facilities housed an array of prisoners ranging from newly sentenced felons to convicts under protective custody to pretrial detainees to arrestees. All of these individuals, except for detainees held in protective custody, were commingled while in various parts of the intake facilities. Detainees held in protective custody used the same areas as other inmates but at different times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the currency of this arrangement, Rhode Island maintained written policies that required all new entrants into the ACI, including misdemeanant arrestees, to undergo strip and body cavity searches. In 1999, Craig Roberts ran afoul of this policy. Local police, having made a routine stop of a motor vehicle in which Roberts was a passenger, learned that the Rhode Island Family Court had issued a body attachment &#8212; the functional equivalent of a writ of arrest &#8212; addressed to him. Although Roberts protested that the body attachment had been withdrawn and produced what purported to be documentation to that effect, the police detained him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with the customary procedure, the police transported Roberts to the ACI. Upon his admission, he was twice subjected to strip and body cavity searches. These searches uncovered no drugs, weapons, or other contraband. Shortly thereafter, a sheriff verified that the body attachment had been withdrawn. Roberts was released.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberts was gone but not forgotten. He brought suit in the federal district court alleging that the strip searches had violated his constitutional rights. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that the strip searches had offended Roberts's rights under the Fourth Amendment and enjoined the State from continuing to enforce the written policies then in effect. <i>Roberts v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418948\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418948/roberts-v-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Thereafter, eighteen plaintiffs &#8212; all of whom had been arrested for non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors and subjected to strip and body cavity searches prior to that date &#8212; brought a new action in the federal district court on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. In their class-action complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the searches violated their constitutional rights and sought money damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit named as defendants the State and a galaxy of prison officials. Upon the defendants' motion, the district court dismissed Roberts's claim for damages based on the doctrine of res judicata. <i>See, e.g., Allen v. McCurry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court thereafter entered summary judgment against the remaining plaintiffs. The court reasoned that, prior to the decision in <i>Roberts I,</i> it was not clearly established that prison officials needed some particularized suspicion before strip-searching misdemeanant arrestees who were about to be introduced into the general population at a maximum security prison (and, therefore, that the defendants enjoyed the protection of qualified immunity).

Where, as here, a party's entitlement to summary judgment hinges on a claim of qualified immunity, we must balance the need to vindicate constitutional rights against the need to insulate public officials from civil litigation that might unduly inhibit the assiduous discharge of their duties. <i>See Anderson v.

We acknowledge that strip searches are intrusive and degrading (and, therefore, should not be unreservedly available to law enforcement officers). The <i>Roberts</i> decisions exemplify this thinking; they hold unequivocally that the ACI's policy of strip-searching persons arrested for non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors, in the absence of particularized suspicion, violated the Constitution. <i>See Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 113; <i>Roberts I,</i> 175 F.Supp.2d at 183. The questions on which this appeal turns, therefore, involve the second and third branches of the qualified immunity algorithm. We must determine whether the law was clearly established, prior to March 17, 2000, to the effect that prison officials need at least reasonable suspicion before subjecting misdemeanant arrestees to strip searches when introducing them into the general population of a maximum security prison, and whether a reasonable prison official, situated similarly to the defendants, would have understood at that time that the policy in place at the ACI transgressed the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bases for these determinations often overlap, the instant plaintiffs cannot prevail unless we determine both questions favorably to them.

On the other hand, security is a paramount concern in prison environments, and courts long have recognized that unpleasantly intrusive security measures, up to and including blanket strip searches, may be proper in such settings. <i>See Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 560-62, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Neither comparison is very exact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with <i>Swain.</i> There, police arrested a woman on suspicion of narcotics possession and temporarily held her in a jail cell by herself. <i>Id.</i> at 8. The officers, following institutional practice, strip-searched her. <i>Id.</i> at 4-5. We declared the strip search unconstitutional, holding that strip-searching an arrestee ordinarily requires at least reasonable suspicion that the person arrested is concealing contraband or weapons. <i>Id.</i> at 7. We pointed out that, in Swain's case, there was no basis for any such suspicion. <i>Id.</i> at 8-9. Moreover, she was being held in virtual isolation, so there was no risk that she would come in contact with other prisoners (and, thus, succeed in smuggling contraband or weapons into the jail). <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs contend that <i>Swain</i> clearly established the law relevant to this case. It is, however, an oversimplification to say that, because we applied the reasonable suspicion standard to strip searches in a particular custodial context, the handwriting was on the wall that the same standard would apply to the ACI as well. There are important differences between detaining an arrestee in virtual isolation and introducing an arrestee into the general population of a maximum security prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Making this point brings us to our second case &#8212; a decision that the defendants insist has decretory significance here. That case is <i>Arruda v. Fair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420906\"><a href=\"/opinion/420906/paulo-arruda-v-michael-v-fair-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1983) (Breyer, J.). There, we upheld a blanket strip search policy with regard to prison inmates. <i>Id.</i> at 888. We reasoned that because the searches involved the most dangerous of prisoners as they departed from, and entered into, a particularly sensitive area of a maximum security prison, security concerns provided a compelling justification for the institution's policy. <i>Id.</i> at 887-88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Arruda,</i> the defendants in this case attempt to justify their blanket strip search policy as a necessary (or, at least, reasonable) means of ensuring institutional security. They maintain that the unique nature of the ACI's intake facilities, in which arrestees are intermingled with maximum security prisoners, raises concerns similar to those raised in <i>Arruda</i> and warrants the implementation of such a policy. This argument has considerable force, for <i>Arruda</i> reasonably can be read as saying that the risk that any prisoner in a maximum security facility might receive weapons or contraband from visitors, renegade guards, or others is enough to justify a blanket strip search policy. But despite its broad language, <i>Arruda</i> involved strip searches of convicted felons, not misdemeanant arrestees &#8212; and that disparity cannot idly be brushed aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we recognize that both <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda</i> offer valuable insights, but that neither is a very exact match. While <i>Swain</i> makes clear that strip searches ought not lightly to be indulged, the factual context of the case presented rather minimal security concerns. And while <i>Arruda</i> makes clear that institutional security needs may require intrusive measures in a maximum security setting, that case dealt not with persons arrested for relatively innocuous misdemeanors, but, rather, with hardened criminals. So long as the facts in these cases are distinguishable in a fair way from the facts at hand &#8212; and we believe that they are &#8212; then neither of them can be said to have clearly established the law for purposes of a qualified immunity determination in the instant case. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 202-03, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To be sure, we ultimately placed the case \"on the <i>Swain</i> side of the constitutional line.\" <i>Id.</i> But our acknowledgment that the ACI's strip search policy fell into the gray area between <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda</i> carries more weight for present purposes than our actual holding. A holding on the merits is not dispositive on the issue of qualified immunity. <i>See Cookish v.

The law does not expect a public official, faced with the need to make an objectively reasonable real-world judgment, to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions that will be reached by a panel of federal appellate judges after briefing, arguments, and full-fledged review. <i>See Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 617, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Those cases do not gainsay that the security concerns arising out of the intermingling of inmates are a significant counterweight in the balance that must be struck between personal rights and practical necessities. Read for all they are worth, the plaintiffs' cases at most deny that this counterweight is a sufficient justification in particular circumstances (invariably, circumstances attending an arrestee's detention at facilities such as jails and police stations). <i>See, e.g., Masters,</i> 872 F.2d at 1255; <i>Hill,</i> 735 F.2d at 394; <i>Logan v.

Given the unique features of the ACI's intake facilities, the composition of the inmate population, and the fact that the misdemeanant arrestees generally were not searched prior to their arrival at the ACI, it was hardly unreasonable for Rhode Island correctional officials to calibrate the balance differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In point of fact, a separate line of cases has emphasized the need to defer to the judgment of correctional officials in addressing institutional security needs. <i>See, e.g., Overton,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 2167; <i>Procunier v.

Patrissi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585227\"><a href=\"/opinion/585227/robert-h-covino-v-joseph-patrissi-commissioner-of-corrections-heinz/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 80 (2d Cir.1992). Adverting, among other things, to the fact that the plaintiff (a pretrial detainee) commingled with sentenced inmates who had histories of violence and substance abuse, the court concluded that the prison's policy was a reasonable response to the officials' concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> at 78-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that, throughout the last quarter of the twentieth century, courts had pursued two divergent lines of precedent. This case, as we said in <i>Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 111, fell along neither axis, but, rather, into the tenebrious middle. We are mindful that there is a distinction for qualified immunity purposes between an unconstitutional but objectively reasonable act and a blatantly unconstitutional act. <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 206, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span>. Here, the lack of any direct precedent and the undulating contours of the law during the relevant period combine to persuade us that the constitutional violation was not obvious; the defendants reasonably could have thought, prior to <i>Roberts I,</i> that there was room in the law for the ACI's strip search policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs pose one last challenge to the assertion of a qualified immunity defense. They note that, rather than strip-searching all arrestees, officials at the ACI could have employed less extreme measures such as conducting pat-down searches or segregating misdemeanant arrestees from the rest of the prison population. In support of this view, they point to our conclusion that the search policy was almost entirely unnecessary to control the entry of contraband into the ACI. <i>See Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 112. But this too involves a judgment call. In the relevant time frame, some cases indicated that blanket strip searches are never constitutional when the security needs they address could be met by less intrusive means. <i>E.g., Giles,</i> 746 F.2d at 617; <i>Sostre v. Preiser,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328865\"><a href=\"/opinion/328865/martin-sostre-v-peter-preiser-commissioner-of-new-york-state-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 764 (2d Cir. 1975). Other cases suggested that the availability of less intrusive means is irrelevant to the analysis so long as officials reasonably could have concluded that such measures were more burdensome and less efficacious than blanket strip searches. <i>See, e.g., Bell,</i> 441 U.S. at 559 n. 40, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Therefore, the defendants reasonably could have believed (until the federal court declared Rhode Island's blanket strip search policy unconstitutional) that they were under no legal obligation to resort to alternative measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our brethren suggest that we require an exact match with the facts of previously decided cases before we will deny a defendant the shield of qualified immunity. That is simply not so. What is so is that \"[t]he meaning of reasonableness [of a search] for Fourth Amendment purposes is highly situational\" and requires \"a balancing of the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\" Wood, 89 F.3d at 928 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The cases that our brethren cite in an effort to show that reasonable suspicion was clearly established as a condition precedent to a strip search of a person in custody are no more on point than the cases, cited above, that authorize various exceptions to that generality. Given this cacophony of voices, a reasonable prison official, faced with the novel factual situation that confronted those who were in charge of the ACI, had no way of knowing which voice should guide him in drawing the Fourth Amendment balance. It is the absence of clear guidance, not the absence of a perfect precedential match, that makes qualified immunity appropriate here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this regard, our colleagues reprove us for attributing significant weight both to the dangers inherent in commingling violent felons with misdemeanant arrestees and to distinctions between jails and maximum security prisons. We plead guilty to that charge. But we attach weight to those factors because of our respect for those who must maintain institutional security in the most difficult of settings. Correctional officials charged with the operation of maximum security prisons have an unenviable task &#8212; and courts should be reluctant casually to impose on them personal liability for damages in the absence of \"standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied with a fair prospect of surviving judicial second-guessing months and years [later].\" <i>Atwater v.

While we have found the defendants' resolution of the Fourth Amendment balance incorrect, <i>see Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 112-13, we conclude that, given the mixed signals sent by the case law, the difficulties inherent in Fourth Amendment balancing in the prison context, the special features of the ACI, and the wide berth called for by the qualified immunity doctrine, the defendants, prior to March 17, 2000, reasonably could have believed the ACI's policy to be both justified and constitutional. Put another way, the defendants did not have fair warning, prior to March 17, 2000, that their conduct was unlawful. If judges can span the spectrum on this sort of constitutional question, it would certainly be unfair to hold the defendants liable for doing nothing more blameworthy than guessing incorrectly about how the courts ultimately would resolve the issue. <i>See Wilson,</i> 526 U.S. at 618, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

According to Rhode Island's written policies, these searches included a \"visual examination of [the] groin and rectum.\" Male arrestees were required to \"lift their penises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a clear view of the groin area.\" Both male and female arrestees were required \"to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear view of the area.\" Moreover, these searches were conducted against harmless individuals. All of the plaintiffs in this case were arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses. By way of example, one of the plaintiffs, George Barber, loaned his car to his son in 1993 and the son received a traffic ticket that was never paid. Six years later, Barber was arrested because of the unpaid ticket, held at the Adult Correctional Institutions (\"the ACI\") overnight and strip searched twice. Another plaintiff, Stephanie Clark, called police for assistance after an auto accident and was arrested because a computer check showed an outstanding arrest warrant for her failure to appear at a probation review. Clark had already finished her probation and the warrant was issued in error. She was taken to the ACI and strip searched twice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these facts in mind, we turn to the legal issues in this case.

In that case, the Court upheld a strip and visual body cavity search of pretrial detainees who had contact with prison visitors. <i>Id.</i> at 560, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In doing so, the Court conducted an analysis that balanced the need for the searches against the invasion of personal rights. <i>Id.</i> Although the Court said that the practice of strip searching individuals \"instinctively gives us the most pause,\" it found the searches constitutional because of the security needs of the prison, i.e., the realistic possibility that contraband could pass from visitor to detainee. <i>Id.</i> at 558, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In other words, <i>Bell</i> established the ceiling; it made clear that prison officials did not necessarily need probable cause to strip search pretrial detainees.

It is also noteworthy that we surveyed the legal landscape as it existed at the time and grouped arrestees into the category of strip search scenarios in which particularized suspicion was necessary. <i>See Blackburn,</i> 771 F.2d at 565.

Rather than paraphrase the words of <i>Swain,</i> we shall quote its holding directly: \"A strip and visual body cavity search of an arrestee must be justified, at the least, by a reasonable suspicion.\" 117 F.3d at 5.

They say that <i>Swain</i> involved an arrestee who was held alone in a single cell, whereas the plaintiffs in this case were commingled with other prisoners. Admittedly, our precedent does not speak to commingling specifically. But that fact does not mean that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 23 (although \"[o]ur own precedents are ... inconclusive,\" the law was clearly established by \"an emerging body of decisional law outside our own circuit\"). Commingling may not always pose a security risk. It is not commingling, per se, that presents a security problem; it is commingling that involves a risk of illegal traffic among the commingled inmates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as <i>Blackburn,</i> we rejected the argument that \"the security needs of a prison can, <i>standing alone,</i> properly justify the `complete withdrawal' of Fourth Amendment rights from <i>all</i> who enter [a prison].\" 771 F.2d at 563 (emphasis in original); <i>see also Logan,</i> 660 F.2d at 1013 (\"An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to detainees ... cannot be constitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cases from other circuits are more explicit in rejecting the commingling argument advanced by the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Most notable is the Sixth Circuit's holding in <i>Masters v.

In short, the cases from other circuits, when read in conjunction with our own precedent, would not permit a reasonable prison official to conclude that minor offense arrestees could be strip searched without reasonable suspicion simply because the prison officials decide to mix the arrestees with other prisoners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our colleagues say that <i>Swain</i> could not have provided fair warning for another reason. According to our brethren, <i>Swain,</i> as well as the cases from other circuits upon which it relied, involved local jails rather than prisons, like the ACI. The distinction between jails and maximum security prisons is a crucial leg upon which our colleagues' opinion rests. It is here that their incomplete archeological excavation which we mentioned earlier becomes important. The cases that our colleagues ignored involved the early development of our reasonable suspicion standard as it applied to strip searches of prison visitors. At issue in those cases were both jails <i>and</i> prisons. <i>See Wood,</i> 89 F.3d at 925 (prison); <i>Blackburn,</i> 771 F.2d at 559 (county jail).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more relevant is the fact that one of those cases dealt with the ACI. <i>See Cochrane,</i> 949 F.2d at 12. In <i>Cochrane,</i> we vacated a judgment granting directed verdicts for ACI officials defending the strip search of an inmate's daughter. We said that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]bsent any evidence that appellant ever violated a prison visitation rule, or even supplied Cochrane with drugs, a reasonable juror could have concluded that Cochrane's contraband drugs were supplied by prison officials or other inmates. Thus, the jury could have found that the strip search of appellant was unreasonable because it was based on <i>no</i> \"individualized suspicion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 13 (emphasis in original). Our colleagues maintain that the defendants were justified in believing that no reasonable suspicion was required in this case in part because the defendants \"must maintain institutional security in the most difficult of settings.\" Yet the same setting and security considerations were not enough to defeat the requirement for individualized suspicion in <i>Cochrane.</i> We do not understand on what legal basis our colleagues can now say that those same security needs made the defendants' unconstitutional strip searches reasonable. Certainly the defendants had fair warning that the reasonable suspicion standard would be applied to them because, in fact, they had already been held to that standard in the past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one difference between <i>Cochrane</i> and the present case is that <i>Cochrane</i> involved prison visitors, not minor offense arrestees. But this fact does not help the defendants; if anything, it further highlights why the defendants had fair warning that their strip search policies were unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has explained that prison visitors \"invite a host of security problems\" because they can pass weapons and contraband \"to an inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers.\" <i>Block v.

It is well recognized, however, that individuals arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses do not present the same security risk as prison visitors. <i>See Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 111; <i>Giles,</i> 746 F.2d at 617. This is because arrests, unlike visits, are not planned events. They are random and do not afford an arrestee the opportunity to hatch a scheme to smuggle contraband into a prison. As the Second Circuit has explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is far less obvious that misdemeanor arrestees frequently or even occasionally hide contraband in their bodily orifices. Unlike persons already in jail who receive contact visits, arrestees do not ordinarily have notice that they are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide something.

The present case involves people brought to the ACI because they were arrested, sometimes mistakenly as the record reveals, for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses. They did not come into contact with prison visitors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our colleagues concoct a hypothetical situation in which an inmate arranges for an outsider to bring weapons or contraband inside the prison by staging an incident that would lead to the outsider being arrested for a minor offense. With due respect, this is chimerical. The only case our colleagues have exhumed to support their scenario is <i>Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507387\"><a href=\"/opinion/507387/lynda-l-watt-v-city-of-richardson-police-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1988). They claim <i>Watt</i> stands for the idea that \"a suspect jailed even temporarily on a minor offense could have the opportunity, if not searched, to smuggle weapons or contraband.\" <i>Id.</i> at 198. The very next sentence from <i>Watt,</i> however, shows that the quote upon which they rely is applicable only to those arrestees charged with weapons, shoplifting or drug offenses or those with a history of such offenses. <i>See id.</i> (\"Limiting the searches generally to those offenders charged with or having a criminal history of narcotics, shoplifting or weapons charges is not an irrational attempt to foster jail security....\"). <i>Watt</i> does not support our colleagues' theory that non-violent, non-drug related minor offense arrestees will conduct coordinated smuggling schemes to infiltrate prisons with contraband and weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps more importantly, there is no evidence in the record to support our colleagues' hypothetical. In fact, the record undermines it. At no time has the ACI ever found weapons or contraband in an arrestee's rectum or genital area. <i>Roberts II,</i> 239 F.3d at 112 n. 6. Only on one occasion has the ACI found contraband in the body cavity of a minor offense arrestee. <i>Id.</i> In that instance, the arrestee was hiding a bag of drugs in his mouth. <i>Id.</i> All the other contraband that the ACI has found on minor offense arrestees has been discovered in their clothing. It is obvious that the intrusive and degrading searches that the ACI chose to institute were not required to find this contraband. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No historical analysis of our strip search cases would be complete without a close examination of our holding in <i>Arruda v.

Our colleagues say that <i>Arruda</i> is a case with \"considerable force\" because it \"reasonably can be read as saying that the risk that <i>any prisoner</i> in a maximum security facility might receive weapons or contraband from visitors, renegade guards, <i>or others</i> is enough to justify a blanket strip search policy.\" (emphasis added). Characterized in this manner, <i>Arruda</i> forms another critical leg upon which our colleagues' opinion stands. Their expansive reading of <i>Arruda</i> is unwarranted. <i>Arruda</i> is a totally different case than what we face here. It is so different that no reasonable official could have read <i>Arruda</i> to authorize suspicionless strip searches of minor offense arrestees.

These prisoners were convicted felons assigned to a special cell block, which we described as a \"`prison within a prison,' designed to hold the most dangerous inmates.\" <i>Id.</i> The plaintiff himself was assigned to this special cell block for assaulting another prisoner. <i>Id.</i> In addition, the plaintiff testified that, while a prisoner, he possessed drugs and a weapon. <i>Id.</i> at 888. It is beyond comprehension how the defendants can equate extraordinarily violent convicted felons with people who have been arrested for minor offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and most pertinently, what we identified in <i>Arruda</i> as the \"closest question,\" <i>id.,</i> most analogous to the instant case, was whether prisoners who were convicted felons needed to be searched en route from cell to library or infirmary, even though accompanied by a guard. Like the misdemeanor arrestees here, there would seem to be no basis for any suspicion that such inmates would possess contraband. The record in <i>Arruda,</i> however, revealed a number of instances when guards were found to be involved in smuggling drugs to prisoners. This caused us to hold, \"[G]iven the problem of prison employee involvement with contraband, the district court's conclusion is not unreasonable.\" <i>Id.; but see id.</i> at 891, 890 (Maletz, J., dissenting in part) (\"When one of the primary justifications for strip searches in these circumstances rests on the institution's inability to control its own staff the scales tip decidedly in favor of the inmate.... I am constrained to conclude that routine visual strip searches before and after visits to the prison library and prison hospital are unreasonable, absent some level of cause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twenty years have passed since we decided <i>Arruda</i> and the case law barring suspicionless strip searches of minor offense arrestees has proliferated. And <i>Swain,</i> with its clear recognition that a strip search requires reasonable suspicion, has been on the books of this circuit since 1997. The record in this case does not reveal a prison employee drug smuggling problem. There remains only the speculative risk that a non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanant, randomly arrested, might fortuitously be a bearer of contraband. That is not enough, in our view, to permit the defendants to escape liability for their unconstitutional acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only similarity between <i>Arruda</i> and the present case is that the correctional facilities in both cases are maximum security prisons. This is the vital similarity upon which the defendants' argument relies. Despite the key differences I have described above, our colleagues are persuaded by this single similarity. Our colleagues say that prison officials cannot be expected to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions that we judges will make after full briefing and argument. We agree with that statement as a general matter. But that is not to say that prison officials have no responsibility to analyze the law. All of the individual defendants here are high level prison officials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> They are not entry-level prison guards who have no access to legal advice and have superiors who have failed to supply any training on constitutional law whatsoever. The defendants in this case <i>are</i> the superiors and should be held to the standard of a \"reasonably competent public official [who] should know the law governing his conduct.\" <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 819, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (1982). The qualified immunity analysis is based on an objective standard. <i>See Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 95. This necessarily implies some informed and professional analysis. Merely to take refuge in the concept that the ACI is a maximum security prison, without identifying any realistic distinction between the situation in <i>Arruda</i> and the situation that the defendants were confronted with at the ACI, falls far short of any credible analysis of the state of the law both within and outside this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We close our review of the relevant legal history regarding strip searches with an important observation. Our colleagues do not cite to a single case which permits suspicionless strip searches of non-violent, non-drug related minor offense arrestees. It is quite amazing that they can claim the law is ambiguous but fail to provide a single case that directly supports their position. The only case our colleagues offer is <i>Covino v. Patrissi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585227\"><a href=\"/opinion/585227/robert-h-covino-v-joseph-patrissi-commissioner-of-corrections-heinz/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1992). But that case, as our colleagues readily admit, is not on point. The plaintiff in <i>Covino</i> was not arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses like the plaintiffs in this case. He was arrested for kidnaping a child under the age of sixteen and was ultimately sentenced to 20 to 35 years in prison. <i>Id.</i> at 75 n. 1. In addition, the prison superintendent in <i>Covino</i> testified that \"occasionally contraband and drugs were found secreted in an inmate's rectum.\" <i>Id.</i> at 79. As we have already explained, the evidence in this case is to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without direct legal support, our brethren are forced to argue that generalized statements from certain cases made the law so ambiguous that the defendants could not have had fair warning. Our colleagues argue, for example, that there exists \"a separate line of cases [that] has emphasized the need to defer to the judgment of correctional officials in addressing institutional security needs.\" If these types of sweeping statements are enough to shield prison officials from liability for their illegal actions, then there is the significant risk that qualified immunity will always attach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this concern that brings us to our final point. Up to now, we have argued that our colleagues analysis of our legal history is incomplete and untenable. This is not the only flaw in their opinion. We are deeply troubled by the weight our colleagues give to our statement in <i>Roberts II</i> that institutional security concerns in this case \"fall somewhere between\" those exhibited in <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda.</i> 239 F.3d at 111. Our colleagues describe this statement as an acknowledgment that the ACI's strip search policy fell into a \"gray area\" of the law. We respectfully disagree. The <i>Roberts II</i> statement merely recognizes the obvious: that the facts of the present case fall somewhere between those of <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda.</i> Such an observation is not surprising. Indeed, most cases will fall somewhere between <i>Swain</i> and <i>Arruda</i> because those two cases represent the opposite ends of the spectrum. <i>Swain</i> was a case involving an arrestee who was placed in a cell in a local police station. In contrast, <i>Arruda</i> involved extraordinarily violent convicted felons who were confined to a special security section of a maximum security prison. What our colleagues have done is to construe a dictum probably intended to soften criticism of the prison officials into a sweeping carte blanche, protecting officials for a wide swath of conduct elsewhere long since forbidden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placing so much weight on the <i>Roberts II</i> statement runs the risk of creating an impenetrable defense for government officials. Our colleagues' reliance on the <i>Roberts II</i> statement implies that qualified immunity will only be denied in this circuit when the facts of the case at bar are the same as those in previously decided cases. This risk is compounded by our colleagues' statement that <i>Swain</i> could not give the defendants fair warning because it is not \"a very exact match\" to the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such reasoning flouts the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Hope v. Pelzer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span> (2002). In <i>Hope,</i> the Court admonished the Eleventh Circuit for finding the law clearly established only when the facts of previous cases were \"fundamentally similar\" to the present case. <i>Id.</i> at 739, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2508</span></a></span>. The Court said that such an approach was a \"rigid gloss on the qualified immunity standard ... [that] is not consistent with our cases.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court explained that \"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances,\" and that \"[a]lthough earlier cases involving `fundamentally similar' facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established, they are not necessary to such a finding. The same is true of cases with `materially similar' facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 741, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This seems to us an attempt to have it both ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our colleagues may well be correct that the strip search policy at issue in this case, and others like it, are \"dead and buried.\" But their qualified immunity analysis will live on; it will undoubtedly be used in future cases involving other important constitutional rights. The qualified immunity defense is \"an attempt to balance competing values: not only the importance of a damages remedy to protect the rights of citizens ... but also `the need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.'\" <i>Harlow,</i> 457 U.S. at 807, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

By finding ambiguity in our cases where there is none, and by implying that previous cases must be \"a very exact match\" before they can give fair warning for purposes of the qualified immunity analysis, our brethren have tipped the balance away from the Constitution. They have gone far toward granting absolute immunity under the cloak of qualified immunity. We believe that this court is obliged not only to give due deference to the judgment of government officials but to insist that the constitutional rights of individuals be vigilantly protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the bar to a remedy is set too high, then constitutional rights are in jeopardy. Government officials will have less incentive to change their illegal policies on their own accord because the deterrent effect of damages is lacking. Aggrieved individuals will have less incentive to challenge those policies because monetary compensation for their harms is unavailable. In the end, unconstitutional government action is more likely to go unchanged.
