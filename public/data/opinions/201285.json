Appellant José Romero-Villanueva challenges\n\nthe district court's denial of a motion for reconsideration, filed\n\nafter the district court granted appellees' summary judgment motion\n\non employment discrimination charges.           For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          Romero-Villanueva (Romero) worked for appellee Puerto\n\nRico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) for twenty-eight years before\n\nretiring due to health problems in 1999, two years before he became\n\neligible for full retirement benefits.          In the district court, he\n\nasserted that PREPA forced his early retirement by subjecting him\n\nto various forms of discrimination.             Romero first claimed that\n\nPREPA's   treatment    in    the   wake    of   two   debilitating    strokes\n\nviolated, inter alia, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2000(e) to 2000(e)-17.          He also claimed that he suffered\n\npolitical discrimination, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and\n\nunlawful retaliation as a result of his refusal to fire employees\n\naffiliated with the Partido Popular Democratico political party.\n\n           The trial court granted summary judgment for PREPA,\n\nfinding   that   the   discrimination       claims    were   barred   by   the\n\napplicable statutes of limitations: one year for the § 1983 claim,\n\nsee Benitez-Pons v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 59\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); Sifre v. Puerto Rico Dep't of Health, 38 F. Supp.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f2d 91, 95 (D.P.R. 1999), and 300 days for claims under Title VII,\n\nsee 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, Div. of\n\nMelville Corp., 145 F.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir. 1998), and the ADA, see 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2000e-5(e)(1), 12117(a); Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez,\n\nInc., 194 F.3d 275, 278 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that claims brought\n\nunder Title I of the ADA must be filed with the appropriate\n\nadministrative agency within the same limitations period set forth\n\nin Title VII).\n\n           In    so   holding,   the   trial   court   rejected   Romero's\n\ncontention that the alleged violations fell within the continuing\n\nviolation exception to the Title VII statute of limitations, which\n\nmight have allowed him to recover for acts beyond the 300-day\n\nperiod.   The court reasoned that Romero was aware of the alleged\n\ndiscrimination by December 1995, at the latest,1 and thus forfeited\n\nhis claim by failing to file a complaint with the appropriate\n\nadministrative agency until November 1996, more than 300 days\n\nlater.    More specifically, because the complaint was filed on\n\nNovember 8, 1996, any claim originating before January 13, 1996 was\n\ntime barred.\n\n           Romero then filed a motion to reconsider the grant of\n\nsummary judgment. He argued first that the court erred in applying\n\nthe ADA statute of limitations, and second, that the claims should\n\n\n\n     1\n      Romero requested reasonable accommodations in November 1995\nupon returning from his first medical leave.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fbe allowed under the doctrine of equitable tolling.2 In support of\n\nthe latter, Romero cited two letters from PREPA that he argues\n\nlulled him    into      believing    that      he   would   receive   a   requested\n\ndisability accommodation, thus explaining his delay in filing a\n\ndiscrimination claim with the appropriate administrative agency.\n\n            In denying the motion for reconsideration, the district\n\ncourt repeated its calculation of the ADA statute of limitations,\n\napplying the 300-day limit set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)\n\nand   counting    backwards      from    the    date    that   Romero     filed   his\n\ndiscrimination claim with the Anti Discrimination Unit (ADU), the\n\nPuerto    Rican   counterpart       to   the    Equal    Employment     Opportunity\n\nCommission.       The    court    also    rejected       the   equitable    tolling\n\nargument, finding no evidence that the letters were motivated by a\n\nbad faith desire to prevent Romero from seeking a remedy through\n\nthe available administrative channels.                 Romero now challenges the\n\norder denying his motion for reconsideration, focusing primarily on\n\nthe issue of equitable estoppel.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The motion to reconsider also faulted the trial court for\nfailing to address Romero's retaliation claim. The order denying\nthe motion to reconsider disposed of that assertion, noting that\n\"after reviewing the pleadings . . . the Court cannot discern that\nretaliation claims were ever presented before the Court as a\nseparate and distinct cause of action for relief . . . . The Court\nconsiders the resolution of the § 1983 and ADA claims to fully\naddress those federal claims presented.\"        In light of this\ndisposition and the lack of additional evidence to the contrary, we\nfind no fault with the district court's ruling.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f                                      II.\n\n          Our    review    of   an    order    denying   a   motion   for\n\nreconsideration is highly deferential.        Ordinarily, we will vacate\n\nsuch an order only when it amounts to an abuse of the trial court's\n\ndiscretion.    Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"An appellate court ought not to overturn a trial court's denial\n\nof a motion for reconsideration unless a miscarriage of justice is\n\nin prospect or the record otherwise reveals a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\"); Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n          A motion for reconsideration is not an opportunity to\n\npresent new legal claims or to relitigate issues decided at the\n\nsummary judgment stage.     Such a motion is properly granted only\n\nupon a showing of manifest error of law or in light of newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.      Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto\n\nRico, 212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          The court below found that Romero's motion did not fall\n\ninto either of these categories. Before so concluding, however, it\n\nconsidered a legal argument not addressed previously but touched\n\nupon in the plaintiff's motion in opposition to summary judgment:\n\nan equitable estoppel claim based on two letters Romero received\n\nfrom PREPA.3    Because the trial court dealt with the equitable\n\n\n     3\n      Romero's Brief in Opposition to Summary Judgment included a\npassing reference to letters from PREPA and the following argument:\n     In Jensen v. Snelling, 841 F.2d 600, 600-07 (5th Cir.\n\n                                     -5-\n\festoppel      issue    on     its     merits       and   denied   the    motion     for\n\nreconsideration on that basis, we do the same.\n\n                                            III.\n\n              We pause first to dispense with a technical matter.\n\nAlthough the order on appeal refers to \"equitable tolling,\" Romero\n\ncorrectly     points    out    that     the    related     doctrine     of   equitable\n\nestoppel is more relevant in this context.                        Equitable tolling\n\nexcuses a plaintiff's delay in asserting his rights when the\n\nplaintiff was unaware of his rights because of employer misconduct.\n\nSee Benitez-Pons, 136 F.3d at 61; Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am.,\n\n861    F.2d   746,    752   (1st    Cir.      1988).      Equitable     estoppel,   by\n\ncontrast, occurs when a party is aware of his rights \"but does not\n\nmake    a   timely    filing    due    to     his    reasonable    reliance    on   his\n\nemployer's misleading or confusing representations or conduct.\"\n\nKale, 861 F.2d at 752; see also Dillman v. Combustion Eng'g, Inc.,\n\n784 F.2d 57, 60-61 (2d Cir. 1986).                 Here, Romero does not deny that\n\nhe was aware of his rights, but rather claims that correspondence\n\n\n\n     1988); Chico-Velez v. Roche Products, Inc., 139 F.3d 56\n     (1st Cir. 1988), both circuits [sic] courts determined\n     that if defendant acts in some way are [sic] inconsistent\n     in order to avoid any assertive conduct from the\n     aggrieved party, without telling the truth and thereby\n     affecting his claim under the statute of limitations, the\n     courts will not allow such a defense under the equitable\n     tolling destine [sic].\nThe district court did not directly address this claim in its order\ngranting summary judgment for PREPA.     Romero then repeated the\nclaim verbatim in his motion for reconsideration and his\nsupplemental motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                            -6-\n\ffrom    PREPA    led        him   to    believe    that     his   employer    was   still\n\nconsidering his request for reasonable accommodations.                        This is a\n\nclaim of equitable estoppel.\n\n            The doctrine of equitable estoppel is reserved for cases\n\nin which \"exceptional circumstances\" are present.                       Redman v. U.S.\n\nWest Bus. Res., Inc., 153 F.3d 691, 696 (8th Cir. 1998).                         We have\n\nestablished          four    criteria      for    determining      whether    equitable\n\nestoppel applies:\n\n       (1) The party to be estopped must know the facts; (2) he\n       must intend that his conduct shall be acted on or must so\n       act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to\n       believe it is so intended; (3) the latter must be\n       ignorant of the true facts; and (4) he must rely on the\n       former's conduct to his injury.\n\nClauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 661 (1st Cir. 1987). Additionally,\n\n\"Evidence       of    either      the    employer's        improper    purpose    or   his\n\nconstructive knowledge of the deceptive nature of his conduct\n\n[i.e., that he knew or should have known] must also be shown.\"\n\nKale, 861 F.2d at 752.\n\n            Romero's equitable estoppel argument appears to rest\n\nsolely on two letters he received from PREPA representatives.                          The\n\nfirst    letter,        dated      May     31,     1996,     records    a    physician's\n\nrecommendation that Romero \"not make any physical effort\" at work\n\nin the wake of his stroke.                 The second, dated August 19, 1996,\n\nthough somewhat convoluted, includes a statement that PREPA was\n\nstill    considering          Romero's      reasonable       accommodation       request.\n\nRomero contends that these letters persuaded him that there was a\n\n                                             -7-\n\fpossibility that his reasonable accommodation request would be\n\ngranted, thereby inducing him to delay filing a discrimination\n\nclaim with the ADU.\n\n           The trial court rejected this position, noting that the\n\nletters \"do not conceal or attempt through fraud to keep Plaintiff\n\nfrom   realizing    relief    for   [the    allegedly   illegal]   employment\n\nactions\" and that there was \"no other evidence that a bad-faith\n\nattempt existed to prevent Plaintiff from filing an administrative\n\nclaim\" with the ADU.     Having reviewed the record, we agree.\n\n           Romero    argues    that   it     is   irrelevant   whether   PREPA\n\nintended to delay his filing a claim, and that he need only show\n\nthat his reliance was reasonable.           This argument misrepresents our\n\nsettled understanding of equitable estoppel, which requires a\n\nshowing that the employer had an improper purpose or constructive\n\nknowledge that its conduct was deceptive.            Kale, 861 F.2d at 752.\n\nHere, there has been no such showing.             The letters at issue were\n\nprompted by Romero's request for employment accommodations in light\n\nof his health.      The first is a doctor's recommendation regarding\n\nappropriate accommodations, and the second is essentially a status\n\nreport on Romero's various claims against PREPA, which also notes\n\nthat his reasonable accommodation request was still under analysis.\n\nNeither letter includes any indication that PREPA was likely to\n\ngrant the requested accommodations; they are not misleading, nor\n\nwould they support a finding that PREPA intended to prevent Romero\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\ffrom   filing   an   administrative   claim   with   the   ADU.    Without\n\nadditional evidence of an improper purpose or design to mislead\n\nRomero,   the   exceptional   circumstances    required    for    equitable\n\nestoppel are not present.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

The    court    also    rejected       the   equitable    tolling\n\nargument, finding no evidence that the letters were motivated by a\n\nbad faith desire to prevent Romero from seeking a remedy through\n\nthe available administrative channels.                 Romero now challenges the\n\norder denying his motion for reconsideration, focusing primarily on\n\nthe issue of equitable estoppel.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The motion to reconsider also faulted the trial court for\nfailing to address Romero's retaliation claim. The order denying\nthe motion to reconsider disposed of that assertion, noting that\n\"after reviewing the pleadings . . . the Court cannot discern that\nretaliation claims were ever presented before the Court as a\nseparate and distinct cause of action for relief . . . . The Court\nconsiders the resolution of the § 1983 and ADA claims to fully\naddress those federal claims presented.\"        In light of this\ndisposition and the lack of additional evidence to the contrary, we\nfind no fault with the district court's ruling.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f                                      II.\n\n          Our    review    of   an    order    denying   a   motion   for\n\nreconsideration is highly deferential.

Additionally,\n\n\"Evidence       of    either      the    employer's        improper    purpose    or   his\n\nconstructive knowledge of the deceptive nature of his conduct\n\n[i.e., that he knew or should have known] must also be shown.\"\n\nKale, 861 F.2d at 752.\n\n            Romero's equitable estoppel argument appears to rest\n\nsolely on two letters he received from PREPA representatives.                          The\n\nfirst    letter,        dated      May     31,     1996,     records    a    physician's\n\nrecommendation that Romero \"not make any physical effort\" at work\n\nin the wake of his stroke.                 The second, dated August 19, 1996,\n\nthough somewhat convoluted, includes a statement that PREPA was\n\nstill    considering          Romero's      reasonable       accommodation       request.\n\nRomero contends that these letters persuaded him that there was a\n\n                                             -7-\n\fpossibility that his reasonable accommodation request would be\n\ngranted, thereby inducing him to delay filing a discrimination\n\nclaim with the ADU.\n\n           The trial court rejected this position, noting that the\n\nletters \"do not conceal or attempt through fraud to keep Plaintiff\n\nfrom   realizing    relief    for   [the    allegedly   illegal]   employment\n\nactions\" and that there was \"no other evidence that a bad-faith\n\nattempt existed to prevent Plaintiff from filing an administrative\n\nclaim\" with the ADU.     Having reviewed the record, we agree.\n\n           Romero    argues    that   it     is   irrelevant   whether   PREPA\n\nintended to delay his filing a claim, and that he need only show\n\nthat his reliance was reasonable.           This argument misrepresents our\n\nsettled understanding of equitable estoppel, which requires a\n\nshowing that the employer had an improper purpose or constructive\n\nknowledge that its conduct was deceptive.            Kale, 861 F.2d at 752.\n\nHere, there has been no such showing.             The letters at issue were\n\nprompted by Romero's request for employment accommodations in light\n\nof his health.      The first is a doctor's recommendation regarding\n\nappropriate accommodations, and the second is essentially a status\n\nreport on Romero's various claims against PREPA, which also notes\n\nthat his reasonable accommodation request was still under analysis.\n\nNeither letter includes any indication that PREPA was likely to\n\ngrant the requested accommodations; they are not misleading, nor\n\nwould they support a finding that PREPA intended to prevent Romero\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\ffrom   filing   an   administrative   claim   with   the   ADU.    Without\n\nadditional evidence of an improper purpose or design to mislead\n\nRomero,   the   exceptional   circumstances    required    for    equitable\n\nestoppel are not present.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f</pre>",
