R. 32.3\n\n           United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\nNo. 02-1918\n\n                          STEPHEN P. KNIGHT,\n                         Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\n                                      v.\n\n              BROCKTON HOSPITAL; THE ARBOUR HOSPITAL,\n                       Defendants-Appellees,\n\n       CITY OF BROCKTON; CITY OF BOSTON, Police Department;\n                    BROCKTON POLICE DEPARTMENT,\n                            Defendants.\n\n\n           APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n     [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, Senior U. S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Stapleton,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Malcolm J. Barach, for appellant.\n     Daniel J. Buoniconti, for appellee, Brockton Hospital.\n     Janet J. Bobit, with whom Jeffrey W. Coleman was on the brief,\nfor appellee, The Arbour Hospital.\n\n\n                             October 8, 2003\n\n\n\n\n*   Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f               STAPLETON, Circuit Judge.       Appellant Stephen Knight asks\n\nus   to   determine     whether    the   claims   he   asserts   were   properly\n\nreferred to a medical malpractice tribunal under Massachusetts Law,\n\nChapter 231, § 60B.         We hold that they were not and, therefore,\n\nreverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                         I.\n\n               The complaint alleges that the police entered Knight’s\n\nhome without a warrant, sprayed mace in his eyes, and took him to\n\nAppellee Brockton Hospital. There, he was examined and transferred\n\nto Appellee Arbour Hospital, where he was “confined for some 21\n\ndays without legal justification and without his consent.”\n\n               Based on these factual allegations, Knight asserts claims\n\nunder     42   U.S.C.   §   1983   and    Massachusetts    law   against    both\n\nhospitals, the city of Brockton, and its police department.                These\n\ninclude an illegal search and seizure claim, an invasion of privacy\n\nclaim, a false imprisonment claim, an assault and battery claim,\n\nand a claim based on Massachusetts’s involuntary civil commitment\n\nstatute, Mass. Gen. L. c 123.\n\n               The Appellee hospitals moved to have the case referred to\n\nthe Massachusetts Superior Court for the purpose of convening a\n\nmedical malpractice tribunal under Mass. Gen. L. c 231 § 60B.               Over\n\nKnight’s objection, this motion was granted and a tribunal was\n\nconvened.       Knight declined to submit evidence to this tribunal,\n\nhowever, and the Superior Court decided in favor of the hospitals\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\ffor that reason and, pursuant to the statute, directed Knight to\n\npost a $6,000 bond.     Based on Knight’s failure to post a bond, the\n\ndistrict court entered judgment in favor of the hospitals under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).     This appeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           Under Massachusetts law, “[e]very action for malpractice,\n\nerror or mistake against a provider of health care shall be heard\n\nby a tribunal consisting of a single justice of the superior court,\n\na physician licensed to practice medicine in the commonwealth . .\n\n. and an attorney authorized to practice law in the commonwealth.\n\n. . .” Mass. Gen. L. ch. 231, § 60B.        “The function of a medical\n\nmalpractice tribunal is to separate medical malpractice claims into\n\ntwo groups: those appropriate for judicial evaluation, and those\n\ninvolving merely an unfortunate medical error” Millian v. Deaconess\n\nWaltham Hosp., 2001 Mass. Super LEXIS 450, *7 (Mass. Super. 2001).\n\n“[A] tribunal . . . evaluate[s] only the medical aspects of a\n\nmalpractice claim for the purpose of distinguishing between” those\n\ntypes of cases.    Salem Orthopedic Surgeons., Inc. v. Quinn, 386\n\nN.E.2d   1268,   1272   (Mass.   1979).     “The   tribunal   procedure,\n\ntherefore, is appropriate only where there is an issue of medical\n\nmalpractice, error or mistake.”          Leininger v. Franklin Medical\n\nCenter, 534 N.E.2d 1151, 1152 (Mass. 1989) (quotation omitted and\n\nemphasis in original).\n\n           Knight insists that he is not complaining about “medical\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fmalpractice, error or mistake” and the hospitals are unable to\n\npoint to any allegation in the complaint that is contrary to this\n\nassertion. Rather, they suggest that if Knight were required to be\n\nmore specific, it would be apparent that he is challenging a\n\nmedical decision.           While that may turn out to be the case, the\n\nhospitals did not move to dismiss for failure to state a claim or\n\nfor    a    more     definite    statement.       A    plaintiff     is   entitled   to\n\ndetermine what claims he wishes to have adjudicated and until it\n\naffirmatively appears that a claim involves a challenge to a\n\nmedical decision or treatment, a medical malpractice tribunal\n\nconvened under the Massachusetts statute has no jurisdiction.\n\nLeininger, 534 N.E.2d at 1152.1               Accordingly, this matter must be\n\nremanded to the district court.\n\n                  We do not, of course, suggest that a referral to a\n\nmedical          malpractice    tribunal   will       not   be    appropriate   if   it\n\nsubsequently appears that one of Knight’s state law claims presents\n\na medical issue.          Feinstein v. Massachusetts General Hospital, 643\n\nF.2d       880    (1st   Cir.   1981)   (when    a    federal     district   court   is\n\nexercising its diversity jurisdiction, the Rules of Decision Act,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1652, requires it to apply the Massachusetts medical\n\nmalpractice         statute).      To   the     extent      the   district   court   is\n\n\n\n       1\n     Contrary to the suggestions of the hospitals, this does not\nappear to be a case in which the plaintiff’s claim challenges a\nmedical decision but attempts to evade the statute by suing on\nother than a malpractice theory.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fconfronted on remand with an argument that one of Knight’s claims\n\nunder § 1983 should be submitted to such a tribunal, we do suggest\n\nthat it determine whether the Massachusetts statute was intended to\n\napply to such claims and whether it would be constitutional if so\n\napplied.\n\n                               III.\n\n           The judgments of the district court are reversed, and\n\nthis matter is remanded to that court for proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
