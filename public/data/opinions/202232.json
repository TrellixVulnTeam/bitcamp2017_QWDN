This case stems from the\n\nfailure of the city of Lynn, Massachusetts, to responsibly handle\n\nfunds distributed to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by the\n\nfederal      government   for   use        in   employment   training   and\n\nrehabilitation programs, and of the Massachusetts state government\n\nto monitor Lynn's use of those funds according to procedures\n\nspecified by the federal Department of Labor (DOL).                DOL has\n\nordered the state to repay some of the funds, and the state\n\nobjects.      Because we find that the DOL has the better of the\n\narguments, we affirm the decision of the Administrative Review\n\nBoard (the Board) and deny the Commonwealth's petition for review.\n\n                                      I.\n\n             Under the (now defunct) Job Training Partnership Act\n\n(JTPA), 29 U.S.C. § 1501 et seq. (1994) (repealed 2000), DOL made\n\nfunds available to the states for job training and rehabilitation\n\nprograms.1    The JTPA's stated purpose during the period pertinent\n\nto this case was to \"prepare youth and adults facing serious\n\nbarriers to employment for participation in the labor force by\n\nproviding job training and other services that will result in\n\nincreased employment and earnings.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1501. The statute\n\ncreated a number of programs under its various titles.           This case\n\n\n     1\n      The JTPA was enacted in 1982 and took effect July 1, 1983.\nPub. L. No. 97-300, §§ 161-172 (Oct. 13, 1982), 96 Stat. 1347. It\nwas repealed by statute in 1998, and the repeal became effective\nJuly 1, 2000. Pub. L. No. 105-220, Title I, § 199(b)(2), (c)(1)(B)\n(Aug. 7, 1998), 112 Stat. 1059.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdeals with the disbursement of funds under Titles II and III of the\n\nstatute.\n\n             The Board characterized the programs under Title II as\n\ndesigned to benefit \"disadvantaged youth and adults\" and those\n\nunder Title III as providing \"employment training assistance for\n\ndislocated workers.\"         Under both titles the Act called upon DOL to\n\ndistribute    funds    to    the   state    governors     or   their   proxies     in\n\nparticipating states.         In Massachusetts, it was the Department of\n\nEmployment and Training (DET) that administered the Title II funds\n\nat the state level, while the Corporation for Business, Work, and\n\nLearning (CBWL) and its predecessor agency, the Industrial Services\n\nProgram (ISP), administered the Title III funds.                  DET and CBWL/ISP\n\nin turn parceled out the money for use in geographically distinct\n\nService Delivery Areas (SDAs).2                 In order to do so, they would\n\ndesignate a grant recipient (generally a local government), see 29\n\nU.S.C.   §   1511,    20    C.F.R.   §§    628.405    &   .415,   as   well   as   an\n\nadministrative entity that would take ground-level responsibility\n\nfor implementing the various JTPA programs, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1503(2) &\n\n1514; 20 C.F.R. §§ 628.405 & .415.               This case involves the Service\n\nDelivery Area for Lynn (Lynn SDA) and the efforts of DOL to recover\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Title II authorized distribution only through the SDAs. See\n29 U.S.C. §§ 1511 & 1514. Title III authorized distribution to\nother classes of administrative entities in addition to the SDAs,\nsee id., §§ 1661-1661c, but this case involves only distribution\nthrough the SDAs themselves.\n\n                                          -3-\n\ffunds from Massachusetts that are untraceable and may have been\n\nsubstantively misspent.\n\n              Programs for the Lynn SDA were administered by an entity\n\ncalled Northshore Employment Training (Northshore).                         In 1993,\n\nNorthshore received its first warning from DET: the Commonwealth\n\nhad    been    reviewing     Northshore's       financial    records,       and   had\n\nidentified     \"relatively      minor\"     problems.        The    state     directed\n\nNorthshore to develop a plan to ensure better reporting.                     Over the\n\ncourse of the next two years, however, Northshore's financial\n\naccounting      did    not    improve,    and    Massachusetts       progressively\n\nincreased its oversight of Northshore and eventually decertified\n\nit.    At all stages, DOL, through its Boston office, appears to have\n\nbeen    apprised      of   Northshore's    increasingly      apparent       financial\n\nmismanagement, and to have been involved in cooperative efforts\n\nwith Massachusetts to monitor the program, contain the damage, and\n\nget the Lynn SDA back on track.             Despite the best efforts of the\n\nfederal, state, and local authorities, however, Northshore inched\n\ntowards complete failure.            In the summer of 1995, DET accused\n\nNorthshore of financial mismanagement and took over partial control\n\nof some of the Lynn programs.             In October of that year, Lynn SDA\n\nwas formally designated as a \"high risk\" grantee for its failure to\n\ncomply    with     the     various   corrective      plans        imposed    by   the\n\nCommonwealth agencies in charge of monitoring Northshore. In April\n\n1996,    DET     described     Northshore's      financial        system    as    \"not\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\foperational or coherent\" and decertified Northshore as a JTPA\n\nfunding recipient, and in June 1996, Northshore closed its doors\n\nand the Greater Lowell Regional Employment Board took over its\n\nemployment service responsibilities.            Subsequently, Massachusetts\n\nbegan proceedings to collect from the city of Lynn $6,340,397 that\n\nit considered misspent because Lynn had not maintained adequate\n\nrecords.    Lynn made efforts to avoid repayment.\n\n            During and after this period of decline, Massachusetts\n\nauthorities received public plaudits from the Boston office of the\n\nDOL for their efforts to manage the Lynn SDA crisis and to recover\n\nwasted funds from Lynn, tempered by reminders that as the immediate\n\nrecipient    of    the   JTPA     funds    Massachusetts     was    ultimately\n\nindividually responsible to the DOL for any funds not recovered\n\nfrom Lynn. In 1997, DOL's Office of the Inspector General received\n\nits own audit, performed under contract by Deloitte and Touche,\n\nLLP, CPAs, of the Lynn program. The audit noted that Massachusetts\n\nhad made a determination against Lynn that disallowed to Lynn\n\n$7,137,698 in JTPA Title II funds3 and $1,970,288 in Title III\n\nfunds.     Later that year, DOL began administrative proceedings\n\nseeking a declaration that Massachusetts had misspent federal funds\n\nfrom 1994 to 1996 by distributing the same $9,107,986 to the local\n\nagency   when     Massachusetts    had    not   guaranteed   that    Lynn   was\n\n\n     3\n      The full Title II figure was in fact $7,189,920, but of this\namount $52,222 was related to a program that did not fall under the\npurview of the DOL.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcomplying or capable of complying with the federal accounting\n\nrequirements.       In May 1998 the Grant Officer responsible for\n\nprosecuting the case made a formal determination charging the\n\nCommonwealth with just over $9 million in misspent funds.                      The\n\nCommonwealth appealed to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who\n\ndirected the Grant Officer to permit the state to show evidence on\n\ncertain points that could reduce its liability.            The Grant Officer\n\ndid so but arrived again at her initial conclusion, and the\n\nCommonwealth appealed to the ALJ for a second time.                The ALJ then\n\nreversed roughly $5 million of the original $9 million in charges\n\nto   the   state,   finding    that    the   Commonwealth       had   adequately\n\ndocumented this portion of the expenditures and that these funds\n\nhad been spent responsibly.            The Grant Officer appealed to the\n\nAdministrative      Review    Board,     DOL's    final   and    authoritative\n\nadjudicative body.          The Board remanded to the ALJ, requiring\n\ngreater clarity with respect to certain points.4            On remand, after\n\nmaking     the   required    findings,    the    ALJ   abandoned      his   former\n\ndisposition and affirmed the Grant Officer's original position that\n\n\n\n      4\n      The most vital point in the remand order was a determination\nthat the ALJ had erroneously applied certain outdated provisions of\nthe regulations and had misconstrued the weight to be given to\njudicial and agency precedent as to certain points. There was also\nsome confusion in the record about the time period during which\ncertain events took place: the confusion arose from the fact that\nwhen DOL speaks of, for example, Program Year 1995, it is referring\nto the period from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996, while when\nMassachusetts speaks of Fiscal Year 1995, it is referring to the\nperiod from July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthe state owed the full $9 million.                     Massachusetts once again\n\nappealed the ALJ's disposition to the Board, which affirmed in all\n\nrespects.\n\n            The Board's basic theory was that Massachusetts had\n\nviolated its obligation to ensure that the regional agencies that\n\nreceived its funds (often referred to in the bureaucratic argot as\n\n\"subrecipients\")         maintained            financial       records    capable     of\n\ndemonstrating how those funds were spent.                      As an initial matter,\n\nMassachusetts had failed to compel the Lynn SDA to conduct the\n\nannual audit required by the Single Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 7501-\n\n7507 (1994) (SAA), and implementing regulations.                      This failure, on\n\nthe Board's interpretation, opened up the possibility of repayment\n\nliability,      and    the   state       was    then    given    an   opportunity     to\n\ndemonstrate that the Lynn SDA had in fact spent its federal funds\n\nfor JTPA-appropriate purposes.                 As a practical matter, the Grant\n\nOfficer and various reviewing entities were looking for rigorously\n\ncollected and properly thorough \"source documentation\" consisting\n\nof receipts, invoices, cancelled checks, and the like.                           Where\n\nMassachusetts was able to produce such documentation, the Grant\n\nOfficer dropped claims of misspending, but where the state could\n\nnot   produce    the    documentation,           the   Board    charged   it   for   the\n\nunaccounted-for funds.\n\n            In lieu of some of the missing source documentation, the\n\nCommonwealth      submitted          a    detailed         accounting,      called    a\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f\"Reconstructed Trial Balance\" (RTB), in which the state's own\n\nauditor attempted to reconstruct Northshore's finances throughout\n\nthe period at issue.      In the Board's words, the RTB \"represented an\n\naccounting consultant's reconstruction of the Lynn SDA records,\n\nwhich was undertaken in an effort to produce an auditable set of\n\nfinancial records.\" The state also submitted statements by its own\n\nagents that they had themselves consistently reviewed Northshore's\n\nsource documents with respect to certain aspects of the program.\n\nIn the Commonwealth's view, the post hoc accounting and state agent\n\ntestimony    constituted       substitute     evidence     of    Northshore's\n\nessentially proper management of its financial affairs, and it\n\nargued that in light of this uncontradicted evidence the Board\n\nshould have found that the funds were properly spent.\n\n            The   state    thus   contended     that     the    record-keeping\n\nrequirements of the JTPA and regulations are not substantive\n\nobligations, but are instead simply one way of enforcing the\n\nunderlying requirement that a state take sufficient care to direct\n\nits JTPA funds towards JTPA-related activities.                   The state's\n\nposition    was   that    it   had   provided    satisfactory      substitute\n\nassurances of good financial management and should not have been\n\npenalized for failing to abide by the particular requirements of\n\nthe relevant record-keeping provisions.\n\n            The Board in fact adopted roughly this legal position,\n\nbut rejected the state's specific claims because the evidence the\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fstate provided was not sufficient to convince the Board that the\n\nfunds were properly spent.   The Board crucially noted that the RTB\n\nwas not itself based on source documentation, but was in essence\n\nnothing more than an accountant's speculation as to what probably\n\nhappened to the funds disbursed by Northshore.    It likewise found\n\ninsufficient the state agents' testimony that they had themselves\n\nreviewed source documentation at Northshore.      Massachusetts now\n\npetitions for review of the Board's decision.\n\n          In its petition, Massachusetts raises three questions,\n\nasking: whether the Board acted within its authority in determining\n\nthat as a legal matter Massachusetts could have violated the terms\n\nof the JTPA on the facts alleged by the Grant Officer; whether the\n\nBoard's decision to disallow the expenses and seek repayment was\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence because the Board chose not\n\nto accept as sufficient the evidence proffered by the state; and\n\nwhether the Board abused its discretion when it decided not to\n\nforgive the state its obligation to repay.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          The JTPA requires a state to comply with a host of rules\n\nin order to qualify for funding.    The rules relevant to this case\n\nfall into two broad categories.    On one side of the line, the JTPA\n\nimposes limitations on the uses to which federal funds may be put.\n\nThese substantive regulations govern expenses incurred by regional\n\nagencies in providing employment training services.     Among other\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\frequirements, the regulations prescribe that an agency spending\n\nJTPA funds can only incur costs that are \"necessary and reasonable\n\nto the proper and efficient administration of the program.\"                            29\n\nU.S.C. § 1574(a)(2); 20 C.F.R. § 627.435(a).                   The agency must also\n\nclassify its expenditures according to the categories prescribed by\n\nstatute,5      and    the    statute      and   regulations        prescribe    maximum\n\nexpenditures for certain categories -- for example, the regulations\n\nspecify that (depending on the program) administrative costs can\n\namount    to    no    more   than    fifteen       or     twenty   percent     of    total\n\nexpenditures.\n\n               In order to ensure compliance with these and other\n\nsubstantive       limitations        on     expenditures,          the     statute     and\n\nregulations place a heavy emphasis on financial management and\n\naccountability, and the other category of relevant regulations is\n\nthe set of rules specifying the state and agency responsibilities\n\nto account for their use of funds.                      These oversight provisions\n\nspecify     the      mechanisms     through       which    states    and    their     JTPA\n\nsubrecipients must demonstrate to DOL that they are fulfilling\n\ntheir obligations under the substantive provisions of the Act.\n\n\n\n     5\n      For some Title II funds in the programs at issue here, the\nfunds must be expended either on 1) administration, 2) what are\ncalled training-related services/supportive services, or 3) direct\ntraining services. 29 U.S.C. § 1518(b); 20 C.F.R. § 627.440(d)(1)-\n(5). Title III funds must be categorized as related to 1) rapid\nresponse services, 2) basic readjustment services, 3) retraining\nservices, 4) needs-related payment and supportive services, and 5)\nadministration. 29 U.S.C. § 1661c(a); 20 C.F.R. § 631.13(a)(1).\n\n                                           -10-\n\fAmong them is the requirement that \"[e]ach State shall establish\n\nsuch fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be\n\nnecessary to assure the proper disbursal of, and accounting for,\n\nFederal funds paid to the recipient under subchapters II and III of\n\nthis chapter.\"      Id., § 1574(a)(1).       The statute goes on to specify\n\nthat    \"[s]uch     procedures      shall    ensure   that    all    financial\n\ntransactions are conducted and records maintained in accordance\n\nwith generally accepted accounting principles applicable in each\n\nState.\"    Id.\n\n               Massachusetts maintains that it and the Lynn SDA were\n\nlargely in compliance with all relevant substantive provisions of\n\nthe Act and regulations throughout the relevant time periods.               The\n\nstate contends that the roughly $9 million at stake in these\n\nproceedings (except for a few small sums it has conceded were\n\nmisused) was spent to procure job training services as directed by\n\nthe JTPA, and that DOL is wrong to try to recoup the money.\n\nMassachusetts ran into trouble, however, when it came time to\n\ndemonstrate to the agency that the funds were appropriately spent.\n\nThe    usual    method    for   demonstrating   substantive    compliance    is\n\nthrough the completion of an independent audit.              Such an audit is\n\nrequired by the SAA, as implemented at 29 C.F.R. Part 96 and made\n\napplicable to JTPA programs by 20 C.F.R. § 629.1(b).\n\n               An SAA audit would have reviewed the substate agency's\n\nfinancial      records,    examined   receipts,   invoices,    and   cancelled\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fchecks, and made a determination as to the degree of the agency's\n\ncompliance with the applicable regulations.        Where such an audit\n\nindicated that funds had been misspent, the right response would\n\ngenerally be twofold: the imposition of financial sanctions on the\n\nstate to the degree of the misexpenditure, and the proposal of\n\nremedial measures designed to prevent future misspending.            Here,\n\nhowever, no such audit was conducted.       Neither the statute nor the\n\nregulations specify precisely what ought to happen where an audit\n\nis never undertaken, but through its adjudication processes the\n\nBoard   has    developed   a   rule   for   determining   what   a   fair\n\nreimbursement is under these circumstances.\n\n           Section 627.802(e) in the Code of Federal Regulations\n\nspecifies that, where a determination under the JTPA is entrusted\n\nto a Grant Officer in the first instance, the Grant Officer bears\n\nthe burden of producing evidence to support a determination against\n\na party.      Thereafter, the regulation says, the party seeking to\n\noverturn the Grant Officer's determination has the burden of\n\npersuasion.     In this case, the Board determined that the Grant\n\nOfficer made a prima facie case that funds were misspent under 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1574(d) by offering evidence that an SAA audit was not\n\ncarried out.     The state's burden in response was to demonstrate\n\nthat it either \"met the specific requirements imposed by the JTPA\"\n\n-- i.e., that it had actually carried out an SAA-compliant audit --\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\for that it had \"compensated for any deficiencies through other\n\nmeans.\"\n\n            As a technical matter, under this system the DOL charges\n\nthe state with misspending simply because it has failed to properly\n\nput in place the appropriate accounting safeguards: the failure to\n\nconduct an audit constitutes a repayment-worthy violation of the\n\nJTPA in itself.           DOL then limits the amount of the charged\n\nrepayment to the amount which the state cannot demonstrate was\n\nspent in compliance with the substantive regulations.                   In order to\n\ndemonstrate       that    compliance,        the   state    must       show    source\n\ndocumentation, and where it does, it earns the right to avoid\n\nrepaying the funds to the DOL.          The practical effect of this system\n\nis that the state is responsible for repaying to DOL any funds it\n\ncannot    prove    were    spent   in   compliance        with   the    substantive\n\nregulations.       In the words of the Board, \"Lynn was obligated not\n\nonly to implement and maintain fiscal controls that ensured that\n\nNorthshore funds were expended in compliance with all pertinent\n\nJTPA   requirements,       but   also   to     maintain    adequate     records   to\n\ndemonstrate       that    such   expenditures      complied      with    the   Act.\"\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n            Although Massachusetts attempted to prove substantive\n\ncompliance with the JTPA in lieu of presenting a clean audit, the\n\nBoard concluded that the evidence it presented was not sufficiently\n\n\"detailed, reliable, and extensive\" to meet its burden. Our review\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fof   the   final    determination   of   the   Board    under   the   JTPA    is\n\ndeferential.       We are bound by the Board's findings of fact so long\n\nas they are supported by substantial evidence.                  29 U.S.C. §\n\n1578(a)(3).    While the statute grants us authority to review the\n\nlegal determinations of the Board, see id., as a general matter we\n\ndefer to \"an agency's reasonable interpretation of a statute that\n\nit administers.\"      P. Gioioso & Sons, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &\n\nHealth Review Comm'n, 115 F.3d 100, 107 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n\n837, 843-44 (1984); Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human\n\nServs., 96 F.3d 542, 547 (1st Cir. 1996)).             We similarly defer to\n\nan agency's reasonable interpretation of its own regulations (so\n\nlong as those regulations and the interpretation are themselves\n\nreasonable given the statute), and will \"respect an agency's\n\ninterpretation of its own regulation as long as the interpretation\n\nmeshes sensibly with the regulation's language and purpose.\"                 Id.\n\n(citing Martin v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 499\n\nU.S. 144, 151 (1991)).\n\n            As we have noted, the statute here commands that \"[e]ach\n\nState shall establish such fiscal control and fund accounting\n\nprocedures as may be necessary to assure the proper disbursal of,\n\nand accounting for, Federal funds paid to the recipient under\n\nsubchapters II and III of this chapter.\"          29 U.S.C. § 1574(a)(1).\n\nIt requires that those procedures \"ensure that all financial\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\ftransactions are conducted and records maintained in accordance\n\nwith generally accepted accounting principles applicable in each\n\nState.\"      Id.   The regulations that implement these statutory\n\nprovisions require inter alia that \"[r]ecipients and subrecipients\n\nshall ensure that their own financial systems as well as those of\n\ntheir     subrecipients     provide       fiscal    control         and    accounting\n\nprocedures.\" 20 C.F.R. § 627.425(b)(1). Among other things, these\n\nprocedures     must      require    the     state    to     provide         \"[s]ource\n\ndocumentation      to     support     accounting      records.\"              Id.,     §\n\n627.425(b)(1)(iv).\n\n            The Commonwealth's argument is that the § 627.425 record-\n\nkeeping requirement could not rationally be a factor in considering\n\nwhether    funds   are   misspent.         It   claims,   in    essence,      that    a\n\nmisspending determination should be a determination of substantive\n\nmalfeasance, and that the failure to monitor that is the basis of\n\nthe record-keeping requirement does not rise to that level.                         The\n\nBoard's    interpretation     is    that    a   violation      of    the    financial\n\naccountability rules can give rise to liability.                     This view lies\n\nwell within the statutory boundaries.              29 U.S.C. § 1574(d) is the\n\nsource of the Secretary's authority to demand repayment of funds,\n\nand provides that \"[e]very recipient shall repay to the United\n\nStates amounts found not to have been expended in accordance with\n\nthis chapter.\" The fiscal control provisions are provisions of the\n\nsame chapter (indeed, the same section) as contains the repayment\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fprovision, and the DOL reasonably concluded that violations of\n\nthose provisions could justify demanding repayment.6\n\n           The Board's conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the\n\nstatute itself and the regulations implementing it evince a strong\n\nconcern for proper record-keeping and financial accountability,\n\nevidenced in the above-cited sections and elsewhere throughout the\n\ntexts.     There     is   also   reason    to    believe    that      increased\n\naccountability was a motivating factor in the passage of the\n\nlegislation that substituted the programs under the JTPA for those\n\nprovided by its predecessor statute, the Comprehensive Employment\n\nTraining Act (CETA).      See S. Rep. No. 97-469, at 26, reprinted in\n\n1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2636, 2661 (1982) (\"The General Accounting Office\n\nreports have made clear that the internal controls in CETA programs\n\nare   unacceptably    weak   despite   numerous      Department    of    Labor\n\nregulations   and    publications    which      provide    internal    control\n\nguidance and requirements. These conditions make the grantees\n\nvulnerable to misuse of funds and unintentional errors.\").\n\n           What is more, the Board's position here is consistent\n\nwith longstanding views in various courts that seeking repayment\n\n\n      6\n      Notably, the Board limited its request for repayment to the\namount that may have been actually squandered through the failure\nof the state's oversight, seeking only funds that the state could\nnot prove were spent in accordance with the substantive provisions\nthemselves. This seems an important limiting principle, and we are\nnot faced with the more difficult case that would be presented were\nthe federal government to seek repayment of funds even where the\nstate offered reliable evidence that the funds were spent properly\nunder all relevant substantive rules.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fwhere faulty accounting makes it impossible to determine whether\n\nfunds have been properly spent is an appropriate remedy to allow in\n\nthe context of the JTPA and its predecessor statutes. Dealing with\n\na similar circumstance under the CETA program, the Fourth Circuit\n\nheld    twenty    years   ago   that   \"by    failing      to   comply       with    the\n\nrecord-keeping requirements of CETA and its regulations, the County\n\n'misspent' federal funds within the meaning of the statute.\"\n\nMontgomery County v. Dep't of Labor, 757 F.2d 1510, 1513 (4th Cir.\n\n1985).    This was because \"[r]ecord keeping is at the heart of the\n\nfederal   oversight       and   evaluation     provisions       of    CETA    and    its\n\nimplementing regulations.           Only by requiring documentation to\n\nsupport expenditures is the DOL able to verify that billions of\n\nfederal grant dollars are spent for the purposes intended by\n\nCongress.\"       Id. at 1513.     See also La. Dep't of Labor v. United\n\nStates Dep't of Labor, 108 F.3d 614, 618 (5th Cir. 1997); City of\n\nOakland v. Donovan, 703 F.2d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir. 1983). Similarly\n\nhere,    rigorous    record-keeping      was       essential     to    ensure       that\n\nthousands of JTPA grant subrecipients used the money they received\n\nfor its intended purpose.\n\n            Finally, even if we were not convinced that the DOL's\n\ninterpretation      of    its   authority     to    seek   repayment         here    was\n\notherwise sound and deserving of deference, the catchall remedial\n\nprovision of § 1574(h), which specifies that \"[t]he remedies under\n\nthis section shall not be construed to be exclusive remedies,\"\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fwould provide a strong argument that there is no reason to give the\n\n§ 1574(d) provision a particularly crabbed reading, as Congress\n\nevidently meant to give the Secretary a broad arsenal of powers in\n\nseeking to enforce the terms that the states accept when they elect\n\nto receive JTPA funds.\n\n            The Commonwealth makes a secondary argument that even if\n\nthe Board permissibly construed the statute and regulations to mean\n\nthat a failure to make a proper accounting would result in a\n\nrepayment obligation unless the state made a sufficient alternative\n\nshowing that it complied with the substantive regulations at issue,\n\nits determination that the state did not make such a showing here\n\nwas improper.      Our review under the substantial evidence standard,\n\nhowever, is limited even in the general case, and we are the more\n\nreluctant to second-guess agency accounting policies in areas where\n\nthe    agency   must   oversee   vast   and   complex     programs   and   its\n\nexperience with such oversight presumably informs those policies.\n\nTracking and authenticating the numerous retail-level transactions\n\nthat implementing the JTPA requires is a mammoth task, and \"[i]n\n\nsuch   an   area   '(m)atters    of   accounting,    unless   they   \"be   the\n\nexpression of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment, are for\n\nthe    agency.\"'\"       Cheshire      Hosp.   v.    New   Hampshire-Vermont\n\nHospitalization Serv., Inc., 689 F.2d 1112, 1117 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\nThe Board determined that, without direct evidence in the form of\n\nsource documentation to back it up, the state's evidence that funds\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fwere properly spent was unreliable guesswork and there remained\n\nreason to be concerned that the funds disbursed to Lynn SDA had not\n\nbeen spent on procuring JTPA-related services. The state complains\n\nthat its evidence was good enough, but without a terribly strong\n\nshowing indicating that the Board's evaluation and rejection of the\n\nproffered evidence was pure caprice, we could not conclude that the\n\nevidence compelled a contrary decision.\n\n            The state's final argument is that even if DOL was within\n\nits rights in disallowing the costs at issue in the first place,\n\nthe Secretary of Labor was authorized to waive the repayment\n\nobligation and abused her discretion in not doing so.        Where the\n\nBoard has determined that a state grant recipient may be charged\n\nfor misspent funds, the statute grants the Secretary discretion to\n\nforgive the repayment obligation. See 29 U.S.C. § 1574(e)(3). The\n\nstatute does not give the Secretary unbounded discretion, however.\n\nIn relevant part, the statute permits the Secretary to forgive\n\nrepayment    obligations   only   where   the   recipient   state   has\n\ndemonstrated that it has:\n\n            (A) established and adhered to an appropriate\n            system for the award and monitoring of\n            contracts with subgrantees which contains\n            acceptable     standards     for    ensuring\n            accountability;\n            (B) entered into a written contract with such\n            subgrantee which established clear goals and\n            obligations in unambiguous terms;\n            (C) acted with due diligence to monitor the\n            implementation of the subgrantee contract,\n            including the carrying out of the appropriate\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f           monitoring activities (including audits) at\n           reasonable intervals; and\n           (D) taken prompt and appropriate corrective\n           action upon becoming aware of any evidence of\n           a violation of this chapter or the regulations\n           under this chapter by such subgrantee.\n\nId., § 1574(e)(2).     DOL's position is that, because Massachusetts\n\ncontinued making payments to Lynn SDA for two years, a period\n\nduring which it either overlooked or chose to look past Lynn SDA's\n\nfaulty record-keeping, it was wasting the federal government's\n\nmoney.   While the ultimate exercise of discretion is committed to\n\nthe Secretary, we can review the agency's predicate factual and\n\nlegal determinations -- but we accord those determinations the\n\nusual deference.\n\n           Massachusetts had to meet all four criteria specified in\n\nthe statute in order to qualify for waiver consideration, and a\n\nsupportable finding by the Board that it did not meet any one of\n\nthose criteria dooms the state's claim.        The Board determined that\n\nthe   efforts   that   Massachusetts   made   to   staunch    the    flow   of\n\nunaccounted-for    funds    to   Northshore    did   not     merit    waiver\n\nconsideration because Massachusetts failed to meet three of the\n\nfour criteria.     Specifically, Massachusetts had not \"established\n\nand adhered to an appropriate system for the award and monitoring\n\nof contracts with subgrantees which contains acceptable standards\n\nfor ensuring accountability\" under § 1574(e)(2)(A) because it had\n\nnot adhered to the system it had established; had not acted with\n\nthe   requisite   diligence   under    §   1574(e)(2)(C)     in   monitoring\n\n                                  -20-\n\fNorthshore; and had not responded with the requisite alacrity under\n\n§ 1574(e)(2)(D) in taking appropriate measures to correct the\n\ndeveloping problem with Northshore once it was detected.\n\n           The     state    raises         arguments        contesting      the     Board's\n\ndeterminations as to each of these criteria.                       As to the last of\n\nthem, the requirement that the state move with speed and force to\n\ncorrect   violations       of       the    JTPA,      the    state's    arguments         are\n\nparticularly weak.       The agency is entrusted in the first instance\n\nwith determining whether a state has taken sufficiently diligent\n\nsteps to justify a waiver, and it is the agency's job to determine\n\nwhat standards to apply to such a determination.                                  Under the\n\ncircumstances of the case, given the drawn-out period over which\n\nNorthshore declined and the length of time that elapsed before\n\nMassachusetts     decided       to    decertify       the    program,       the    agency's\n\ndetermination that Massachusetts should have leaned harder on Lynn\n\nor moved to decertify it earlier does not appear unreasonable.\n\n           The statutory requirement is that the state take \"prompt\n\nand appropriate corrective action\" once it detects a problem.                             It\n\nseems   sensible    to     think       that      whether      an   action     taken       was\n\n\"appropriate\"     should       be    determined       by    looking    to    information\n\navailable at the time, which is to say that retroactively declaring\n\nMassachusetts not to have taken \"appropriate corrective action\"\n\nbecause   its    plan    did    not       work   in   the    end   might     well    be    an\n\nunreasonable approach to take under § 1574(e)(2)(D). Massachusetts\n\n\n                                            -21-\n\fsuggests that the agency made such an error here, arguing that\n\n\"[t]he fact that Lynn did not adequately implement the corrective\n\nmeasures imposed on it by the Commonwealth does not support the\n\nconclusion that the Commonwealth itself was not diligent in its\n\nactions\" and that \"[t]he Board erred in holding otherwise.\"                    This\n\npure   legal   argument       does   not   have    any   basis    in   the   Board's\n\ndecision, for the Board did not rely on the corrective program's\n\nfailure in determining that the state moved with less than the\n\nnecessary speed.\n\n           Instead, the Board made a fact-bound determination that\n\nthe efforts Massachusetts did make to bring Northshore back into\n\ncompliance     were     not    sufficient     to     qualify      it   for   waiver\n\nconsideration.        It noted federal and state requirements that\n\ncorrective     action    be    taken   within     six    months   when   financial\n\nirregularities were detected, and concluded that on the basis of\n\ninformation then known, Massachusetts ought to have downgraded Lynn\n\nSDA to \"out of compliance\" status as early as September 1994.                    To\n\ndefeat the agency's determination in a petition to this court, the\n\nstate had at least to describe, making reference to the record, the\n\nparticular efforts it made to revitalize the Lynn program and\n\nexplain why it would be unreasonable to conclude that those efforts\n\ndid not meet the statutory threshold. Without such an explanation,\n\nwe cannot see our way to overturning the agency's determination and\n\n\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fwe therefore affirm the Board's decision to deny a waiver in this\n\ncase.\n\n          For   the   foregoing    reasons,   the   decision   of   the\n\nAdministrative Review Board is affirmed.      The petition for review\n\nis denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f",

DOL has ordered the state to repay some of the funds, and the state objects. Because we find that the DOL has the better of the arguments, we affirm the decision of the Administrative Review Board (the Board) and deny the Commonwealth's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the (now defunct) Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1501 <i>et seq.</i> (1994) (repealed 2000), DOL made funds available to the states for job training and rehabilitation programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The JTPA's stated purpose during the period pertinent to this case was to \"prepare youth and adults facing serious barriers to employment for participation in the labor force by providing job training and other services that will result in increased employment and earnings.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1501. The statute created a number of programs under its various titles. This case deals with the disbursement of funds under Titles II and III of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board characterized the programs under Title II as designed to benefit \"disadvantaged youth and adults\" and those under Title III as providing \"employment training assistance for dislocated workers.\" Under both titles the Act called upon DOL to distribute funds to the state governors or their proxies in participating states. In Massachusetts, it was the Department of Employment and Training (DET) that administered the Title II funds at the state level, while the Corporation for Business, Work, and Learning (CBWL) and its predecessor agency, the Industrial Services Program (ISP), administered the Title III funds. DET and CBWL/ISP in turn parceled out the money for use in geographically distinct Service Delivery Areas (SDAs).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In order to do so, they would designate a grant recipient (generally a local government), <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1511, 20 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 628.405 &amp; .415, as well as an administrative entity that would take ground-level responsibility for implementing the various JTPA programs, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1503(2) &amp; 1514; 20 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 628.405 &amp; .415. This case involves the Service Delivery Area for Lynn (Lynn SDA) and the efforts of DOL to recover funds from Massachusetts that are untraceable and may have been substantively misspent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Programs for the Lynn SDA were administered by an entity called Northshore Employment Training (Northshore). In 1993, Northshore received its first warning from DET: the Commonwealth had been reviewing Northshore's financial records, and had identified \"relatively minor\" problems. The state directed Northshore to develop a plan to ensure better reporting. Over the course of the next two years, however, Northshore's financial accounting did not improve, and Massachusetts progressively increased its oversight of Northshore and eventually decertified it. At all stages, DOL, through its Boston office, appears to have been apprised of Northshore's increasingly apparent financial mismanagement, and to have been involved in cooperative efforts with Massachusetts to monitor the program, contain the damage, and get the Lynn SDA back on track. Despite the best efforts of the federal, state, and local authorities, however, Northshore inched towards complete failure. In the summer of 1995, DET accused Northshore of financial mismanagement and took over partial control of some of the Lynn programs. In October of that year, Lynn SDA was formally designated as a \"high risk\" grantee for its failure to comply with the various corrective plans imposed by the Commonwealth agencies in charge of monitoring Northshore. In April 1996, DET described Northshore's financial system as \"not operational or coherent\" and decertified Northshore as a JTPA funding recipient, and in June 1996, Northshore closed its doors and the Greater Lowell Regional Employment Board took over its employment service responsibilities. Subsequently, Massachusetts began proceedings to collect from the city of Lynn $6,340,397 that it considered misspent because Lynn had not maintained adequate records. Lynn made efforts to avoid repayment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During and after this period of decline, Massachusetts authorities received public plaudits from the Boston office of the DOL for their efforts to manage the Lynn SDA crisis and to recover wasted funds from Lynn, tempered by reminders that as the immediate recipient of the JTPA funds Massachusetts was ultimately individually responsible to the DOL for any funds not recovered from Lynn. In 1997, DOL's Office of the Inspector General received its own audit, performed under contract by Deloitte and Touche, LLP, CPAs, of the Lynn program. The audit noted that Massachusetts had made a determination against Lynn that disallowed to Lynn $7,137,698 in JTPA Title II funds<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and $1,970,288 in Title III funds. Later that year, DOL began administrative proceedings seeking a declaration that Massachusetts had misspent federal funds from 1994 to 1996 by distributing the same $9,107,986 to the local agency when Massachusetts had not guaranteed that Lynn was complying or capable of complying with the federal accounting requirements. In May 1998 the Grant Officer responsible for prosecuting the case made a formal determination charging the Commonwealth with just over $9 million in misspent funds. The Commonwealth appealed to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who directed the Grant Officer to permit the state to show evidence on certain points that could reduce its liability. The Grant Officer did so but arrived again at her initial conclusion, and the Commonwealth appealed to the ALJ for a second time. The ALJ then reversed roughly $5 million of the original $9 million in charges to the state, finding that the Commonwealth had adequately documented this portion of the expenditures and that these funds had been spent responsibly. The Grant Officer appealed to the Administrative Review Board, DOL's final and authoritative adjudicative body. The Board remanded to the ALJ, requiring greater clarity with respect to certain points.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On remand, after making the required findings, the ALJ abandoned his former disposition and affirmed the Grant Officer's original position that the state owed the full $9 million. Massachusetts once again appealed the ALJ's disposition to the Board, which affirmed in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's basic theory was that Massachusetts had violated its obligation to ensure that the regional agencies that received its funds (often referred to in the bureaucratic argot as \"subrecipients\") maintained financial records capable of demonstrating how those funds were spent. As an initial matter, Massachusetts had failed to compel the Lynn SDA to conduct the annual audit required by the Single Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7501-7507 (1994) (SAA), and implementing regulations. This failure, on the Board's interpretation, opened up the possibility of repayment liability, and the state was then given an opportunity to demonstrate that the Lynn SDA had in fact spent its federal funds for JTPA-appropriate purposes. As a practical matter, the Grant Officer and various reviewing entities were looking for rigorously collected and properly thorough \"source documentation\" consisting of receipts, invoices, cancelled checks, and the like. Where Massachusetts was able to produce such documentation, the Grant Officer dropped claims of misspending, but where the state could not produce the documentation, the Board charged it for the unaccounted-for funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In lieu of some of the missing source documentation, the Commonwealth submitted a detailed accounting, called a \"Reconstructed Trial Balance\" (RTB), in which the state's own auditor attempted to reconstruct Northshore's finances throughout the period at issue. In the Board's words, the RTB \"represented an accounting consultant's reconstruction of the Lynn SDA records, which was undertaken in an effort to produce an auditable set of financial records.\" The state also submitted statements by its own agents that they had themselves consistently reviewed Northshore's source documents with respect to certain aspects of the program. In the Commonwealth's view, the <i>post hoc</i> accounting and state agent testimony constituted substitute evidence of Northshore's essentially proper management of its financial affairs, and it argued that in light of this uncontradicted evidence the Board should have found that the funds were properly spent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state thus contended that the record-keeping requirements of the JTPA and regulations are not substantive obligations, but are instead simply one way of enforcing the underlying requirement that a state take sufficient care to direct its JTPA funds towards JTPA-related activities. The state's position was that it had provided satisfactory substitute assurances of good financial management and should not have been penalized for failing to abide by the particular requirements of the relevant record-keeping provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board in fact adopted roughly this legal position, but rejected the state's specific claims because the evidence the state provided was not sufficient to convince the Board that the funds were properly spent. The Board crucially noted that the RTB was not itself based on source documentation, but was in essence nothing more than an accountant's speculation as to what probably happened to the funds disbursed by Northshore. It likewise found insufficient the state agents' testimony that they had themselves reviewed source documentation at Northshore. Massachusetts now petitions for review of the Board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its petition, Massachusetts raises three questions, asking: whether the Board acted within its authority in determining that as a legal matter Massachusetts could have violated the terms of the JTPA on the facts alleged by the Grant Officer; whether the Board's decision to disallow the expenses and seek repayment was not supported by substantial evidence because the Board chose not to accept as sufficient the evidence proffered by the state; and whether the Board abused its discretion when it decided not to forgive the state its obligation to repay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JTPA requires a state to comply with a host of rules in order to qualify for funding. The rules relevant to this case fall into two broad categories. On one side of the line, the JTPA imposes limitations on the uses to which federal funds may be put. These substantive regulations govern expenses incurred by regional agencies in providing employment training services. Among other requirements, the regulations prescribe that an agency spending JTPA funds can only incur costs that are \"necessary and reasonable to the proper and efficient administration of the program.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(a)(2); 20 C.F.R. &#167; 627.435(a). The agency must also classify its expenditures according to the categories prescribed by statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and the statute and regulations prescribe maximum expenditures for certain categories &#8212; for example, the regulations specify that (depending on the program) administrative costs can amount to no more than fifteen or twenty percent of total expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to ensure compliance with these and other substantive limitations on expenditures, the statute and regulations place a heavy emphasis on financial management and accountability, and the other category of relevant regulations is the set of rules specifying the state and agency responsibilities to account for their use of funds. These oversight provisions specify the mechanisms through which states and their JTPA subrecipients must demonstrate to DOL that they are fulfilling their obligations under the substantive provisions of the Act. Among them is the requirement that \"[e]ach State shall establish such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure the proper disbursal of, and accounting for, Federal funds paid to the recipient under subchapters II and III of this chapter.\" <i>Id.,</i> &#167; 1574(a)(1). The statute goes on to specify that \"[s]uch procedures shall ensure that all financial transactions are conducted and records maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in each State.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts maintains that it and the Lynn SDA were largely in compliance with all relevant <i>substantive</i> provisions of the Act and regulations throughout the relevant time periods. The state contends that the roughly $9 million at stake in these proceedings (except for a few small sums it has conceded were misused) was spent to procure job training services as directed by the JTPA, and that DOL is wrong to try to recoup the money. Massachusetts ran into trouble, however, when it came time to demonstrate to the agency that the funds were appropriately spent. The usual method for demonstrating substantive compliance is through the completion of an independent audit. Such an audit is required by the SAA, as implemented at 29 C.F.R. Part 96 and made applicable to JTPA programs by 20 C.F.R. &#167; 629.1(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An SAA audit would have reviewed the substate agency's financial records, examined receipts, invoices, and cancelled checks, and made a determination as to the degree of the agency's compliance with the applicable regulations. Where such an audit indicated that funds had been misspent, the right response would generally be twofold: the imposition of financial sanctions on the state to the degree of the misexpenditure, and the proposal of remedial measures designed to prevent future misspending. Here, however, no such audit was conducted. Neither the statute nor the regulations specify precisely what ought to happen where an audit is never undertaken, but through its adjudication processes the Board has developed a rule for determining what a fair reimbursement is under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 627.802(e) in the Code of Federal Regulations specifies that, where a determination under the JTPA is entrusted to a Grant Officer in the first instance, the Grant Officer bears the burden of producing evidence to support a determination against a party. Thereafter, the regulation says, the party seeking to overturn the Grant Officer's determination has the burden of persuasion. In this case, the Board determined that the Grant Officer made a <i>prima facie</i> case that funds were misspent under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(d) by offering evidence that an SAA audit was not carried out. The state's burden in response was to demonstrate that it either \"met the specific requirements imposed by the JTPA\" &#8212; i.e., that it had actually carried out an SAA-compliant audit &#8212; or that it had \"compensated for any deficiencies through other means.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a technical matter, under this system the DOL charges the state with misspending simply because it has failed to properly put in place the appropriate accounting safeguards: the failure to conduct an audit constitutes a repayment-worthy violation of the JTPA in itself. DOL then limits the amount of the charged repayment to the amount which the state cannot demonstrate was spent in compliance with the substantive regulations. In order to demonstrate that compliance, the state must show source documentation, and where it does, it earns the right to avoid repaying the funds to the DOL. The practical effect of this system is that the state is responsible for repaying to DOL any funds it cannot prove were spent in compliance with the substantive regulations. In the words of the Board, \"Lynn was obligated not only to implement and maintain fiscal controls that ensured that Northshore funds were expended in compliance with all pertinent JTPA requirements, but also to maintain adequate records to <i>demonstrate</i> that such expenditures complied with the Act.\" (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Massachusetts attempted to prove substantive compliance with the JTPA in lieu of presenting a clean audit, the Board concluded that the evidence it presented was not sufficiently \"detailed, reliable, and extensive\" to meet its burden. Our review of the final determination of the Board under the JTPA is deferential. We are bound by the Board's findings of fact so long as they are supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1578(a)(3). While the statute grants us authority to review the legal determinations of the Board, <i>see id.,</i> as a general matter we defer to \"an agency's reasonable interpretation of a statute that it administers.\" <i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n,</i> 115 F.3d 100, 107 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <i>Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> 96 F.3d 542, 547 (1st Cir.1996)). We similarly defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of its own regulations (so long as those regulations and the interpretation are themselves reasonable given the statute), and will \"respect an agency's interpretation of its own regulation as long as the interpretation meshes sensibly with the regulation's language and purpose.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Martin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n,</i> 499 U.S. 144, 151, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted, the statute here commands that \"[e]ach State shall establish such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure the proper disbursal of, and accounting for, Federal funds paid to the recipient under subchapters II and III of this chapter.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(a)(1). It requires that those procedures \"ensure that all financial transactions are conducted and records maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in each State.\" <i>Id.</i> The regulations that implement these statutory provisions require <i>inter alia</i> that \"[r]ecipients and subrecipients shall ensure that their own financial systems as well as those of their subrecipients provide fiscal control and accounting procedures.\" 20 C.F.R. &#167; 627.425(b)(1). Among other things, these procedures must require the state to provide \"[s]ource documentation to support accounting records.\" <i>Id.,</i> &#167; 627.425(b)(1)(iv).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's argument is that the &#167; 627.425 record-keeping requirement could not rationally be a factor in considering whether funds are misspent. It claims, in essence, that a misspending determination should be a determination of substantive malfeasance, and that the failure to monitor that is the basis of the record-keeping requirement does not rise to that level. The Board's interpretation is that a violation of the financial accountability rules can give rise to liability. This view lies well within the statutory boundaries. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(d) is the source of the Secretary's authority to demand repayment of funds, and provides that \"[e]very recipient shall repay to the United States amounts found not to have been expended in accordance with this chapter.\" The fiscal control provisions are provisions of the same chapter (indeed, the same section) as contains the repayment provision, and the DOL reasonably concluded that violations of those provisions could justify demanding repayment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the statute itself and the regulations implementing it evince a strong concern for proper record-keeping and financial accountability, evidenced in the above-cited sections and elsewhere throughout the texts. There is also reason to believe that increased accountability was a motivating factor in the passage of the legislation that substituted the programs under the JTPA for those provided by its predecessor statute, the Comprehensive Employment Training Act (CETA). <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 97-469, at 26, <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2636, 2661 (1982) (\"The General Accounting Office reports have made clear that the internal controls in CETA programs are unacceptably weak despite numerous Department of Labor regulations and publications which provide internal control guidance and requirements. These conditions make the grantees vulnerable to misuse of funds and unintentional errors.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, the Board's position here is consistent with longstanding views in various courts that seeking repayment where faulty accounting makes it impossible to determine whether funds have been properly spent is an appropriate remedy to allow in the context of the JTPA and its predecessor statutes. Dealing with a similar circumstance under the CETA program, the Fourth Circuit held twenty years ago that \"by failing to comply with the record-keeping requirements of CETA and its regulations, the County `misspent' federal funds within the meaning of the statute.\" <i>Montgomery County v. Dep't of Labor,</i> 757 F.2d 1510, 1513 (4th Cir.1985). This was because \"[r]ecord keeping is at the heart of the federal oversight and evaluation provisions of CETA and its implementing regulations. Only by requiring documentation to support expenditures is the DOL able to verify that billions of federal grant dollars are spent for the purposes intended by Congress.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1513. <i>See also La. Dep't of Labor v. United States Dep't of Labor,</i> 108 F.3d 614, 618 (5th Cir.1997); <i>City of Oakland v. Donovan,</i> 703 F.2d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1983). Similarly here, rigorous record-keeping was essential to ensure that thousands of JTPA grant subrecipients used the money they received for its intended purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if we were not convinced that the DOL's interpretation of its authority to seek repayment here was otherwise sound and deserving of deference, the catchall remedial provision of &#167; 1574(h), which specifies that \"[t]he remedies under this section shall not be construed to be exclusive remedies,\" would provide a strong argument that there is no reason to give the &#167; 1574(d) provision a particularly crabbed reading, as Congress evidently meant to give the Secretary a broad arsenal of powers in seeking to enforce the terms that the states accept when they elect to receive JTPA funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth makes a secondary argument that even if the Board permissibly construed the statute and regulations to mean that a failure to make a proper accounting would result in a repayment obligation unless the state made a sufficient alternative showing that it complied with the substantive regulations at issue, its determination that the state did not make such a showing here was improper. Our review under the substantial evidence standard, however, is limited even in the general case, and we are the more reluctant to second-guess agency accounting policies in areas where the agency must oversee vast and complex programs and its experience with such oversight presumably informs those policies. Tracking and authenticating the numerous retail-level transactions that implementing the JTPA requires is a mammoth task, and \"[i]n such an area `(m)atters of accounting, unless they \"be the expression of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment, are for the agency.\"'\" <i>Cheshire Hosp. v. New Hampshire-Vermont Hospitalization Serv., Inc.,</i> 689 F.2d 1112, 1117 (1st Cir.1982). The Board determined that, without direct evidence in the form of source documentation to back it up, the state's evidence that funds were properly spent was unreliable guesswork and there remained reason to be concerned that the funds disbursed to Lynn SDA had not been spent on procuring JTPA-related services. The state complains that its evidence was good enough, but without a terribly strong showing indicating that the Board's evaluation and rejection of the proffered evidence was pure caprice, we could not conclude that the evidence compelled a contrary decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state's final argument is that even if DOL was within its rights in disallowing the costs at issue in the first place, the Secretary of Labor was authorized to waive the repayment obligation and abused her discretion in not doing so. Where the Board has determined that a state grant recipient may be charged for misspent funds, the statute grants the Secretary discretion to forgive the repayment obligation. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(e)(3). The statute does not give the Secretary unbounded discretion, however. In relevant part, the statute permits the Secretary to forgive repayment obligations only where the recipient state has demonstrated that it has: (A) established and adhered to an appropriate system for the award and monitoring of contracts with subgrantees which contains acceptable standards for ensuring accountability;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) entered into a written contract with such subgrantee which established clear goals and obligations in unambiguous terms;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) acted with due diligence to monitor the implementation of the subgrantee contract, including the carrying out of the appropriate monitoring activities (including audits) at reasonable intervals; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(D) taken prompt and appropriate corrective action upon becoming aware of any evidence of a violation of this chapter or the regulations under this chapter by such subgrantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.,</i> &#167; 1574(e)(2). DOL's position is that, because Massachusetts continued making payments to Lynn SDA for two years, a period during which it either overlooked or chose to look past Lynn SDA's faulty record-keeping, it was wasting the federal government's money. While the ultimate exercise of discretion is committed to the Secretary, we can review the agency's predicate factual and legal determinations &#8212; but we accord those determinations the usual deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts had to meet all four criteria specified in the statute in order to qualify for waiver consideration, and a supportable finding by the Board that it did not meet any one of those criteria dooms the state's claim. The Board determined that the efforts that Massachusetts made to staunch the flow of unaccounted-for funds to Northshore did not merit waiver consideration because Massachusetts failed to meet three of the four criteria. Specifically, Massachusetts had not \"established and adhered to an appropriate system for the award and monitoring of contracts with subgrantees which contains acceptable standards for ensuring accountability\" under &#167; 1574(e)(2)(A) because it had not adhered to the system it had established; had not acted with the requisite diligence under &#167; 1574(e)(2)(C) in monitoring Northshore; and had not responded with the requisite alacrity under &#167; 1574(e)(2)(D) in taking appropriate measures to correct the developing problem with Northshore once it was detected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state raises arguments contesting the Board's determinations as to each of these criteria. As to the last of them, the requirement that the state move with speed and force to correct violations of the JTPA, the state's arguments are particularly weak. The agency is entrusted in the first instance with determining whether a state has taken sufficiently diligent steps to justify a waiver, and it is the agency's job to determine what standards to apply to such a determination. Under the circumstances of the case, given the drawnout period over which Northshore declined and the length of time that elapsed before Massachusetts decided to decertify the program, the agency's determination that Massachusetts should have leaned harder on Lynn or moved to decertify it earlier does not appear unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory requirement is that the state take \"prompt and appropriate corrective action\" once it detects a problem. It seems sensible to think that whether an action taken was \"appropriate\" should be determined by looking to information available at the time, which is to say that retroactively declaring Massachusetts not to have taken \"appropriate corrective action\" because its plan did not work in the end might well be an unreasonable approach to take under &#167; 1574(e)(2)(D). Massachusetts suggests that the agency made such an error here, arguing that \"[t]he fact that Lynn did not adequately implement the corrective measures imposed on it by the Commonwealth does not support the conclusion that the Commonwealth itself was not diligent in its actions\" and that \"[t]he Board erred in holding otherwise.\" This pure legal argument does not have any basis in the Board's decision, for the Board did not rely on the corrective program's failure in determining that the state moved with less than the necessary speed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the Board made a fact-bound determination that the efforts Massachusetts did make to bring Northshore back into compliance were not sufficient to qualify it for waiver consideration. It noted federal and state requirements that corrective action be taken within six months when financial irregularities were detected, and concluded that on the basis of information then known, Massachusetts ought to have downgraded Lynn SDA to \"out of compliance\" status as early as September 1994. To defeat the agency's determination in a petition to this court, the state had at least to describe, making reference to the record, the particular efforts it made to revitalize the Lynn program and explain why it would be unreasonable to conclude that those efforts did not meet the statutory threshold. Without such an explanation, we cannot see our way to overturning the agency's determination and we therefore affirm the Board's decision to deny a waiver in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Administrative Review Board is <i>affirmed.</i> The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The JTPA was enacted in 1982 and took effect July 1, 1983.

DOL has ordered the state to repay some of the funds, and the state objects. Because we find that the DOL has the better of the arguments, we affirm the decision of the Administrative Review Board (the Board) and deny the Commonwealth's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the (now defunct) Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1501 <i>et seq.</i> (1994) (repealed 2000), DOL made funds available to the states for job training and rehabilitation programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The JTPA's stated purpose during the period pertinent to this case was to \"prepare youth and adults facing serious barriers to employment for participation in the labor force by providing job training and other services that will result in increased employment and earnings.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1501. The statute created a number of programs under its various titles. This case deals with the disbursement of funds under Titles II and III of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board characterized the programs under Title II as designed to benefit \"disadvantaged youth and adults\" and those under Title III as providing \"employment training assistance for dislocated workers.\" Under both titles the Act called upon DOL to distribute funds to the state governors or their proxies in participating states. In Massachusetts, it was the Department of Employment and Training (DET) that administered the Title II funds at the state level, while the Corporation for Business, Work, and Learning (CBWL) and its predecessor agency, the Industrial Services Program (ISP), administered the Title III funds. DET and CBWL/ISP in turn parceled out the money for use in geographically distinct Service Delivery Areas (SDAs).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In order to do so, they would designate a grant recipient (generally a local government), <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1511, 20 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 628.405 &amp; .415, as well as an administrative entity that would take ground-level responsibility for implementing the various JTPA programs, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1503(2) &amp; 1514; 20 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 628.405 &amp; .415. This case involves the Service Delivery Area for Lynn (Lynn SDA) and the efforts of DOL to recover funds from Massachusetts that are untraceable and may have been substantively misspent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Programs for the Lynn SDA were administered by an entity called Northshore Employment Training (Northshore). In 1993, Northshore received its first warning from DET: the Commonwealth had been reviewing Northshore's financial records, and had identified \"relatively minor\" problems. The state directed Northshore to develop a plan to ensure better reporting. Over the course of the next two years, however, Northshore's financial accounting did not improve, and Massachusetts progressively increased its oversight of Northshore and eventually decertified it. At all stages, DOL, through its Boston office, appears to have been apprised of Northshore's increasingly apparent financial mismanagement, and to have been involved in cooperative efforts with Massachusetts to monitor the program, contain the damage, and get the Lynn SDA back on track. Despite the best efforts of the federal, state, and local authorities, however, Northshore inched towards complete failure. In the summer of 1995, DET accused Northshore of financial mismanagement and took over partial control of some of the Lynn programs. In October of that year, Lynn SDA was formally designated as a \"high risk\" grantee for its failure to comply with the various corrective plans imposed by the Commonwealth agencies in charge of monitoring Northshore. In April 1996, DET described Northshore's financial system as \"not operational or coherent\" and decertified Northshore as a JTPA funding recipient, and in June 1996, Northshore closed its doors and the Greater Lowell Regional Employment Board took over its employment service responsibilities. Subsequently, Massachusetts began proceedings to collect from the city of Lynn $6,340,397 that it considered misspent because Lynn had not maintained adequate records. Lynn made efforts to avoid repayment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During and after this period of decline, Massachusetts authorities received public plaudits from the Boston office of the DOL for their efforts to manage the Lynn SDA crisis and to recover wasted funds from Lynn, tempered by reminders that as the immediate recipient of the JTPA funds Massachusetts was ultimately individually responsible to the DOL for any funds not recovered from Lynn. In 1997, DOL's Office of the Inspector General received its own audit, performed under contract by Deloitte and Touche, LLP, CPAs, of the Lynn program. The audit noted that Massachusetts had made a determination against Lynn that disallowed to Lynn $7,137,698 in JTPA Title II funds<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and $1,970,288 in Title III funds. Later that year, DOL began administrative proceedings seeking a declaration that Massachusetts had misspent federal funds from 1994 to 1996 by distributing the same $9,107,986 to the local agency when Massachusetts had not guaranteed that Lynn was complying or capable of complying with the federal accounting requirements. In May 1998 the Grant Officer responsible for prosecuting the case made a formal determination charging the Commonwealth with just over $9 million in misspent funds. The Commonwealth appealed to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who directed the Grant Officer to permit the state to show evidence on certain points that could reduce its liability. The Grant Officer did so but arrived again at her initial conclusion, and the Commonwealth appealed to the ALJ for a second time. The ALJ then reversed roughly $5 million of the original $9 million in charges to the state, finding that the Commonwealth had adequately documented this portion of the expenditures and that these funds had been spent responsibly. The Grant Officer appealed to the Administrative Review Board, DOL's final and authoritative adjudicative body. The Board remanded to the ALJ, requiring greater clarity with respect to certain points.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On remand, after making the required findings, the ALJ abandoned his former disposition and affirmed the Grant Officer's original position that the state owed the full $9 million. Massachusetts once again appealed the ALJ's disposition to the Board, which affirmed in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's basic theory was that Massachusetts had violated its obligation to ensure that the regional agencies that received its funds (often referred to in the bureaucratic argot as \"subrecipients\") maintained financial records capable of demonstrating how those funds were spent. As an initial matter, Massachusetts had failed to compel the Lynn SDA to conduct the annual audit required by the Single Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7501-7507 (1994) (SAA), and implementing regulations. This failure, on the Board's interpretation, opened up the possibility of repayment liability, and the state was then given an opportunity to demonstrate that the Lynn SDA had in fact spent its federal funds for JTPA-appropriate purposes. As a practical matter, the Grant Officer and various reviewing entities were looking for rigorously collected and properly thorough \"source documentation\" consisting of receipts, invoices, cancelled checks, and the like. Where Massachusetts was able to produce such documentation, the Grant Officer dropped claims of misspending, but where the state could not produce the documentation, the Board charged it for the unaccounted-for funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In lieu of some of the missing source documentation, the Commonwealth submitted a detailed accounting, called a \"Reconstructed Trial Balance\" (RTB), in which the state's own auditor attempted to reconstruct Northshore's finances throughout the period at issue. In the Board's words, the RTB \"represented an accounting consultant's reconstruction of the Lynn SDA records, which was undertaken in an effort to produce an auditable set of financial records.\" The state also submitted statements by its own agents that they had themselves consistently reviewed Northshore's source documents with respect to certain aspects of the program. In the Commonwealth's view, the <i>post hoc</i> accounting and state agent testimony constituted substitute evidence of Northshore's essentially proper management of its financial affairs, and it argued that in light of this uncontradicted evidence the Board should have found that the funds were properly spent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state thus contended that the record-keeping requirements of the JTPA and regulations are not substantive obligations, but are instead simply one way of enforcing the underlying requirement that a state take sufficient care to direct its JTPA funds towards JTPA-related activities. The state's position was that it had provided satisfactory substitute assurances of good financial management and should not have been penalized for failing to abide by the particular requirements of the relevant record-keeping provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board in fact adopted roughly this legal position, but rejected the state's specific claims because the evidence the state provided was not sufficient to convince the Board that the funds were properly spent. The Board crucially noted that the RTB was not itself based on source documentation, but was in essence nothing more than an accountant's speculation as to what probably happened to the funds disbursed by Northshore. It likewise found insufficient the state agents' testimony that they had themselves reviewed source documentation at Northshore. Massachusetts now petitions for review of the Board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its petition, Massachusetts raises three questions, asking: whether the Board acted within its authority in determining that as a legal matter Massachusetts could have violated the terms of the JTPA on the facts alleged by the Grant Officer; whether the Board's decision to disallow the expenses and seek repayment was not supported by substantial evidence because the Board chose not to accept as sufficient the evidence proffered by the state; and whether the Board abused its discretion when it decided not to forgive the state its obligation to repay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JTPA requires a state to comply with a host of rules in order to qualify for funding. The rules relevant to this case fall into two broad categories. On one side of the line, the JTPA imposes limitations on the uses to which federal funds may be put. These substantive regulations govern expenses incurred by regional agencies in providing employment training services. Among other requirements, the regulations prescribe that an agency spending JTPA funds can only incur costs that are \"necessary and reasonable to the proper and efficient administration of the program.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(a)(2); 20 C.F.R. &#167; 627.435(a). The agency must also classify its expenditures according to the categories prescribed by statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and the statute and regulations prescribe maximum expenditures for certain categories &#8212; for example, the regulations specify that (depending on the program) administrative costs can amount to no more than fifteen or twenty percent of total expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to ensure compliance with these and other substantive limitations on expenditures, the statute and regulations place a heavy emphasis on financial management and accountability, and the other category of relevant regulations is the set of rules specifying the state and agency responsibilities to account for their use of funds. These oversight provisions specify the mechanisms through which states and their JTPA subrecipients must demonstrate to DOL that they are fulfilling their obligations under the substantive provisions of the Act. Among them is the requirement that \"[e]ach State shall establish such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure the proper disbursal of, and accounting for, Federal funds paid to the recipient under subchapters II and III of this chapter.\" <i>Id.,</i> &#167; 1574(a)(1). The statute goes on to specify that \"[s]uch procedures shall ensure that all financial transactions are conducted and records maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in each State.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts maintains that it and the Lynn SDA were largely in compliance with all relevant <i>substantive</i> provisions of the Act and regulations throughout the relevant time periods. The state contends that the roughly $9 million at stake in these proceedings (except for a few small sums it has conceded were misused) was spent to procure job training services as directed by the JTPA, and that DOL is wrong to try to recoup the money. Massachusetts ran into trouble, however, when it came time to demonstrate to the agency that the funds were appropriately spent. The usual method for demonstrating substantive compliance is through the completion of an independent audit. Such an audit is required by the SAA, as implemented at 29 C.F.R. Part 96 and made applicable to JTPA programs by 20 C.F.R. &#167; 629.1(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An SAA audit would have reviewed the substate agency's financial records, examined receipts, invoices, and cancelled checks, and made a determination as to the degree of the agency's compliance with the applicable regulations. Where such an audit indicated that funds had been misspent, the right response would generally be twofold: the imposition of financial sanctions on the state to the degree of the misexpenditure, and the proposal of remedial measures designed to prevent future misspending. Here, however, no such audit was conducted. Neither the statute nor the regulations specify precisely what ought to happen where an audit is never undertaken, but through its adjudication processes the Board has developed a rule for determining what a fair reimbursement is under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 627.802(e) in the Code of Federal Regulations specifies that, where a determination under the JTPA is entrusted to a Grant Officer in the first instance, the Grant Officer bears the burden of producing evidence to support a determination against a party. Thereafter, the regulation says, the party seeking to overturn the Grant Officer's determination has the burden of persuasion. In this case, the Board determined that the Grant Officer made a <i>prima facie</i> case that funds were misspent under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(d) by offering evidence that an SAA audit was not carried out. The state's burden in response was to demonstrate that it either \"met the specific requirements imposed by the JTPA\" &#8212; i.e., that it had actually carried out an SAA-compliant audit &#8212; or that it had \"compensated for any deficiencies through other means.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a technical matter, under this system the DOL charges the state with misspending simply because it has failed to properly put in place the appropriate accounting safeguards: the failure to conduct an audit constitutes a repayment-worthy violation of the JTPA in itself. DOL then limits the amount of the charged repayment to the amount which the state cannot demonstrate was spent in compliance with the substantive regulations. In order to demonstrate that compliance, the state must show source documentation, and where it does, it earns the right to avoid repaying the funds to the DOL. The practical effect of this system is that the state is responsible for repaying to DOL any funds it cannot prove were spent in compliance with the substantive regulations. In the words of the Board, \"Lynn was obligated not only to implement and maintain fiscal controls that ensured that Northshore funds were expended in compliance with all pertinent JTPA requirements, but also to maintain adequate records to <i>demonstrate</i> that such expenditures complied with the Act.\" (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Massachusetts attempted to prove substantive compliance with the JTPA in lieu of presenting a clean audit, the Board concluded that the evidence it presented was not sufficiently \"detailed, reliable, and extensive\" to meet its burden. Our review of the final determination of the Board under the JTPA is deferential. We are bound by the Board's findings of fact so long as they are supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1578(a)(3). While the statute grants us authority to review the legal determinations of the Board, <i>see id.,</i> as a general matter we defer to \"an agency's reasonable interpretation of a statute that it administers.\" <i>P.

It requires that those procedures \"ensure that all financial transactions are conducted and records maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in each State.\" <i>Id.</i> The regulations that implement these statutory provisions require <i>inter alia</i> that \"[r]ecipients and subrecipients shall ensure that their own financial systems as well as those of their subrecipients provide fiscal control and accounting procedures.\" 20 C.F.R. &#167; 627.425(b)(1).

It claims, in essence, that a misspending determination should be a determination of substantive malfeasance, and that the failure to monitor that is the basis of the record-keeping requirement does not rise to that level. The Board's interpretation is that a violation of the financial accountability rules can give rise to liability. This view lies well within the statutory boundaries. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(d) is the source of the Secretary's authority to demand repayment of funds, and provides that \"[e]very recipient shall repay to the United States amounts found not to have been expended in accordance with this chapter.\" The fiscal control provisions are provisions of the same chapter (indeed, the same section) as contains the repayment provision, and the DOL reasonably concluded that violations of those provisions could justify demanding repayment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the statute itself and the regulations implementing it evince a strong concern for proper record-keeping and financial accountability, evidenced in the above-cited sections and elsewhere throughout the texts. There is also reason to believe that increased accountability was a motivating factor in the passage of the legislation that substituted the programs under the JTPA for those provided by its predecessor statute, the Comprehensive Employment Training Act (CETA). <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 97-469, at 26, <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2636, 2661 (1982) (\"The General Accounting Office reports have made clear that the internal controls in CETA programs are unacceptably weak despite numerous Department of Labor regulations and publications which provide internal control guidance and requirements. These conditions make the grantees vulnerable to misuse of funds and unintentional errors.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, the Board's position here is consistent with longstanding views in various courts that seeking repayment where faulty accounting makes it impossible to determine whether funds have been properly spent is an appropriate remedy to allow in the context of the JTPA and its predecessor statutes. Dealing with a similar circumstance under the CETA program, the Fourth Circuit held twenty years ago that \"by failing to comply with the record-keeping requirements of CETA and its regulations, the County `misspent' federal funds within the meaning of the statute.\" <i>Montgomery County v.

Similarly here, rigorous record-keeping was essential to ensure that thousands of JTPA grant subrecipients used the money they received for its intended purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if we were not convinced that the DOL's interpretation of its authority to seek repayment here was otherwise sound and deserving of deference, the catchall remedial provision of &#167; 1574(h), which specifies that \"[t]he remedies under this section shall not be construed to be exclusive remedies,\" would provide a strong argument that there is no reason to give the &#167; 1574(d) provision a particularly crabbed reading, as Congress evidently meant to give the Secretary a broad arsenal of powers in seeking to enforce the terms that the states accept when they elect to receive JTPA funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth makes a secondary argument that even if the Board permissibly construed the statute and regulations to mean that a failure to make a proper accounting would result in a repayment obligation unless the state made a sufficient alternative showing that it complied with the substantive regulations at issue, its determination that the state did not make such a showing here was improper. Our review under the substantial evidence standard, however, is limited even in the general case, and we are the more reluctant to second-guess agency accounting policies in areas where the agency must oversee vast and complex programs and its experience with such oversight presumably informs those policies. Tracking and authenticating the numerous retail-level transactions that implementing the JTPA requires is a mammoth task, and \"[i]n such an area `(m)atters of accounting, unless they \"be the expression of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment, are for the agency.\"'\" <i>Cheshire Hosp. v. New Hampshire-Vermont Hospitalization Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409325\"><a href=\"/opinion/409325/cheshire-hospital-v-new-hampshire-vermont-hospitalization-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></a></span>, 1117 (1st Cir.1982). The Board determined that, without direct evidence in the form of source documentation to back it up, the state's evidence that funds were properly spent was unreliable guesswork and there remained reason to be concerned that the funds disbursed to Lynn SDA had not been spent on procuring JTPA-related services. The state complains that its evidence was good enough, but without a terribly strong showing indicating that the Board's evaluation and rejection of the proffered evidence was pure caprice, we could not conclude that the evidence compelled a contrary decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state's final argument is that even if DOL was within its rights in disallowing the costs at issue in the first place, the Secretary of Labor was authorized to waive the repayment obligation and abused her discretion in not doing so. Where the Board has determined that a state grant recipient may be charged for misspent funds, the statute grants the Secretary discretion to forgive the repayment obligation. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1574(e)(3). The statute does not give the Secretary unbounded discretion, however. In relevant part, the statute permits the Secretary to forgive repayment obligations only where the recipient state has demonstrated that it has: (A) established and adhered to an appropriate system for the award and monitoring of contracts with subgrantees which contains acceptable standards for ensuring accountability;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) entered into a written contract with such subgrantee which established clear goals and obligations in unambiguous terms;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) acted with due diligence to monitor the implementation of the subgrantee contract, including the carrying out of the appropriate monitoring activities (including audits) at reasonable intervals; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(D) taken prompt and appropriate corrective action upon becoming aware of any evidence of a violation of this chapter or the regulations under this chapter by such subgrantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.,</i> &#167; 1574(e)(2). DOL's position is that, because Massachusetts continued making payments to Lynn SDA for two years, a period during which it either overlooked or chose to look past Lynn SDA's faulty record-keeping, it was wasting the federal government's money. While the ultimate exercise of discretion is committed to the Secretary, we can review the agency's predicate factual and legal determinations &#8212; but we accord those determinations the usual deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts had to meet all four criteria specified in the statute in order to qualify for waiver consideration, and a supportable finding by the Board that it did not meet any one of those criteria dooms the state's claim. The Board determined that the efforts that Massachusetts made to staunch the flow of unaccounted-for funds to Northshore did not merit waiver consideration because Massachusetts failed to meet three of the four criteria. Specifically, Massachusetts had not \"established and adhered to an appropriate system for the award and monitoring of contracts with subgrantees which contains acceptable standards for ensuring accountability\" under &#167; 1574(e)(2)(A) because it had not adhered to the system it had established; had not acted with the requisite diligence under &#167; 1574(e)(2)(C) in monitoring Northshore; and had not responded with the requisite alacrity under &#167; 1574(e)(2)(D) in taking appropriate measures to correct the developing problem with Northshore once it was detected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state raises arguments contesting the Board's determinations as to each of these criteria. As to the last of them, the requirement that the state move with speed and force to correct violations of the JTPA, the state's arguments are particularly weak. The agency is entrusted in the first instance with determining whether a state has taken sufficiently diligent steps to justify a waiver, and it is the agency's job to determine what standards to apply to such a determination. Under the circumstances of the case, given the drawnout period over which Northshore declined and the length of time that elapsed before Massachusetts decided to decertify the program, the agency's determination that Massachusetts should have leaned harder on Lynn or moved to decertify it earlier does not appear unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory requirement is that the state take \"prompt and appropriate corrective action\" once it detects a problem. It seems sensible to think that whether an action taken was \"appropriate\" should be determined by looking to information available at the time, which is to say that retroactively declaring Massachusetts not to have taken \"appropriate corrective action\" because its plan did not work in the end might well be an unreasonable approach to take under &#167; 1574(e)(2)(D). Massachusetts suggests that the agency made such an error here, arguing that \"[t]he fact that Lynn did not adequately implement the corrective measures imposed on it by the Commonwealth does not support the conclusion that the Commonwealth itself was not diligent in its actions\" and that \"[t]he Board erred in holding otherwise.\" This pure legal argument does not have any basis in the Board's decision, for the Board did not rely on the corrective program's failure in determining that the state moved with less than the necessary speed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the Board made a fact-bound determination that the efforts Massachusetts did make to bring Northshore back into compliance were not sufficient to qualify it for waiver consideration. It noted federal and state requirements that corrective action be taken within six months when financial irregularities were detected, and concluded that on the basis of information then known, Massachusetts ought to have downgraded Lynn SDA to \"out of compliance\" status as early as September 1994. To defeat the agency's determination in a petition to this court, the state had at least to describe, making reference to the record, the particular efforts it made to revitalize the Lynn program and explain why it would be unreasonable to conclude that those efforts did not meet the statutory threshold. Without such an explanation, we cannot see our way to overturning the agency's determination and we therefore affirm the Board's decision to deny a waiver in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Administrative Review Board is <i>affirmed.</i> The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The JTPA was enacted in 1982 and took effect July 1, 1983.

There was also some confusion in the record about the time period during which certain events took place: the confusion arose from the fact that when DOL speaks of, for example, Program Year 1995, it is referring to the period from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996, while when Massachusetts speaks of Fiscal Year 1995, it is referring to the period from July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> For some Title II funds in the programs at issue here, the funds must be expended either on 1) administration, 2) what are called training-related services/supportive services, or 3) direct training services. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1518(b); 20 C.F.R. &#167; 627.440(d)(1)-(5).
