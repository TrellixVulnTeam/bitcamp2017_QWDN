C&M Constructora, S.A. (C&M)\n\nappeals from the July 13, 2005, amended judgment nunc pro tunc of\n\nthe district court in which the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Constructora Andrade Gutierrez, S.A. (CAG) on\n\nits claim against American International Insurance Company of\n\nPuerto Rico (AIICO); granted summary judgment in favor of AIICO on\n\nits   third-party   claim   for   indemnification   against   C&M;   and\n\ndismissed C&M's cross-claims against CAG on the basis that the\n\ncross-claims were subject to mandatory arbitration.           We affirm\n\nthose portions of the district court's judgment that are properly\n\nthe subject of this appeal.\n\n                             I. Background\n\n      C&M, a construction company headquartered in the Dominican\n\nRepublic, entered into an agreement titled \"Agreement on Grouping\n\nEnterprises\" (hereinafter \"Joint Venture Agreement\") in November\n\n1995 with CAG, a Brazilian corporation, for the sole purpose of\n\nbidding on the reconstruction of the Pont Sondé-Mirebalais Highway\n\nin the Republic of Haiti.    In the event that the joint venture won\n\nthe contract, CAG agreed to provide 100% of the guarantees for\n\nperformance and payment to the Republic of Haiti, and C&M agreed to\n\nprovide counter-guarantees to CAG for C&M's participation in the\n\nproject.\n\n      The Republic of Haiti awarded the project to the joint venture\n\nin May 1996. Pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, CAG obtained\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fa performance and payment bond on behalf of the joint venture for\n\nthe benefit of the Republic of Haiti, and C&M obtained a bond from\n\nAIICO for the benefit of CAG in proportion to C&M's participation\n\nin the construction project.        The AIICO bond stated that it was \"an\n\nirrevocable and unconditional guarantee . . . for the completion by\n\nthe   contractor    of    its   obligations      to   [CAG]   pursuant   to    the\n\nstipulations of the contract dated May 6, 1996.\" (Appellant's App.\n\nat 165.)\n\n      The parties were unable to settle disputes that developed\n\nduring the construction project, and on February 11, 1998, C&M and\n\nCAG entered into an agreement titled \"Modifications to Agreement of\n\nEnterprise Group\" (Modifications Agreement) in which participation\n\nin the construction project was reallocated 99% to C&M and 1% to\n\nCAG. The Modifications Agreement incorporated a letter of the same\n\ndate (Letter Agreement) written by C&M and approved by CAG, wherein\n\nthe   parties    agreed    that   C&M    would    pay   $967,000   to    CAG   as\n\nreimbursement for expenses incurred by CAG, to the extent that\n\namount was supported by a to-be-performed audit, and C&M would pay\n\n$440,000 to CAG for loss of business and profits.                   The Letter\n\nAgreement contemplated that C&M would provide CAG with a bank bond\n\nor insurance guarantee for the amounts specified in the Letter\n\nAgreement.      Although C&M provided two surety bonds, CAG returned\n\nthe bonds, and no additional bonds were ever issued on the Letter\n\nAgreement.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f      The    subsequent      audit    performed   pursuant     to    the   Letter\n\nAgreement revealed that CAG was responsible for cost overruns while\n\nit controlled the project, and that C&M's resulting losses far\n\nexceeded the amounts C&M had agreed to pay in the Letter Agreement.\n\nC&M thereafter refused to pay the agreed-upon amounts pursuant to\n\nthe terms of the Letter Agreement.            On July 19, 1999, CAG filed a\n\ncomplaint against AIICO in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico, invoking the district court's diversity\n\njurisdiction and seeking to recover on the AIICO bond for the\n\namounts specified in the Letter Agreement that C&M refused to pay.\n\n      C&M attempted to intervene in CAG's complaint against AIICO to\n\nprotect its interests.           Meanwhile, AIICO filed a third-party\n\ncomplaint against C&M in the original action, seeking to invoke the\n\nseparate indemnity agreement it had entered into with C&M to cover\n\nany payments that AIICO might be required to make on the bond it\n\nhad issued on C&M's behalf in favor of CAG.           Thereafter, C&M filed\n\ncross-claims against CAG, claiming that CAG had breached the Joint\n\nVenture Agreement.\n\n      After much litigation, the district court filed an Opinion and\n\nOrder on February 26, 2003, granting summary judgment in favor of\n\nCAG   on    its   original    claim    against    AIICO   in   the    amount   of\n\n$1,407,000, finding that the bond issued by AIICO was in actuality\n\nan unconditional guarantee essentially payable on demand.                  In an\n\nOpinion and Order filed on February 27, 2003, the district court\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fgranted   CAG's    motion    to   dismiss   C&M's   cross-claims   without\n\nprejudice, finding that the claims were subject to mandatory\n\narbitration.      The district court then entered judgment on CAG's\n\nclaim against AIICO and on C&M's cross-claims against CAG on\n\nFebruary 27, 2003, in accordance with the aforementioned Opinions\n\nand Orders.\n\n     On November 1, 2004, the district court filed a Memorandum and\n\nOrder finding that C&M was liable to AIICO on the third-party\n\ncomplaint against C&M for indemnification of the amounts that AIICO\n\nwas ordered to pay to CAG pursuant to the February 26, 2003,\n\nOpinion and Order.          The district court then filed an amended\n\njudgment on November 1, 2004, amending the February 27, 2003,\n\njudgment to add the judgment against C&M in favor of AIICO.\n\nFinally, on July 13, 2005, the district court granted CAG's motion\n\nto include prejudgment interest on the amount of $1,407,000 that\n\nAIICO was ordered to pay to CAG in the February 26, 2003, order.\n\nThe district court entered an Amended Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc\n\nreflecting the three prior judgments and the newly awarded pre-\n\njudgment interest.\n\n     From this final judgment, both C&M and AIICO filed separate\n\nnotices of appeal. AIICO's appeal was docketed as No. 05-2302, and\n\nits caption does not list C&M as a party to that appeal.             C&M's\n\nappeal was docketed as No. 05-2303.         The appeals were consolidated\n\nfor oral argument.     AIICO eventually settled its dispute with CAG\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fby paying $1,600,000 to CAG and moved to dismiss its appeal in this\n\ncourt on November 2, 2005.              Accordingly, this court dismissed\n\nappeal No. 05-2302.        C&M's appeal No. 05-2303 is therefore the\n\nsubject of the case before us.\n\n              II. Issues on Appeal and Standard of Review\n\n      C&M filed its notice of appeal on August 3, 2005, in which it\n\nappealed\n\n      from a final amended judgment nunc pro tunc (and\n      memorandum and order) entered on July 13, 2005 by the\n      Hon. Jay A. Garcöa [sic], amendingan [sic] amended\n      judgment (and memorandum and order) entered on November\n      1, 2004 granting defendant and third-party plaintiff\n      [AIICO]'s motion for summary judgment and ruling that C&M\n      was obligated to indemnify AIICO for any disbursements\n      made to plaintiff, [CAG], as well as any costs and\n      attorneys fees resulting from the court's February 25,\n      2003 judgment and February 27, 2003 Opinion and Order\n      entered in CAG's favor.\n\n(Appellant's App. at 1067.)         One week later, C&M filed an amended\n\nnotice of appeal, which was nearly identical in language to the\n\noriginal notice of appeal, but added the phrase \"dismissing C&M's\n\ncross claims against plaintiff [CAG], without prejudice, finding\n\nthat they were subject to mandatory arbitration\" to its description\n\nof which portions of the July 13, 2005, amended judgment nunc pro\n\ntunc it was appealing.2         (Id. at 1071-72.)     AIICO filed its notice\n\nof   appeal   on   the   same   date,    specifying   the   district   court's\n\njudgment granting CAG $1,407,000 plus prejudgment interest.\n\n\n      2\n      The amended notice of appeal also changed \"February 27, 2003\nOpinion and Order\" in the last line to \"February 26, 2003 Opinion\nand Order.\" This does not affect our analysis.\n\n                                        -6-\n\f     In their briefing to this court, both CAG and AIICO declined\n\nto address the validity of the district court's judgment ordering\n\nAIICO to pay CAG on the bond.          CAG claims that the issue is moot in\n\nlight of its settlement with AIICO. AIICO claims that the validity\n\nof the underlying judgment ordering AIICO to pay CAG on the bond is\n\nirrelevant      because      C&M   entered    into     a   separate     unconditional\n\nindemnity agreement that was not contingent on the correctness of\n\nthe district court's judgment against AIICO.\n\n     Putting the issues of the relevance and the mootness of the\n\nunderlying judgment aside, we question first whether the separate\n\norder    of     February     26,   2003,     finding       that   the   bond    was   an\n\nunconditional guarantee and ordering AIICO to pay $1,407,000 to\n\nCAG, is even properly before this court as a part of C&M's appeal.\n\nAs quoted above, C&M filed a very specific original notice of\n\nappeal    and    an   even    more   specific     amended         notice   of   appeal.\n\nCompliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3, specifying\n\nthe contents of a notice of appeal, is jurisdictional and cannot be\n\nwaived.       See Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 317\n\n(1988).       We must therefore determine which orders are encompassed\n\nwithin C&M's amended notice of appeal before we proceed to the\n\nmerits of the appeal.          See Diaz-Rodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410\n\nF.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 2005) (addressing appellate jurisdiction even\n\nthough it was not raised by the parties).\n\n     A notice of appeal must \"designate the judgment, order, or\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fpart thereof being appealed,\" Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B), before it\n\nconfers jurisdiction on a court of appeals to hear a case, see\n\nNieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 122 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\"[T]he general rule is that '[i]f an appellant . . . chooses to\n\ndesignate specific determinations in his notice of appeal-rather\n\nthan simply appealing from the entire judgment-only the specified\n\nissues may be raised on appeal.'\" United States v. Universal Mgmt.\n\nServs., Inc., 191 F.3d 750, 756 (6th Cir. 1999) (quoting McLaurin\n\nv. Fischer, 768 F.2d 98, 102 (6th Cir. 1985)), cert. denied, 530\n\nU.S. 1274 (2000).   The failure to include a particular issue in a\n\nnotice of appeal can be fatal to this court's jurisdiction over\n\nthat issue.   See Poy v. Boutselis, 352 F.3d 479, 486 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (declining to address an issue on appeal concerning another\n\nparty that was not raised in the notice of appeal); see also Lehman\n\nv. Revolution Portfolio L.L.C., 166 F.3d 389, 395 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(\"Failure to make a sufficient specification ordinarily debars the\n\nappellant from arguing the propriety of an unspecified ruling on\n\nappeal.\"); Spound v. Mohasco Indus., Inc., 534 F.2d 404, 410 (1st\n\nCir. 1976) (\"Nor was plaintiff correct in his further allegation\n\nthat his specific and limited prior appeal raised matters contained\n\nin entirely different paragraphs.\"), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 886\n\n(1976), abrogated on other grounds by Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v.\n\nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P'ship, 507 U.S. 380 (1993).\n\n     Notwithstanding   the   jurisdictional   nature   of   the   Rule   3\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\frequirements, we construe those requirements liberally, analyzing\n\n\"the notice of appeal in the context of the entire record.\"\n\nBlockel v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 337 F.3d 17, 23-24 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   \"This principle of liberal construction does not, however,\n\nexcuse   noncompliance    with   the   Rule.    Rule   3's   dictates    are\n\njurisdictional in nature, and their satisfaction is a prerequisite\n\nto appellate review.\"     Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992).\n\n     This   case   involves      multiple      parties;   three   separate\n\nsubstantive claims: CAG's original claim against AIICO on the bond,\n\nAIICO's third-party claim against C&M for indemnity, and C&M's\n\ncross-claims against CAG for breach of the Joint Venture Agreement;\n\nand three separate district court orders addressing each claim.\n\nFollowing the district court's amended judgment nunc pro tunc, C&M\n\nspecifically appealed from the district court's order requiring C&M\n\nto indemnify AIICO.      C&M then filed an amended notice of appeal,\n\nadding to its appeal the district court's order dismissing C&M's\n\ncross-claims because they were subject to arbitration.                  AIICO\n\nseparately appealed the district court's order holding it liable on\n\nthe bond but dismissed that appeal upon settlement with CAG. While\n\nC&M's amended notice of appeal mentioned the February 26, 2003,\n\norder that determined that AIICO was liable on the bond, the notice\n\nof appeal was specifically limited to \"any costs and attorneys fees\n\nresulting from\" that order.      (Appellant's App. at 1071-72.)\n\n     Given the circumstances of this case and the specific nature\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fof C&M's notice of appeal and amended notice of appeal, we conclude\n\nthat C&M did not appeal the district court's February 26 order\n\nrequiring AIICO to pay on the bond.   C&M knew the limited scope of\n\nits original notice of appeal as evidenced by its amended notice,\n\nin which it added another of the district court's specific rulings.\n\nEven after AIICO dismissed its appeal, C&M did not attempt to\n\ninclude the underlying judgment on the CAG claim against AIICO\n\nwithin its own appeal.   C&M's actions bring to mind the ancient\n\nmaxim, \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" (the expression of\n\none thing is an intention to exclude all others).    Kotler v. Am.\n\nTobacco Co., 981 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that a notice\n\nof appeal's exclusion of one order, coupled with the designation of\n\na distinct and independent order, \"loudly proclaims plaintiff's\n\nintention not to appeal from the former order\"); see also C&S\n\nAcquisitions Corp. v. Nw. Aircraft, Inc., 153 F.3d 622, 625 (8th\n\nCir. 1998) (declining to apply the rule that an appeal from a final\n\norder permits the review of issues decided in prior orders because\n\nthe notice of appeal specified a grant of summary judgment, which\n\napplied only to one count, and did not encompass the district\n\ncourt's separate order confirming an arbitration award).    C&M is\n\nthe master of its notices, and we are limited to reviewing only\n\nthose orders fairly raised within those notices.   We conclude that\n\nwe lack jurisdiction to disturb the district court's judgment\n\nordering AIICO to pay CAG on the bond, and we limit our discussion\n\n\n                               -10-\n\faccordingly.\n\n     We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.    Lexington Ins. Co. v. Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. of Am., 338 F.3d\n\n42, 46 (1st Cir. 2003).    We apply Puerto Rico substantive law to\n\nthis diversity action.    See id. (applying state substantive law\n\nwhen sitting in diversity).   Under Puerto Rico law, we accord the\n\nterms of a contract their plain meaning, reading the contract as a\n\nwhole.   Jewelers Mut. Ins. Co. v. N. Barquet, Inc., 410 F.3d 2, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           III. Application of the Agreement of Indemnity\n\n     Several weeks after issuance of the bond by AIICO to CAG,\n\nAIICO and C&M entered into a separate Agreement of Indemnity, which\n\nprovided that\n\n     The Principals and Indemnitors [C&M] shall exonerate,\n     indemnify, and keep indemnified the Surety [AIICO] from\n     and against any and all liability for losses and/or\n     expenses of whatsoever kind or nature (including, but not\n     limited to, interest, court costs, and counsel fees) and\n     from and against any and all such losses and/or expenses\n     which the Surety may sustain and incur: (1) By reason of\n     having executed or procured execution of the Bonds. . . .\n     Payment by reason of the aforesaid causes shall be made\n     to the surety by the Principals and Indemnitors as soon\n     as liability exists or is asserted against the Surety\n     whether or not the Surety shall have made payment\n     therefor. . . . In the event of any payment by the Surety\n     the Principals and Indemnitors further agree that in any\n     accounting between the Surety and the Principals, . . .\n     the Surety shall be entitled to charge for any and all\n     disbursements made by it in good faith in and about the\n     matters herein contemplated by this Agreement under the\n     belief that it is or was liable for the sums and amounts\n     so disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedient to\n     make such disbursements, whether or not such liability,\n     necessity or expediency existed . . . .\n\n                                -11-\n\f(Appellant’s App. at 138.)     Because the bond obligated AIICO \"to\n\npay the aforementioned amount on first demand by\" CAG (id. at 165),\n\nthe Agreement of Indemnity further required C&M as the Indemnitor\n\nto:\n\n      immediately and upon the Surety's first written or simple\n      demand (which shall be conclusive evidence that such sum\n      is due and payable) pay to the Surety or place with the\n      Surety (subject to the Bond amount) the sum required to\n      make such payment without any question or delay and\n      whether or not such demand is in the Indemnitor's opinion\n      a proper demand.\n\n(Id. at 140.)\n\n      Puerto Rico law recognizes the relationship between a surety\n\nand a debtor and requires a debtor to indemnify a surety even when\n\nthe security is paid without the debtor's knowledge.           See 31 P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 4911.    Furthermore, Puerto Rico law \"implicitly allows\n\nfor a surety to compromise a debt.\"       U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. PR\n\nEnters., No. 03-1338, 2005 WL 2244283, at *4 (D.P.R. Sept. 15,\n\n2005) (relying on 31 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 4911-13).        Generally, when\n\nan indemnity agreement gives a surety broad discretion to pay\n\nclaims triggering the indemnity agreement, the only defense an\n\nindemnitor   may    raise   against   a   claim   by   the    surety   for\n\nindemnification is that the surety committed fraud or collusion, or\n\notherwise acted in bad faith in paying the claim.            See Fireman's\n\nIns. Co. of Newark, N.J. v. Todesca Equip. Co., 310 F.3d 32, 35-36\n\n& n.6 (1st Cir. 2002) (discussing Rhode Island law and noting\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fslight variations in other jurisdictions).3\n\n     Although we lack jurisdiction to disturb the district court's\n\nruling that the bond was in actuality an unconditional guarantee,\n\nC&M argues that the district court's alleged error in that ruling\n\nmakes the Agreement of Indemnity inapplicable.            In other words,\n\naccording to C&M, there should have been, and there is, nothing to\n\nindemnify because AIICO should not have been required to pay CAG on\n\nthe bond.    In limited circumstances third-party defendants \"may\n\nraise on appeal claims of error based in the main action,\" where\n\nthe \"third-party liability . . . is entirely derivative of the\n\n[underlying] judgment . . ., and will cease to exist if that\n\njudgment is defeated.\"       United States v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.,\n\n917 F.2d 654, 658 n.5 (1st Cir. 1990) (reversing third-party\n\njudgment against insurance agent in favor of insurer based on\n\nerroneous    ruling   that   insurance     policy   provided    coverage   in\n\nunderlying suit and refusing to disturb judgment holding insurer\n\nliable where insurer did not appeal underlying judgment). Separate\n\nand apart from appealing the underlying ruling, a third-party\n\ndefendant may assert, as the basis for appealing the ruling against\n\nit on the third-party claim, that the underlying judgment was\n\nerroneous.      Id.      Thus,    while    we   will   not     disturb   (for\n\n\n     3\n      Puerto Rico law allows a debtor to use against the surety\nthose defenses it would have against the creditor, but only when\nthe surety pays on a debt without informing the debtor. See 31\nP.R. Laws Ann. § 4913. C&M does not rely on this defense, and we\ndo not address it.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fjurisdictional reasons) the district court's judgment holding that\n\nthe bond was an unconditional guarantee by AIICO, we can review the\n\ncorrectness of that ruling as a defense to C&M's liability under\n\nthe indemnity agreement if C&M's liability is \"entirely derivative\"\n\nof CAG's judgment against AIICO.       Id.\n\n     In   this   case,   C&M's   liability   to   AIICO   is   not   entirely\n\nderivative of CAG's judgment against AIICO. In fact, its liability\n\nis not derivative of the underlying judgment at all.           Even if AIICO\n\nhad paid on CAG's demand before CAG filed suit, C&M would have been\n\nliable to indemnify AIICO under the very broad terms of the\n\nseparate Agreement of Indemnification upon AIICO's good faith\n\npayment on the demand.      The sweeping language can be reduced to\n\nfive words: \"If we pay -- you pay.\"       Regardless of the correctness\n\nof the district court's underlying decision, the fact remains that\n\nAIICO did in fact pay on the bond.           Even if we now found that\n\nruling to be incorrect, it would not change the fact of payment or\n\nalter the judgment as between AIICO and CAG, which is now final as\n\nto those parties.    See id. at 662 (refusing to grant relief from an\n\nerroneous judgment to a nonappealing party); Marin Piazza v. Aponte\n\nRoque, 909 F.2d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 1990) (dismissing as untimely an\n\nappeal brought by four defendants following the fifth defendant's\n\nsuccessful appeal and noting that \"the inescapable consequence of\n\nfailure to appeal a judgment within the time allowed is that the\n\njudgment becomes final\" as to the nonappealing party). AIICO would\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fstill be out its payment on the bond.           The Agreement of Indemnity\n\nclearly and unequivocally required C&M to indemnify AIICO upon\n\nAIICO's good faith payment on the bond based on AIICO's belief that\n\nit was liable on the claim, \"or that it was necessary or expedient\n\nto    make    such   disbursements,   whether    or   not   such   liability,\n\nnecessity or expediency existed.\"              (Appellant's App. at 138.)\n\nThus, we need not, and do not, decide the correctness of the\n\nunderlying judgment in favor of CAG against AIICO; either way, C&M\n\nis liable to AIICO under the Agreement of Indemnity because AIICO\n\npaid on CAG's demand.\n\n       We note that in ruling on the underlying claim between CAG and\n\nAIICO, the district court found the bond to be an unconditional\n\nletter of credit and that the two conditions precedent to liability\n\non the letter of credit had been met, namely that (1) CAG provided\n\nwritten notice to AIICO prior to the expiration date of the bond,\n\nand (2) the written notification contained the amount to be paid\n\nand stated that C&M had not performed its contractual obligations.\n\nThe district court did not address the defenses raised by C&M to\n\njustify its failure to pay on the Letter Agreement, nor did it need\n\nto,   given    its   conclusion   that   the   bond   was   an   unconditional\n\nguarantee.      See generally 38A C.J.S. Guaranty § 17 (2006) (\"The\n\ngeneral rule that where the principal contract is invalid the\n\nguaranty is rendered invalid does not apply where the contract of\n\nguaranty is an entirely separate and independent contract, such as\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fan absolute guaranty.\" (internal footnotes omitted)). The judgment\n\ngranted to CAG against AIICO has no effect on the underlying\n\ndisputes between CAG and C&M concerning C&M's liability (or lack\n\nthereof or defenses thereto) on the Letter Agreement.\n\n      C&M did not argue in its briefs that AIICO's payment on the\n\nbond was made in bad faith, but relied solely on its claim that the\n\ndistrict   court   erred    in   holding      that   the   AIICO   bond   was   an\n\nunconditional guarantee.         During oral argument, counsel for C&M\n\nargued that AIICO settled the CAG-AIICO appeal in bad faith because\n\nit did not first consult C&M before paying the settlement.\n\n      We generally do not address arguments made for the first time\n\nduring oral argument, especially when the arguments are contrary to\n\nthe   arguments    made    in    the   briefs.       See    United   States     v.\n\nPizarro-Berríos,     448    F.3d    1,   4    (1st   Cir.    2006)   (\"We   have\n\nconsistently held that, except in extraordinary circumstances,\n\narguments not raised in a party's initial brief and instead raised\n\nfor the first time at oral argument are considered waived.\").\n\nAIICO was not aware until oral argument that the issue of its good\n\nfaith settlement of the appeal was at issue.\n\n      Even if we were to reach the merits of the bad faith argument,\n\nwe could not agree that AIICO's settlement was made in bad faith.\n\nAIICO vigorously disputed its liability on the bond in the district\n\ncourt and filed an appeal of the final judgment against it.\n\nWhatever its reason for settling after filing its notice of appeal,\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fwe cannot say that compliance with a judgment duly entered by a\n\nUnited States District Court evidences bad faith on the part of the\n\nlosing party.\n\n     The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof AIICO and against C&M based on the unambiguous and entirely\n\nseparate Agreement of Indemnity.         See Plaza Athénée, S.E. v. U.S.\n\nFid. and Guar. Co., No. 01-2597, 2005 WL 1114368, at *9-10 (D.P.R.\n\nMay 9, 2005) (granting partial summary judgment in favor of surety\n\nwhere surety settled claim with creditor without consulting debtor;\n\nnothing in the surety agreement limited surety's discretion or\n\nability to respond to the creditor's claim).\n\n IV. Cross-Claims Dismissed as Subject to Mandatory Arbitration\n\n     Finally, C&M challenges the district court's dismissal of its\n\ncross-claims    against   CAG,   in    which   C&M   claimed   that   CAG   had\n\nbreached the Joint Venture Agreement.          The Joint Venture Agreement\n\nbetween C&M and CAG included an arbitration clause, which stated:\n\n     Any difference related to the interpretation or the\n     execution of the present agreement will be settled in\n     accordance with the Rules of Reconciliation and\n     Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, by\n     a referee designated under the conditions provided by\n     said rule. The arbitration will take place at Genéve,\n     Switzerland, the applicable law being used i[s] the\n     Canton of Genéve.\n\n\n(Appellant's App. at 105.)       C&M recognizes the enforceability of\n\nmandatory arbitration agreements, but argues that CAG waived its\n\nright to enforce arbitration by bringing the action against AIICO\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fon the bond in federal court, relying on Jones Motor Co. v.\n\nChauffeurs, Teamsters, & Helpers Local Union No. 633 of N.H., 671\n\nF.2d 38, 42 (1st Cir.) (\"[P]arties are free to waive their rights\n\nto arbitration under a contract and proceed to present their\n\ncontractual dispute to a court.\"), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 943\n\n(1982).\n\n     The importance of arbitration agreements in the commercial\n\nworld,    particularly   related   to     international   agreements,   is\n\nindisputable.    Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)\n\nto\n\n     promote[] a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration\n     and [to] guarantee[] that \"[a] written provision in . . .\n     a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to\n     settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising\n     out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid,\n     irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as\n     exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any\n     contract.\"\n\nCampbell v. Gen. Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp., 407 F.3d 546, 551-52\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting 9 U.S.C. § 2) (alterations within internal\n\nquotation in original).\n\n     The district court determined that the bond was in actuality\n\nan unconditional guarantee, a determination that permitted the\n\ndistrict court to avoid deciding whether C&M had breached either\n\nthe Joint Venture Agreement or the Letter Agreement before it\n\nordered AIICO to pay on the bond.         Even if the district court was\n\nwrong in holding that the bond's character was independent of the\n\nJoint Venture Agreement, an issue we do not decide today, the fact\n\n                                   -18-\n\fremains that the district court interpreted only the bond.                       It did\n\nnot construe the Joint Venture Agreement or related amendments in\n\nholding AIICO liable on the bond.             In bringing its original action\n\nagainst   AIICO    on       the    bond   then,    CAG    did   not    invoke   federal\n\njurisdiction      to    decide      issues   related       to   the    Joint    Venture\n\nAgreement,   and       it    did    not    waive    its    right      to   enforce   the\n\narbitration clause.               Accordingly, the district court properly\n\ndismissed C&M's cross-claims because they are subject to mandatory\n\narbitration.\n\n                                      V. Summary\n\n     To the extent C&M attempts to appeal the underlying judgment\n\nin favor of CAG against AIICO, we dismiss that part of its appeal\n\nfor want of jurisdiction.            We affirm the district court's judgment\n\nholding that C&M was required to indemnify AIICO for the payment it\n\nmade to CAG, including costs and attorneys fees pursuant to the\n\nJuly 13, 2005, order, and we affirm the district court's judgment\n\ndismissing without prejudice C&M's cross-claims against CAG because\n\nthose claims are subject to mandatory arbitration. Costs of appeal\n\nare awarded to AIICO and CAG.             As it now stands, CAG holds AIICO's\n\nmoney, and C&M is liable to indemnify AIICO for the amount AIICO\n\nhas paid to CAG.            Assuming the parties invoke arbitration, the\n\ncorrect distribution or allocation of those funds held by CAG as\n\nbetween CAG and C&M will be determined by the results of the\n\narbitration proceedings in Genéve, in which CAG's claims against\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\fC&M based on the Letter Agreement and C&M's dismissed cross-claims\n\nfor breach of the Joint Venture Agreement should be resolved.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -20-\n\f",

C&M Constructora, S.A. (C&M)\n\nappeals from the July 13, 2005, amended judgment nunc pro tunc of\n\nthe district court in which the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Constructora Andrade Gutierrez, S.A. (CAG) on\n\nits claim against American International Insurance Company of\n\nPuerto Rico (AIICO); granted summary judgment in favor of AIICO on\n\nits   third-party   claim   for   indemnification   against   C&M;   and\n\ndismissed C&M's cross-claims against CAG on the basis that the\n\ncross-claims were subject to mandatory arbitration.           We affirm\n\nthose portions of the district court's judgment that are properly\n\nthe subject of this appeal.\n\n                             I. Background\n\n      C&M, a construction company headquartered in the Dominican\n\nRepublic, entered into an agreement titled \"Agreement on Grouping\n\nEnterprises\" (hereinafter \"Joint Venture Agreement\") in November\n\n1995 with CAG, a Brazilian corporation, for the sole purpose of\n\nbidding on the reconstruction of the Pont Sondé-Mirebalais Highway\n\nin the Republic of Haiti.    In the event that the joint venture won\n\nthe contract, CAG agreed to provide 100% of the guarantees for\n\nperformance and payment to the Republic of Haiti, and C&M agreed to\n\nprovide counter-guarantees to CAG for C&M's participation in the\n\nproject.\n\n      The Republic of Haiti awarded the project to the joint venture\n\nin May 1996. Pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, CAG obtained\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fa performance and payment bond on behalf of the joint venture for\n\nthe benefit of the Republic of Haiti, and C&M obtained a bond from\n\nAIICO for the benefit of CAG in proportion to C&M's participation\n\nin the construction project.        The AIICO bond stated that it was \"an\n\nirrevocable and unconditional guarantee . . . for the completion by\n\nthe   contractor    of    its   obligations      to   [CAG]   pursuant   to    the\n\nstipulations of the contract dated May 6, 1996.\" (Appellant's App.\n\nat 165.)\n\n      The parties were unable to settle disputes that developed\n\nduring the construction project, and on February 11, 1998, C&M and\n\nCAG entered into an agreement titled \"Modifications to Agreement of\n\nEnterprise Group\" (Modifications Agreement) in which participation\n\nin the construction project was reallocated 99% to C&M and 1% to\n\nCAG. The Modifications Agreement incorporated a letter of the same\n\ndate (Letter Agreement) written by C&M and approved by CAG, wherein\n\nthe   parties    agreed    that   C&M    would    pay   $967,000   to    CAG   as\n\nreimbursement for expenses incurred by CAG, to the extent that\n\namount was supported by a to-be-performed audit, and C&M would pay\n\n$440,000 to CAG for loss of business and profits.                   The Letter\n\nAgreement contemplated that C&M would provide CAG with a bank bond\n\nor insurance guarantee for the amounts specified in the Letter\n\nAgreement.      Although C&M provided two surety bonds, CAG returned\n\nthe bonds, and no additional bonds were ever issued on the Letter\n\nAgreement.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f      The    subsequent      audit    performed   pursuant     to    the   Letter\n\nAgreement revealed that CAG was responsible for cost overruns while\n\nit controlled the project, and that C&M's resulting losses far\n\nexceeded the amounts C&M had agreed to pay in the Letter Agreement.\n\nC&M thereafter refused to pay the agreed-upon amounts pursuant to\n\nthe terms of the Letter Agreement.            On July 19, 1999, CAG filed a\n\ncomplaint against AIICO in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico, invoking the district court's diversity\n\njurisdiction and seeking to recover on the AIICO bond for the\n\namounts specified in the Letter Agreement that C&M refused to pay.\n\n      C&M attempted to intervene in CAG's complaint against AIICO to\n\nprotect its interests.           Meanwhile, AIICO filed a third-party\n\ncomplaint against C&M in the original action, seeking to invoke the\n\nseparate indemnity agreement it had entered into with C&M to cover\n\nany payments that AIICO might be required to make on the bond it\n\nhad issued on C&M's behalf in favor of CAG.           Thereafter, C&M filed\n\ncross-claims against CAG, claiming that CAG had breached the Joint\n\nVenture Agreement.\n\n      After much litigation, the district court filed an Opinion and\n\nOrder on February 26, 2003, granting summary judgment in favor of\n\nCAG   on    its   original    claim    against    AIICO   in   the    amount   of\n\n$1,407,000, finding that the bond issued by AIICO was in actuality\n\nan unconditional guarantee essentially payable on demand.                  In an\n\nOpinion and Order filed on February 27, 2003, the district court\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fgranted   CAG's    motion    to   dismiss   C&M's   cross-claims   without\n\nprejudice, finding that the claims were subject to mandatory\n\narbitration.      The district court then entered judgment on CAG's\n\nclaim against AIICO and on C&M's cross-claims against CAG on\n\nFebruary 27, 2003, in accordance with the aforementioned Opinions\n\nand Orders.\n\n     On November 1, 2004, the district court filed a Memorandum and\n\nOrder finding that C&M was liable to AIICO on the third-party\n\ncomplaint against C&M for indemnification of the amounts that AIICO\n\nwas ordered to pay to CAG pursuant to the February 26, 2003,\n\nOpinion and Order.          The district court then filed an amended\n\njudgment on November 1, 2004, amending the February 27, 2003,\n\njudgment to add the judgment against C&M in favor of AIICO.\n\nFinally, on July 13, 2005, the district court granted CAG's motion\n\nto include prejudgment interest on the amount of $1,407,000 that\n\nAIICO was ordered to pay to CAG in the February 26, 2003, order.\n\nThe district court entered an Amended Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc\n\nreflecting the three prior judgments and the newly awarded pre-\n\njudgment interest.\n\n     From this final judgment, both C&M and AIICO filed separate\n\nnotices of appeal. AIICO's appeal was docketed as No. 05-2302, and\n\nits caption does not list C&M as a party to that appeal.             C&M's\n\nappeal was docketed as No. 05-2303.         The appeals were consolidated\n\nfor oral argument.     AIICO eventually settled its dispute with CAG\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fby paying $1,600,000 to CAG and moved to dismiss its appeal in this\n\ncourt on November 2, 2005.              Accordingly, this court dismissed\n\nappeal No. 05-2302.        C&M's appeal No. 05-2303 is therefore the\n\nsubject of the case before us.\n\n              II. Issues on Appeal and Standard of Review\n\n      C&M filed its notice of appeal on August 3, 2005, in which it\n\nappealed\n\n      from a final amended judgment nunc pro tunc (and\n      memorandum and order) entered on July 13, 2005 by the\n      Hon. Jay A. Garcöa [sic], amendingan [sic] amended\n      judgment (and memorandum and order) entered on November\n      1, 2004 granting defendant and third-party plaintiff\n      [AIICO]'s motion for summary judgment and ruling that C&M\n      was obligated to indemnify AIICO for any disbursements\n      made to plaintiff, [CAG], as well as any costs and\n      attorneys fees resulting from the court's February 25,\n      2003 judgment and February 27, 2003 Opinion and Order\n      entered in CAG's favor.\n\n(Appellant's App. at 1067.)         One week later, C&M filed an amended\n\nnotice of appeal, which was nearly identical in language to the\n\noriginal notice of appeal, but added the phrase \"dismissing C&M's\n\ncross claims against plaintiff [CAG], without prejudice, finding\n\nthat they were subject to mandatory arbitration\" to its description\n\nof which portions of the July 13, 2005, amended judgment nunc pro\n\ntunc it was appealing.2         (Id. at 1071-72.)     AIICO filed its notice\n\nof   appeal   on   the   same   date,    specifying   the   district   court's\n\njudgment granting CAG $1,407,000 plus prejudgment interest.\n\n\n      2\n      The amended notice of appeal also changed \"February 27, 2003\nOpinion and Order\" in the last line to \"February 26, 2003 Opinion\nand Order.\" This does not affect our analysis.\n\n                                        -6-\n\f     In their briefing to this court, both CAG and AIICO declined\n\nto address the validity of the district court's judgment ordering\n\nAIICO to pay CAG on the bond.          CAG claims that the issue is moot in\n\nlight of its settlement with AIICO. AIICO claims that the validity\n\nof the underlying judgment ordering AIICO to pay CAG on the bond is\n\nirrelevant      because      C&M   entered    into     a   separate     unconditional\n\nindemnity agreement that was not contingent on the correctness of\n\nthe district court's judgment against AIICO.\n\n     Putting the issues of the relevance and the mootness of the\n\nunderlying judgment aside, we question first whether the separate\n\norder    of     February     26,   2003,     finding       that   the   bond    was   an\n\nunconditional guarantee and ordering AIICO to pay $1,407,000 to\n\nCAG, is even properly before this court as a part of C&M's appeal.\n\nAs quoted above, C&M filed a very specific original notice of\n\nappeal    and    an   even    more   specific     amended         notice   of   appeal.\n\nCompliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3, specifying\n\nthe contents of a notice of appeal, is jurisdictional and cannot be\n\nwaived.

C&M then filed an amended notice of appeal,\n\nadding to its appeal the district court's order dismissing C&M's\n\ncross-claims because they were subject to arbitration.                  AIICO\n\nseparately appealed the district court's order holding it liable on\n\nthe bond but dismissed that appeal upon settlement with CAG. While\n\nC&M's amended notice of appeal mentioned the February 26, 2003,\n\norder that determined that AIICO was liable on the bond, the notice\n\nof appeal was specifically limited to \"any costs and attorneys fees\n\nresulting from\" that order.

Application of the Agreement of Indemnity\n\n     Several weeks after issuance of the bond by AIICO to CAG,\n\nAIICO and C&M entered into a separate Agreement of Indemnity, which\n\nprovided that\n\n     The Principals and Indemnitors [C&M] shall exonerate,\n     indemnify, and keep indemnified the Surety [AIICO] from\n     and against any and all liability for losses and/or\n     expenses of whatsoever kind or nature (including, but not\n     limited to, interest, court costs, and counsel fees) and\n     from and against any and all such losses and/or expenses\n     which the Surety may sustain and incur: (1) By reason of\n     having executed or procured execution of the Bonds. . . .\n     Payment by reason of the aforesaid causes shall be made\n     to the surety by the Principals and Indemnitors as soon\n     as liability exists or is asserted against the Surety\n     whether or not the Surety shall have made payment\n     therefor. . . . In the event of any payment by the Surety\n     the Principals and Indemnitors further agree that in any\n     accounting between the Surety and the Principals, . . .\n     the Surety shall be entitled to charge for any and all\n     disbursements made by it in good faith in and about the\n     matters herein contemplated by this Agreement under the\n     belief that it is or was liable for the sums and amounts\n     so disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedient to\n     make such disbursements, whether or not such liability,\n     necessity or expediency existed . . . .\n\n                                -11-\n\f(Appellant’s App. at 138.)     Because the bond obligated AIICO \"to\n\npay the aforementioned amount on first demand by\" CAG (id. at 165),\n\nthe Agreement of Indemnity further required C&M as the Indemnitor\n\nto:\n\n      immediately and upon the Surety's first written or simple\n      demand (which shall be conclusive evidence that such sum\n      is due and payable) pay to the Surety or place with the\n      Surety (subject to the Bond amount) the sum required to\n      make such payment without any question or delay and\n      whether or not such demand is in the Indemnitor's opinion\n      a proper demand.\n\n(Id. at 140.)\n\n      Puerto Rico law recognizes the relationship between a surety\n\nand a debtor and requires a debtor to indemnify a surety even when\n\nthe security is paid without the debtor's knowledge.           See 31 P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 4911.    Furthermore, Puerto Rico law \"implicitly allows\n\nfor a surety to compromise a debt.\"       U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v.

Separate\n\nand apart from appealing the underlying ruling, a third-party\n\ndefendant may assert, as the basis for appealing the ruling against\n\nit on the third-party claim, that the underlying judgment was\n\nerroneous.

Id.\n\n     In   this   case,   C&M's   liability   to   AIICO   is   not   entirely\n\nderivative of CAG's judgment against AIICO. In fact, its liability\n\nis not derivative of the underlying judgment at all.           Even if AIICO\n\nhad paid on CAG's demand before CAG filed suit, C&M would have been\n\nliable to indemnify AIICO under the very broad terms of the\n\nseparate Agreement of Indemnification upon AIICO's good faith\n\npayment on the demand.      The sweeping language can be reduced to\n\nfive words: \"If we pay -- you pay.\"       Regardless of the correctness\n\nof the district court's underlying decision, the fact remains that\n\nAIICO did in fact pay on the bond.

AIICO would\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fstill be out its payment on the bond.           The Agreement of Indemnity\n\nclearly and unequivocally required C&M to indemnify AIICO upon\n\nAIICO's good faith payment on the bond based on AIICO's belief that\n\nit was liable on the claim, \"or that it was necessary or expedient\n\nto    make    such   disbursements,   whether    or   not   such   liability,\n\nnecessity or expediency existed.\"              (Appellant's App. at 138.)\n\nThus, we need not, and do not, decide the correctness of the\n\nunderlying judgment in favor of CAG against AIICO; either way, C&M\n\nis liable to AIICO under the Agreement of Indemnity because AIICO\n\npaid on CAG's demand.\n\n       We note that in ruling on the underlying claim between CAG and\n\nAIICO, the district court found the bond to be an unconditional\n\nletter of credit and that the two conditions precedent to liability\n\non the letter of credit had been met, namely that (1) CAG provided\n\nwritten notice to AIICO prior to the expiration date of the bond,\n\nand (2) the written notification contained the amount to be paid\n\nand stated that C&M had not performed its contractual obligations.\n\nThe district court did not address the defenses raised by C&M to\n\njustify its failure to pay on the Letter Agreement, nor did it need\n\nto,   given    its   conclusion   that   the   bond   was   an   unconditional\n\nguarantee.      See generally 38A C.J.S.

The judgment\n\ngranted to CAG against AIICO has no effect on the underlying\n\ndisputes between CAG and C&M concerning C&M's liability (or lack\n\nthereof or defenses thereto) on the Letter Agreement.\n\n      C&M did not argue in its briefs that AIICO's payment on the\n\nbond was made in bad faith, but relied solely on its claim that the\n\ndistrict   court   erred    in   holding      that   the   AIICO   bond   was   an\n\nunconditional guarantee.

Even if the district court was\n\nwrong in holding that the bond's character was independent of the\n\nJoint Venture Agreement, an issue we do not decide today, the fact\n\n                                   -18-\n\fremains that the district court interpreted only the bond.                       It did\n\nnot construe the Joint Venture Agreement or related amendments in\n\nholding AIICO liable on the bond.             In bringing its original action\n\nagainst   AIICO    on       the    bond   then,    CAG    did   not    invoke   federal\n\njurisdiction      to    decide      issues   related       to   the    Joint    Venture\n\nAgreement,   and       it    did    not    waive    its    right      to   enforce   the\n\narbitration clause.               Accordingly, the district court properly\n\ndismissed C&M's cross-claims because they are subject to mandatory\n\narbitration.\n\n                                      V. Summary\n\n     To the extent C&M attempts to appeal the underlying judgment\n\nin favor of CAG against AIICO, we dismiss that part of its appeal\n\nfor want of jurisdiction.            We affirm the district court's judgment\n\nholding that C&M was required to indemnify AIICO for the payment it\n\nmade to CAG, including costs and attorneys fees pursuant to the\n\nJuly 13, 2005, order, and we affirm the district court's judgment\n\ndismissing without prejudice C&M's cross-claims against CAG because\n\nthose claims are subject to mandatory arbitration. Costs of appeal\n\nare awarded to AIICO and CAG.             As it now stands, CAG holds AIICO's\n\nmoney, and C&M is liable to indemnify AIICO for the amount AIICO\n\nhas paid to CAG.            Assuming the parties invoke arbitration, the\n\ncorrect distribution or allocation of those funds held by CAG as\n\nbetween CAG and C&M will be determined by the results of the\n\narbitration proceedings in Genéve, in which CAG's claims against\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\fC&M based on the Letter Agreement and C&M's dismissed cross-claims\n\nfor breach of the Joint Venture Agreement should be resolved.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -20-\n\f</pre>",
