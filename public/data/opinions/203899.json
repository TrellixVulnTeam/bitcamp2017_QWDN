Melanie Landry, a resident of Maine,\n\nwas involved in a car accident in New Brunswick, Canada, on\n\nNovember   28,   2003   in    which   Keith   Savoie,   a   resident   of   New\n\nBrunswick, was injured.         Landry was driving a vehicle owned by\n\nRollin H. Small, Jr. when she hit Savoie's pickup truck, which was\n\nowned by Savoie's father, from the rear.\n\n           Landry was insured for the accident under a policy which\n\nwas issued by Bristol West (\"BW\") for the six-month period from\n\nNovember 20, 2003 to May 20, 2004.             Savoie filed suit against\n\nLandry and Small in New Brunswick; BW handled the claim.               Savoie\n\nclaimed injuries to his neck and back and sought damages in excess\n\nof $200,000 (Can.) for, inter alia, wage loss, loss of future\n\nincome, medical costs, and pain and suffering.              Savoie also filed\n\nan action against Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company, his insurer,\n\nseeking recovery for damages for what he might be unable to recover\n\nfrom Landry and Small.\n\n           BW    brought     this   related   declaratory    judgment action\n\nagainst Landry and Small in federal court in Maine.            The purpose of\n\nthe declaratory judgment suit, essentially, is to determine the\n\nextent of Landry's coverage under a particular clause in the BW\n\npolicy in these circumstances.         Wawanesa was allowed to intervene.\n\nThe two insurers filed cross motions for summary judgment.\n\n           BW's position is that its coverage is limited to the\n\n$50,000 maximum coverage specified in Landry's policy for in-state\n\n                                      -2-\n\faccidents.    See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29-A, § 1605(1)(C)(2)\n\n(specifying   $50,000   minimum   coverage   under   Maine's   compulsory\n\ninsurance law for bodily injury). Landry, Small, and Wawanesa take\n\nthe position that BW's coverage obligation is for $200,000 (Can.)\n\nunder an \"Out of State Coverage\" clause in the contract, because\n\nthe accident occurred in New Brunswick.\n\n            The case thus presents a question of insurance contract\n\ninterpretation.     That is an issue of law for a court under Maine\n\nlaw.   Foremost Ins. Co. v. Levesque, 868 A.2d 244, 246 (Me. 2005).\n\nThe district court resolved the case on cross motions for summary\n\njudgment.    Independently, for each of those reasons, our review is\n\nde novo.    See New Fed Mortg. Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of\n\nPittsburgh, PA, 543 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 2008); Liberty Mut. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Greenwich Ins. Co., 417 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            The district court made two holdings:        First, it held\n\nthat the \"Out of State\" clause coverage language entitled Landry to\n\nout of state coverage only \"to the extent required by a financial\n\nresponsibility law to which the insured is subject.\"       Bristol West\n\nIns. Co. v. Landry, 577 F. Supp. 2d 459, 464 (D. Me. 2008).            It\n\nthen construed the New Brunswick financial responsibility statute\n\nand concluded Landry was not entitled to the extra coverage.         Id.\n\nat 465-66.    We disagree on the first point and have no need to\n\nreach the second.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f                                        I.\n\n           We begin with the plain language of the \"Out of State\n\nCoverage\" clause:\n\n           If an auto accident to which this policy\n           applies occurs in any state or province other\n           than the one in which \"your covered auto\" is\n           principally garaged, we will interpret your\n           policy for that accident as follows:\n\n           A.     If the state or province has:\n\n           1.        A financial responsibility or similar\n                     law specifying limits of liability for\n                     \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\"\n                     higher than the limit shown in the\n                     Declarations, your policy will provide\n                     the higher specified limit.\n\n           2.        A compulsory insurance or similar law\n                     requiring a non-resident to maintain\n                     insurance whenever the nonresident uses\n                     a vehicle in that state or province,\n                     your policy will provide at least the\n                     required minimum amounts and types of\n                     coverage.\n\nNew   Brunswick    has   both   a   financial    responsibility    law    and   a\n\ncompulsory insurance law, with identical $200,000 (Can.) limits.\n\nSee   R.S.N.B. 1973, ch. M-17, § 271.           The parties agree that it is\n\nthe financial responsibility provision which is at issue.\n\n           The    courts   of   Maine    would    apply   Maine   law    to   the\n\ninterpretation of the coverage provided in an automobile insurance\n\npolicy for a resident of Maine.         See Flaherty v. Allstate Ins. Co.,\n\n822 A.2d 1159, 1165-68 (Me. 2003) (explaining that under Maine law\n\ncourts apply the \"most significant contacts and relationships\" test\n\nand applying Maine law where, inter alia, parties were Maine\n\n                                      -4-\n\fresidents and parties entered into insurance contract in Maine);\n\nsee also Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 188 (1971).1\n\nUnder Maine insurance law, there are certain well-accepted rules of\n\nconstruction of such contracts.\n\n          The ultimate touchstone of our analysis must be the\n\nparties' intent in entering their bargain.       See, e.g., Pine Ridge\n\nRealty, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Ins. Co., 752 A.2d 595, 601 (Me. 2000).\n\nWe view the policy from the standpoint of \"an average person,\n\nuntrained in either the law or the insurance field, in light of\n\nwhat a more than casual reading of the policy would reveal to an\n\nordinarily intelligent insured.\"        Peerless Ins. Co. v. Wood, 685\n\nA.2d 1173, 1174 (Me. 1996).    Additionally, \"[i]nsurance policies\n\nare liberally construed by [the] court in favor of the insured.\"\n\nId.; see also Found. for   Blood Research v. St. Paul Marine & Fire\n\nIns. Co., 730 A.2d 175, 180 (Me. 1999); Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v.\n\nCommercial Union Ins. Co., 521 A.2d 308, 310 (Me. 1987).         Under\n\nMaine law, \"[a]ny ambiguity in the [insurance] contract is resolved\n\nagainst the insurer.\"   Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 521 A.2d at 310;\n\nsee also Allstate Ins. Co. v. Elwell, 513 A.2d 269, 271 (Me. 1986).\n\n          Read literally, the Out of State Coverage clause states\n\nthat it will provide coverage for an accident which occurs out of\n\nstate up to the limits of liability provided for by a financial\n\n\n     1\n          Although a complete copy of the BW policy was not\nsubmitted to the district court, all parties agreed that Maine law\ngoverned the case, and the district court accepted that agreement.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fresponsibility law of the place of the accident.            It is undisputed\n\nthat New Brunswick, the place of the accident, has a financial\n\nresponsibility law that requires nonresident motorists to satisfy\n\na judgment of up to $200,000 (Can.), and to provide proof of\n\nfinancial responsibility in the amount of $200,000 (Can.), to avoid\n\nsuspension   of   their    driving   privileges    following    an   accident\n\ncausing personal injury or $1000 (Can.) in damages.            See R.S.N.B.\n\n1973, ch. M-17, §§ 276(1)(a), 282.               The contract provision's\n\nlanguage,    which   was   crafted   by    the   insurer,   then   is   easily\n\nunderstood to increase the coverage amount in this instance to\n\n$200,000 (Can.).\n\n            BW essentially argues that the provision should be read\n\nnot as an expansion of coverage for the insured, but only as a\n\npotential expansion subject to a limitation.            The limitation BW\n\nwishes to read into the policy language is that the insured gets\n\nthe benefit of the increased coverage amount if and only if New\n\nBrunswick's financial responsibility law would actually apply to\n\nthese facts.   It argues that the New Brunswick law would not apply.\n\nWithout our going into a long exegesis on the New Brunswick\n\nfinancial responsibility law, at the heart of BW's argument is that\n\nthis was a first accident and under financial responsibility laws,\n\nas Couch on Insurance recognizes, usually the first accident is\n\nessentially free.     7A L.R. Russ & T.F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance\n\n§ 109:34, at 109-47 (3d ed. 2005) (\"The terms required by such\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f[financial responsibility] statutes apply only after the operator\n\nof a vehicle has been involved in one accident and only to\n\naccidents which occur after the effective date of the requirement\n\nof proof of financial responsibility.\").         We do not need to test\n\nthe assumption that the New Brunswick law has that effect.\n\n            We think BW is wrong to focus on the limits of the New\n\nBrunswick financial responsibility law, and not on its own policy\n\nlanguage.    First, the Out of State Coverage clause does not read\n\nthe way BW would like it to read, although it could have been\n\nwritten that way.         Second, the proper focus is on the insured's\n\nreasonable expectations, given the policy language.           We doubt any\n\ninsured    would   have    reasonably   understood   this   \"out   of   state\n\ncoverage\" clause to be not an expansion of coverage, as it says,\n\nbut also to contain an unstated limitation on an expansion of\n\ncoverage. Further, the insured certainly would not have understood\n\nthe expansion of coverage to have an exception for first accidents\n\noutside of Maine in jurisdictions with financial responsibility\n\nlaws.     The language of the \"Out of State Coverage\" clause makes\n\nspecific reference to any accident, whether first or not, out of\n\nstate: the preamble to the financial responsibility clause states,\n\n\"[i]f an auto accident to which this policy applies occurs\" out of\n\nstate, then \"we will interpret your policy for that accident as\n\nfollows\"; the financial responsibility clause then promises to\n\n\"provide the higher specified limit.\"\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          Our conclusion would be the same regardless, but it is\n\nbuttressed by the fact that BW itself initially read the clause as\n\nwe do and so represented to the insured.      On September 13, 2007,\n\ntwo months prior to the filing of the complaint in the instant\n\naction, a BW Claims Analyst, Curtis M. Lemmerbrock, wrote a letter\n\nto Landry stating that \"since this accident happened in Canada,\n\nyour [bodily injury] policy limits automatically deem to the\n\nminimum amounts of liability limits as outlined via Canadian law,\n\nwhich is $200,000CA per person.\"      The letter advised Landry that\n\nshe would be covered up to the $200,000 (Can.) limit, but that\n\ndamages from the injury claim pending against her could exceed that\n\nlimit.   Whether or not this is an admission, it is evidence BW's\n\nown agent read the clause that way.      To the extent the clause is\n\nambiguous, it must be read against the insurer.\n\n          The meaning of the clause is squarely presented and has\n\nnot been waived.    Wawanesa has argued both in the district court\n\nand on appeal that under the plain language of the policy the Out\n\nof State Coverage clause necessarily expands the coverage to\n\n$200,000 (Can.).2   It is true that on appeal the parties largely\n\nviewed this case as a question about the meaning of the New\n\nBrunswick financial responsibility law.       At oral argument, the\n\n\n\n     2\n          In the district court, Wawanesa characterized the\nlanguage of the clause as \"clear and unambiguous\" and argued that\nBW's clause included no words of limitation that the policy applied\nonly after the first accident.\n\n                                -8-\n\fpanel asked questions about interpretation of the Out of State\n\nCoverage clause.    And logically, the question we have answered is\n\nthe prior one about the contractual language.    We have no need to\n\nreach the questions as to the meaning of New Brunswick law; we are\n\nparticularly disinclined to opine on foreign law when we do not\n\nneed to do so.     The principles of Maine law on which we rely are\n\nunexceptional and were briefed to the district court.\n\n                                II.\n\n          For these reasons, we reverse and order entry of judgment\n\nfor Wawanesa.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

It is undisputed\n\nthat New Brunswick, the place of the accident, has a financial\n\nresponsibility law that requires nonresident motorists to satisfy\n\na judgment of up to $200,000 (Can.), and to provide proof of\n\nfinancial responsibility in the amount of $200,000 (Can.), to avoid\n\nsuspension   of   their    driving   privileges    following    an   accident\n\ncausing personal injury or $1000 (Can.) in damages.            See R.S.N.B.\n\n1973, ch. M-17, §§ 276(1)(a), 282.               The contract provision's\n\nlanguage,    which   was   crafted   by    the   insurer,   then   is   easily\n\nunderstood to increase the coverage amount in this instance to\n\n$200,000 (Can.).\n\n            BW essentially argues that the provision should be read\n\nnot as an expansion of coverage for the insured, but only as a\n\npotential expansion subject to a limitation.            The limitation BW\n\nwishes to read into the policy language is that the insured gets\n\nthe benefit of the increased coverage amount if and only if New\n\nBrunswick's financial responsibility law would actually apply to\n\nthese facts.   It argues that the New Brunswick law would not apply.\n\nWithout our going into a long exegesis on the New Brunswick\n\nfinancial responsibility law, at the heart of BW's argument is that\n\nthis was a first accident and under financial responsibility laws,\n\nas Couch on Insurance recognizes, usually the first accident is\n\nessentially free.     7A L.R. Russ & T.F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance\n\n§ 109:34, at 109-47 (3d ed. 2005) (\"The terms required by such\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f[financial responsibility] statutes apply only after the operator\n\nof a vehicle has been involved in one accident and only to\n\naccidents which occur after the effective date of the requirement\n\nof proof of financial responsibility.\").         We do not need to test\n\nthe assumption that the New Brunswick law has that effect.\n\n            We think BW is wrong to focus on the limits of the New\n\nBrunswick financial responsibility law, and not on its own policy\n\nlanguage.    First, the Out of State Coverage clause does not read\n\nthe way BW would like it to read, although it could have been\n\nwritten that way.         Second, the proper focus is on the insured's\n\nreasonable expectations, given the policy language.           We doubt any\n\ninsured    would   have    reasonably   understood   this   \"out   of   state\n\ncoverage\" clause to be not an expansion of coverage, as it says,\n\nbut also to contain an unstated limitation on an expansion of\n\ncoverage. Further, the insured certainly would not have understood\n\nthe expansion of coverage to have an exception for first accidents\n\noutside of Maine in jurisdictions with financial responsibility\n\nlaws.     The language of the \"Out of State Coverage\" clause makes\n\nspecific reference to any accident, whether first or not, out of\n\nstate: the preamble to the financial responsibility clause states,\n\n\"[i]f an auto accident to which this policy applies occurs\" out of\n\nstate, then \"we will interpret your policy for that accident as\n\nfollows\"; the financial responsibility clause then promises to\n\n\"provide the higher specified limit.\"\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          Our conclusion would be the same regardless, but it is\n\nbuttressed by the fact that BW itself initially read the clause as\n\nwe do and so represented to the insured.      On September 13, 2007,\n\ntwo months prior to the filing of the complaint in the instant\n\naction, a BW Claims Analyst, Curtis M. Lemmerbrock, wrote a letter\n\nto Landry stating that \"since this accident happened in Canada,\n\nyour [bodily injury] policy limits automatically deem to the\n\nminimum amounts of liability limits as outlined via Canadian law,\n\nwhich is $200,000CA per person.\"      The letter advised Landry that\n\nshe would be covered up to the $200,000 (Can.) limit, but that\n\ndamages from the injury claim pending against her could exceed that\n\nlimit.   Whether or not this is an admission, it is evidence BW's\n\nown agent read the clause that way.      To the extent the clause is\n\nambiguous, it must be read against the insurer.\n\n          The meaning of the clause is squarely presented and has\n\nnot been waived.    Wawanesa has argued both in the district court\n\nand on appeal that under the plain language of the policy the Out\n\nof State Coverage clause necessarily expands the coverage to\n\n$200,000 (Can.).2   It is true that on appeal the parties largely\n\nviewed this case as a question about the meaning of the New\n\nBrunswick financial responsibility law.       At oral argument, the\n\n\n\n     2\n          In the district court, Wawanesa characterized the\nlanguage of the clause as \"clear and unambiguous\" and argued that\nBW's clause included no words of limitation that the policy applied\nonly after the first accident.\n\n                                -8-\n\fpanel asked questions about interpretation of the Out of State\n\nCoverage clause.    And logically, the question we have answered is\n\nthe prior one about the contractual language.    We have no need to\n\nreach the questions as to the meaning of New Brunswick law; we are\n\nparticularly disinclined to opine on foreign law when we do not\n\nneed to do so.     The principles of Maine law on which we rely are\n\nunexceptional and were briefed to the district court.\n\n                                II.\n\n          For these reasons, we reverse and order entry of judgment\n\nfor Wawanesa.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f</pre>",
