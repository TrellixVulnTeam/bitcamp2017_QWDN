For over a quarter of a century,\n\nthe hiring of firefighters in the City of Boston (the City) has\n\ntaken place in the albedo of a federal court consent decree\n\ndesigned to remedy the effects of past discrimination against\n\nAfrican-Americans    and   Hispanics.       On   April    11,    2001,   five\n\ncandidates for employment (the Candidates) brought suit in the\n\nfederal district court alleging that the City had discriminated\n\nagainst them on the basis of race when hiring new firefighters in\n\nthe fall of 2000.      The City defended its hiring practices as\n\ncompliant with, and compelled by, the terms of the consent decree.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in the defendants'\n\nfavor.   See Quinn v. City of Boston, 204 F. Supp. 2d 156 (D. Mass.\n\n2002).   The Candidates appeal.      For the reasons that follow, we\n\nreverse the judgment and remand to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           In   considering   an   appeal   from   a     grant   of   summary\n\njudgment, this court, like the trial court, normally will \"view the\n\nentire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing\n\nsummary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that\n\nparty's favor.\"   Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   Here, however, the facts upon which our decision turns are\n\nundisputed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f           In the early 1970s, two suits were brought against a\n\nnumber of municipalities subject to the Massachusetts Civil Service\n\nlaw (now codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, §§ 1-77).                  The suits\n\nalleged    that    the     municipalities     engaged     in     discriminatory\n\nrecruitment and hiring practices whilst staffing their respective\n\nfire departments.         These actions culminated in the entry of an\n\nomnibus consent decree that influenced the manner in which the\n\naffected   municipalities      could     recruit   and    hire      firefighters.\n\nBoston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher, 371 F. Supp. 507, 520-23\n\n(D. Mass. 1974) (Beecher I).           The decree was affirmed on appeal.\n\nBoston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher, 504 F.2d 1017, 1028 (1st\n\nCir. 1974) (Beecher II), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 910 (1975).                It has\n\nbeen in effect for nearly thirty years.\n\n           The Beecher decree — courts consistently have used that\n\nphrase to include the original decree and subsequent orders entered\n\nto fine-tune it, see, e.g., Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d\n\n1273,   1274   (1st   Cir.    1992),    and   we   emulate     that    example   —\n\ncircumscribed the hiring of firefighters in much of Massachusetts\n\nover the ensuing years.       Its history up to 1992 is well chronicled\n\nin the case law.      See, e.g., id. at 1274-75.          We urge readers who\n\nthirst for     a   more   complete     understanding     of   the    genesis   and\n\noperation of the decree to consult that opinion.                      For present\n\npurposes, we are content to note that the Beecher decree was\n\nintended to rectify a situation in which many fire departments\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fwithin Massachusetts had remained lily-white, or nearly so, despite\n\ndramatic    increases       in     the    African-American          and    Hispanic\n\npopulations.       The    decree    sought     to   accomplish       its   goal    by\n\naffirmative     action,   i.e.,     by    fostering    a    hiring    regime   that\n\naccorded race-based preferences to blacks and Spanish-surnamed\n\nindividuals.1      Id. at    1274    n.2.       Each   of     the   affected   fire\n\ndepartments was to remain subject to the strictures of the decree\n\n(and, thus, to accord race-based preferences) until such time as\n\nthat department met a general benchmark established by the decree:\n\nthe attainment of parity (or, at least, rough parity). See Beecher\n\nI, 371 F. Supp. at 523 (providing for release from the decree \"[a]s\n\na city or town achieves a complement of minorities commensurate\n\nwith the percentage of minorities within the community\").                         The\n\nmeaning of this criterion, and the manner in which it is to be\n\ngauged, are questions that have permeated this litigation from the\n\noutset.    Not surprisingly, those questions are central to the case\n\nat hand.\n\n            Unlike   some    forty-five        other   fire    departments     that\n\nheretofore have met the goals of the decree and gained release from\n\n\n\n     1\n      Throughout the litigation, the parties have used the term\n\"blacks\" as opposed to \"African-Americans.\"         For historical\ncoherence, we henceforth will adhere to that usage. For ease in\nreference, however, we elect to use the term \"Hispanics\" as a proxy\nfor the more cumbersome \"Spanish-surnamed individuals.\" Finally,\nwe use the words \"minority\" and \"minorities\" to refer to blacks and\nHispanics collectively, and the word \"non-minority\" to encompass\nall other persons.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fits constraints, the Boston Fire Department (BFD) has operated\n\nunder the auspices of the Beecher decree since 1974.                             A decade ago,\n\na     group   of     non-minority         men,       aspiring        to    appointments          as\n\nfirefighters within the BFD, endeavored to bring the City out from\n\nunder the umbrella of the decree.                     See Mackin, 969 F.2d at 1275.\n\nAlthough      we    affirmed      the     district         court's     rejection         of   that\n\nattempt, we noted that the decree was not meant to operate in\n\nperpetuity.         To the contrary, it would remain in force as to any\n\nparticular         municipality     only       until       its    stated     goal       had    been\n\nachieved.          Id. at 1278.           A decade has passed, but — despite\n\nincreased      diversity         within       the    BFD    —    the      City    still       hires\n\nfirefighters in accordance with the Beecher decree.\n\n              That brings us to the events giving rise to the instant\n\ncase. In 1998, the Candidates — Joseph Quinn, Sean O'Brien, Robert\n\nDillon, Joseph Sullivan, and Roger Kendrick, Jr. — aspired to\n\nfirefighter appointments in the BFD.                   All five are white males; as\n\nwas     required,         they    identified          themselves           as     non-minority\n\napplicants.          Each    took       the    firefighter         entrance           examination\n\nadministered         by     the     Massachusetts               Division         of    Personnel\n\nAdministration (MDPA) and scored ninety-nine out of a possible one\n\nhundred points.\n\n              The Candidates' scores satisfied the threshold criterion\n\nfor employment.           Along with all other qualifying applicants, they\n\nwere placed on a civil service eligibility list in rank order.\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fThis ranking made allowance for various statutory preferences\n\n(e.g., veterans, residents, children of firefighters killed or\n\ndisabled in the line of duty), ceding pride of place to the holders\n\nof such preferences in accordance with state law (even if those\n\npersons     had   earned    lower      test    scores     than   other      qualified\n\ncandidates).      See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, §§ 26, 40.              None of these\n\nstatutory preferences involve race or ethnicity, and none of them\n\nare challenged in this proceeding.\n\n            Preparing      to   hire     fifty    new   firefighters,        the   BFD\n\nrequested    a    certified     list     of    eligible      applicants     from   the\n\nMassachusetts Human Resources Division (HRD).                    The HRD selected\n\nindividuals in rank order (based on statutory preferences and test\n\nscores) and grouped them into a putative \"hiring class.\"                       After\n\nscreening out those individuals who stumbled over a variety of\n\nrace-neutral      preconditions        (such     as   drug    tests   and    physical\n\nexaminations), the HRD composed a slate of \"hiring pairs\" by\n\nplacing the highest ranking minority member and the highest ranking\n\nnon-minority member into a group of two and then repeating the\n\nprocess until the hiring class had been exhausted.\n\n             In November 2000, the BFD, following this rank order,\n\nchose twenty-five pairs from the eligibility list and appointed\n\nthose     fifty   individuals       as   entry-level         firefighters.2        The\n\n\n     2\n      The parties skirmish over both the construction of the\neligibility list and what deviations, if any, the BFD entertained\nfrom it. Although these disputes ultimately may prove material in\n\n                                         -6-\n\fCandidates were not among those selected.          Although each received\n\na letter from the BFD stating that the vacancies had been filled by\n\npersons who outranked him on the certification list, the record\n\nsuggests that, had the BFD followed a strict rank-order selection\n\nprocess (without any consideration of race or ethnicity), the\n\nCandidates (or some of them) likely would have been in the top\n\nfifty.\n\n            The Candidates (other than Kendrick, who joined the\n\nlitigation at a later date) then sued the City.            They argued that\n\nthe City impermissibly had used preferences based on race and\n\nethnicity to rank minorities ahead of them on the eligibility list.\n\nIn   the   Candidates'   view,   this      constituted   discrimination    in\n\nviolation    of   the   Fourteenth   Amendment     to    the   United   States\n\nConstitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (count 1), Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n151B, § 4 (count 2), and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (count 3).              The\n\nCandidates also attacked another aspect of the hiring process; they\n\nargued that requiring them to submit to medical examinations\n\nwithout a conditional offer of employment violated both federal and\n\nstate law (counts 4-6).3     The district court granted the motion of\n\n\n\n\naddressing the relief to which the Candidates may be entitled, see\ninfra Part III(E), we leave them unresolved for purposes of this\nappeal.\n      3\n      These counts are not in issue on this appeal, see infra Part\nII, and we therefore omit any detailed discussion of them.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe Boston Chapter of the NAACP to intervene as a party defendant.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 24.\n\n            The Candidates moved for summary judgment on the first\n\nthree counts of their complaint or, in the alternative, for a\n\npreliminary injunction forbidding the City from filling at least\n\nfive firefighter positions pending a resolution of the action.\n\nThey maintained, among other things, that the City should not have\n\napplied the Beecher decree to the November 2000 hiring cycle\n\nbecause,    by   that   time,   the   City     had   achieved     parity   in    the\n\nfirefighter force (and, therefore, had met the benchmark for\n\nrelease from the strictures of the decree). The defendants did not\n\ncontrovert the material facts, but, rather, opposed this motion as\n\na matter of law and cross-moved for summary judgment. The district\n\ncourt denied the Candidates' motion and granted summary judgment\n\nfor the defendants on counts 1 through 3.                This appeal followed.\n\nCounts 4 through 6 remain pending before the district court.\n\nII.   APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n            It is too familiar a proposition to require citation of\n\nauthority that a federal court may not act beyond the scope of its\n\njurisdiction.       As a logical corollary, parties cannot confer\n\nsubject    matter   jurisdiction      on   a   federal    court    by   waiver    or\n\nconsent.    See Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 767-68 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nConsequently, when a court senses a potential lack of subject\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fmatter jurisdiction, it ought to inquire further regardless of\n\nwhether the parties have raised the issue.          BIW Deceived v. Local\n\nS6, 132 F.3d 824, 828 (1st Cir. 1997).            We must conduct such an\n\ninquiry here.\n\n           In the usual case, an appeal must await the entry of a\n\nfinal judgment, commonly regarded as a judgment that fully disposes\n\nof all claims asserted in the action.        See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.\n\nGen. Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 8 (1980); Spiegel v. Trustees of Tufts\n\nColl., 843 F.2d 38, 42 (1st Cir. 1988); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nThere are, however, exceptions to the classic final judgment rule.\n\nOne such exception, embodied in Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, allows the immediate entry of a partial final\n\njudgment as to fewer than all the claims in a multi-claim action\n\n\"upon an express determination that there is no just reason for\n\ndelay.\"    The district court made such a determination here and\n\ndirected that a separate and final judgment enter as to counts 1\n\nthrough 3.\n\n             Despite this explicit direction, a jurisdictional problem\n\nlooms.    The law is firmly established in this circuit that a rote\n\nrecital of Rule 54(b)'s talismanic phrase is not enough, in and of\n\nitself, to trump the wonted application of the final judgment rule.\n\nSee Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 42 (endorsing the \"long-settled and\n\nprudential     policy   against    the   scattershot       disposition   of\n\nlitigation\").      To   warrant   recourse   to    the   special   procedure\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fenvisioned by Rule 54(b), the district court typically must make an\n\nindividualized assessment of the desirability and effect of an\n\nimmediate appeal.       Id. at 42-43.    Thus, if a district court wishes\n\nto enter a partial final judgment on the ground that there is no\n\njust reason for delay, it should not only make that explicit\n\ndetermination but should also make specific findings and set forth\n\nits reasoning.     See id.\n\n          We have warned that the parties have an obligation to\n\nbring this requirement to the district court's attention.               See id.\n\nat 44 n.5.     In this instance, the parties did not fulfill this\n\nobligation, and the court neither made the requisite findings nor\n\nexplicated the reasons underlying its Rule 54(b) certification.\n\n          Although       this   deviation      from    preferred   practice    is\n\ntroubling, it is not necessarily fatal.               We have noted that there\n\nare \"infrequent instances\" in which the record, on its face, makes\n\nit sufficiently apparent that the circumstances support an appeal\n\nfrom a partial judgment.        Id. at 43 n.4.         This is such a case.\n\n          Counts    1    through   3    of    the   complaint   deal   with   the\n\nobligations and protections afforded by the Beecher decree.                    In\n\ncontrast, counts 4 through 6 have very little to do with the decree\n\n(and nothing to do with race or ethnicity).               Moreover, one of the\n\nprincipal parties — the NAACP — has no knowledge about (and, for\n\naught that appears, no interest in) the claims still pending in the\n\nlower court.   Given the discrete nature of the two sets of claims,\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fthe summary judgment decision appears to be \"final in the sense\n\nthat it is an ultimate disposition of . . . individual claim[s]\n\nentered in the course of a multiple claims action.\"                         Curtiss-\n\nWright, 446 U.S. at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              Equally as important, the proof needed to establish the\n\nallegations of counts 1 through 3 is materially different from the\n\nproof needed to establish the allegations of counts 4 through 6.\n\nBy the same token, the legal issues are separate and distinct.\n\nMoreover, if the Candidates prevail on one or more of the first\n\nthree counts and obtain satisfactory relief, counts 4 through 6 may\n\nwell be rendered moot.           This concatenation of circumstances means\n\nthat, in all probability, there will be no significant duplication\n\nof effort in litigating one set of claims to a conclusion and then\n\naddressing the remaining set of claims.                 Such a lack of overlap\n\nstrongly supports the finding of no just reason for delay (and,\n\nthus, the entry of a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b)).\n\nSee, e.g., Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 580\n\n(1st Cir. 1994); Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34,\n\n40 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n              The most important factor counseling in favor of allowing\n\nan immediate appeal in this case is the public interest.                          As a\n\npractical matter, a final resolution of the issues raised in counts\n\n1   through    3   will   have    a   broad    impact   on   the   future    of    all\n\napplicants for firefighter positions in the City of Boston.                       This\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fis a vital concern, as hiring is ongoing.       The district court\n\nrecognized this consideration when it agreed to render an expedited\n\ndecision on counts 1 through 3.   See Quinn, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 157\n\nn.3.   In short, the nature of the issue calls out for immediate\n\nresolution:   time is of the essence if for no other reason than\n\nthat race-based hiring preferences inevitably shift some of the\n\nburden of remediation to innocent persons, Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of\n\nEduc., 476 U.S. 267, 280-81 (1986) (plurality op.), and thus should\n\nnot remain in place for any longer than necessary to alleviate the\n\neffects of past discrimination.   See Regents of the Univ. of Cal.\n\nv. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 308 (1978) (plurality op.) (cautioning that\n\nsuch \"remedial action [must] . . . work the least harm possible\").\n\n          To sum up, the \"findings\" requirement that we have\n\nsuperimposed on Rule 54(b) is important, but it is not to be\n\napplied woodenly.   When the record and the interests of justice\n\npermit, we have on occasion relaxed the requirement.    See, e.g.,\n\nMaldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 580-81; Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 40.\n\nGiven the factors enumerated above — especially the substantial\n\npublic interest that attaches to an expeditious resolution of\n\nwhether the Beecher decree should continue to constrain the BFD's\n\nhiring practices — we conclude that this is one of the rare cases\n\nin which, despite the absence of detailed district court findings,\n\nthe conditions for the use of Rule 54(b) effectively have been met.\n\nAccordingly, we have jurisdiction over the Candidates' appeal.\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Having assumed jurisdiction, we turn to the merits of the\n\nappeal.   We divide our discussion into five segments.     First, we\n\nframe the issue.   We next describe how a court is to assess whether\n\nthe release point of the Beecher decree — parity — has been\n\nachieved, outlining the required comparison and delineating how to\n\narrive at its component parts.         Then, we do the mathematics.\n\nFinally, we address the question of relief.\n\n                       A.   Framing the Issue.\n\n           Parity (or, at least, rough parity) is the key that\n\nunlocks the restrictions of the Beecher decree as to a particular\n\ncommunity.   The central issue in this appeal involves how parity\n\nshould be calculated for that purpose.     The parties agree that the\n\nrelevant time frame is November of 2000.       They also agree as to\n\nwhat sources of data are appropriate for use in this context; all\n\nparties accept the City's breakdown of the BFD's complement as of\n\nthe relevant dates and cite data derived from the 2000 census to\n\nestablish the appropriate labor pool.        Their dispute revolves\n\naround what categories of this data govern the measurement of\n\nparity.   The controlling algorithm has two components.   One (which\n\nwe shall call the first variable) relates to how one measures\n\nminority penetration within a particular fire department.        The\n\nother (which we shall call the second variable) relates to how one\n\nmeasures minority representation in the community as a whole.\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f             As to these points, the Candidates argue that, under the\n\nBeecher decree,      the   first    variable    should   be    limited   to   the\n\npercentage of firefighters in the BFD (not including officers).\n\nThis should be compared to the second variable, which they envision\n\nas the percentage of minorities in the City's employment-eligible\n\npopulation. On the other hand, the City and the intervenor contend\n\nthat   the   first   variable      should   represent    the    percentage     of\n\nminorities in the BFD as a whole (including officers) and that the\n\nsecond variable should comprise the percentage of minorities in\n\nBoston's overall population.\n\n             The district court concluded that the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis dictated the composition of both variables. In the court's\n\nview, that doctrine required measuring parity by comparing the\n\npercentage of minorities in all ranks within the BFD to the\n\npercentage of minorities in the City's overall population.               Quinn,\n\n204 F. Supp. 2d at 161 (accusing the Candidates of \"us[ing] a\n\ndifferent statistical method than the one used in the Beecher\n\ndecree\"). Since this calculation did not show that parity had been\n\nattained — the percentage of minorities within the BFD, including\n\nall ranks, was 31.5%, whereas the percentage of minorities in the\n\noverall population was slightly over 38% — the court granted the\n\nCity's motion for summary judgment.            Id. at 163.\n\n             We address the nature of the two variables in the next\n\ntwo sections of this opinion.         Before doing so, however, we pause\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fto mention two sets of legal principles.                    First, because this\n\nlitigation   challenges    a    judicial      decree       affording    race-based\n\nrelief, any interpretation of the decree or any application of it\n\nin   practice   must     survive      strict       scrutiny.        See     Adarand\n\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 235 (1995) (\"Federal\n\nracial classifications,        like   those       of   a   State,   must    serve   a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored to\n\nfurther that interest.\"); Stuart v. Roache, 951 F.2d 446, 449 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (concluding that all race-based classifications must\n\npass strict scrutiny). This standard obliges an inquiring court to\n\nmake a binary finding that the race-based relief is not only\n\njustified by a compelling governmental purpose but also narrowly\n\ndrawn to fit the contours of that purpose.                  Mackin, 969 F.2d at\n\n1275; Stuart, 951 F.2d at 449.\n\n           Second, the district court ruled at the summary judgment\n\nstage.   The role of summary judgment is to pierce the boilerplate\n\nof the pleadings and provide a means for prompt disposition of\n\ncases in which no trialworthy issue exists.                See Suarez v. Pueblo\n\nInt'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2000).                This device should\n\nbe employed only when the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories,   and    admissions         on    file,     together      with   the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).             We review an order\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fgranting summary judgment de novo.       Suarez, 229 F.3d at 53.    This\n\nnon-deferential review is particularly appropriate where, as here,\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment is based on its\n\napplication    of   abstract   principles    of    law   to   essentially\n\nuncontradicted facts.    See Plumley v. S. Container, Inc., 303 F.3d\n\n364, 369 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                        B.   The First Variable.\n\n          The district court concluded that the first variable to\n\nbe used for measuring parity under the Beecher decree was the\n\npercentage of minority firefighters in the BFD as a whole.           The\n\ncourt did not reach this conclusion through independent analysis,\n\nbut, rather, premised it on the assumption that this issue had been\n\nfully litigated and settled in earlier proceedings. See Quinn, 204\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 162.     Although we appreciate the district court's\n\nsensitivity to the role of precedent, an examination of the prior\n\ndecisions touching upon the Beecher decree refutes the court's\n\nassumption.\n\n          To the extent that the Beecher I court compared relative\n\nracial representation using quantitative data, it did so only to\n\ndetermine proper placement of the burden of proof as to what\n\ndiscriminatory effects could be attributed to the defendants'\n\npreexisting recruitment and hiring practices.       See 371 F. Supp. at\n\n514, 518-20.   Thus, Beecher I did not mandate a particular parity-\n\nmeasuring formula for future use. That omission is understandable:\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fthe minuscule number of minorities in the affected fire departments\n\nat the time of the original Beecher decree negated any need for\n\nprecise   definition   of   how   to     measure   anticipated   minority\n\npenetration.4\n\n          This court's initial affirmance of the Beecher decree is\n\nunhelpful on this point.    In resolving that appeal, we stated that\n\nthe Beecher decree would \"remain[] in force, for each local fire\n\ndepartment, until that department attains sufficient minority fire\n\nfighters to have a percentage on the force approximately equal to\n\nthe percentage of minorities in the locality,\"           Beecher II, 504\n\nF.2d at 1027.    This statement begs the question of who is a\n\n\"firefighter.\"\n\n          Our subsequent opinion in Mackin likewise left open the\n\nissue of how to measure parity.        That case rejected an argument\n\nthat the second variable was the racial composition of the City as\n\nit existed in 1974 (when the Beecher decree was first entered).\n\nMackin, 969 F.2d at 1276.     We disposed of that argument without\n\nruling on the significance of the figures presented vis-à-vis the\n\ncomposition of the first variable.         See id.     Elsewhere in that\n\nopinion, we addressed an overbreadth challenge and held that the\n\ndecree continued to survive strict scrutiny.         Id. at 1278.   In the\n\nprocess, we cited the language of the decree itself as an indicium\n\n\n     4\n      By way of illustration, the BFD had a minority complement at\nthe time of less than 1%, while Boston had a minority population of\napproximately 23%. Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 514.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fof its limited life.     See id. (acknowledging that the decree would\n\n\"remain[] in force only until its requirements have been met\").\n\nSeen in this light, any elliptical references in Mackin as to how\n\nparity might be measured cannot be deemed a holding.\n\n           Our   determination   that    the   district    court   erred   in\n\nconcluding that stare decisis supplies an answer to the question of\n\nhow the first variable should be constructed brings us back to\n\nsquare one.      While we recognize that \"district courts enforcing\n\npublic law consent decrees have, in general, broad discretion in\n\ndetermining such matters as whether the objectives of the decree\n\nhave been substantially achieved,\" Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-\n\nColon, 951 F.2d 1325, 1337 (1st Cir. 1991), the court below did not\n\nexercise   any    such   discretion.       Instead,       it   offered     its\n\ninterpretation of judicial precedents dealing with the Beecher\n\ndecree.    Having found that interpretation wanting, we owe no\n\nparticular deference to the district court's conclusion.                   See\n\nWessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790, 795 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           If a district court's adjudication of a public sector\n\nconsent decree does not warrant deference, \"[o]rdinary contract\n\nprinciples apply\" to the same extent as they apply to other consent\n\ndecrees. Navarro-Ayala, 951 F.2d at 1339. This is especially true\n\nwhen, as now, the question involves determining the parties'\n\noriginal intent and, concomitantly, the scope of the arrangement to\n\n\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fwhich they initially consented.5             Id.     \"Parties to a consent decree\n\nare entitled to know that . . . [it] will not be treated as a mere\n\nentering wedge which . . . gives a district court untrammeled\n\ndiscretion     to     increase\"      the     depth    and    breadth    of   judicial\n\nsupervision.        Id. at 1339 n.17.\n\n          Against this backdrop, we turn to the parties' competing\n\ninterpretations of the term \"firefighter.\" As said, the Candidates\n\nview that term as encompassing only the lowest rank, that is,\n\nentry-level    members       of   the      BFD.6     In     contradistinction,     the\n\ndefendants    view     the    term      as   encompassing       all    uniformed   BFD\n\npersonnel, including officers.                 In the abstract, it may seem\n\npossible to stretch the term \"firefighter\" to fit the defendants'\n\nvision — but this case does not deal with abstractions.                      Terms in\n\na consent decree cannot be construed in a vacuum; they must instead\n\n\n     5\n      Our dissenting colleague chastises us for giving the\nCandidates too much credit. He says that the Candidates do not\nargue that the parties' original intent encompassed only the entry-\nlevel rank. That is literally true, but it overlooks the fact that\nthe Candidates place the scope of the decree squarely at issue and\nargue    that   constitutional    principles   require    such   an\ninterpretation. To address that argument, our analysis necessarily\nbegins with a \"determination of the parties' intent when they\nentered into the stipulation.\" Navarro-Ayala, 951 F.2d at 1339.\n     6\n      Throughout, all references to \"entry-level\" positions should\nbe understood to mean post-probationary non-officer positions.\nThis qualification is compelled by explicit language in the Beecher\ndecree enjoining \"further certifications of permanent appointments\n. . . to the position of firefighter\" until certain requirements of\nthe decree are met.     Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 521 (emphasis\nsupplied). That reference is reinforced by language in the decree\nthat differentiates between permanent and provisional appointments.\nId.\n\n                                           -19-\n\fbe read in the context of the decree as a whole.   See Newport Plaza\n\nAssocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank, 985 F.2d 640, 646 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); see generally 5 Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts §\n\n24.21, at 204 (Joseph M. Perillo rev. ed. 1998).    From that coign\n\nof vantage, the Candidates' definition is much more compelling.\n\n          The litigation underlying the Beecher decree arose out of\n\ndiscriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring into entry-level\n\npositions.   See Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 509 (describing the\n\nfocal point of the case as the municipalities' \"overall hiring\n\npolicies for the position of firefighter\").   Consistent with this\n\nfocus, the district court made specific findings of discriminatory\n\npractices in recruitment and hiring, and the decree was tailored to\n\ncounteract the effects of that discrimination.     Id. at 520.   This\n\nhistorical perspective sheds considerable light on the meaning of\n\nthe term \"firefighter\" as used in the Beecher decree.    Logically,\n\nthe parties must have intended that term to refer to the class of\n\njobs open to external hiring:   entry-level firefighter positions.\n\nSee Fleet Nat'l Bank v. H&D Entm't, Inc., 96 F.3d 532, 539 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (interpreting terms of a settlement agreement in light\n\nof the aim of the litigants at the time of settlement); see\n\ngenerally 5 Corbin, supra § 24.20, at 193.    Only by interpreting\n\nthe term \"firefighter\" in that manner is it possible to harmonize\n\nthe wording of the decree with its evident purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f             Other language in the decree supports this reading.          The\n\ndecree's first paragraph zeroes in on entry-level positions:               it\n\nenjoins activities that \"discriminat[e] against any applicant or\n\npotential applicant for employment.\"            Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at\n\n521.   The decree purports to regulate the recruiting, certifying,\n\nand appointing of entry-level personnel and specifically refers to\n\nthis three-part process as the \"hiring procedure.\" See id. at 522.\n\nSubsequent amendments, such as the interim consent decrees entered\n\non April 17, 1975, and November 25, 1975, continue this emphasis on\n\nrecruitment and hiring for entry-level positions.\n\n             Custom and usage within an affected industry or workplace\n\ncan be important aids to the construction of a contract or consent\n\ndecree.      See, e.g., Boston Police Superior Officers Fed'n v. City\n\nof Boston, 147 F.3d 13, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1998) (interpreting terms\n\nwith otherwise broad usage narrowly according to usage within the\n\nrelevant profession); Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disab. Plan,\n\n70 F.3d 173, 179 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that \"usages of trade\" are\n\nrelevant to interpreting terms of a contract).          Here, the usage of\n\nthe    BFD    supports   the    Candidates'     definition   of    the   term\n\n\"firefighter.\"\n\n              In the court below, the evidence showing the composition\n\nof the BFD differentiated the various ranks by specific title.\n\nThese records consistently referred to the entry-level rank as\n\n\"Firefighter\"      (sometimes   written    as   \"Fire   Fighter\"   or    \"Fire\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\ffighter\").     Corresponding to that term, the evidence showed the\n\nnumber of persons serving in the entry-level rank, broken down by\n\nrace and ethnicity.        That evidence referred to the other ranks —\n\nthe officers — by such titles as \"Fire Lieutenant,\" \"Fire Captain,\"\n\nand \"District Fire Chief,\" giving the racial and ethnic composition\n\nof each such rank.      This indicates that, within the BFD, the term\n\n\"firefighter\" carries with it specific duties, responsibilities,\n\npay, and privileges.\n\n             Lexigraphic      insights         are    frequently          helpful     in\n\ndetermining the meaning of specific words in consent decrees. See,\n\ne.g., Guilday v. Dubois, 124 F.3d 277, 285-86 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nHere, the mine-run of dictionary definitions tends to support the\n\nCandidates' version of the disputed term. A firefighter is said to\n\nbe   \"one   who   fights   fires    as    a     member     of   a    municipal      fire\n\ndepartment,\"      Webster's    Third     New    Int'l      Dictionary      855   (1993)\n\n(internal dictionary symbols omitted), or \"a person who fights\n\ndestructive fires,\" Random House Dictionary of the English Language\n\n722 (2d ed. 1987), or, simply, \"a person who fights fires,\"\n\nMerriam-Webster      On-Line    Dictionary           (2002),    at    http://www.m-\n\nw.com/home.htm.        These    definitions           uniformly      emphasize       the\n\nprincipal activity that firefighters perform.                       They show quite\n\nclearly that the term \"firefighter,\" in its ordinary sense, applies\n\nmore naturally to those whose exclusive province is attempting to\n\nextinguish    conflagrations       as    opposed      to    those    in    the   higher\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fechelons (who must handle a broader and more diversified range of\n\nactivities, including administration and supervision).               While the\n\ndictionary definitions of \"firefighter\" do not necessarily exclude\n\nthose whom the defendants seek to include, they argue persuasively\n\nagainst their inclusion.\n\n              Our case law also militates against including higher\n\nranks under the appellation \"firefighter.\"             For example, in Boston\n\nPolice Superior Officers, 147 F.3d at 17-18, we held that the term\n\n\"police officers\" used in a consent decree governing promotions\n\nwithin the Boston Police Department did not include all police\n\nofficers, but, rather, encompassed only patrolmen. That case, like\n\nthis   one,    illustrates   the    importance    of    honoring    contextual\n\nconstraints that may be placed on a word or phrase within the four\n\ncorners of a consent decree.\n\n              Last — but far from least — including higher ranks within\n\nthe compass of the term \"firefighter\" would mean that the Beecher\n\ndecree was not narrowly tailored to serve its stated purpose. Such\n\nan   interpretation     would   effectively      transform     an   instrument\n\ncarefully crafted to eliminate discrimination in recruitment and\n\nhiring into general leverage favoring minorities in a much wider\n\nvariety of matters.      In most of those areas — promotion is a good\n\nexample — no justification for systematic preferential treatment of\n\nminorities has been established.            Thus, the transformation that\n\nnecessarily     would   accompany   an   acceptance      of   the   defendants'\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\finterpretive gloss would present an insurmountable constitutional\n\nobstacle. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307.            Because courts should avoid\n\nconstruing a consent decree in a constitutionally offensive way if\n\na   feasible     alternative       construction      exists,        this     looming\n\nconstitutional quandary is itself a cogent argument for rejecting\n\nthe defendants' expansive view of the term \"firefighter.\"                         Cf.\n\nWalsh v. Schlecht, 429 U.S. 401, 408 (1977) (\"[C]ontracts should\n\nnot be interpreted to render them illegal and unenforceable where\n\nthe wording lends itself to a logically acceptable construction\n\nthat renders them legal and enforceable.\").\n\n           The   opposite    pan    of    the   scale    contains     nothing      of\n\nsufficient weight to counterbalance this powerful asseverational\n\narray.     Insofar    as    we   can     discern,    interpreting          the   word\n\n\"firefighter\" to include higher ranks has no basis in the record.\n\nThe decree is utterly silent as to activities affecting higher\n\nranks,   and   the   remainder     of    the    record   —   both    current      and\n\nhistorical — is devoid of any allegation or finding that the BFD\n\nhas ever discriminated against minorities in promotions or in other\n\npersonnel practices involving those in (or aspiring to reach) the\n\nhigher ranks.     Indeed, the original Beecher plaintiffs would not\n\nhave had standing to allege discrimination in such respects.7\n\n\n     7\n      Beecher was a consolidated set of class actions in which the\ndistrict court certified two classes. The first class consisted of\n\"[a]ll black or Spanish-surnamed persons who have applied for the\nposition of firefighter in any fire department . . . subject to\nMassachusetts Civil Service law, but have not become eligible for\n\n                                        -24-\n\fTaking these facts into account, it unfairly belittles the Beecher\n\ncourt to read \"firefighter\" as that term is used in the decree to\n\ninclude    all   ranks    (and,   thus,   to   impute    to    the    court   the\n\ninjudicious crafting of a remedy that reaches beyond the scope of\n\nthe surrounding litigation).\n\n            The defendants, ably represented, nonetheless advance a\n\nplethora    of   counter-arguments.        Only   four    of     them    require\n\ndiscussion.\n\n            First, the City and the intervenor point to paragraph 11\n\nof the interim consent decree of November 25, 1975.               That proviso\n\nrequires a municipality seeking to be released from the decree to\n\npetition the MDPA, informing that agency \"that the percentage of\n\npost-probationary        minority   uniformed     personnel          equals   the\n\npercentage of minorities\" in that municipality.               We do not believe\n\nthat this casual (and wholly unexplained) linguistic switch from\n\n\"firefighter\" to \"uniformed personnel\" can be accorded decretory\n\nsignificance.    This is especially so in light of two facts.             First,\n\nthat same proviso incorporates by reference paragraph 7 of the\n\nApril 17, 1975 interim consent decree (which opens the way for\n\nrelease from the decree \"whenever a particular city or town has\n\n\n\nappointment under existing requirements.\" Beecher I, 371 F. Supp.\nat 510. The other class included \"[a]ll black or Spanish-surnamed\npersons who have never applied for the position of firefighter\nbecause they have allegedly been deprived of information concerning\nfirefighter employment opportunities as a result of the allegedly\ndiscriminatory recruitment practices of the defendants.\" Id.\n\n                                    -25-\n\fachieved a complement of Black or Spanish-surnamed firefighters\n\ncommensurate      with    the     percentage     of   minorities     within          the\n\ncommunity\").     Second, the preamble to the November 25 decree — the\n\ndecree which introduced the term \"uniformed personnel\" into the\n\nlitigation — unequivocally declared that \"the parties consent to\n\nentry of this Agreement to permit . . . the establishment of an\n\neligibility     list     for    the   position   of    firefighter      .    .   .    .\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied).           In the final analysis, then, the phrase upon\n\nwhich the defendants rely leads us back to our starting point.\n\n              We add, moreover, that if the phraseology employed in the\n\nNovember 25, 1975 decree was intended to clarify that the earlier\n\ndecrees affected more than the firefighter rank, it seems highly\n\nlikely that the Beecher court would have used more precise language\n\nsuch as \"of all ranks\" or \"of any rank.\"                But the Beecher court\n\neschewed such language.           What is more, the court demonstrated an\n\ninclination to use general descriptors for specific subject matter.\n\nSee Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 523 (using the general phrase\n\n\"complement of minorities\" to refer to the specific minority\n\n\"[g]roup of all eligible blacks and Spanish-surnamed persons\"). In\n\nour   view,    this    proclivity     undermines      the   inference       that     the\n\ndefendants (and the dissent) seek to draw from the phrase \"post-\n\nprobationary uniformed personnel.\"\n\n              Before leaving this point, we note that our dissenting\n\ncolleague sees \"no basis for concluding that 'firefighter' is the\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\foperative word\" in the Beecher decree and the two interim decrees\n\nthat followed.    Yet that word appears no fewer than twenty-six\n\ntimes in those decrees, while the term \"uniformed personnel\"\n\nappears only once. This repeated emphasis, especially when coupled\n\nwith the fact that the litigation revolved around the position of\n\nfirefighter and did not concern other ranks, makes it perfectly\n\nclear that \"firefighter\" is indeed the operative term.\n\n          Next, the defendants strive to convince us that we should\n\ndefer to a 1987 memorandum issued by the MDPA, which indicates\n\nthat, for Beecher purposes, the first variable should consist of\n\n\"the actual percentage of the authorized uniformed permanent full-\n\ntime force which is made up of tenured Black or Hispanic officers\n\nof any rank.\"    We are not persuaded.\n\n          The    deference   typically   owed   by   a   court   to   an\n\nadministrative agency derives from the fact that the agency has\n\nbeen entrusted by a legislative body to administer a statute\n\nenacted under that branch's separate constitutional authority. See\n\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n\n837, 842-44 (1984); see also Fireside Nissan, Inc. v. Fanning, 30\n\nF.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir. 1994) (reasoning that state officials'\n\ninterpretation of state statute is entitled to deference).       If the\n\nlegislative branch has \"left a gap for the agency to fill, there is\n\nan express delegation of authority.\"     Chevron, 487 U.S. at 843-44.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fThus, a court must defer to the agency's reasonable construction of\n\na provision in the statute.            Id. at 844.\n\n            Here, however, a state agency is helping to administer\n\ncompliance not with a legislative enactment but with a federal\n\njudicial decree.          A federal appellate court owes no deference to\n\nsuch   an   agency    when     endeavoring         to       discern    the    meaning     and\n\nconstitutional       limits    of    such     a    decree.        After       all,   if   the\n\njudiciary    is    the     final    arbiter       as    to   questions        of   statutory\n\nconstruction        and      must     refuse           to     accept      administrative\n\ninterpretations that contradict clearly ascertainable legislative\n\nintent, see id. at 843 n.9, courts certainly have the power —\n\nindeed, the duty — to reject an administrative construction that\n\nruns contrary to the manifest intent of a judicial decree.\n\n            Third, the defendants posit a variation on the \"trickle\n\nup\" theory.        See, e.g., Stuart, 951 F.2d at 452 (\"One obvious\n\nreason . . . why there may have been few black sergeants in the\n\nBoston Police Force in 1978 is that the Department had not hired\n\nmany   black      police    officers    before          1970.         Since    unjustified\n\ndiscrimination accounted for the latter fact, [it] cannot excuse\n\nthe former.\").       They assert that not including higher ranks within\n\nthe term \"firefighter\" would diminish the efficacy of the decree\n\nand reward appointing authorities for keeping minorities in the\n\nfirefighter rank (thus perpetuating underrepresentation in the\n\nhigher echelons).          For that reason, they argue, it makes sense to\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\frequire parity department-wide before allowing a community to\n\nescape from the constraints imposed by the Beecher decree.\n\n             This argument is specious.              We have determined, and the\n\ndefendants concede, that the parties never intended the decree to\n\naddress promotions.       On that basis alone, it would be improper to\n\nextend the decree's reach by judicial fiat.                    See Boston Police\n\nSuperior Officers, 147 F.3d at 17-18.                 Furthermore, alleging that\n\nunconstitutional hiring practices within the BFD have caused a\n\ndisparate impact on the number of minorities in the higher echelons\n\nis a heavy charge.        Such an allegation should not be addressed in\n\nthe abstract, but, rather, should be squarely propounded by an\n\ninjured   party    with    standing     to     sue    and   litigated   to   a    just\n\nconclusion.     Because the litigation giving rise to the Beecher\n\ndecree is of a different nature than the justification that the\n\ndefendants now offer, the decree is a constitutionally insufficient\n\nvehicle for addressing that justification. See id. at 18; see also\n\nWessmann, 160 F.3d at 802 (\"The mere fact that an institution once\n\nwas found to have practiced discrimination is insufficient, in and\n\nof itself, to satisfy a state actor's burden of producing the\n\nreliable evidence required to uphold race-based action.\").\n\n             Finally, the City and the intervenor make an argument of\n\nlast resort.      They contend that their interpretation of the term\n\n\"firefighter\" is proper because they have assumed all along that\n\nthe   term   embraced     more   than    entry-level        personnel.       In   the\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fcircumstances of this case, such a contention does not get them\n\nvery far.\n\n                 In pressing this point, the defendants lean heavily upon\n\npast practice of the MDPA and attempt to apply language derived\n\nfrom Mackin to that practice. There, we rejected the argument that\n\nstatic     1974     population          figures   controlled     the   measurement        of\n\nparity.          In so doing, we wrote that \"[f]ew things evidence a\n\ndecree's meaning more persuasively than an immutable, decade-old\n\npattern of past practice under the decree, consensually engaged in\n\nby   all    sides     in    the    underlying       litigation    that    produced       the\n\ndecree.\"         969 F.2d at 1276.\n\n                 That language is inapposite here.               In Mackin, we were\n\nusing a uniformly accepted past practice to validate a facially\n\nplausible interpretation of the Beecher decree (i.e., that current\n\npopulation figures would control).                   See id.     We deemed that past\n\npractice confirmatory of what appeared to be a commonsense reading\n\nof the verbiage chosen by the parties and approved by the district\n\ncourt.       In     contrast,      the     defendants    here    attempt    to     use    an\n\nadministrative practice first inaugurated in 1987 (thirteen years\n\nafter      the    entry     of    the    Beecher    decree),     and   never      directly\n\nchallenged, to change the meaning of plain language and thus to\n\nvalidate an unlikely interpretation that is implausible in the\n\ncontext of         the     underlying      litigation    (and    one     which,    in    the\n\nbargain, would open the decree to constitutional attack).                           To the\n\n\n                                             -30-\n\fextent that the MDPA's past practice points toward that suggested\n\ninterpretation,    it    lacks   record    support    and   therefore     cannot\n\ndominate the decisional calculus.          See Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 802;\n\nStuart, 951 F.2d at 454-55.\n\n           To dwell on this issue would be pointless.             It suffices\n\nto say that the history and purpose of the litigation, the language\n\nof the decree, and the usage of the BFD make manifest that the term\n\n\"firefighter,\" as used in the Beecher decree, was intended to\n\ninclude   only   those   persons   serving    in     the    entry-level    rank.\n\nInterpreting \"firefighter\" more broadly would rip the decree from\n\nits constitutional moorings, twist its language into something\n\nalien to its evident purpose, and violate settled principles of\n\ncontract law.     Accordingly, the proper parity-measuring device —\n\nwhat we have called the first variable — comprises the percentage\n\nof minorities in the entry-level rank of the BFD as of the relevant\n\ndate (November of 2000).\n\n                         C.   The Second Variable.\n\n           As for the comparison that Beecher demands — the second\n\nvariable — the Candidates, citing cases decided after the entry of\n\nthe original Beecher decree, assert that in affirmative action\n\nemployment cases minority representation must be measured against\n\nthe specific adult population that comprises the qualified labor\n\npool.   See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 501-\n\n02 (1989); Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n v. EEOC,\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f478 U.S. 421, 479 (1986); Stuart, 951 F.2d at 450, 453-54.      They\n\ninsist that any other focus would be unconstitutional and that,\n\ntherefore, the relevant comparison in this case necessarily must be\n\nto Boston's over-19 black and Hispanic population.     See Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 31, § 58 (requiring firefighters to be over 19 years of\n\nage).8\n\n          The district court held that this point previously had\n\nbeen resolved.   Quinn, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 163.   We agree that stare\n\ndecisis governs. The last time around, we addressed this aspect of\n\nthe standard for measuring compliance head-on and held that the\n\nproper data are the \"contemporaneous population figures [for] . .\n\n. 'the percentage of minorities within the community.'\"      Mackin,\n\n969 F.2d at 1276 (quoting the Beecher decree).      At that time, we\n\nconsidered the very authorities upon which the Candidates now rely\n\nand specifically repudiated the notion that the pertinent language\n\nof the decree was overbroad.   Id. at 1277-78.    Thus, principles of\n\nstare decisis required the district court to reject the Candidates'\n\nversion of how the second variable should be constructed.        See\n\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 854 (1992) (recognizing\n\nthat the doctrine of stare decisis embodies \"[t]he obligation to\n\nfollow precedent\").\n\n\n\n     8\n      This statute currently imposes an upper age limit (32) for\nnew firefighters. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, § 58. Because no\nmaximum age applied to the November 2000 hiring cycle, we do not\ndwell on this feature.\n\n                                -32-\n\f          If more were needed — and we do not think that it is — we\n\nnote that the Beecher decree unambiguously requires the use of the\n\npercentage of minorities in the general population as the second\n\nvariable for gauging discriminatory patterns in entry-level hiring.\n\nSee Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 523; see also Mackin, 969 F.2d at\n\n1276 (enumerating portions of the Beecher decree that require, or\n\nplainly contemplate, reference to the percentage of minorities in\n\nthe general population). That requirement is fully consistent with\n\nthe authorities cited by the Candidates.      See Croson, 488 U.S. at\n\n501 (\"In the employment context, we have recognized that for\n\ncertain   entry   level    positions    requiring   minimal   training,\n\nstatistical comparisons of the racial composition of the relevant\n\npopulation may be probative of a pattern of discrimination.\").\n\nWhether or not some other standard might be more precise, the fact\n\nremains that the firefighter position is of the type contemplated\n\nby the Croson Court.      Thus, the parties' original bargain for a\n\ncommunity-wide pool and the district court's endorsement of that\n\nconcept are entitled to great weight.9     See Navarro-Ayala, 951 F.2d\n\n\n     9\n      We note that the district judge who actually entered the\nBeecher decree (Judge Freedman) made specific mention that, in\n1974, the BFD required applicants to be within an age range of 19-\n35 years. Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 512. He also observed that,\nprior to 1971, the minimum age had been 21. Id. Mindful of this\nshift, he concluded that the community population as a whole would\nbe an appropriate measure of compliance. This seems supportable in\nlight of Judge Freedman's recognition that the enjoined party had\nthe power to reconfigure the contours of the labor pool.       The\nauthorities cited by the Candidates involve parties without such\nleverage vis-à-vis the reach of the remedy; where such leverage\n\n                                 -33-\n\fat 1339 (reasoning that the district court is best able to decide\n\ncertain   types    of   parameters    in     public    institutional   reform\n\nlitigation and, thus, is owed deference when the scope of the\n\nparties' original bargain is not at issue).\n\n           We reaffirm, therefore, that the appropriate standard for\n\nmeasuring compliance with the Beecher decree — what we have termed\n\nthe   second   variable    —   consists     of   contemporaneous   population\n\nstatistics     depicting   the   percentage      of   minorities   within   the\n\noverall community.      It follows that a fire department subject to\n\nthe Beecher decree will remain so until that department succeeds in\n\ndemonstrating that it has achieved \"the decree's actual objective:\n\nrough parity,\" Mackin, 969 F.2d at 1277, measured by establishing\n\nthe percentage of minorities among entry-level firefighters in the\n\nparticular department and comparing that ratio to the percentage of\n\nminorities within the general population of the local community.\n\nWhen this comparison demonstrates that parity (or, at least, rough\n\nparity) has been attained, then the Beecher decree has outlived its\n\nusefulness as to that community's firefighting force.\n\n\n\n\nexists, however, measuring parity against general population\nstatistics prevents a public employer enjoined for discriminatory\npractices in violation of federal law from manipulating the remedy\nto suit its fancy.    So viewed, Judge Freedman's shaping of the\nsecond variable is a good example of why \"broad judicial discretion\n[is often] crucial for the district judge to secure complex legal\ngoals.\" Navarro-Ayala, 951 F.2d at 1338 (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n                                     -34-\n\f                    D.   Reworking the Algorithm.\n\n          From this analysis, it is evident that the district court\n\nerred in constructing the first Beecher variable.        In order to\n\ndetermine whether that error affected the Candidates' substantial\n\nrights, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 61, we rework the algorithm using the\n\nproper variables.    If that algorithm does not yield ratios that\n\nshow parity (or, at least, rough parity) between the percentage of\n\nminorities in the entry-level rank of the BFD and the percentage of\n\nminorities in the City of Boston as a whole, then the entry of\n\nsummary judgment in the City's favor must stand.         See Houlton\n\nCitizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (holding that a grant of summary judgment may be affirmed on\n\nany independent ground revealed by the record).\n\n          On this issue, the parties urging that parity has been\n\nachieved (here, the Candidates) bear the burden of proof. See C.K.\n\nSmith & Co. v. Motiva Enter. LLC, 269 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThat is of purely academic interest in this case for the pertinent\n\nfacts are uncontradicted.    The court below developed the factual\n\nrecord sufficiently to demonstrate that, when the City recruited\n\nthe 2000 hiring class, blacks and Hispanics comprised approximately\n\n40% of the firefighters within the BFD.    At the same time, blacks\n\nand Hispanics constituted slightly over 38% of Boston's overall\n\npopulation.   Quinn, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 162.   Hence, parity had been\n\nachieved, and the City had become eligible for release from the\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\fstrictures of the Beecher decree.      See Beecher II, 504 F.2d at\n\n1026-27.\n\n            Given these facts, the district court's error was not\n\nharmless.   After all, a public employer who consents to the use of\n\nrace as a factor in order to palliate the lingering effects of past\n\ndiscrimination must maintain continuous oversight in order to\n\nensure that the decree works the least possible harm to other\n\ninnocent persons competing for employment. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308.\n\nOnce parity has been achieved, the decree has served its legitimate\n\npurpose, and the justification for it has abated.   See id. at 309.\n\nFrom that point forward, the employer has no basis to continue\n\npreferring minorities.   See id.; see also Mackin, 969 F.2d at 1276\n\n(\"An intrusion by a federal court into the affairs of local\n\ngovernment should be kept to a bare minimum and not be allowed to\n\ncontinue after the violation has abated and its pernicious effects\n\nhave been cured.\").\n\n            We conclude, therefore, that the City's continued resort\n\nto race-based preferences from and after the time when parity was\n\nachieved fails the second prong of the strict scrutiny analysis.\n\nSee Bakke, 438 U.S. at 309.      Thus, the City's adherence to the\n\nBeecher decree during the 2000 hiring cycle was unconstitutional.\n\nConsistent with the foregoing, we reverse the district court's\n\nentry of summary judgment in favor of the City and direct the court\n\nto enter judgment in the Candidates' favor.\n\n\n                                -36-\n\f                                E.    Relief.\n\n            Our holding does not end the matter:               there remains the\n\nquestion of what remedy is appropriate under the circumstances.\n\nThat is a highly ramified question, the answer to which is subject\n\nto the push and pull of competing centrifugal and centripetal\n\nforces.\n\n            On the one hand, a public employer's good faith reliance\n\non   a   consent   decree   entered    to     remedy     the   effects    of   past\n\ndiscrimination should not lightly be disturbed.                See, e.g., Boston\n\nPolice Superior Officers, 147 F.3d at 25.                That proposition has\n\nparticular bite as to the firefighters who were appointed to the\n\nBFD during the 2000 hiring cycle, for the Beecher decree does not\n\ndirectly dictate hiring decisions, but, rather, simply directs\n\nmunicipalities to take affirmative action concerns into account in\n\nchoosing among qualified applicants.            See Mackin, 969 F.2d at 1278\n\n(explaining that \"only qualified minority candidates are specially\n\nadvantaged; no minority candidate is placed on the eligibility list\n\nunless he or she has attained a passing score on the entrance\n\nexamination\")      (emphasis    in    the     original).          Constitutional\n\nviolations rarely, if ever, justify the reversal of specific\n\nemployment    decisions     previously       made   by   government      employers\n\ninsofar as those decisions affect innocent parties.                   See, e.g.,\n\nBoston Police Superior Officers, 147 F.3d at 25; cf. Wygant, 476\n\nU.S. at 282-83 (\"Denial of a future employment opportunity is not\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fas intrusive as loss of an existing job.\").      The history of this\n\ncase offers a striking example of this truism:    the Beecher court,\n\ndespite its finding of pervasive past discrimination, did not\n\ndisturb the livelihood of those firefighters who were on the force\n\nin 1974.    See Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 520 (noting the need to\n\n\"preserv[e] morale within the fire departments\").\n\n            On the other hand, we have acknowledged that when job\n\napplicants have been denied equal protection of the laws by a\n\npublic employer, \"[t]he result, not the specific intent, is what\n\nmatters.\"    Beecher II, 504 F.2d at 1021 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    In that spirit, the original Beecher\n\ncourt invoked its equitable powers to fashion affirmative relief\n\nfor a perceived injury even after explicitly disavowing any finding\n\nthat the \"exclusionary policy [giving rise to the litigation] ha[d]\n\nbeen followed intentionally or by design.\" Beecher I, 371 F. Supp.\n\nat 519.\n\n            Here, the Candidates have neither offered any evidence\n\nthat the City acted in bad faith nor otherwise set forth a\n\nplausible basis that would justify a court in second-guessing the\n\nspecific decisions made by the City in the 2000 hiring cycle.     In\n\na similar vein, they have not established that the persons actually\n\nhired were either complicit in some scheme or somehow undeserving\n\nof their appointments.   Consequently, there is no principled basis\n\nfor turning back the clock and revoking those appointments.\n\n\n                                -38-\n\f            That does not mean, however, that the Candidates are\n\nentitled to no more than a handshake or a tip of the hat.                The fact\n\nremains that they have succeeded in showing that the City applied\n\na consent decree, previously held to be constitutional, for too\n\nlong.     The result was that the City infringed the Candidates'\n\nconstitutional rights when it acted upon their applications for\n\nappointment to the BFD.            They should at least have had the\n\nopportunity to compete for the positions that they coveted free of\n\nthe constraints imposed by the Beecher decree. See Bakke, 438 U.S.\n\nat 308.     Balancing these competing considerations, we hold that\n\nthe BFD's decisions to appoint specific individuals during the 2000\n\nhiring cycle were valid exercises of its responsibility to provide\n\nthe   citizens    of   Boston   with    a     full   complement    of   qualified\n\nfirefighters.     See Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 520.              Nevertheless,\n\nthe application of the decree to the 2000 hiring cycle violated the\n\nCandidates' constitutional rights by depriving them of an equal\n\nopportunity to compete for positions on the BFD.                  See Bakke, 403\n\nU.S. at 308.     On remand, the district court must sort through this\n\ntangle and determine, in its sound discretion, the appropriate\n\nremedy for the Candidates' injury (excluding, however, any form of\n\nrelief    that   would   require   dismissal         of   any   provisionally   or\n\npermanently appointed firefighter currently serving in the BFD).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -39-\n\fIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           The     goal   of   the    Beecher   decree   was   to     eliminate\n\ndiscriminatory      practices    in    the   recruitment     and    hiring     of\n\nfirefighters in communities subject to the Massachusetts Civil\n\nService laws,      and,   relatedly,    to   remedy   the   effects    of    past\n\ndiscrimination in recruitment and hiring.             Remediation has taken\n\nmore than a quarter-century. At long last, however, that objective\n\nhas been achieved with respect to the BFD; parity has been reached\n\nbetween the percentage of minority firefighters in the BFD and the\n\npercentage of minorities in the City as a whole.10\n\n           Although this is a significant landmark along the road to\n\nequality, we add a word of caution.          We are not Pollyannas, and we\n\n\n      10\n      Our dissenting brother never squarely addresses the\nCandidates' argument that \"even assuming that general population\nstatistics are to be considered, the minority composition of the\nDepartment's firefighters (39.9%) exceeded the minority composition\nof the general population of Boston (38.3%). The examination of\nparity should focus on minority representation in the firefighter\nposition alone . . . .     The racial preferences at issue apply\nsolely to the firefighter position.\"      Appellants' Brief at 23\n(internal cross-references and paragraph structure omitted). This\nis a changed circumstance requiring an examination into \"whether\nthe goals of the litigation . . . have been completely achieved,\"\nMackin, 969 F.2d at 1275, as well as a question posed for the first\ntime involving the decree's constitutional application. Viewed in\neither fashion, the question warrants strict scrutiny. See Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 384 (1992); see also\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 235. Our dissenting brother, however, says\nonly that he \"cannot imagine that the plaintiffs in the Beecher\nlitigation would have decided upon a remedy that provides\nincentives [to keep minorities in the entry-level rank].\" This is\nthe stuff not of strict scrutiny but of rational basis review.\nSee, e.g., FCC v. Beach Comm'ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993)\n(upholding law under rational basis review \"based on rational\nspeculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data\").\n\n                                      -40-\n\frecognize that achieving parity at the firefighter level is not\n\ntantamount to saying that all is well in regard to racial and\n\nethnic issues within the BFD as a whole.        To the extent that\n\ninequalities remain, however, they are not within the compass of\n\neither the Beecher decree or this litigation.      Nor will we reach\n\nout for them — issues of constitutional magnitude should not be the\n\nsubject of speculation, but, rather, should be litigated fully by\n\nparties with standing to represent various pertinent points of\n\nview. For today, we fulfill our responsibility by holding that the\n\nCity's appointment of firefighters ought no longer be subject to\n\nthe strictures of the Beecher decree.   We need go no further.\n\n\n\n           The judgment of the district court is reversed and the\n\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.   Costs are to be taxed in favor of the appellants.\n\n\n\n\n                  — Dissenting opinion follows —\n\n\n\n\n                               -41-\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.               The majority frames\n\nthe critical issue as one involving \"competing interpretations of\n\nthe term firefighter.\"       I respectfully disagree that this is the\n\ncentral issue in the dispute.          Indeed, the majority attributes an\n\nargument   to   the    Candidates     that   they   have    not    made     in   this\n\nlitigation -- that the court and the parties to the Beecher decree\n\nunderstood as a matter of original intent that minority presence in\n\nthe fire departments subject to the decree would be calculated by\n\nconsidering only the entry-level firefighter rank.                 The Candidates\n\nacknowledge     that   \"[w]hen    the    Beecher    decree        was   originally\n\nconceived, its apparent goal was to generate racial parity in the\n\nFire Department as a whole, as opposed to merely the firefighter\n\nranks.\" Instead, the Candidates argue that we should focus only on\n\nthe entry-level ranks because changed circumstances since 1974 and\n\n1992, when we last reviewed the Beecher decree in Mackin v. City of\n\nBoston, 969 F.2d 1273 (1st Cir. 1992), render the original intent\n\nof the decree unconstitutional.\n\n           Moreover,     even    if   the    Candidates      had    asked    us    to\n\ndetermine the original intent of the parties on the calculation of\n\nparity, it is a mistake to frame the issue as a search for the\n\nmeaning of the term \"firefighter.\"             As I will explain in more\n\ndetail, there is no consistent use of the word \"firefighter\" as the\n\noperative term in the calculation of parity.               Instead, there are a\n\nvariety of terms used, only one of which is the word \"firefighter.\"\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fThe relevant question, then, is which of the early formulations of\n\nthe measurement of parity captures the intent of the parties and\n\nthe court.\n\n               This dissent proceeds in three parts.                    In Part I, I\n\naddress the majority's conclusion that the Beecher decree always\n\ncontemplated        that   the    first    variable,     to   use    the   majority's\n\nlanguage, would only consider the percentage of minorities in the\n\nentry-level         firefighter    ranks.         In   Part   II,   I    address    the\n\nmajority's       assertion        that     narrow      tailoring     requires      this\n\ninterpretation of the decree to avoid constitutional problems.                       In\n\nPart    III,    I    evaluate     the     Candidates'     argument      that   changed\n\ncircumstances since the entry of the Beecher decree require that\n\nthe decree now be read to measure parity by focusing only on the\n\nfirefighter ranks.\n\n                           I. Interpreting the Decree\n\n               In the original Beecher decree issued on February 8,\n\n1974, the court used the phrase \"complement of minorities\" in the\n\noperative sentence explaining when a city's fire department could\n\nreceive an exemption.11 Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher, 371\n\n\n       11\n      In our first review of the decree, we paraphrased the parity\nparagraph of the decree, saying that \"[t]he decree remains in\nforce, for each local fire department, until that department\nattains sufficient minority fire fighters to have a percentage on\nthe force approximately equal to the percentage of minorities in\nthe locality.\" Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher, 504 F.2d\n1017, 1026-27 (1st Cir. 1974). While the use of the term \"fire\nfighters\" may have been a shorthand description of the decree, it\ncertainly should not supplant the language of the original decree.\n\n                                           -43-\n\fF. Supp. 507, 523 (D. Mass.), aff'd 504 F.2d 1017 (1st Cir. 1974).\n\nIn its Interim Consent Decree of April 17, 1975 (signed by the\n\nparties), the court for the first time used the term \"firefighter\"\n\nin explaining the process for obtaining an exemption: \"The Director\n\n[of Personnel Administration] shall notify the plaintiffs and\n\nsupply evidence to the plaintiffs whenever a particular city or\n\ntown has achieved a complement of Black and Spanish-surnamed\n\nfirefighters commensurate with the percentage of minorities within\n\nthe community . . . .\"     Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher, No.\n\n72-3060-F, slip op. at 4 (D. Mass. Apr. 17, 1975) (emphasis added).\n\nSoon thereafter, though, the parties signed the \"Agreement to\n\nEffectuate    Interim     Consent   Decree,\"    which   again   discusses\n\nexemptions.    Paragraph 11 of that Agreement states: \"No fire\n\ndepartment . . . may be exempted . . . unless the appointing\n\nauthority has first petitioned the Division that the percentage of\n\npost-probationary       minority    uniformed   personnel   equals    the\n\npercentage of minorities in the city or town served by said\n\ndepartment . . . .\"      Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher, No.\n\n72-3060-F, slip op. at 6 (D. Mass. Nov. 25, 1975) (emphasis\n\nadded).12\n\n\n     12\n       The majority dismisses the city's reliance on the terminology\nof the November 1975 Agreement because that Agreement \"incorporates\nby reference paragraph 7\" of the April 1975 decree, which uses the\nterm \"firefighters,\" and therefore \"leads us back to our starting\npoint.\" The majority assumes that the April 1975 decree should be\nthe court's \"starting point.\" The starting point of the analysis\nshould be the original Beecher decree -- which uses the phrase\n\n                                    -44-\n\f          Presented with these three formulations, the majority\n\nchooses to focus on the word \"firefighter\" in the April 1975\n\nInterim Consent Decree as the critical word and dismisses the\n\nformulation in the final agreement of the parties (\"the percentage\n\nof post-probationary minority uniformed personnel\") as a \"casual\n\n(and wholly unexplained) linguistic switch.\"              This dismissive\n\ncharacterization seems odd, especially since the phrase \"post-\n\nprobationary minority uniformed personnel\" in the November 1975\n\nAgreement is far closer to the general language of the original\n\nBeecher   decree   (\"complement     of     minorities\")   than   the    word\n\n\"firefighter\" used in the April Interim Decree. The \"complement of\n\nminorities\" and \"post-probationary minority uniformed personnel\"\n\nformulations   also   seem     to    capture    the   purpose    that    the\n\nBeecher court attributed to its own decree -- to remedy the\n\n\"exclusion of minorities from the fire department\"           -- than does\n\nthe word \"firefighter.\"      Beecher, 371 F. Supp. at 519-20.\n\n          However, there is support for competing views in the\n\nshifting word choices of these three decrees.         The language itself\n\ndoes not tell us definitively what the court and parties intended\n\nfor the measure of the first variable.          But the use of the word\n\n\"firefighter\" is part of the ambiguity -- not the answer to it.           In\n\nthe sequence of language in the three decrees, there is no basis\n\nfor concluding that \"firefighter\" is the operative word and that\n\n\n\"complement of minorities.\"      Beecher, 371 F. Supp. at 523.\n\n                                    -45-\n\fdetermining its plain meaning will answer the intent question.13\n\nInstead, we must acknowledge that the competing formulations of the\n\nfirst variable create an inescapable ambiguity which must be\n\nresolved by resort to extrinsic evidence.\n\n           We have already opined in this litigation on the kind of\n\npersuasive evidence that helps resolve such ambiguities.                 \"Few\n\nthings evidence a decree's meaning more persuasively than [a] . .\n\n. pattern of past practice under the decree . . . .\"          Mackin, 969\n\nF.2d at 1276.       The City and the NAACP produced evidence that\n\nMassachusetts has required municipalities seeking exemptions from\n\nthe   decree   to   compare   the   percentage    of   minorities   in   the\n\npopulation of their city or town to the percentage of minority\n\npersonnel among their departments' entire uniformed personnel.\n\nUsing this formula, forty-five municipalities originally subject to\n\nthe decree have received exemptions.        An affidavit in the record\n\nexplains that no department's appointing authority has objected to\n\nthis formula since it has been in place.         This understanding of the\n\n\n\n      13\n      In support of its argument that \"firefighter\" is the\noperative term for interpreting the decree, the majority notes that\nthe term \"firefighter\" is used \"no fewer than twenty-six times in\nthe decrees, while the term 'uniformed personnel' appears only\nonce.\" While likely true, this statement is beside the point. For\nexample, the term \"firefighter\" is used no fewer than ten times\nsimply to describe the examination given to candidates, for example\n\"valid firefighter entrance examination\" and \"fire fighter\nexamination.\" As I indicated, one must focus on the operative term\nof the decrees, i.e. the language which explains the meaning of\nparity. In that context, the word \"firefighter\" is one of only\nthree formulations.\n\n                                    -46-\n\fdecree has been memorialized in a 1987 memorandum circulated by the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Personnel Administration outlining \"the\n\nprocess and the criteria for seeking approval for exemption\" from\n\nthe Beecher decree. This memorandum, using the same terminology as\n\nthe November 1975 Agreement, states that a municipality must\n\nconsider   the   \"full-time   uniformed   force\"    and   calculate   the\n\npercentage of \"post-probationary (tenured) full-time permanent\n\nBlack or Hispanic members of the uniformed force\" to determine\n\nwhether parity has been achieved.\n\n           The majority dismisses the importance of this memorandum,\n\nconcluding that \"a federal appellate court owes no deference to [a\n\nstate agency helping to administer compliance with a federal\n\njudicial decree] when endeavoring to discern the meaning and\n\nconstitutional limits of such a decree.\"           As a generality this\n\npoint is a fair one.    But this memorandum from the Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Personnel Administration demonstrates much more than\n\na reasonable interpretation of ambiguous language in a federal\n\ndecree by a helpful state agency.         This memorandum describes a\n\n\"pattern of past practice\" of the application of language in the\n\nNovember 1975 Agreement by one of the parties to the original\n\nlitigation.\n\n           The Commissioners of the Massachusetts Division of Civil\n\nService were some of the named defendants in the consolidated\n\nBeecher litigation.    At some point, the Department of Personnel\n\n\n                                 -47-\n\fAdministration became the successor to the Division of Civil\n\nServices and responsible for carrying out the remedial provisions\n\nof the decree.      Paragraph 1 of the April 1975 decree describes how\n\nthe \"Director of Civil Service [hereinafter Director shall mean the\n\nDirector, his successors, or after July 1, 1975, the Personnel\n\nAdministrator]\" should implement the original Beecher decree.14\n\nParagraph 1 of the November 1975 Agreement refers to \"The Division15\n\nof Personnel Administration (formerly known as the Division of\n\nCivil Service, and hereinafter, the 'Division') . . . .\" Paragraph\n\n11 of the November 1975 Agreement designates the \"Division\" as the\n\nagency     to   which   municipal       fire    departments     should   apply    for\n\nexemptions from the decree.             The November 1975 Agreement was also\n\nsigned by counsel for the \"Director of Personnel Administration.\"\n\nThe memorandum in question, then, was not issued by an agency that\n\nwas a stranger to the underlying litigation.                     Instead, it was\n\ncrafted by a party to the Beecher litigation with the court-ordered\n\nresponsibility         to     review    the    petitions   of     municipal      fire\n\ndepartments      for        exemption   from     the   decree.       Under    these\n\ncircumstances, the insistence in Mackin on the persuasive value of\n\n\n\n     14\n          The bracketed words are in the April 1975 decree.\n     15\n      Although the Beecher court referred to the Division of\nPersonnel Administration, the agency calls itself the Department of\nPersonnel Administration. I assume that the agencies in question\nare one and the same.        There does not currently exist a\nMassachusetts agency with the official name Division of Personnel\nAdministration.\n\n                                         -48-\n\fa pattern of past practice under the decree is particularly apt.\n\nSee also Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez Colon, 951 F.2d 1325, 1353 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (Cyr, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n(analogizing   a   consent    decree   to   a   contract:    \"Under   a    well-\n\nestablished rule of contract interpretation, the court may look to\n\nthe parties' post-contract course of conduct and performance to\n\nascertain the 'practical interpretation and application' that the\n\nparties themselves attached to the ambiguous contract language.\")\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n          The majority says that Mackin's directive to consider\n\npost-execution     practice   to   interpret    the   decree's     meaning   is\n\n\"inapposite\" in this case because the evidence of the practice in\n\nquestion is being used \"to change the meaning of plain language and\n\nthus to validate an unlikely interpretation\" of the Beecher decree.\n\nHowever, there is no plain language in the decrees on the issue of\n\nthe first variable, and the \"unlikely interpretation\" was one\n\nadopted by one of the parties to the underlying litigation and\n\ncomplied with by many other municipalities subject to the decree.\n\nTherefore,   the   majority's      interpretation     of    the   decree   runs\n\ncontrary both to Massachusetts's demonstrated understanding of it\n\nand to the lengthy history of its application in granting many\n\nexemptions from the decree over a period of at least sixteen years\n\n(that is, since 1987).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\f          It   is   also   difficult    to   reconcile    the   majority's\n\ninterpretation of the decree with incentives that would have seemed\n\nsensible to the parties to the decree.       If, at the time the decree\n\nwas entered, a city fire department knew that it needed to show\n\nparity only in its entry-level class to receive an exemption from\n\nthe decree, it could achieve its goals more quickly by keeping all\n\nthe minority firefighters it hired at the entry level -- that is,\n\nby selecting for promotion only non-minority firefighters.             The\n\nmajority's interpretation would have provided an incentive for fire\n\ndepartments not to promote the black and Hispanic firefighters it\n\nhired under the terms of the decree.         Every minority firefighter\n\npromoted to an officer position would have been another black or\n\nHispanic member of the department that did not count towards the\n\ncalculation of parity.\n\n          Although there is no evidence in the record that the\n\nBoston Fire Department (\"BFD\") has ever discriminated against black\n\nand Hispanic firefighters in its previous promotion decisions, the\n\nmajority's interpretation of the decree creates an incentive for\n\ndiscriminatory behavior for those municipalities still subject to\n\nthe decree after the resolution of this case.            I cannot imagine\n\nthat the plaintiffs in the Beecher litigation and the district\n\n\n\n\n                                 -50-\n\fcourt would have decided upon a remedy that provides incentives so\n\nat odds with the purpose of the litigation and the relief ordered.16\n\n                       II. Narrow Tailoring\n\n          To support its interpretation of the Beecher decree, the\n\nmajority contends that the interpretation advanced by the city and\n\nthe NAACP \"would mean that the Beecher decree was not narrowly\n\ntailored to serve its stated purpose.\"      In elaborating on this\n\npoint, the majority raises another argument that was not raised by\n\nthe Candidates:\n\n          Such an interpretation would effectively\n          transform an instrument carefully crafted to\n          eliminate discrimination in recruitment and\n          hiring   into   general    leverage   favoring\n          minorities in a much wider variety of matters.\n          In most of those areas -- promotion is a good\n          example -- no justification for systematic\n          preferential treatment of minorities has been\n          established.\n\nAs I understand it, the majority reasons that the interpretation of\n\nthe Beecher decree advocated by the NAACP and the city would\n\nimpermissibly benefit minority firefighters by somehow giving them\n\npreferences for promotions even though the Beecher court made no\n\n\n\n     16\n      In a footnote to its opinion, the majority cites this point\nas evidence that I do not understand the difference between strict\nscrutiny and rational basis review. Self-evidently, I make this\npoint only in support of the original meaning of the decree\nadvanced by the defendants and acknowledged by the Candidates. I\ndo not proffer it as a constitutional basis for upholding the\ndecree. My conclusion that this original interpretation of the\ndecree is constitutional, or more specifically, that it is narrowly\ntailored to a compelling government interest, is presented in the\nsection that follows.\n\n                               -51-\n\ffindings regarding the constitutionality of the promotion policies\n\nof the fire departments subject to the decree.                   This effect of the\n\nBeecher    decree,   the      majority          concludes,       would       render    it\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n           I disagree with this conclusion because the decree does\n\nnot in fact have the effect of granting minorities preferential\n\ntreatment in promotions.            That is, I fail to see how merely\n\ncalculating     parity   by        taking       the     entire        department      into\n\nconsideration leads to a \"systematic preferential treatment of\n\nminorities\" in the promotion process.                 First, there is no evidence\n\nin the record that minority firefighters hired in accordance with\n\nthe   Beecher   decree   have      received      preferences          for    promotions.\n\nTherefore, the majority's conclusion about such an effect is\n\nentirely   speculative.         Second,         the    logic     of    the    majority's\n\n\"preferential treatment\" argument is problematic.                        By its terms,\n\nthe Beecher decree does not explicitly address the promotion\n\npolicies of the BFD or any other fire department in any way.\n\nWhether parity is calculated by taking into consideration merely\n\nentry-level     firefighters,       or    by     also    including          lieutenants,\n\ncaptains, and chiefs, the decree does not mandate changes in the\n\ndepartment's    promotion     practices.              Because     the    criteria     for\n\npromoting firefighters, whatever they may be, are independent from\n\nthe hiring criteria, the Beecher court's alterations to the BFD's\n\nhiring    criteria   have     no    effect       on     its    promotion       criteria.\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\fTherefore, whether or not the Beecher decree continues to direct\n\nthe method by which the department hires new firefighters, we can\n\nonly assume,      without    any    evidence    to   the   contrary,     that     the\n\ndepartment will continue to decide promotions in the same way it\n\nalways has.\n\n             True, by design, the decree results in an increase in the\n\ndiversity of the class from which the BFD selects the firefighters\n\nfor promotion.      However, this consequence of the decree cannot be\n\n\"general leverage favoring minorities.\"              In any organization that\n\npromotes from within, the application of a hiring decree that\n\nresults in the employment of minorities that otherwise would not\n\nhave been hired necessarily increases the possibility that some of\n\nthose minorities will be promoted to officers and thereby change\n\nthe racial makeup of the officer ranks.                Just because the decree\n\nhas the consequence of changing the racial composition of the pool\n\nof   those   eligible      for    promotions    does    not    mean   that   it    is\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n                        III.      Changed Circumstances\n\n             As   noted,    the    Candidates   concede       that,   \"[w]hen     the\n\nBeecher decree was originally conceived, its apparent goal was to\n\ngenerate racial parity in the Fire Department as a whole, as\n\nopposed to merely the firefighter ranks.\" However, they argue that\n\nafter twenty-eight years, \"a different analysis must be used if the\n\ndecree is to be implemented in a constitutionally acceptable\n\n\n                                       -53-\n\fmanner.\"      Specifically, the Candidates point to three changed\n\ncircumstances that they claim require a revised interpretation of\n\nthe decree.     First, they say that it has become evident over time\n\nthat the decree is ineffective for the purpose of generating racial\n\ndiversity in the upper ranks of the BFD.          Second, the Candidates\n\nremind us that twenty-eight years have elapsed since the entry of\n\nthe Beecher decree, and argue that this is simply too long to wait\n\nfor the realization of rough parity.      Third, when the scope of the\n\ninquiry    is   restricted   to   consideration    of   only   entry-level\n\nfirefighters, statistics show that the percentage of minority\n\nfirefighters exceeds the percentage of minorities in the community,\n\nresulting in an \"excess of parity\" at the entry level.\n\n            Frankly, I am at a loss to understand this third \"changed\n\ncircumstance\" as a discrete argument.        The Candidates offer two\n\nvariations of \"excess of parity.\" In the first, the Candidates use\n\na computation of parity that the majority has rightly rejected.\n\nThat computation reflects the difference between the percentage of\n\nminority firefighters (39.9%) and the minority population of Boston\n\naged 18 and older (32.6%).        I agree with the majority that stare\n\ndecisis requires the use of the percentage of minorities in the\n\ngeneral population, rather than the adult population, as the second\n\nvariable for gauging parity.        In the alternative, the Candidates\n\nassert that \"even assuming that general population statistics are\n\nto be considered, the minority composition of the Department's\n\n\n                                   -54-\n\ffirefighters (39.9%) exceeded the minority composition of the\n\ngeneral population of Boston (38.3%).\"          However, after conceding\n\nthat \"[w]hen the Beecher decree was originally conceived, its\n\napparent goal was to generate racial parity in the Fire Department\n\nas a whole, as opposed to merely the firefighter ranks,\" the\n\nCandidates do not use this formulation of \"excess of parity\" to\n\narticulate a distinct constitutional argument.              Instead, they use\n\nthe statistics as evidence that the decree is not effective for the\n\npurposes of achieving this \"apparent goal\" of racial diversity in\n\nthe upper ranks of the BFD.         Hence, because \"excess of parity\" in\n\nthe firefighter rank is inescapably tied to the first \"changed\n\ncircumstance\" argument relating to the ineffectiveness of the\n\ndecree, I    will   not   address    this   \"excess    of   parity\"   argument\n\nindependently. Instead, I will incorporate my discussion of excess\n\nparity in the ineffectiveness argument.\n\n            While modification of a consent decree is warranted if\n\nthere is \"a significant change either in factual conditions or in\n\nlaw,\"   Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 384\n\n(1992), \"a party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the\n\nburden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances\n\nwarrants revision of the decree.\"        Id. at 383.    The Candidates have\n\nfailed to carry this burden.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -55-\n\fA.    Ineffectiveness of the Decree.\n\n             The Candidates assert that although 39.9% of entry-level\n\nfirefighters in the BFD are minorities, only 6.2% (22 of 350) of\n\nuniformed personnel above the rank of firefighter are minorities.\n\nThey assert that \"after 28 years, this is not a temporary status,\"\n\nand that continuation of the decree will only increase disparity in\n\nfavor of minorities at the entry level.                Claimants argue that this\n\nchanged     circumstance     implicates       narrow    tailoring          because    the\n\nBeecher decree has proven ineffective in achieving its goals.                         In\n\nother words, the unexpected barrier between the entry-level and the\n\nupper ranks, experienced by minorities within the BFD, demonstrates\n\nthat the race-conscious hiring process is not narrowly tailored to\n\nserve the decree's goals of parity within the BFD.\n\n             Interestingly, the majority's narrow tailoring argument\n\nand   the   Candidates's     narrow    tailoring        argument       are    based    on\n\ncontradictory factual premises. The majority rejects the inclusion\n\nof higher ranks in the computation of parity because, in part, such\n\ninclusion     unconstitutionally         transforms       the        decree    into    an\n\ninstrument of \"general leverage favoring minorities\" in promotions.\n\nBy    contrast,      the    Candidates      assert       that        the     decree    is\n\nunconstitutional      because     it   is   ineffective         in    furthering      the\n\npromotion of minorities to the upper ranks.\n\n             There    are   two   ways      to   understand          the   Candidates'\n\nineffectiveness argument.         The Candidates may be arguing that the\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\fBeecher decree, as originally conceived, requires parity at both\n\nthe entry-level and among the upper ranks.         Because of the alleged\n\nbarrier to the promotion of minority firefighters, the Candidates\n\ncontend that the decree is ineffective in achieving this goal.\n\nAlternatively, they may be arguing that the purpose of the decree\n\nis to achieve parity in the department as a whole, irrespective of\n\nthe distribution of minorities at all levels of the department.\n\nGiven the barrier to promotions, they assert that the only way this\n\nparity can be achieved is indirectly -- that is, by impermissible\n\n\"overloading\" of minorities at the entry-level to \"offset\" the lack\n\nof diversity in the upper ranks -- and that this effect is fatal to\n\nnarrow tailoring.     I will address separately these variations of\n\nthe ineffectiveness argument.\n\n           1.    Parity at the Entry Level and in the Upper Ranks\n\n           The    Candidates's     first   ineffectiveness      argument    is\n\npremised on their characterization of the original purpose of the\n\ndecree, described as an assumption. That is, they attribute to the\n\ndistrict   court    in   Beecher    the    assumption   that     \"once     the\n\ndiscriminatory     effects   of   the   entrance   hurdles    were   removed,\n\nminorities would trickle through the fire department somewhat\n\nevenly.\"   There is a basic flaw in this premise.            At the time the\n\nBeecher decree was entered, the percentage of minority firefighters\n\nin the BFD was less than one percent.       It would have been pointless\n\nfor the Beecher court to make any assumptions about promotion\n\n\n                                    -57-\n\fpractices when the total number of minorities in the BFD was\n\nnegligible.    Moreover, the court did not enter its decree only to\n\nremedy discrimination in the Boston fire department.       The Beecher\n\ncourt made fifty-five other municipalities in Massachusetts subject\n\nto   the      Beecher     decree,    and   specifically   noted   the\n\ndisproportionately low percentage of minorities in the \"total\n\nforce\" of other towns.17     Essentially, there were few minorities to\n\npromote in any of the cities or towns, and the Candidates never\n\nexplain why the Beecher court would have made any assumptions about\n\npromotion practices. Therefore, it is unpersuasive to attribute to\n\nthe Beecher court the assumption described in the Candidates' brief\n\nthat \"once the discriminatory effects of the entrance hurdles were\n\nremoved, minorities would trickle through the fire department\n\nsomewhat evenly.\"       Instead, it is more reasonable to attribute to\n\nthe Beecher court the goal reflected in the explicit language of\n\nthe decree: \"a complement of minorities commensurate with the\n\npercentage of minorities\" within each municipality.       Beecher, 371\n\nF. Supp. at 523.    The City, an original party to the decree, states\n\n\n     17\n      \"The City of Springfield has a black population of\napproximately 13%. Of 475 firefighters in that city, one is black\nand none are Spanish-surnamed. The one black represents 0.2% of\nthe total force. The City of Cambridge has a black population of\n6.1%, and a fire fighting force of 305 men, four of whom are black;\none is Spanish-surnamed. They represent approximately 2% of the\ntotal force. New Bedford has a black population of approximately\n3.5%. Minorities represent approximately 1% of the fire force.\nWorcester has a black population of approximately 2%. Minorities\nrepresent 1% of the fire force there.\" Beecher, 371 F. Supp at 514\n(emphasis added).\n\n                                    -58-\n\fthe purpose of the decree well in its brief: \"increasing the total\n\ngross proportion of minority fire personnel in each appointing\n\nauthority.\"\n\n           Indeed, as noted earlier, the Beecher court discusses the\n\npurpose of the decree in its original opinion ordering remedial\n\naction and establishing the framework for the subsequent consent\n\ndecree.   There it states that in 1974 \"blacks and Spanish-surnamed\n\npersons represent such an insignificant percentage of the force,\"\n\nand that these \"present effects of past discrimination must be\n\nremedied.\"      Beecher I, 371 F. Supp. at 519-20.     The decree says\n\nnothing about anticipating racial proportionality in both the\n\nentry-level and the upper ranks.        The Candidates' argument of\n\nineffectiveness in achieving such proportionality fails because it\n\nis premised on a goal that is nowhere discernible in the Beecher\n\ndecree or decision.\n\n           2.    Parity in the Department as a Whole\n\n           Even if the purpose of the Beecher decree is to diversify\n\nthe entire department, without regard to the even distribution of\n\nminorities in the entry level and upper ranks, the Candidates argue\n\nthat, given the barrier to minority promotion in the department,\n\ncontinuation of the decree will only increase disparity in favor of\n\nminorities at the entry level. From this changed circumstance, the\n\nCandidates offer a complicated narrow tailoring argument that does\n\nnot lend itself to easy summary.     Hence, I quote it at length:\n\n\n                                 -59-\n\f          If the method of promotion is appropriate, is\n          not discriminatory, and nevertheless leads to\n          racial disparity at the top levels, then it is\n          inappropriate to try to \"offset\" legitimate\n          promotions with an increased minority presence\n          at the bottom.    In other words, parity may\n          currently exist in the upper levels of the\n          Fire Department, in that it may reflect the\n          appropriate proportion of minorities in the\n          qualified labor pool for such promotions. . .\n          . If so, this parity can not be used to\n          justify further hiring quotas in the lower\n          ranks.\n\n          In the alternative, if lack of minorities at\n          the   top   levels   is   the   result  of   a\n          discriminatory promotional procedure (of which\n          there is no proof), the requirement to\n          \"narrowly tailor\" racial preferences requires\n          that the specific promotional problem be\n          addressed directly, and not indirectly through\n          affirmative action at the lowest level.\n          Indeed, more minorities in a lower position\n          does   not    remedy    the   problem   of   a\n          \"discriminatory\" promotional process.\n\n          To comply with strict scrutiny, a racial\n          remedy must be effective. It is inappropriate\n          to address alleged disparity in the upper\n          ranks indirectly using racial preferences to\n          fill the lower ranks, when minorities are not\n          being promoted in proportionate numbers.\n\n          The Candidates's narrow tailoring argument asserts that\n\nthere are only two possible causes for the discrepancy between the\n\npercentage of minorities at the entry-level and the percentage of\n\nminorities in the upper ranks: (a) the low percentage of minorities\n\nin the upper ranks is an accurate reflection of the qualified\n\napplicant pool, or (b) the low percentage of minorities reflects\n\ndiscrimination in the promotion process.     They say that if the\n\nbarrier to promotion is due to the lack of qualified minority\n\n                               -60-\n\fapplicants, then the decree is not narrowly tailored because it\n\nrequires the overloading of minorities at the entry-level to offset\n\nthis   dearth   of   minorities   qualified    for   the   upper   ranks.\n\nAlternately, if the barrier to promotion is due to discrimination,\n\nthe decree is ineffective in addressing this problem because it\n\nfocuses only on hiring practices.         Since there are only two\n\npossible causes of the discrepancy between the percentage of\n\nminorities at the entry-level and the percentage of minorities in\n\nthe upper ranks, and each cause demonstrates that the decree is not\n\nnarrowly tailored to serve the decree's goals of parity within the\n\nentire Fire Department, the Candidates argue that this \"conundrum,\"\n\nas they describe it, conclusively proves that the decree fails the\n\nnarrow tailoring test.\n\n          This logic reveals another flawed premise.          Causes (a)\n\nand (b) do not represent the universe of possible explanations for\n\nthe discrepancy.     In fact, the City offers a third plausible and\n\nconstitutionally sound explanation.      Based on its experience with\n\npublic employment affirmative action programs, the City posits that\n\nit may just take a long time for affirmative action measures at the\n\nentry level of the BFD to influence minority representation in the\n\nhigher ranks. Instead of being evidence of a barrier to promotion,\n\nthe fact that only 6.2% of the higher ranks of the department is\n\nminority may evidence an inescapably slow process of growing\n\ndiversity throughout the department.          At the time the Beecher\n\n\n                                  -61-\n\fdecree was implemented in 1974, minorities represented only 0.9% of\n\nthe total BFD.     Beecher I, 371 F. Supp at 514.       While far from\n\nrepresentative of the minority population of the community, the\n\n6.2% minority representation in the upper ranks is a significant\n\nincrease indicating that the decree, however slowly, is fostering\n\ndiversity    in   the   upper   ranks.    Indeed,   there   has    been   a\n\ndemonstrable increase in the number of minority officers recently.\n\nThe City's response to the Candidates' interrogatories, included in\n\nthe summary judgment record, indicates that there were 17 minority\n\nofficers in 1998, 18 in 1999, and 22 in 2000.        Over a span of two\n\nyears, the percentage of minority officers increased from 4.8% to\n\n6.2%.\n\n            Moreover, the slow rate of change in the officer ranks is\n\nnot surprising in an organization the size of the BFD.            While the\n\ndepartment employs over 1500 firefighting personnel, only 350 of\n\nthose hold officer positions -- less than 25 percent. Although the\n\nrecord reveals that it is not uncommon for Boston to hire 50 new\n\nfirefighters in a particular year, it is highly unlikely that a\n\ndepartment with only 350 officer positions will promote that many\n\nover the same time period.      Because the annual promotion rate will\n\ngenerally be much lower than the annual hiring rate, evidence that\n\nminorities are not penetrating the upper levels of the department\n\nas quickly as the entry level is predictable.        In concluding that\n\nthere is an intractable barrier to minority promotion in the\n\n\n                                   -62-\n\fdepartment merely because there are only 22 minority officers, the\n\nCandidates take too grudging a view of progress.\n\n          With    their      conundrum   argument,   the   Candidates    have\n\nconstructed an argument designed to succeed on the basis of logic\n\ninstead of proof:      because both of the possible explanations for\n\nthe discrepancy between the percentages of minorities in the entry-\n\nlevels and upper ranks indicate a lack of narrow tailoring, they\n\nassert that they do not have to prove the reality of either\n\nexplanation.     However, as noted, the logic is faulty because it\n\nfails to account for other plausible and constitutionally sound\n\nexplanations     for   the    discrepancy.      Therefore,   even   on    the\n\nassumption that there might be a narrow tailoring problem with the\n\nBeecher decree if either of the Candidates' explanations of the\n\ndiscrepancy were real (unqualified applicants for promotion or\n\ndiscriminatory promotion practices), the Candidates must offer\n\nproof of one of these explanations.          They have failed to do so.\n\n          As the Candidates themselves point out, there is no\n\nevidence of discriminatory promotion practices.            The alternative\n\n\"unqualified applicants\" explanation18 is objectionable on a number\n\nof grounds.      First, the Beecher court found that the entrance\n\nexamination for firefighters was not indicative of job performance\n\n\n     18\n      The Candidates elaborate on this explanation as follows:\n\"[B]ecause affirmative action benefits minorities that score lower\non the entrance examinations . . . [w]hen these lower scorers seek\npromotions, they are competing against non-minorities who have\nscored at the very top of the entrance examination.\"\n\n                                    -63-\n\fand had a discriminatory impact on minorities.                       Beecher 371 F.\n\nSupp. at 517-18.         Second, as we made clear in Mackin, 969 F.2d at\n\n1278, the Beecher court specifically designed the decree to require\n\nthe hiring of only qualified applicants.                     Third, the Candidates\n\nthemselves assert that the entry-level and promotional positions\n\nhave     \"markedly       different       skill,      experience      and    knowledge\n\nrequirements,\" making performance on the entrance examination of\n\nlittle relevance to promotional success.                There is simply no proof\n\nin this record that the 6.2% statistic represents the \"appropriate\n\nproportion of minorities in the qualified labor pool for such\n\npromotions.\"\n\n               The Candidates bear the burden of proving the existence\n\nof changed circumstances undermining the constitutionality of a\n\nconsent decree.         Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383.           Mere recitation of the\n\ncurrent statistics describing the racial composition of the entry-\n\nlevel and upper ranks is insufficient.                 Thus, the Candidates have\n\nfailed    to    carry     their     burden    of   proving    substantial       changed\n\ncircumstances affecting the constitutional validity of the decree.\n\nB.     Duration of the Decree\n\n               Although      we    rejected   this   argument       when   we   decided\n\nMackin, the Candidates argue that the passage of time (now twenty\n\neight years) is itself a changed circumstance that demonstrates the\n\nineffectiveness         of   the    Beecher decree.          That    argument    is   as\n\nunpersuasive now as it was when we decided Mackin.                     Then we said:\n\n\n                                          -64-\n\f           [T]he decree's life is limited, remaining in force\n           only until its requirements have been met. . . .\n           Indeed, the proof of the present pudding is that,\n           since 1974, more than fifty percent of the\n           communities originally affected by the decree have\n           already been freed from further oversight.\n\nMackin, 969 F.2d at 1278 (citations omitted).\n\n           Today, the fifty percent figure cited in Mackin ten years\n\nago has reached eighty percent, with forty-five out of fifty-six\n\ncommunities    originally affected by the decree having now achieved\n\nparity and thus exclusion from further oversight.               The Beecher\n\ndecree remains limited in duration because it is extinguished upon\n\nthe achievement of a demonstrably attainable rough parity.                 See\n\nBeecher,   371    F.   Supp.   at   523    (providing   for    release    from\n\nappointment process mandated by the decree \"as a city or town\n\nachieves   a     complement    of   minorities   commensurate     with     the\n\npercentage of minorities within the community\").              Limitations of\n\nthis sort are crucial factors in evaluating overbreadth challenges.\n\nSee Stuart v. City of Boston, 951 F.2d 446, 454 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nNothing about the race-conscious appointment process of the Beecher\n\ndecree resembles \"remedies that are ageless in their reach into the\n\npast, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\"               Wygant\n\nv. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 276 (1986); see also City of\n\nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 498 (1989).              With so\n\nmuch compliance elsewhere, and with so much progress in Boston\n\ntowards rough parity, the mere passage of time does not demonstrate\n\nthe decree's ineffectiveness.\n\n                                    -65-\n\f                                  IV.   Conclusion\n\n           At least since our decision in Mackin ten years ago, the\n\nBeecher decree has had a settled meaning. Pursuant to that settled\n\nmeaning,       the   fire      departments      of   eighty   percent      of    the\n\nmunicipalities       subject      to    the    Beecher   decree   have    achieved\n\ncompliance with it.            Now, faced with a renewed challenge to the\n\ndecree by Candidates who feel themselves unfairly barred from\n\nemployment opportunities in the BFD, the majority finds new meaning\n\nin an old decree.         I disagree with that conclusion.             It cannot be\n\nreconciled with our precedent in Mackin, sound principles of\n\ninterpretation applicable to a consent decree, or the history of\n\nthis case.       Taking a different tack, the Candidates challenge the\n\nBeecher decree by constructing changed circumstances arguments that\n\nare unpersuasive because of faulty logic, the absence of proof, and\n\nprior rejection in Mackin.\n\n               The Beecher decree is not just about the BFD.             It was and\n\nremains    a     decree     applicable    to    other    cities   and    towns   in\n\nMassachusetts.       Although it is regrettable that the substantial\n\nprogress of the BFD in ending its discriminatory hiring practices\n\nhas not yet reached the goal of rough parity required by the\n\ndecree, that remaining gap is no justification for altering a\n\ndecree which requires, with a formula now long accepted, that the\n\n\"present       effects    of    past    discrimination     must   be     remedied.\"\n\nBeecher, 371 F. Supp. at 520.                 Until that gap is closed, the\n\n\n                                         -66-\n\fremedial purpose of the decree remains unfulfilled. We should stay\n\nthe course, not abandon it.   I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               -67-\n\f",

On April 11, 2001, five candidates for employment (the Candidates) brought suit in the federal district court alleging that the City had discriminated against them on the basis of race when hiring new firefighters in the fall of 2000. The City defended its hiring practices as compliant with, and compelled by, the terms of the consent decree. The district court granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor. <i>See Quinn v. City of Boston,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d 156 (D.Mass.2002). The Candidates appeal. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, this court, like the trial court, normally will \"view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,</i> 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.1990). Here, however, the facts upon which our decision turns are undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1970s, two suits were brought against a number of municipalities subject to the Massachusetts Civil Service law (now codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167;&#167; 1-77). The suits alleged that the municipalities engaged in discriminatory recruitment and hiring practices whilst staffing their respective fire departments. These actions culminated in the entry of an omnibus consent decree that influenced the manner in which the affected municipalities could recruit and hire firefighters. <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. 507, 520-23 (D.Mass.1974) (<i>Beecher I</i>). The decree was affirmed on appeal. <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> 504 F.2d 1017, 1028 (1st Cir.1974) (<i>Beecher II</i>), <i>cert. denied,</i> 421 U.S. 910, 95 S.Ct. 1561, 43 L.Ed.2d 775 (1975). It has been in effect for nearly thirty years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Beecher</i> decree &#8212; courts consistently have used that phrase to include the original decree and subsequent orders entered to fine-tune it, <i>see, e.g., Mackin v. City of Boston,</i> 969 F.2d 1273, 1274 (1st Cir.1992), and we emulate that example &#8212; circumscribed the hiring of firefighters in much of Massachusetts over the ensuing years. Its history up to 1992 is well chronicled in the case law. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 1274-75. We urge readers who thirst for a more complete understanding of the genesis and operation of the decree to consult that opinion. For present purposes, we are content to note that the <i>Beecher</i> decree was intended to rectify a situation in which many fire departments within Massachusetts had remained lily-white, or nearly so, despite dramatic increases in the African-American and Hispanic populations. The decree sought to accomplish its goal by affirmative action, i.e., by fostering a hiring regime that accorded race-based preferences to blacks and Spanish-surnamed individuals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1274 n. 2. Each of the affected fire departments was to remain subject to the strictures of the decree (and, thus, to accord race-based preferences) until such time as that department met a general benchmark established by the decree: the attainment of parity (or, at least, rough parity). <i>See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523 (providing for release from the decree \"[a]s a city or town achieves a complement of minorities commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community\"). The meaning of this criterion, and the manner in which it is to be gauged, are questions that have permeated this litigation from the outset. Not surprisingly, those questions are central to the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike some forty-five other fire departments that heretofore have met the goals of the decree and gained release from its constraints, the Boston Fire Department (BFD) has operated under the auspices of the <i>Beecher</i> decree since 1974. A decade ago, a group of non-minority men, aspiring to appointments as firefighters within the BFD, endeavored to bring the City out from under the umbrella of the decree. <i>See Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1275. Although we affirmed the district court's rejection of that attempt, we noted that the decree was not meant to operate in perpetuity. To the contrary, it would remain in force as to any particular municipality only until its stated goal had been achieved. <i>Id.</i> at 1278. A decade has passed, but &#8212; despite increased diversity within the BFD &#8212; the City still hires firefighters in accordance with the <i>Beecher</i> decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That brings us to the events giving rise to the instant case. In 1998, the Candidates &#8212; Joseph Quinn, Sean O'Brien, Robert Dillon, Joseph Sullivan, and Roger Kendrick, Jr. &#8212; aspired to firefighter appointments in the BFD. All five are white males; as was required, they identified themselves as non-minority applicants. Each took the firefighter entrance examination administered by the Massachusetts Division of Personnel Administration (MDPA) and scored ninety-nine out of a possible one hundred points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates' scores satisfied the threshold criterion for employment. Along with all other qualifying applicants, they were placed on a civil service eligibility list in rank order. This ranking made allowance for various statutory preferences (e.g., veterans, residents, children of firefighters killed or disabled in the line of duty), ceding pride of place to the holders of such preferences in accordance with state law (even if those persons had earned lower test scores than other qualified candidates). <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167;&#167; 26, 40. None of these statutory preferences involve race or ethnicity, and none of them are challenged in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Preparing to hire fifty new firefighters, the BFD requested a certified list of eligible applicants from the Massachusetts Human Resources Division (HRD). The HRD selected individuals in rank order (based on statutory preferences and test scores) and grouped them into a putative \"hiring class.\" After screening out those individuals who stumbled over a variety of race-neutral preconditions (such as drug tests and physical examinations), the HRD composed a slate of \"hiring pairs\" by placing the highest ranking minority member and the highest ranking non-minority member into a group of two and then repeating the process until the hiring class had been exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2000, the BFD, following this rank order, chose twenty-five pairs from the eligibility list and appointed those fifty individuals as entry-level firefighters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Candidates were not among those selected. Although each received a letter from the BFD stating that the vacancies had been filled by persons who outranked him on the certification list, the record suggests that, had the BFD followed a strict rank-order selection process (without any consideration of race or ethnicity), the Candidates (or some of them) likely would have been in the top fifty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates (other than Kendrick, who joined the litigation at a later date) then sued the City. They argued that the City impermissibly had used preferences based on race and ethnicity to rank minorities ahead of them on the eligibility list. In the Candidates' view, this constituted discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (count 1), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4 (count 2), and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq. (count 3). The Candidates also attacked another aspect of the hiring process; they argued that requiring them to submit to medical examinations without a conditional offer of employment violated both federal and state law (counts 4-6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The district court granted the motion of the Boston Chapter of the NAACP to intervene as a party defendant. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates moved for summary judgment on the first three counts of their complaint or, in the alternative, for a preliminary injunction forbidding the City from filling at least five firefighter positions pending a resolution of the action. They maintained, among other things, that the City should not have applied the <i>Beecher</i> decree to the November 2000 hiring cycle because, by that time, the City had achieved parity in the firefighter force (and, therefore, had met the benchmark for release from the strictures of the decree). The defendants did not controvert the material facts, but, rather, opposed this motion as a matter of law and cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court denied the Candidates' motion and granted summary judgment for the defendants on counts 1 through 3. This appeal followed. Counts 4 through 6 remain pending before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is too familiar a proposition to require citation of authority that a federal court may not act beyond the scope of its jurisdiction. As a logical corollary, parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court by waiver or consent. <i>See Prou v. United States,</i> 199 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Horn,</i> 29 F.3d 754, 767-68 (1st Cir.1994). Consequently, when a court senses a potential lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it ought to inquire further regardless of whether the parties have raised the issue. <i>BIW Deceived v. Local S6,</i> 132 F.3d 824, 828 (1st Cir.1997). We must conduct such an inquiry here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the usual case, an appeal must await the entry of a final judgment, commonly regarded as a judgment that fully disposes of all claims asserted in the action. <i>See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 446 U.S. 1, 8, 100 S.Ct. 1460, 64 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980); <i>Spiegel v. Trustees of Tufts Coll.,</i> 843 F.2d 38, 42 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. There are, however, exceptions to the classic final judgment rule. One such exception, embodied in Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, allows the immediate entry of a partial final judgment as to fewer than all the claims in a multi-claim action \"upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.\" The district court made such a determination here and directed that a separate and final judgment enter as to counts 1 through 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this explicit direction, a jurisdictional problem looms. The law is firmly established in this circuit that a rote recital of Rule 54(b)'s talismanic phrase is not enough, in and of itself, to trump the wonted application of the final judgment rule. <i>See Spiegel,</i> 843 F.2d at 42 (endorsing the \"long-settled and prudential policy against the scattershot disposition of litigation\"). To warrant recourse to the special procedure envisioned by Rule 54(b), the district court typically must make an individualized assessment of the desirability and effect of an immediate appeal. <i>Id.</i> at 42-43. Thus, if a district court wishes to enter a partial final judgment on the ground that there is no just reason for delay, it should not only make that explicit determination but should also make specific findings and set forth its reasoning. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have warned that the parties have an obligation to bring this requirement to the district court's attention. <i>See id.</i> at 44 n. 5. In this instance, the parties did not fulfill this obligation, and the court neither made the requisite findings nor explicated the reasons underlying its Rule 54(b) certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this deviation from preferred practice is troubling, it is not necessarily fatal. We have noted that there are \"infrequent instances\" in which the record, on its face, makes it sufficiently apparent that the circumstances support an appeal from a partial judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 43 n. 4. This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts 1 through 3 of the complaint deal with the obligations and protections afforded by the <i>Beecher</i> decree. In contrast, counts 4 through 6 have very little to do with the decree (and nothing to do with race or ethnicity). Moreover, one of the principal parties &#8212; the NAACP &#8212; has no knowledge about (and, for aught that appears, no interest in) the claims still pending in the lower court. Given the discrete nature of the two sets of claims, the summary judgment decision appears to be \"final in the sense that it is an ultimate disposition of ... individual claim[s] entered in the course of a multiple claims action.\" <i>Curtiss-Wright,</i> 446 U.S. at 7, 100 S.Ct. 1460 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally as important, the proof needed to establish the allegations of counts 1 through 3 is materially different from the proof needed to establish the allegations of counts 4 through 6. By the same token, the legal issues are separate and distinct. Moreover, if the Candidates prevail on one or more of the first three counts and obtain satisfactory relief, counts 4 through 6 may well be rendered moot. This concatenation of circumstances means that, in all probability, there will be no significant duplication of effort in litigating one set of claims to a conclusion and then addressing the remaining set of claims. Such a lack of overlap strongly supports the finding of no just reason for delay (and, thus, the entry of a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b)). <i>See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez,</i> 23 F.3d 576, 580 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp.,</i> 942 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most important factor counseling in favor of allowing an immediate appeal in this case is the public interest. As a practical matter, a final resolution of the issues raised in counts 1 through 3 will have a broad impact on the future of all applicants for firefighter positions in the City of Boston. This is a vital concern, as hiring is ongoing. The district court recognized this consideration when it agreed to render an expedited decision on counts 1 through 3. <i>See Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 157 n. 3. In short, the nature of the issue calls out for immediate resolution: time is of the essence if for no other reason than that race-based hiring preferences inevitably shift some of the burden of remediation to innocent persons, <i>Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ.,</i> 476 U.S. 267, 280-81, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986) (plurality op.), and thus should not remain in place for any longer than necessary to alleviate the effects of past discrimination. <i>See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. 265, 308, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (plurality op.) (cautioning that such \"remedial action [must] ... work the least harm possible\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the \"findings\" requirement that we have superimposed on Rule 54(b) is important, but it is not to be applied woodenly. When the record and the interests of justice permit, we have on occasion relaxed the requirement. <i>See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis,</i> 23 F.3d at 580-81; <i>Feinstein,</i> 942 F.2d at 40. Given the factors enumerated above &#8212; especially the substantial public interest that attaches to an expeditious resolution of whether the <i>Beecher</i> decree should continue to constrain the BFD's hiring practices &#8212; we conclude that this is one of the rare cases in which, despite the absence of detailed district court findings, the conditions for the use of Rule 54(b) effectively have been met. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction over the Candidates' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having assumed jurisdiction, we turn to the merits of the appeal. We divide our discussion into five segments. First, we frame the issue. We next describe how a court is to assess whether the release point of the <i>Beecher</i> decree &#8212; parity &#8212; has been achieved, outlining the required comparison and delineating how to arrive at its component parts. Then, we do the mathematics. Finally, we address the question of relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Framing the Issue.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parity (or, at least, rough parity) is the key that unlocks the restrictions of the <i>Beecher</i> decree as to a particular community. The central issue in this appeal involves how parity should be calculated for that purpose. The parties agree that the relevant time frame is November of 2000. They also agree as to what sources of data are appropriate for use in this context; all parties accept the City's breakdown of the BFD's complement as of the relevant dates and cite data derived from the 2000 census to establish the appropriate labor pool. Their dispute revolves around what categories of this data govern the measurement of parity. The controlling algorithm has two components. One (which we shall call the first variable) relates to how one measures minority penetration within a particular fire department. The other (which we shall call the second variable) relates to how one measures minority representation in the community as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to these points, the Candidates argue that, under the <i>Beecher</i> decree, the first variable should be limited to the percentage of firefighters in the BFD (not including officers). This should be compared to the second variable, which they envision as the percentage of minorities in the City's employment-eligible population. On the other hand, the City and the intervenor contend that the first variable should represent the percentage of minorities in the BFD as a whole (including officers) and that the second variable should comprise the percentage of minorities in Boston's overall population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the doctrine of stare decisis dictated the composition of both variables. In the court's view, that doctrine required measuring parity by comparing the percentage of minorities in all ranks within the BFD to the percentage of minorities in the City's overall population. <i>Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 161 (accusing the Candidates of \"us[ing] a different statistical method than the one used in the <i>Beecher</i> decree\"). Since this calculation did not show that parity had been attained &#8212; the percentage of minorities within the BFD, including all ranks, was 31.5%, whereas the percentage of minorities in the overall population was slightly over 38% &#8212; the court granted the City's motion for summary judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 163.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address the nature of the two variables in the next two sections of this opinion. Before doing so, however, we pause to mention two sets of legal principles. First, because this litigation challenges a judicial decree affording race-based relief, any interpretation of the decree or any application of it in practice must survive strict scrutiny. <i>See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,</i> 515 U.S. 200, 235, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995) (\"Federal racial classifications, like those of a State, must serve a compelling governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.\"); <i>Stuart v. Roache,</i> 951 F.2d 446, 449 (1st Cir.1991) (concluding that all race-based classifications must pass strict scrutiny). This standard obliges an inquiring court to make a binary finding that the race-based relief is not only justified by a compelling governmental purpose but also narrowly drawn to fit the contours of that purpose. <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1275; <i>Stuart,</i> 951 F.2d at 449.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court ruled at the summary judgment stage. The role of summary judgment is to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and provide a means for prompt disposition of cases in which no trial-worthy issue exists. <i>See Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2000). This device should be employed only when the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review an order granting summary judgment de novo. <i>Suarez,</i> 229 F.3d at 53. This non-deferential review is particularly appropriate where, as here, the district court's grant of summary judgment is based on its application of abstract principles of law to essentially uncontradicted facts. <i>See Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 364, 369 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The First Variable.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the first variable to be used for measuring parity under the <i>Beecher</i> decree was the percentage of minority firefighters in the BFD as a whole. The court did not reach this conclusion through independent analysis, but, rather, premised it on the assumption that this issue had been fully litigated and settled in earlier proceedings. <i>See Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 162. Although we appreciate the district court's sensitivity to the role of precedent, an examination of the prior decisions touching upon the <i>Beecher</i> decree refutes the court's assumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the <i>Beecher I</i> court compared relative racial representation using quantitative data, it did so only to determine proper placement of the burden of proof as to what discriminatory effects could be attributed to the defendants' preexisting recruitment and hiring practices. <i>See</i> 371 F.Supp. at 514, 518-20. Thus, <i>Beecher I</i> did not mandate a particular parity-measuring formula for future use. That omission is understandable: the minuscule number of minorities in the affected fire departments at the time of the original <i>Beecher</i> decree negated any need for precise definition of how to measure anticipated minority penetration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court's initial affirmance of the <i>Beecher</i> decree is unhelpful on this point. In resolving that appeal, we stated that the <i>Beecher</i> decree would \"remain[ ] in force, for each local fire department, until that department attains sufficient minority fire fighters to have a percentage on the force approximately equal to the percentage of minorities in the locality,\" <i>Beecher II,</i> 504 F.2d at 1027. This statement begs the question of who is a \"firefighter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our subsequent opinion in <i>Mackin</i> likewise left open the issue of how to measure parity. That case rejected an argument that the <i>second</i> variable was the racial composition of the City as it existed in 1974 (when the <i>Beecher</i> decree was first entered). <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1276. We disposed of that argument without ruling on the significance of the figures presented vis-&#224;-vis the composition of the <i>first</i> variable. <i>See id.</i> Elsewhere in that opinion, we addressed an overbreadth challenge and held that the decree continued to survive strict scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> at 1278. In the process, we cited the language of the decree itself as an indicium of its limited life. <i>See id.</i> (acknowledging that the decree would \"remain[ ] in force only until its requirements have been met\"). Seen in this light, any elliptical references in <i>Mackin</i> as to how parity might be measured cannot be deemed a holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the district court erred in concluding that stare decisis supplies an answer to the question of how the first variable should be constructed brings us back to square one. While we recognize that \"district courts enforcing public law consent decrees have, in general, broad discretion in determining such matters as whether the objectives of the decree have been substantially achieved,\" <i>Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> 951 F.2d 1325, 1337 (1st Cir.1991), the court below did not exercise any such discretion. Instead, it offered its interpretation of judicial precedents dealing with the <i>Beecher</i> decree. Having found that interpretation wanting, we owe no particular deference to the district court's conclusion. <i>See Wessmann v. Gittens,</i> 160 F.3d 790, 795 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a district court's adjudication of a public sector consent decree does not warrant deference, \"[o]rdinary contract principles apply\" to the same extent as they apply to other consent decrees. <i>Navarro-Ayala,</i> 951 F.2d at 1339. This is especially true when, as now, the question involves determining the parties' original intent and, concomitantly, the scope of the arrangement to which they initially consented.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i> \"Parties to a consent decree are entitled to know that ... [it] will not be treated as a mere entering wedge which ... gives a district court untrammeled discretion to increase\" the depth and breadth of judicial supervision. <i>Id.</i> at 1339 n. 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the parties' competing interpretations of the term \"firefighter.\" As said, the Candidates view that term as encompassing only the lowest rank, that is, entry-level members of the BFD.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In contradistinction, the defendants view the term as encompassing all uniformed BFD personnel, including officers. In the abstract, it may seem possible to stretch the term \"firefighter\" to fit the defendants' vision &#8212; but this case does not deal with abstractions. Terms in a consent decree cannot be construed in a vacuum; they must instead be read in the context of the decree as a whole. <i>See Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank,</i> 985 F.2d 640, 646 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see generally</i> 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <i>Corbin on Contracts</i> &#167; 24.21, at 204 (Joseph M. Perillo rev. ed.1998). From that coign of vantage, the Candidates' definition is much more compelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigation underlying the <i>Beecher</i> decree arose out of discriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring <i>into entry-level positions. See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 509 (describing the focal point of the case as the municipalities' \"overall hiring policies for the position of firefighter\"). Consistent with this focus, the district court made specific findings of discriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring, and the decree was tailored to counteract the effects of that discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 520. This historical perspective sheds considerable light on the meaning of the term \"firefighter\" as used in the <i>Beecher</i> decree. Logically, the parties must have intended that term to refer to the class of jobs open to external hiring: entry-level firefighter positions. <i>See Fleet Nat'l Bank v. H &amp; D Entm't, Inc.,</i> 96 F.3d 532, 539 (1st Cir.1996) (interpreting terms of a settlement agreement in light of the aim of the litigants at the time of settlement); <i>see generally</i> 5 Corbin, <i>supra</i> &#167; 24.20, at 193. Only by interpreting the term \"firefighter\" in that manner is it possible to harmonize the wording of the decree with its evident purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other language in the decree supports this reading. The decree's first paragraph zeroes in on entry-level positions: it enjoins activities that \"discriminat[e] against any applicant or potential applicant for employment.\" <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 521. The decree purports to regulate the recruiting, certifying, and appointing of entry-level personnel and specifically refers to this three-part process as the \"hiring procedure.\" <i>See id.</i> at 522. Subsequent amendments, such as the interim consent decrees entered on April 17, 1975, and November 25, 1975, continue this emphasis on recruitment and hiring for entry-level positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Custom and usage within an affected industry or workplace can be important aids to the construction of a contract or consent decree. <i>See, e.g., Boston Police Superior Officers Fed'n v. City of Boston,</i> 147 F.3d 13, 17-18 (1st Cir.1998) (interpreting terms with otherwise broad usage narrowly according to usage within the relevant profession); <i>Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disab. Plan,</i> 70 F.3d 173, 179 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that \"usages of trade\" are relevant to interpreting terms of a contract). Here, the usage of the BFD supports the Candidates' definition of the term \"firefighter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the court below, the evidence showing the composition of the BFD differentiated the various ranks by specific title. These records consistently referred to the entry-level rank as \"Firefighter\" (sometimes written as \"Fire Fighter\" or \"Fire fighter\"). Corresponding to that term, the evidence showed the number of persons serving in the entry-level rank, broken down by race and ethnicity. That evidence referred to the other ranks &#8212; the officers &#8212; by such titles as \"Fire Lieutenant,\" \"Fire Captain,\" and \"District Fire Chief,\" giving the racial and ethnic composition of each such rank. This indicates that, within the BFD, the term \"firefighter\" carries with it specific duties, responsibilities, pay, and privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lexigraphic insights are frequently helpful in determining the meaning of specific words in consent decrees. <i>See, e.g., Gilday v. Dubois,</i> 124 F.3d 277, 285-86 (1st Cir.1997). Here, the mine-run of dictionary definitions tends to support the Candidates' version of the disputed term. A firefighter is said to be \"one who fights fires as a member of a municipal fire department,\" <i>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary</i> 855 (1993) (internal dictionary symbols omitted), or \"a person who fights destructive fires,\" <i>Random House Dictionary of the English Language</i> 722 (2d ed.1987), or, simply, \"a person who fights fires,\" <i>Merriam-Webster On-Line Dictionary</i> (2002), <i>at</i> http://www.mw.com/home.htm. These definitions uniformly emphasize the principal activity that firefighters perform. They show quite clearly that the term \"firefighter,\" in its ordinary sense, applies more naturally to those whose exclusive province is attempting to extinguish conflagrations as opposed to those in the higher echelons (who must handle a broader and more diversified range of activities, including administration and supervision). While the dictionary definitions of \"firefighter\" do not necessarily exclude those whom the defendants seek to include, they argue persuasively against their inclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law also militates against including higher ranks under the appellation \"firefighter.\" For example, in <i>Boston Police Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 17-18, we held that the term \"police officers\" used in a consent decree governing promotions within the Boston Police Department did not include <i>all</i> police officers, but, rather, encompassed only patrolmen. That case, like this one, illustrates the importance of honoring contextual constraints that may be placed on a word or phrase within the four corners of a consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; including higher ranks within the compass of the term \"firefighter\" would mean that the <i>Beecher</i> decree was not narrowly tailored to serve its stated purpose. Such an interpretation would effectively transform an instrument carefully crafted to eliminate discrimination in recruitment and hiring into general leverage favoring minorities in a much wider variety of matters. In most of those areas &#8212; promotion is a good example &#8212; no justification for systematic preferential treatment of minorities has been established. Thus, the transformation that necessarily would accompany an acceptance of the defendants' interpretive gloss would present an insurmountable constitutional obstacle. <i>See Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Because courts should avoid construing a consent decree in a constitutionally offensive way if a feasible alternative construction exists, this looming constitutional quandary is itself a cogent argument for rejecting the defendants' expansive view of the term \"firefighter.\" <i>Cf. Walsh v. Schlecht,</i> 429 U.S. 401, 408, 97 S.Ct. 679, 50 L.Ed.2d 641 (1977) (\"[C]ontracts should not be interpreted to render them illegal and unenforceable where the wording lends itself to a logically acceptable construction that renders them legal and enforceable.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The opposite pan of the scale contains nothing of sufficient weight to counterbalance this powerful asseverational array. Insofar as we can discern, interpreting the word \"firefighter\" to include higher ranks has no basis in the record. The decree is utterly silent as to activities affecting higher ranks, and the remainder of the record &#8212; both current and historical &#8212; is devoid of any allegation or finding that the BFD has ever discriminated against minorities in promotions or in other personnel practices involving those in (or aspiring to reach) the higher ranks. Indeed, the original <i>Beecher</i> plaintiffs would not have had standing to allege discrimination in such respects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Taking these facts into account, it unfairly belittles the <i>Beecher</i> court to read \"firefighter\" as that term is used in the decree to include all ranks (and, thus, to impute to the court the injudicious crafting of a remedy that reaches beyond the scope of the surrounding litigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, ably represented, nonetheless advance a plethora of counter-arguments. Only four of them require discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the City and the intervenor point to paragraph 11 of the interim consent decree of November 25, 1975. That proviso requires a municipality seeking to be released from the decree to petition the MDPA, informing that agency \"that the percentage of post-probationary minority uniformed personnel equals the percentage of minorities\" in that municipality. We do not believe that this casual (and wholly unexplained) linguistic switch from \"firefighter\" to \"uniformed personnel\" can be accorded decretory significance. This is especially so in light of two facts. First, that same proviso incorporates by reference paragraph 7 of the April 17, 1975 interim consent decree (which opens the way for release from the decree \"whenever a particular city or town has achieved a complement of Black or Spanish-surnamed firefighters commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community\"). Second, the preamble to the November 25 decree &#8212; the decree which introduced the term \"uniformed personnel\" into the litigation &#8212; unequivocally declared that \"<i>the parties consent</i> to entry of this Agreement to permit ... the establishment of an eligibility list for <i>the position of firefighter</i> ....\" (Emphasis supplied). In the final analysis, then, the phrase upon which the defendants rely leads us back to our starting point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that if the phraseology employed in the November 25, 1975 decree was intended to clarify that the earlier decrees affected more than the firefighter rank, it seems highly likely that the <i>Beecher</i> court would have used more precise language such as \"of all ranks\" or \"of any rank.\" But the <i>Beecher</i> court eschewed such language. What is more, the court demonstrated an inclination to use general descriptors for specific subject matter. <i>See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523 (using the general phrase \"complement of minorities\" to refer to the specific minority \"[g]roup of all eligible blacks and Spanish-surnamed persons\"). In our view, this proclivity undermines the inference that the defendants (and the dissent) seek to draw from the phrase \"post-probationary uniformed personnel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before leaving this point, we note that our dissenting colleague sees \"no basis for concluding that `firefighter' is the operative word\" in the <i>Beecher</i> decree and the two interim decrees that followed. Yet that word appears no fewer than twenty-six times in those decrees, while the term \"uniformed personnel\" appears only once. This repeated emphasis, especially when coupled with the fact that the litigation revolved around the position of firefighter and did not concern other ranks, makes it perfectly clear that \"firefighter\" is indeed the operative term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the defendants strive to convince us that we should defer to a 1987 memorandum issued by the MDPA, which indicates that, for <i>Beecher</i> purposes, the first variable should consist of \"the actual percentage of the authorized uniformed permanent full-time force which is made up of tenured Black or Hispanic officers of any rank.\" We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deference typically owed by a court to an administrative agency derives from the fact that the agency has been entrusted by a legislative body to administer a statute enacted under that branch's separate constitutional authority. <i>See Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <i>see also Fireside Nissan, Inc. v. Fanning,</i> 30 F.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir.1994) (reasoning that state officials' interpretation of state statute is entitled to deference). If the legislative branch has \"left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Thus, a court must defer to the agency's reasonable construction of a provision in the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, a state agency is helping to administer compliance not with a legislative enactment but with a federal judicial decree. A federal appellate court owes no deference to such an agency when endeavoring to discern the meaning and constitutional limits of such a decree. After all, if the judiciary is the final arbiter as to questions of statutory construction and must refuse to accept administrative interpretations that contradict clearly ascertainable legislative intent, <i>see id.</i> at 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778, courts certainly have the power &#8212; indeed, the duty &#8212; to reject an administrative construction that runs contrary to the manifest intent of a judicial decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the defendants posit a variation on the \"trickle up\" theory. <i>See, e.g., Stuart,</i> 951 F.2d at 452 (\"One obvious reason ... why there may have been few black sergeants in the Boston Police Force in 1978 is that the Department had not hired many black police officers before 1970. Since unjustified discrimination accounted for the latter fact, [it] cannot excuse the former.\"). They assert that not including higher ranks within the term \"firefighter\" would diminish the efficacy of the decree and reward appointing authorities for keeping minorities in the firefighter rank (thus perpetuating underrepresentation in the higher echelons). For that reason, they argue, it makes sense to require parity department-wide before allowing a community to escape from the constraints imposed by the <i>Beecher</i> decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is specious. We have determined, and the defendants concede, that the parties never intended the decree to address promotions. On that basis alone, it would be improper to extend the decree's reach by judicial fiat. <i>See Boston Police Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 17-18. Furthermore, alleging that unconstitutional hiring practices within the BFD have caused a disparate impact on the number of minorities in the higher echelons is a heavy charge. Such an allegation should not be addressed in the abstract, but, rather, should be squarely propounded by an injured party with standing to sue and litigated to a just conclusion. Because the litigation giving rise to the <i>Beecher</i> decree is of a different nature than the justification that the defendants now offer, the decree is a constitutionally insufficient vehicle for addressing that justification. <i>See id.</i> at 18; <i>see also Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 802 (\"The mere fact that an institution once was found to have practiced discrimination is insufficient, in and of itself, to satisfy a state actor's burden of producing the reliable evidence required to uphold race-based action.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the City and the intervenor make an argument of last resort. They contend that their interpretation of the term \"firefighter\" is proper because they have assumed all along that the term embraced more than entry-level personnel. In the circumstances of this case, such a contention does not get them very far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In pressing this point, the defendants lean heavily upon past practice of the MDPA and attempt to apply language derived from <i>Mackin</i> to that practice. There, we rejected the argument that static 1974 population figures controlled the measurement of parity. In so doing, we wrote that \"[f]ew things evidence a decree's meaning more persuasively than an immutable, decade-old pattern of past practice under the decree, consensually engaged in by all sides in the underlying litigation that produced the decree.\" 969 F.2d at 1276.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That language is inapposite here. In <i>Mackin,</i> we were using a uniformly accepted past practice to validate a facially plausible interpretation of the <i>Beecher</i> decree (i.e., that current population figures would control). <i>See id.</i> We deemed that past practice confirmatory of what appeared to be a commonsense reading of the verbiage chosen by the parties and approved by the district court. In contrast, the defendants here attempt to use an administrative practice first inaugurated in 1987 (thirteen years after the entry of the <i>Beecher</i> decree), and never directly challenged, to change the meaning of plain language and thus to validate an unlikely interpretation that is implausible in the context of the underlying litigation (and one which, in the bargain, would open the decree to constitutional attack). To the extent that the MDPA's past practice points toward that suggested interpretation, it lacks record support and therefore cannot dominate the decisional calculus. <i>See Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 802; <i>Stuart,</i> 951 F.2d at 454-55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To dwell on this issue would be pointless. It suffices to say that the history and purpose of the litigation, the language of the decree, and the usage of the BFD make manifest that the term \"firefighter,\" as used in the <i>Beecher</i> decree, was intended to include only those persons serving in the entry-level rank. Interpreting \"firefighter\" more broadly would rip the decree from its constitutional moorings, twist its language into something alien to its evident purpose, and violate settled principles of contract law. Accordingly, the proper parity-measuring device &#8212; what we have called the first variable &#8212; comprises the percentage of minorities in the entry-level rank of the BFD as of the relevant date (November of 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Second Variable.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the comparison that <i>Beecher</i> demands &#8212; the second variable &#8212; the Candidates, citing cases decided after the entry of the original <i>Beecher</i> decree, assert that in affirmative action employment cases minority representation must be measured against the specific adult population that comprises the qualified labor pool. <i>See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 501-02, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989); <i>Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n v. EEOC,</i> 478 U.S. 421, 479, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986); <i>Stuart,</i> 951 F.2d at 450, 453-54. They insist that any other focus would be unconstitutional and that, therefore, the relevant comparison in this case necessarily must be to Boston's over-19 black and Hispanic population. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 58 (requiring firefighters to be over 19 years of age).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that this point previously had been resolved. <i>Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 163. We agree that stare decisis governs. The last time around, we addressed this aspect of the standard for measuring compliance head-on and held that the proper data are the \"contemporaneous population figures [for] ... `the percentage of minorities within the community.'\" <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1276 (quoting the <i>Beecher</i> decree). At that time, we considered the very authorities upon which the Candidates now rely and specifically repudiated the notion that the pertinent language of the decree was overbroad. <i>Id.</i> at 1277-78. Thus, principles of stare decisis required the district court to reject the Candidates' version of how the second variable should be constructed. <i>See Planned Parenthood v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 854, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992) (recognizing that the doctrine of stare decisis embodies \"[t]he obligation to follow precedent\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we do not think that it is &#8212; we note that the <i>Beecher</i> decree unambiguously requires the use of the percentage of minorities in the general population as the second variable for gauging discriminatory patterns in entry-level hiring. <i>See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523; <i>see also Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1276 (enumerating portions of the <i>Beecher</i> decree that require, or plainly contemplate, reference to the percentage of minorities in the general population). That requirement is fully consistent with the authorities cited by the Candidates. <i>See Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 501, 109 S.Ct. 706 (\"In the employment context, we have recognized that for certain entry level positions requiring minimal training, statistical comparisons of the racial composition of the relevant population may be probative of a pattern of discrimination.\"). Whether or not some other standard might be more precise, the fact remains that the firefighter position is of the type contemplated by the <i>Croson</i> Court. Thus, the parties' original bargain for a community-wide pool and the district court's endorsement of that concept are entitled to great weight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Navarro-Ayala,</i> 951 F.2d at 1339 (reasoning that the district court is best able to decide certain types of parameters in public institutional reform litigation and, thus, is owed deference when the scope of the parties' original bargain is not at issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reaffirm, therefore, that the appropriate standard for measuring compliance with the <i>Beecher</i> decree &#8212; what we have termed the second variable &#8212; consists of contemporaneous population statistics depicting the percentage of minorities within the overall community. It follows that a fire department subject to the <i>Beecher</i> decree will remain so until that department succeeds in demonstrating that it has achieved \"the decree's actual objective: rough parity,\" <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1277, measured by establishing the percentage of minorities among entry-level firefighters in the particular department and comparing that ratio to the percentage of minorities within the general population of the local community. When this comparison demonstrates that parity (or, at least, rough parity) has been attained, then the <i>Beecher</i> decree has outlived its usefulness as to that community's firefighting force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Reworking the Algorithm.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this analysis, it is evident that the district court erred in constructing the first <i>Beecher</i> variable. In order to determine whether that error affected the Candidates' substantial rights, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 61, we rework the algorithm using the proper variables. If that algorithm does not yield ratios that show parity (or, at least, rough parity) between the percentage of minorities in the entry-level rank of the BFD and the percentage of minorities in the City of Boston as a whole, then the entry of summary judgment in the City's favor must stand. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that a grant of summary judgment may be affirmed on any independent ground revealed by the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this issue, the parties urging that parity has been achieved (here, the Candidates) bear the burden of proof. <i>See C.K. Smith &amp; Co., Inc. v. Motiva Enter. LLC,</i> 269 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir.2001). That is of purely academic interest in this case for the pertinent facts are uncontradicted. The court below developed the factual record sufficiently to demonstrate that, when the City recruited the 2000 hiring class, blacks and Hispanics comprised approximately 40% of the firefighters within the BFD. At the same time, blacks and Hispanics constituted slightly over 38% of Boston's overall population. <i>Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 162. Hence, parity had been achieved, and the City had become eligible for release from the strictures of the <i>Beecher</i> decree. <i>See Beecher II,</i> 504 F.2d at 1026-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these facts, the district court's error was not harmless. After all, a public employer who consents to the use of race as a factor in order to palliate the lingering effects of past discrimination must maintain continuous oversight in order to ensure that the decree works the least possible harm to other innocent persons competing for employment. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 308, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Once parity has been achieved, the decree has served its legitimate purpose, and the justification for it has abated. <i>See id.</i> at 309, 98 S.Ct. 2733. From that point forward, the employer has no basis to continue preferring minorities. <i>See id.; see also Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1276 (\"An intrusion by a federal court into the affairs of local government should be kept to a bare minimum and not be allowed to continue after the violation has abated and its pernicious effects have been cured.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the City's continued resort to race-based preferences from and after the time when parity was achieved fails the second prong of the strict scrutiny analysis. <i>See Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 309, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Thus, the City's adherence to the <i>Beecher</i> decree during the 2000 hiring cycle was unconstitutional. Consistent with the foregoing, we reverse the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the City and direct the court to enter judgment in the Candidates' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>Relief.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding does not end the matter: there remains the question of what remedy is appropriate under the circumstances. That is a highly ramified question, the answer to which is subject to the push and pull of competing centrifugal and centripetal forces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, a public employer's good faith reliance on a consent decree entered to remedy the effects of past discrimination should not lightly be disturbed. <i>See, e.g., Boston Police Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 25. That proposition has particular bite as to the firefighters who were appointed to the BFD during the 2000 hiring cycle, for the <i>Beecher</i> decree does not directly dictate hiring decisions, but, rather, simply directs municipalities to take affirmative action concerns into account in choosing among qualified applicants. <i>See Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1278 (explaining that \"only <i>qualified</i> minority candidates are specially advantaged; no minority candidate is placed on the eligibility list unless he or she has attained a passing score on the entrance examination\") (emphasis in the original). Constitutional violations rarely, if ever, justify the reversal of specific employment decisions previously made by government employers insofar as those decisions affect innocent parties. <i>See, e.g., Boston Police Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 25; <i>cf. Wygant,</i> 476 U.S. at 282-83, 106 S.Ct. 1842 (\"Denial of a future employment opportunity is not as intrusive as loss of an existing job.\"). The history of this case offers a striking example of this truism: the <i>Beecher</i> court, despite its finding of pervasive past discrimination, did not disturb the livelihood of those firefighters who were on the force in 1974. <i>See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 520 (noting the need to \"preserv[e] morale within the fire departments\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, we have acknowledged that when job applicants have been denied equal protection of the laws by a public employer, \"[t]he result, not the specific intent, is what matters.\" <i>Beecher II,</i> 504 F.2d at 1021 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In that spirit, the original <i>Beecher</i> court invoked its equitable powers to fashion affirmative relief for a perceived injury even after explicitly disavowing any finding that the \"exclusionary policy [giving rise to the litigation] ha[d] been followed intentionally or by design.\" <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Candidates have neither offered any evidence that the City acted in bad faith nor otherwise set forth a plausible basis that would justify a court in second-guessing the specific decisions made by the City in the 2000 hiring cycle. In a similar vein, they have not established that the persons actually hired were either complicit in some scheme or somehow undeserving of their appointments. Consequently, there is no principled basis for turning back the clock and revoking those appointments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That does not mean, however, that the Candidates are entitled to no more than a handshake or a tip of the hat. The fact remains that they have succeeded in showing that the City applied a consent decree, previously held to be constitutional, for too long. The result was that the City infringed the Candidates' constitutional rights when it acted upon their applications for appointment to the BFD. They should at least have had the opportunity to compete for the positions that they coveted free of the constraints imposed by the <i>Beecher</i> decree. <i>See Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 308, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Balancing these competing considerations, we hold that the BFD's decisions to appoint specific individuals during the 2000 hiring cycle were valid exercises of its responsibility to provide the citizens of Boston with a full complement of qualified firefighters. <i>See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 520. Nevertheless, the application of the decree to the 2000 hiring cycle violated the Candidates' constitutional rights by depriving them of an equal opportunity to compete for positions on the BFD. <i>See Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 308, 98 S.Ct. 2733. On remand, the district court must sort through this tangle and determine, in its sound discretion, the appropriate remedy for the Candidates' injury (excluding, however, any form of relief that would require dismissal of any provisionally or permanently appointed firefighter currently serving in the BFD).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The goal of the <i>Beecher</i> decree was to eliminate discriminatory practices in the recruitment and hiring of firefighters in communities subject to the Massachusetts Civil Service laws, and, relatedly, to remedy the effects of past discrimination in recruitment and hiring. Remediation has taken more than a quarter-century. At long last, however, that objective has been achieved with respect to the BFD; parity has been reached between the percentage of minority firefighters in the BFD and the percentage of minorities in the City as a whole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is a significant landmark along the road to equality, we add a word of caution. We are not Pollyannas, and we recognize that achieving parity at the firefighter level is not tantamount to saying that all is well in regard to racial and ethnic issues within the BFD as a whole. To the extent that inequalities remain, however, they are not within the compass of either the <i>Beecher</i> decree or this litigation. Nor will we reach out for them &#8212; issues of constitutional magnitude should not be the subject of speculation, but, rather, should be litigated fully by parties with standing to represent various pertinent points of view. For today, we fulfill our responsibility by holding that the City's appointment of firefighters ought no longer be subject to the strictures of the <i>Beecher</i> decree. We need go no further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

He says that the Candidates do not argue that the parties' original intent encompassed only the entry-level rank. That is literally true, but it overlooks the fact that the Candidates place the scope of the decree squarely at issue and argue that constitutional principles require such an interpretation. To address that argument, our analysis necessarily begins with a \"determination of the parties' intent when they entered into the stipulation.\"<i>Navarro-Ayala,</i> 951 F.2d at 1339.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Throughout, all references to \"entry-level\" positions should be understood to mean post-probationary non-officer positions. This qualification is compelled by explicit language in the<i>Beecher</i> decree enjoining \"further certifications of <i>permanent</i> appointments ... to the <i>position of firefighter</i>\" until certain requirements of the decree are met. <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 521 (emphasis supplied). That reference is reinforced by language in the decree that differentiates between permanent and provisional appointments. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> <i>Beecher</i> was a consolidated set of class actions in which the district court certified two classes.

He also observed that, prior to 1971, the minimum age had been 21. <i>Id.</i> Mindful of this shift, he concluded that the community population as a whole would be an appropriate measure of compliance. This seems supportable in light of Judge Freedman's recognition that the enjoined party had the power to reconfigure the contours of the labor pool. The authorities cited by the Candidates involve parties without such leverage vis-&#224;-vis the reach of the remedy; where such leverage exists, however, measuring parity against general population statistics prevents a public employer enjoined for discriminatory practices in violation of federal law from manipulating the remedy to suit its fancy. So viewed, Judge Freedman's shaping of the second variable is a good example of why \"broad judicial discretion [is often] crucial for the district judge to secure complex legal goals.\" <i>Navarro-Ayala,</i> 951 F.2d at 1338 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Our dissenting brother never squarely addresses the Candidates' argument that \"even assuming that general population statistics are to be considered, the minority composition of the Department's firefighters (39.9%) exceeded the minority composition of the general population of Boston (38.3%). The examination of parity should focus on minority representation in the firefighter position alone .... The racial preferences at issue apply solely to the firefighter position.\" Appellants' Brief at 23 (internal cross-references and paragraph structure omitted). This is a changed circumstance requiring an examination into \"whether the goals of the litigation ... have been completely achieved,\"<i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1275, as well as a question posed for the first time involving the decree's constitutional application. Viewed in either fashion, the question warrants strict scrutiny. <i>See Rufo v.

Our dissenting brother, however, says only that he \"cannot imagine that the plaintiffs in the <i>Beecher</i> litigation would have decided upon a remedy that provides incentives [to keep minorities in the entry-level rank].\" This is the stuff not of strict scrutiny but of rational basis review. <i>See, e.g., FCC v. Beach Comm'ns, Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993) (upholding law under rational basis review \"based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority frames the critical issue as one involving \"competing interpretations of the term firefighter.\" I respectfully disagree that this is the central issue in the dispute. Indeed, the majority attributes an argument to the Candidates that they have not made in this litigation &#8212; that the court and the parties to the <i>Beecher</i> decree understood as a matter of original intent that minority presence in the fire departments subject to the decree would be calculated by considering only the entry-level firefighter rank. The Candidates acknowledge that \"[w]hen the <i>Beecher</i> decree was originally conceived, its apparent goal was to generate racial parity in the Fire Department as a whole, as opposed to merely the firefighter ranks.\" Instead, the Candidates argue that we should focus only on the entry-level ranks because changed circumstances since 1974 and 1992, when we last reviewed the <i>Beecher</i> decree in <i>Mackin v. City of Boston,</i> 969 F.2d 1273 (1st Cir.1992), render the original intent of the decree unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the Candidates had asked us to determine the original intent of the parties on the calculation of parity, it is a mistake to frame the issue as a search for the meaning of the term \"firefighter.\" As I will explain in more detail, there is no consistent use of the word \"firefighter\" as the operative term in the calculation of parity. Instead, there are a variety of terms used, only one of which is the word \"firefighter.\" The relevant question, then, is which of the early formulations of the measurement of parity captures the intent of the parties and the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dissent proceeds in three parts. In part I, I address the majority's conclusion that the <i>Beecher</i> decree always contemplated that the first variable, to use the majority's language, would only consider the percentage of minorities in the entry-level firefighter ranks. In Part II, I address the majority's assertion that narrow tailoring requires this interpretation of the decree to avoid constitutional problems. In Part III, I evaluate the Candidates' argument that changed circumstances since the entry of the <i>Beecher</i> decree require that the decree <i>now</i> be read to measure parity by focusing only on the firefighter ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Interpreting the Decree</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the original <i>Beecher</i> decree issued on February 8, 1974, the court used the phrase \"complement of minorities\" in the operative sentence explaining when a city's fire department could receive an exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. 507, 523 (D.Mass.), <i>aff'd</i> 504 F.2d 1017 (1st Cir.1974). In its Interim Consent Decree of April 17, 1975 (signed by the parties), the court for the first time used the term \"firefighter\" in explaining the process for obtaining an exemption: \"The Director [of Personnel Administration] shall notify the plaintiffs and supply evidence to the plaintiffs whenever a particular city or town has achieved a <i>complement of Black and Spanish-surnamed firefighters</i> commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community ....\" <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> No. 72-3060-F, slip op. at 4 (D.Mass. Apr. 17, 1975) (emphasis added). Soon thereafter, though, the parties signed the \"Agreement to Effectuate Interim Consent Decree,\" which again discusses exemptions. Paragraph 11 of that Agreement states: \"No fire department ... may be exempted ... unless the appointing authority has first petitioned the Division that the percentage of <i>post-probationary minority uniformed personnel</i> equals the percentage of minorities in the city or town served by said department ....\" <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> No. 72-3060-F, slip op. at 6 (D.Mass. Nov. 25, 1975) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presented with these three formulations, the majority chooses to focus on the word \"firefighter\" in the April 1975 Interim Consent Decree as the critical word and dismisses the formulation in the final agreement of the parties (\"the percentage of post-probationary minority uniformed personnel\") as a \"casual (and wholly unexplained) linguistic switch.\" This dismissive characterization seems odd, especially since the phrase \"post-probationary minority uniformed personnel\" in the November 1975 Agreement is far closer to the general language of the original <i>Beecher</i> decree (\"complement of minorities\") than the word \"firefighter\" used in the April Interim Decree. The \"complement of minorities\" and \"post-probationary minority uniformed personnel\" formulations also seem to capture the purpose that the <i>Beecher</i> court attributed to its own decree &#8212; to remedy the \"exclusion of minorities from the fire department\" &#8212; than does the word \"firefighter.\" <i>Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 519-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, there is support for competing views in the shifting word choices of these three decrees. The language itself does not tell us definitively what the court and parties intended for the measure of the first variable. But the use of the word \"firefighter\" is part of the ambiguity &#8212; not the answer to it. In the sequence of language in the three decrees, there is no basis for concluding that \"firefighter\" is the operative word and that determining its plain meaning will answer the intent question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Instead, we must acknowledge that the competing formulations of the first variable create an inescapable ambiguity which must be resolved by resort to extrinsic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already opined in this litigation on the kind of persuasive evidence that helps resolve such ambiguities. \"Few things evidence a decree's meaning more persuasively than [a] ... pattern of past practice under the decree ....\" <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1276. The City and the NAACP produced evidence that Massachusetts has required municipalities seeking exemptions from the decree to compare the percentage of minorities in the population of their city or town to the percentage of minority personnel among their departments' <i>entire uniformed personnel.</i> Using this formula, forty-five municipalities originally subject to the decree have received exemptions. An affidavit in the record explains that no department's appointing authority has objected to this formula since it has been in place. This understanding of the decree has been memorialized in a 1987 memorandum circulated by the Massachusetts Department of Personnel Administration outlining \"the process and the criteria for seeking approval for exemption\" from the <i>Beecher</i> decree. This memorandum, using the same terminology as the November 1975 Agreement, states that a municipality must consider the \"full-time uniformed force\" and calculate the percentage of \"<i>post-probationary</i> (tenured) full-time permanent Black or Hispanic members of the uniformed force\" to determine whether parity has been achieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority dismisses the importance of this memorandum, concluding that \"a federal appellate court owes no deference to [a state agency helping to administer compliance with a federal judicial decree] when endeavoring to discern the meaning and constitutional limits of such a decree.\" As a generality this point is a fair one. But this memorandum from the Massachusetts Department of Personnel Administration demonstrates much more than a reasonable interpretation of ambiguous language in a federal decree by a helpful state agency. This memorandum describes a \"pattern of past practice\" of the application of language in the November 1975 Agreement by one of the parties to the original litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioners of the Massachusetts Division of Civil Service were some of the named defendants in the consolidated <i>Beecher</i> litigation. At some point, the Department of Personnel Administration became the successor to the Division of Civil Services and responsible for carrying out the remedial provisions of the decree. Paragraph 1 of the April 1975 decree describes how the \"Director of Civil Service [hereinafter Director shall mean the Director, his successors, or after July 1, 1975, the Personnel Administrator]\" should implement the original <i>Beecher</i> decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Paragraph 1 of the November 1975 Agreement refers to \"The Division<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> of Personnel Administration (formerly known as the Division of Civil Service, and hereinafter, the `Division') ....\" Paragraph 11 of the November 1975 Agreement designates the \"Division\" as the agency to which municipal fire departments should apply for exemptions from the decree. The November 1975 Agreement was also signed by counsel for the \"Director of Personnel Administration.\" The memorandum in question, then, was not issued by an agency that was a stranger to the underlying litigation. Instead, it was crafted by a party to the <i>Beecher</i> litigation with the court-ordered responsibility to review the petitions of municipal fire departments for exemption from the decree. Under these circumstances, the insistence in <i>Mackin</i> on the persuasive value of a pattern of past practice under the decree is particularly apt. <i>See also Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> 951 F.2d 1325, 1353 (1st Cir.1991) (Cyr, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (analogizing a consent decree to a contract: \"Under a well-established rule of contract interpretation, the court may look to the parties' <i>post-contract</i> course of conduct and performance to ascertain the `practical interpretation and application' that the parties themselves attached to the ambiguous contract language.\") (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority says that <i>Mackin</i>'s directive to consider post-execution practice to interpret the decree's meaning is \"inapposite\" in this case because the evidence of the practice in question is being used \"to change the meaning of plain language and thus to validate an unlikely interpretation\" of the <i>Beecher</i> decree. However, there is no plain language in the decrees on the issue of the first variable, and the \"unlikely interpretation\" was one adopted by one of the parties to the underlying litigation and complied with by many other municipalities subject to the decree. Therefore, the majority's interpretation of the decree runs contrary both to Massachusetts's demonstrated understanding of it and to the lengthy history of its application in granting many exemptions from the decree over a period of at least sixteen years (that is, since 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also difficult to reconcile the majority's interpretation of the decree with incentives that would have seemed sensible to the parties to the decree. If, at the time the decree was entered, a city fire department knew that it needed to show parity only in its entry-level class to receive an exemption from the decree, it could achieve its goals more quickly by keeping all the minority firefighters it hired at the entry level &#8212; that is, by selecting for promotion only non-minority firefighters. The majority's interpretation would have provided an incentive for fire departments <i>not</i> to promote the black and Hispanic firefighters it hired under the terms of the decree. Every minority firefighter promoted to an officer position would have been another black or Hispanic member of the department that did not count towards the calculation of parity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there is no evidence in the record that the Boston Fire Department (\"BFD\") has ever discriminated against black and Hispanic firefighters in its previous promotion decisions, the majority's interpretation of the decree creates an incentive for discriminatory behavior for those municipalities still subject to the decree after the resolution of this case. I cannot imagine that the plaintiffs in the <i>Beecher</i> litigation and the district court would have decided upon a remedy that provides incentives so at odds with the purpose of the litigation and the relief ordered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Narrow Tailoring</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its interpretation of the <i>Beecher</i> decree, the majority contends that the interpretation advanced by the city and the NAACP \"would mean that the <i>Beecher</i> decree was not narrowly tailored to serve its stated purpose.\" In elaborating on this point, the majority raises another argument that was not raised by the Candidates:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an interpretation would effectively transform an instrument carefully crafted to eliminate discrimination in recruitment and hiring into general leverage favoring minorities in a much wider variety of matters. In most of those areas &#8212; promotion is a good example &#8212; no justification for systematic preferential treatment of minorities has been established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I understand it, the majority reasons that the interpretation of the <i>Beecher</i> decree advocated by the NAACP and the city would impermissibly benefit minority firefighters by somehow giving them preferences for promotions even though the <i>Beecher</i> court made no findings regarding the constitutionality of the promotion policies of the fire departments subject to the decree. This effect of the <i>Beecher</i> decree, the majority concludes, would render it unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree with this conclusion because the decree does not in fact have the effect of granting minorities preferential treatment in promotions. That is, I fail to see how merely calculating parity by taking the entire department into consideration leads to a \"systematic preferential treatment of minorities\" in the promotion process. First, there is no evidence in the record that minority firefighters hired in accordance with the <i>Beecher</i> decree have received preferences for promotions. Therefore, the majority's conclusion about such an effect is entirely speculative. Second, the logic of the majority's \"preferential treatment\" argument is problematic. By its terms, the <i>Beecher</i> decree does not explicitly address the promotion policies of the BFD or any other fire department in any way. Whether parity is calculated by taking into consideration merely entry-level firefighters, or by also including lieutenants, captains, and chiefs, the decree does not mandate changes in the department's promotion practices. Because the criteria for promoting firefighters, whatever they may be, are independent from the hiring criteria, the <i>Beecher</i> court's alterations to the BFD's hiring criteria have no effect on its promotion criteria. Therefore, whether or not the <i>Beecher</i> decree continues to direct the method by which the department <i>hires</i> new firefighters, we can only assume, without any evidence to the contrary, that the department will continue to decide <i>promotions</i> in the same way it always has.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, by design, the decree results in an increase in the diversity of the class from which the BFD selects the firefighters for promotion. However, this consequence of the decree cannot be \"general leverage favoring minorities.\" In any organization that promotes from within, the application of a hiring decree that results in the employment of minorities that otherwise would not have been hired necessarily increases the possibility that some of those minorities will be promoted to officers and thereby change the racial makeup of the officer ranks. Just because the decree has the consequence of changing the racial composition of the pool of those eligible for promotions does not mean that it is unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Changed Circumstances</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the Candidates concede that, \"[w]hen the <i>Beecher</i> decree was originally conceived, its apparent goal was to generate racial parity in the Fire Department as a whole, as opposed to merely the firefighter ranks.\" However, they argue that after twenty-eight years, \"a different analysis must be used if the decree is to be implemented in a constitutionally acceptable manner.\" Specifically, the Candidates point to three changed circumstances that they claim require a revised interpretation of the decree. First, they say that it has become evident over time that the decree is ineffective for the purpose of generating racial diversity in the upper ranks of the BFD. Second, the Candidates remind us that twenty-eight years have elapsed since the entry of the <i>Beecher</i> decree, and argue that this is simply too long to wait for the realization of rough parity. Third, when the scope of the inquiry is restricted to consideration of only entry-level firefighters, statistics show that the percentage of minority firefighters exceeds the percentage of minorities in the community, resulting in an \"excess of parity\" at the entry level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frankly, I am at a loss to understand this third \"changed circumstance\" as a discrete argument. The Candidates offer two variations of \"excess of parity.\" In the first, the Candidates use a computation of parity that the majority has rightly rejected. That computation reflects the difference between the percentage of minority firefighters (39.9%) and the minority population of Boston aged 18 and older (32.6%). I agree with the majority that stare decisis requires the use of the percentage of minorities in the general population, rather than the adult population, as the second variable for gauging parity. In the alternative, the Candidates assert that \"even assuming that general population statistics are to be considered, the minority composition of the Department's firefighters (39.9%) exceeded the minority composition of the general population of Boston (38.3%).\" However, after conceding that \"[w]hen the <i>Beecher</i> decree was originally conceived, its apparent goal was to generate racial parity in the Fire Department as a whole, as opposed to merely the firefighter ranks,\" the Candidates do not use this formulation of \"excess of parity\" to articulate a distinct constitutional argument. Instead, they use the statistics as evidence that the decree is not effective for the purposes of achieving this \"apparent goal\" of racial diversity in the upper ranks of the BFD. Hence, because \"excess of parity\" in the firefighter rank is inescapably tied to the first \"changed circumstance\" argument relating to the ineffectiveness of the decree, I will not address this \"excess of parity\" argument independently. Instead, I will incorporate my discussion of excess parity in the ineffectiveness argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While modification of a consent decree is warranted if there is \"a significant change either in factual conditions or in law,\" <i>Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,</i> 502 U.S. 367, 384, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), \"a party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree.\" <i>Id.</i> at 383, 112 S.Ct. 748. The Candidates have failed to carry this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Ineffectiveness of the Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates assert that although 39.9% of entry-level firefighters in the BFD are minorities, only 6.2% (22 of 350) of uniformed personnel above the rank of firefighter are minorities. They assert that \"after 28 years, this is not a temporary status,\" and that continuation of the decree will only increase disparity in favor of minorities at the entry level. Claimants argue that this changed circumstance implicates narrow tailoring because the <i>Beecher</i> decree has proven ineffective in achieving its goals. In other words, the unexpected barrier between the entry-level and the upper ranks, experienced by minorities within the BFD, demonstrates that the race-conscious hiring process is not narrowly tailored to serve the decree's goals of parity within the BFD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interestingly, the majority's narrow tailoring argument and the Candidates's narrow tailoring argument are based on contradictory factual premises. The majority rejects the inclusion of higher ranks in the computation of parity because, in part, such inclusion unconstitutionally transforms the decree into an instrument of \"general leverage favoring minorities\" in promotions. By contrast, the Candidates assert that the decree is unconstitutional because it is ineffective in furthering the promotion of minorities to the upper ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two ways to understand the Candidates' ineffectiveness argument. The Candidates may be arguing that the <i>Beecher</i> decree, as originally conceived, requires parity at both the entry-level and among the upper ranks. Because of the alleged barrier to the promotion of minority firefighters, the Candidates contend that the decree is ineffective in achieving this goal. Alternatively, they may be arguing that the purpose of the decree is to achieve parity in the department as a whole, irrespective of the distribution of minorities at all levels of the department. Given the barrier to promotions, they assert that the only way this parity can be achieved is indirectly &#8212; that is, by impermissible \"overloading\" of minorities at the entry-level to \"offset\" the lack of diversity in the upper ranks &#8212; and that this effect is fatal to narrow tailoring. I will address separately these variations of the ineffectiveness argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Parity at the Entry Level and in the Upper Ranks</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates's first ineffectiveness argument is premised on their characterization of the original purpose of the decree, described as an assumption. That is, they attribute to the district court in <i>Beecher</i> the assumption that \"once the discriminatory effects of the entrance hurdles were removed, minorities would trickle through the fire department somewhat evenly.\" There is a basic flaw in this premise. At the time the <i>Beecher</i> decree was entered, the percentage of minority firefighters in the BFD was less than one percent. It would have been pointless for the <i>Beecher</i> court to make any assumptions about promotion practices when the total number of minorities in the BFD was negligible. Moreover, the court did not enter its decree only to remedy discrimination in the Boston fire department. The <i>Beecher</i> court made fifty-five other municipalities in Massachusetts subject to the <i>Beecher</i> decree, and specifically noted the disproportionately low percentage of minorities in the \"total force\" of other towns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Essentially, there were few minorities to promote in any of the cities or towns, and the Candidates never explain why the <i>Beecher</i> court would have made any assumptions about promotion practices. Therefore, it is unpersuasive to attribute to the <i>Beecher</i> court the assumption described in the Candidates' brief that \"once the discriminatory effects of the entrance hurdles were removed, minorities would trickle through the fire department somewhat evenly.\" Instead, it is more reasonable to attribute to the <i>Beecher</i> court the goal reflected in the explicit language of the decree: \"a complement of minorities commensurate with the percentage of minorities\" within each municipality. <i>Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523. The City, an original party to the decree, states the purpose of the decree well in its brief: \"increasing the total gross proportion of minority fire personnel in each appointing authority.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, as noted earlier, the <i>Beecher</i> court discusses the purpose of the decree in its original opinion ordering remedial action and establishing the framework for the subsequent consent decree. There it states that in 1974 \"blacks and Spanish-surnamed persons represent such an insignificant percentage of the force,\" and that these \"present effects of past discrimination must be remedied.\" <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 519-20. The decree says nothing about anticipating racial proportionality in both the entry-level and the upper ranks. The Candidates' argument of ineffectiveness in achieving such proportionality fails because it is premised on a goal that is nowhere discernible in the <i>Beecher</i> decree or decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Parity in the Department as a Whole</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the purpose of the <i>Beecher</i> decree is to diversify the entire department, without regard to the even distribution of minorities in the entry level and upper ranks, the Candidates argue that, given the barrier to minority promotion in the department, continuation of the decree will only increase disparity in favor of minorities at the entry level. From this changed circumstance, the Candidates offer a complicated narrow tailoring argument that does not lend itself to easy summary. Hence, I quote it at length:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the method of promotion is appropriate, is not discriminatory, and nevertheless leads to racial disparity at the top levels, then it is inappropriate to try to \"offset\" legitimate promotions with an increased minority presence at the bottom. In other words, parity may currently exist in the upper levels of the Fire Department, in that it may reflect the appropriate proportion of minorities in the <i>qualified</i> labor pool for such promotions.... If so, this parity can not be used to justify further hiring quotas in the lower ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, if lack of minorities at the top levels is the result of a discriminatory promotional procedure (of which there is no proof), the requirement to \"narrowly tailor\" racial preferences requires that the specific promotional problem be addressed directly, and not indirectly through affirmative action at the lowest level. Indeed, more minorities in a lower position does not remedy the problem of a \"discriminatory\" promotional process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To comply with strict scrutiny, a racial remedy must be <i>effective.</i> It is inappropriate to address alleged disparity in the upper ranks indirectly using racial preferences to fill the lower ranks, when minorities are not being promoted in proportionate numbers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates's narrow tailoring argument asserts that there are <i>only</i> two possible causes for the discrepancy between the percentage of minorities at the entry-level and the percentage of minorities in the upper ranks: (a) the low percentage of minorities in the upper ranks is an accurate reflection of the qualified applicant pool, or (b) the low percentage of minorities reflects discrimination in the promotion process. They say that if the barrier to promotion is due to the lack of qualified minority applicants, then the decree is not narrowly tailored because it requires the overloading of minorities at the entry-level to offset this dearth of minorities qualified for the upper ranks. Alternately, if the barrier to promotion is due to discrimination, the decree is ineffective in addressing this problem because it focuses only on hiring practices. Since there are only two possible causes of the discrepancy between the percentage of minorities at the entry-level and the percentage of minorities in the upper ranks, and each cause demonstrates that the decree is not narrowly tailored to serve the decree's goals of parity within the entire Fire Department, the Candidates argue that this \"conundrum,\" as they describe it, conclusively proves that the decree fails the narrow tailoring test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This logic reveals another flawed premise. Causes (a) and (b) do not represent the universe of possible explanations for the discrepancy. In fact, the City offers a third plausible and constitutionally sound explanation. Based on its experience with public employment affirmative action programs, the City posits that it may just take a long time for affirmative action measures at the entry level of the BFD to influence minority representation in the higher ranks. Instead of being evidence of a barrier to promotion, the fact that only 6.2% of the higher ranks of the department is minority may evidence an inescapably slow process of growing diversity throughout the department. At the time the <i>Beecher</i> decree was implemented in 1974, minorities represented only 0.9% of the total BFD. <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 514. While far from representative of the minority population of the community, the 6.2% minority representation in the upper ranks is a significant increase indicating that the decree, however slowly, is fostering diversity in the upper ranks. Indeed, there has been a demonstrable increase in the number of minority officers recently. The City's response to the Candidates' interrogatories, included in the summary judgment record, indicates that there were 17 minority officers in 1998, 18 in 1999, and 22 in 2000. Over a span of two years, the percentage of minority officers increased from 4.8% to 6.2%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the slow rate of change in the officer ranks is not surprising in an organization the size of the BFD. While the department employs over 1500 firefighting personnel, only 350 of those hold officer positions &#8212; less than 25 percent. Although the record reveals that it is not uncommon for Boston to hire 50 new firefighters in a particular year, it is highly unlikely that a department with only 350 officer positions will promote that many over the same time period. Because the annual promotion rate will generally be much lower than the annual hiring rate, evidence that minorities are not penetrating the upper levels of the department as quickly as the entry level is predictable. In concluding that there is an intractable barrier to minority promotion in the department merely because there are only 22 minority officers, the Candidates take too grudging a view of progress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With their conundrum argument, the Candidates have constructed an argument designed to succeed on the basis of logic instead of proof: because both of the possible explanations for the discrepancy between the percentages of minorities in the entry-levels and upper ranks indicate a lack of narrow tailoring, they assert that they do not have to prove the reality of either explanation. However, as noted, the logic is faulty because it fails to account for other plausible and constitutionally sound explanations for the discrepancy. Therefore, even on the assumption that there might be a narrow tailoring problem with the <i>Beecher</i> decree if either of the Candidates' explanations of the discrepancy were real (unqualified applicants for promotion or discriminatory promotion practices), the Candidates must offer proof of one of these explanations. They have failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Candidates themselves point out, there is no evidence of discriminatory promotion practices. The alternative \"unqualified applicants\" explanation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> is objectionable on a number of grounds. First, the <i>Beecher</i> court found that the entrance examination for firefighters was not indicative of job performance and had a discriminatory impact on minorities. <i>Beecher</i> 371 F.Supp. at 517-18. Second, as we made clear in <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1278, the <i>Beecher</i> court specifically designed the decree to require the hiring of only qualified applicants. Third, the Candidates themselves assert that the entry-level and promotional positions have \"markedly different skill, experience and knowledge requirements,\" making performance on the entrance examination of little relevance to promotional success. There is simply no proof in this record that the 6.2% statistic represents the \"appropriate proportion of minorities in the <i>qualified</i> labor pool for such promotions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates bear the burden of proving the existence of changed circumstances undermining the constitutionality of a consent decree. <i>Rufo,</i> 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. 748. Mere recitation of the current statistics describing the racial composition of the entry-level and upper ranks is insufficient. Thus, the Candidates have failed to carry their burden of proving substantial changed circumstances affecting the constitutional validity of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Duration of the Decree</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we rejected this argument when we decided <i>Mackin,</i> the Candidates argue that the passage of time (now twenty eight years) is itself a changed circumstance that demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the <i>Beecher</i> decree. That argument is as unpersuasive now as it was when we decided <i>Mackin.</i> Then we said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he decree's life is limited, remaining in force only until its requirements have been met.... Indeed, the proof of the present pudding is that, since 1974, more than fifty percent of the communities originally affected by the decree have already been freed from further oversight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1278 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today, the fifty percent figure cited in <i>Mackin</i> ten years ago has reached eighty percent, with forty-five out of fifty-six communities originally affected by the decree having now achieved parity and thus exclusion from further oversight. The <i>Beecher</i> decree remains limited in duration because it is extinguished upon the achievement of a demonstrably attainable rough parity. <i>See Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523 (providing for release from appointment process mandated by the decree \"as a city or town achieves a complement of minorities commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community\"). Limitations of this sort are crucial factors in evaluating overbreadth challenges. <i>See Stuart v. Roache,</i> 951 F.2d 446, 454 (1st Cir.1991). Nothing about the race-conscious appointment process of the <i>Beecher</i> decree resembles \"remedies that are ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\" <i>Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ.,</i> 476 U.S. 267, 276, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986); <i>see also City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 498, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989). With so much compliance elsewhere, and with so much progress in Boston towards rough parity, the mere passage of time does not demonstrate the decree's ineffectiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least since our decision in <i>Mackin</i> ten years ago, the <i>Beecher</i> decree has had a settled meaning. Pursuant to that settled meaning, the fire departments of eighty percent of the municipalities subject to the <i>Beecher</i> decree have achieved compliance with it. Now, faced with a renewed challenge to the decree by Candidates who feel themselves unfairly barred from employment opportunities in the BFD, the majority finds new meaning in an old decree. I disagree with that conclusion. It cannot be reconciled with our precedent in <i>Mackin,</i> sound principles of interpretation applicable to a consent decree, or the history of this case. Taking a different tack, the Candidates challenge the <i>Beecher</i> decree by constructing changed circumstances arguments that are unpersuasive because of faulty logic, the absence of proof, and prior rejection in Mackin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Beecher</i> decree is not just about the BFD. It was and remains a decree applicable to other cities and towns in Massachusetts. Although it is regrettable that the substantial progress of the BFD in ending its discriminatory hiring practices has not yet reached the goal of rough parity required by the decree, that remaining gap is no justification for altering a decree which requires, with a formula now long accepted, that the \"present effects of past discrimination must be remedied.\" <i>Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 520. Until that gap is closed, the remedial purpose of the decree remains unfulfilled. We should stay the course, not abandon it.

For example, the term \"firefighter\" is used no fewer than ten times simply to describe the examination given to candidates, for example \"valid firefighter entrance examination\" and \"fire fighter examination.\" As I indicated, one must focus on the operative term of the decrees, i.e. the language which explains the meaning of parity.

On April 11, 2001, five candidates for employment (the Candidates) brought suit in the federal district court alleging that the City had discriminated against them on the basis of race when hiring new firefighters in the fall of 2000. The City defended its hiring practices as compliant with, and compelled by, the terms of the consent decree. The district court granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor. <i>See Quinn v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428976\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428976/quinn-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167;&#167; 1-77). The suits alleged that the municipalities engaged in discriminatory recruitment and hiring practices whilst staffing their respective fire departments. These actions culminated in the entry of an omnibus consent decree that influenced the manner in which the affected municipalities could recruit and hire firefighters. <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v.

It has been in effect for nearly thirty years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Beecher</i> decree &#8212; courts consistently have used that phrase to include the original decree and subsequent orders entered to fine-tune it, <i>see, e.g., Mackin v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587240\"><a href=\"/opinion/587240/lawrence-mackin-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1273</span></a></span>, 1274 (1st Cir.1992), and we emulate that example &#8212; circumscribed the hiring of firefighters in much of Massachusetts over the ensuing years. Its history up to 1992 is well chronicled in the case law. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 1274-75. We urge readers who thirst for a more complete understanding of the genesis and operation of the decree to consult that opinion. For present purposes, we are content to note that the <i>Beecher</i> decree was intended to rectify a situation in which many fire departments within Massachusetts had remained lily-white, or nearly so, despite dramatic increases in the African-American and Hispanic populations. The decree sought to accomplish its goal by affirmative action, i.e., by fostering a hiring regime that accorded race-based preferences to blacks and Spanish-surnamed individuals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1274 n. 2. Each of the affected fire departments was to remain subject to the strictures of the decree (and, thus, to accord race-based preferences) until such time as that department met a general benchmark established by the decree: the attainment of parity (or, at least, rough parity). <i>See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523 (providing for release from the decree \"[a]s a city or town achieves a complement of minorities commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community\"). The meaning of this criterion, and the manner in which it is to be gauged, are questions that have permeated this litigation from the outset. Not surprisingly, those questions are central to the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike some forty-five other fire departments that heretofore have met the goals of the decree and gained release from its constraints, the Boston Fire Department (BFD) has operated under the auspices of the <i>Beecher</i> decree since 1974. A decade ago, a group of non-minority men, aspiring to appointments as firefighters within the BFD, endeavored to bring the City out from under the umbrella of the decree. <i>See Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1275. Although we affirmed the district court's rejection of that attempt, we noted that the decree was not meant to operate in perpetuity. To the contrary, it would remain in force as to any particular municipality only until its stated goal had been achieved. <i>Id.</i> at 1278. A decade has passed, but &#8212; despite increased diversity within the BFD &#8212; the City still hires firefighters in accordance with the <i>Beecher</i> decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That brings us to the events giving rise to the instant case. In 1998, the Candidates &#8212; Joseph Quinn, Sean O'Brien, Robert Dillon, Joseph Sullivan, and Roger Kendrick, Jr. &#8212; aspired to firefighter appointments in the BFD. All five are white males; as was required, they identified themselves as non-minority applicants. Each took the firefighter entrance examination administered by the Massachusetts Division of Personnel Administration (MDPA) and scored ninety-nine out of a possible one hundred points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates' scores satisfied the threshold criterion for employment. Along with all other qualifying applicants, they were placed on a civil service eligibility list in rank order. This ranking made allowance for various statutory preferences (e.g., veterans, residents, children of firefighters killed or disabled in the line of duty), ceding pride of place to the holders of such preferences in accordance with state law (even if those persons had earned lower test scores than other qualified candidates). <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167;&#167; 26, 40. None of these statutory preferences involve race or ethnicity, and none of them are challenged in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Preparing to hire fifty new firefighters, the BFD requested a certified list of eligible applicants from the Massachusetts Human Resources Division (HRD). The HRD selected individuals in rank order (based on statutory preferences and test scores) and grouped them into a putative \"hiring class.\" After screening out those individuals who stumbled over a variety of race-neutral preconditions (such as drug tests and physical examinations), the HRD composed a slate of \"hiring pairs\" by placing the highest ranking minority member and the highest ranking non-minority member into a group of two and then repeating the process until the hiring class had been exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2000, the BFD, following this rank order, chose twenty-five pairs from the eligibility list and appointed those fifty individuals as entry-level firefighters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Candidates were not among those selected. Although each received a letter from the BFD stating that the vacancies had been filled by persons who outranked him on the certification list, the record suggests that, had the BFD followed a strict rank-order selection process (without any consideration of race or ethnicity), the Candidates (or some of them) likely would have been in the top fifty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates (other than Kendrick, who joined the litigation at a later date) then sued the City. They argued that the City impermissibly had used preferences based on race and ethnicity to rank minorities ahead of them on the eligibility list. In the Candidates' view, this constituted discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (count 1), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4 (count 2), and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq. (count 3). The Candidates also attacked another aspect of the hiring process; they argued that requiring them to submit to medical examinations without a conditional offer of employment violated both federal and state law (counts 4-6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The district court granted the motion of the Boston Chapter of the NAACP to intervene as a party defendant. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates moved for summary judgment on the first three counts of their complaint or, in the alternative, for a preliminary injunction forbidding the City from filling at least five firefighter positions pending a resolution of the action. They maintained, among other things, that the City should not have applied the <i>Beecher</i> decree to the November 2000 hiring cycle because, by that time, the City had achieved parity in the firefighter force (and, therefore, had met the benchmark for release from the strictures of the decree). The defendants did not controvert the material facts, but, rather, opposed this motion as a matter of law and cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court denied the Candidates' motion and granted summary judgment for the defendants on counts 1 through 3. This appeal followed. Counts 4 through 6 remain pending before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is too familiar a proposition to require citation of authority that a federal court may not act beyond the scope of its jurisdiction. As a logical corollary, parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court by waiver or consent. <i>See Prou v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198748\"><a href=\"/opinion/198748/prou-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v.

Consequently, when a court senses a potential lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it ought to inquire further regardless of whether the parties have raised the issue. <i>BIW Deceived v. Local S6,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749863\"><a href=\"/opinion/749863/biw-deceived-v-local-s6-industrial-union-of-marine-and-shipbuilding/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span>, 828 (1st Cir.1997). We must conduct such an inquiry here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the usual case, an appeal must await the entry of a final judgment, commonly regarded as a judgment that fully disposes of all claims asserted in the action. <i>See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110244\"><a href=\"/opinion/110244/curtiss-wright-corp-v-general-elec-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110244\"><a href=\"/opinion/110244/curtiss-wright-corp-v-general-elec-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There are, however, exceptions to the classic final judgment rule. One such exception, embodied in Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, allows the immediate entry of a partial final judgment as to fewer than all the claims in a multi-claim action \"upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.\" The district court made such a determination here and directed that a separate and final judgment enter as to counts 1 through 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this explicit direction, a jurisdictional problem looms. The law is firmly established in this circuit that a rote recital of Rule 54(b)'s talismanic phrase is not enough, in and of itself, to trump the wonted application of the final judgment rule. <i>See Spiegel,</i> 843 F.2d at 42 (endorsing the \"long-settled and prudential policy against the scattershot disposition of litigation\"). To warrant recourse to the special procedure envisioned by Rule 54(b), the district court typically must make an individualized assessment of the desirability and effect of an immediate appeal. <i>Id.</i> at 42-43. Thus, if a district court wishes to enter a partial final judgment on the ground that there is no just reason for delay, it should not only make that explicit determination but should also make specific findings and set forth its reasoning. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have warned that the parties have an obligation to bring this requirement to the district court's attention. <i>See id.</i> at 44 n. 5. In this instance, the parties did not fulfill this obligation, and the court neither made the requisite findings nor explicated the reasons underlying its Rule 54(b) certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this deviation from preferred practice is troubling, it is not necessarily fatal. We have noted that there are \"infrequent instances\" in which the record, on its face, makes it sufficiently apparent that the circumstances support an appeal from a partial judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 43 n. 4. This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts 1 through 3 of the complaint deal with the obligations and protections afforded by the <i>Beecher</i> decree. In contrast, counts 4 through 6 have very little to do with the decree (and nothing to do with race or ethnicity). Moreover, one of the principal parties &#8212; the NAACP &#8212; has no knowledge about (and, for aught that appears, no interest in) the claims still pending in the lower court. Given the discrete nature of the two sets of claims, the summary judgment decision appears to be \"final in the sense that it is an ultimate disposition of ... individual claim[s] entered in the course of a multiple claims action.\" <i>Curtiss-Wright,</i> 446 U.S. at 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110244\"><a href=\"/opinion/110244/curtiss-wright-corp-v-general-elec-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

By the same token, the legal issues are separate and distinct. Moreover, if the Candidates prevail on one or more of the first three counts and obtain satisfactory relief, counts 4 through 6 may well be rendered moot. This concatenation of circumstances means that, in all probability, there will be no significant duplication of effort in litigating one set of claims to a conclusion and then addressing the remaining set of claims. Such a lack of overlap strongly supports the finding of no just reason for delay (and, thus, the entry of a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b)). <i>See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis v.

This is a vital concern, as hiring is ongoing. The district court recognized this consideration when it agreed to render an expedited decision on counts 1 through 3. <i>See Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 157 n. 3. In short, the nature of the issue calls out for immediate resolution: time is of the essence if for no other reason than that race-based hiring preferences inevitably shift some of the burden of remediation to innocent persons, <i>Wygant v.

When the record and the interests of justice permit, we have on occasion relaxed the requirement. <i>See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis,</i> 23 F.3d at 580-81; <i>Feinstein,</i> 942 F.2d at 40. Given the factors enumerated above &#8212; especially the substantial public interest that attaches to an expeditious resolution of whether the <i>Beecher</i> decree should continue to constrain the BFD's hiring practices &#8212; we conclude that this is one of the rare cases in which, despite the absence of detailed district court findings, the conditions for the use of Rule 54(b) effectively have been met. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction over the Candidates' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having assumed jurisdiction, we turn to the merits of the appeal. We divide our discussion into five segments. First, we frame the issue. We next describe how a court is to assess whether the release point of the <i>Beecher</i> decree &#8212; parity &#8212; has been achieved, outlining the required comparison and delineating how to arrive at its component parts. Then, we do the mathematics. Finally, we address the question of relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Framing the Issue.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parity (or, at least, rough parity) is the key that unlocks the restrictions of the <i>Beecher</i> decree as to a particular community. The central issue in this appeal involves how parity should be calculated for that purpose. The parties agree that the relevant time frame is November of 2000. They also agree as to what sources of data are appropriate for use in this context; all parties accept the City's breakdown of the BFD's complement as of the relevant dates and cite data derived from the 2000 census to establish the appropriate labor pool. Their dispute revolves around what categories of this data govern the measurement of parity. The controlling algorithm has two components. One (which we shall call the first variable) relates to how one measures minority penetration within a particular fire department. The other (which we shall call the second variable) relates to how one measures minority representation in the community as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to these points, the Candidates argue that, under the <i>Beecher</i> decree, the first variable should be limited to the percentage of firefighters in the BFD (not including officers). This should be compared to the second variable, which they envision as the percentage of minorities in the City's employment-eligible population. On the other hand, the City and the intervenor contend that the first variable should represent the percentage of minorities in the BFD as a whole (including officers) and that the second variable should comprise the percentage of minorities in Boston's overall population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the doctrine of stare decisis dictated the composition of both variables. In the court's view, that doctrine required measuring parity by comparing the percentage of minorities in all ranks within the BFD to the percentage of minorities in the City's overall population. <i>Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 161 (accusing the Candidates of \"us[ing] a different statistical method than the one used in the <i>Beecher</i> decree\"). Since this calculation did not show that parity had been attained &#8212; the percentage of minorities within the BFD, including all ranks, was 31.5%, whereas the percentage of minorities in the overall population was slightly over 38% &#8212; the court granted the City's motion for summary judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 163.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address the nature of the two variables in the next two sections of this opinion. Before doing so, however, we pause to mention two sets of legal principles. First, because this litigation challenges a judicial decree affording race-based relief, any interpretation of the decree or any application of it in practice must survive strict scrutiny. <i>See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 235, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span> (1995) (\"Federal racial classifications, like those of a State, must serve a compelling governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.\"); <i>Stuart v. Roache,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573879\"><a href=\"/opinion/573879/57-fair-emplpraccas-bna-902-57-empl-prac-dec-p-41141-anne-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>, 449 (1st Cir.1991) (concluding that all race-based classifications must pass strict scrutiny). This standard obliges an inquiring court to make a binary finding that the race-based relief is not only justified by a compelling governmental purpose but also narrowly drawn to fit the contours of that purpose. <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1275; <i>Stuart,</i> 951 F.2d at 449.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court ruled at the summary judgment stage. The role of summary judgment is to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and provide a means for prompt disposition of cases in which no trial-worthy issue exists. <i>See Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770706\"><a href=\"/opinion/770706/ramon-m-suarez-v-pueblo-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2000). This device should be employed only when the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review an order granting summary judgment de novo. <i>Suarez,</i> 229 F.3d at 53. This non-deferential review is particularly appropriate where, as here, the district court's grant of summary judgment is based on its application of abstract principles of law to essentially uncontradicted facts. <i>See Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200125\"><a href=\"/opinion/200125/plumley-v-southern-container/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 369 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The First Variable.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the first variable to be used for measuring parity under the <i>Beecher</i> decree was the percentage of minority firefighters in the BFD as a whole. The court did not reach this conclusion through independent analysis, but, rather, premised it on the assumption that this issue had been fully litigated and settled in earlier proceedings. <i>See Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 162. Although we appreciate the district court's sensitivity to the role of precedent, an examination of the prior decisions touching upon the <i>Beecher</i> decree refutes the court's assumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the <i>Beecher I</i> court compared relative racial representation using quantitative data, it did so only to determine proper placement of the burden of proof as to what discriminatory effects could be attributed to the defendants' preexisting recruitment and hiring practices. <i>See</i> 371 F.Supp. at 514, 518-20. Thus, <i>Beecher I</i> did not mandate a particular parity-measuring formula for future use. That omission is understandable: the minuscule number of minorities in the affected fire departments at the time of the original <i>Beecher</i> decree negated any need for precise definition of how to measure anticipated minority penetration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court's initial affirmance of the <i>Beecher</i> decree is unhelpful on this point. In resolving that appeal, we stated that the <i>Beecher</i> decree would \"remain[ ] in force, for each local fire department, until that department attains sufficient minority fire fighters to have a percentage on the force approximately equal to the percentage of minorities in the locality,\" <i>Beecher II,</i> 504 F.2d at 1027. This statement begs the question of who is a \"firefighter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our subsequent opinion in <i>Mackin</i> likewise left open the issue of how to measure parity. That case rejected an argument that the <i>second</i> variable was the racial composition of the City as it existed in 1974 (when the <i>Beecher</i> decree was first entered). <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1276. We disposed of that argument without ruling on the significance of the figures presented vis-&#224;-vis the composition of the <i>first</i> variable. <i>See id.</i> Elsewhere in that opinion, we addressed an overbreadth challenge and held that the decree continued to survive strict scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> at 1278. In the process, we cited the language of the decree itself as an indicium of its limited life. <i>See id.</i> (acknowledging that the decree would \"remain[ ] in force only until its requirements have been met\"). Seen in this light, any elliptical references in <i>Mackin</i> as to how parity might be measured cannot be deemed a holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the district court erred in concluding that stare decisis supplies an answer to the question of how the first variable should be constructed brings us back to square one. While we recognize that \"district courts enforcing public law consent decrees have, in general, broad discretion in determining such matters as whether the objectives of the decree have been substantially achieved,\" <i>Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574313\"><a href=\"/opinion/574313/roberto-navarro-ayala-v-rafael-hernandez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span>, 1337 (1st Cir.1991), the court below did not exercise any such discretion. Instead, it offered its interpretation of judicial precedents dealing with the <i>Beecher</i> decree. Having found that interpretation wanting, we owe no particular deference to the district court's conclusion. <i>See Wessmann v. Gittens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198211\"><a href=\"/opinion/198211/wessmann-v-gittens/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 795 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a district court's adjudication of a public sector consent decree does not warrant deference, \"[o]rdinary contract principles apply\" to the same extent as they apply to other consent decrees. <i>Navarro-Ayala,</i> 951 F.2d at 1339. This is especially true when, as now, the question involves determining the parties' original intent and, concomitantly, the scope of the arrangement to which they initially consented.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i> \"Parties to a consent decree are entitled to know that ...

In the abstract, it may seem possible to stretch the term \"firefighter\" to fit the defendants' vision &#8212; but this case does not deal with abstractions. Terms in a consent decree cannot be construed in a vacuum; they must instead be read in the context of the decree as a whole. <i>See Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600262\"><a href=\"/opinion/600262/in-re-newport-plaza-associates-lp-debtor-newport-plaza-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 646 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see generally</i> 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <i>Corbin on Contracts</i> &#167; 24.21, at 204 (Joseph M. Perillo rev. ed.1998). From that coign of vantage, the Candidates' definition is much more compelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigation underlying the <i>Beecher</i> decree arose out of discriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring <i>into entry-level positions. See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 509 (describing the focal point of the case as the municipalities' \"overall hiring policies for the position of firefighter\"). Consistent with this focus, the district court made specific findings of discriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring, and the decree was tailored to counteract the effects of that discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 520. This historical perspective sheds considerable light on the meaning of the term \"firefighter\" as used in the <i>Beecher</i> decree. Logically, the parties must have intended that term to refer to the class of jobs open to external hiring: entry-level firefighter positions. <i>See Fleet Nat'l Bank v. H &amp; D Entm't, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196991\"><a href=\"/opinion/196991/fleet-national-v-hd-entertainment/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 539 (1st Cir.1996) (interpreting terms of a settlement agreement in light of the aim of the litigants at the time of settlement); <i>see generally</i> 5 Corbin, <i>supra</i> &#167; 24.20, at 193. Only by interpreting the term \"firefighter\" in that manner is it possible to harmonize the wording of the decree with its evident purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other language in the decree supports this reading. The decree's first paragraph zeroes in on entry-level positions: it enjoins activities that \"discriminat[e] against any applicant or potential applicant for employment.\" <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 521. The decree purports to regulate the recruiting, certifying, and appointing of entry-level personnel and specifically refers to this three-part process as the \"hiring procedure.\" <i>See id.</i> at 522. Subsequent amendments, such as the interim consent decrees entered on April 17, 1975, and November 25, 1975, continue this emphasis on recruitment and hiring for entry-level positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Custom and usage within an affected industry or workplace can be important aids to the construction of a contract or consent decree. <i>See, e.g., Boston Police Superior Officers Fed'n v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198025\"><a href=\"/opinion/198025/boston-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 17-18 (1st Cir.1998) (interpreting terms with otherwise broad usage narrowly according to usage within the relevant profession); <i>Smart v.

Here, the usage of the BFD supports the Candidates' definition of the term \"firefighter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the court below, the evidence showing the composition of the BFD differentiated the various ranks by specific title. These records consistently referred to the entry-level rank as \"Firefighter\" (sometimes written as \"Fire Fighter\" or \"Fire fighter\"). Corresponding to that term, the evidence showed the number of persons serving in the entry-level rank, broken down by race and ethnicity. That evidence referred to the other ranks &#8212; the officers &#8212; by such titles as \"Fire Lieutenant,\" \"Fire Captain,\" and \"District Fire Chief,\" giving the racial and ethnic composition of each such rank. This indicates that, within the BFD, the term \"firefighter\" carries with it specific duties, responsibilities, pay, and privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lexigraphic insights are frequently helpful in determining the meaning of specific words in consent decrees. <i>See, e.g., Gilday v. Dubois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197525\"><a href=\"/opinion/197525/gilday-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span>, 285-86 (1st Cir.1997). Here, the mine-run of dictionary definitions tends to support the Candidates' version of the disputed term. A firefighter is said to be \"one who fights fires as a member of a municipal fire department,\" <i>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary</i> 855 (1993) (internal dictionary symbols omitted), or \"a person who fights destructive fires,\" <i>Random House Dictionary of the English Language</i> 722 (2d ed.1987), or, simply, \"a person who fights fires,\" <i>Merriam-Webster On-Line Dictionary</i> (2002), <i>at</i> http://www.mw.com/home.htm. These definitions uniformly emphasize the principal activity that firefighters perform. They show quite clearly that the term \"firefighter,\" in its ordinary sense, applies more naturally to those whose exclusive province is attempting to extinguish conflagrations as opposed to those in the higher echelons (who must handle a broader and more diversified range of activities, including administration and supervision). While the dictionary definitions of \"firefighter\" do not necessarily exclude those whom the defendants seek to include, they argue persuasively against their inclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law also militates against including higher ranks under the appellation \"firefighter.\" For example, in <i>Boston Police Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 17-18, we held that the term \"police officers\" used in a consent decree governing promotions within the Boston Police Department did not include <i>all</i> police officers, but, rather, encompassed only patrolmen. That case, like this one, illustrates the importance of honoring contextual constraints that may be placed on a word or phrase within the four corners of a consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; including higher ranks within the compass of the term \"firefighter\" would mean that the <i>Beecher</i> decree was not narrowly tailored to serve its stated purpose. Such an interpretation would effectively transform an instrument carefully crafted to eliminate discrimination in recruitment and hiring into general leverage favoring minorities in a much wider variety of matters. In most of those areas &#8212; promotion is a good example &#8212; no justification for systematic preferential treatment of minorities has been established. Thus, the transformation that necessarily would accompany an acceptance of the defendants' interpretive gloss would present an insurmountable constitutional obstacle. <i>See Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 307, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2733</span></a></span>. Because courts should avoid construing a consent decree in a constitutionally offensive way if a feasible alternative construction exists, this looming constitutional quandary is itself a cogent argument for rejecting the defendants' expansive view of the term \"firefighter.\" <i>Cf. Walsh v. Schlecht,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109583\"><a href=\"/opinion/109583/walsh-v-schlecht/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 408, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109583\"><a href=\"/opinion/109583/walsh-v-schlecht/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Insofar as we can discern, interpreting the word \"firefighter\" to include higher ranks has no basis in the record. The decree is utterly silent as to activities affecting higher ranks, and the remainder of the record &#8212; both current and historical &#8212; is devoid of any allegation or finding that the BFD has ever discriminated against minorities in promotions or in other personnel practices involving those in (or aspiring to reach) the higher ranks. Indeed, the original <i>Beecher</i> plaintiffs would not have had standing to allege discrimination in such respects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Taking these facts into account, it unfairly belittles the <i>Beecher</i> court to read \"firefighter\" as that term is used in the decree to include all ranks (and, thus, to impute to the court the injudicious crafting of a remedy that reaches beyond the scope of the surrounding litigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, ably represented, nonetheless advance a plethora of counter-arguments. Only four of them require discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the City and the intervenor point to paragraph 11 of the interim consent decree of November 25, 1975. That proviso requires a municipality seeking to be released from the decree to petition the MDPA, informing that agency \"that the percentage of post-probationary minority uniformed personnel equals the percentage of minorities\" in that municipality. We do not believe that this casual (and wholly unexplained) linguistic switch from \"firefighter\" to \"uniformed personnel\" can be accorded decretory significance. This is especially so in light of two facts. First, that same proviso incorporates by reference paragraph 7 of the April 17, 1975 interim consent decree (which opens the way for release from the decree \"whenever a particular city or town has achieved a complement of Black or Spanish-surnamed firefighters commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community\"). Second, the preamble to the November 25 decree &#8212; the decree which introduced the term \"uniformed personnel\" into the litigation &#8212; unequivocally declared that \"<i>the parties consent</i> to entry of this Agreement to permit ... the establishment of an eligibility list for <i>the position of firefighter</i> ....\" (Emphasis supplied). In the final analysis, then, the phrase upon which the defendants rely leads us back to our starting point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that if the phraseology employed in the November 25, 1975 decree was intended to clarify that the earlier decrees affected more than the firefighter rank, it seems highly likely that the <i>Beecher</i> court would have used more precise language such as \"of all ranks\" or \"of any rank.\" But the <i>Beecher</i> court eschewed such language. What is more, the court demonstrated an inclination to use general descriptors for specific subject matter. <i>See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523 (using the general phrase \"complement of minorities\" to refer to the specific minority \"[g]roup of all eligible blacks and Spanish-surnamed persons\"). In our view, this proclivity undermines the inference that the defendants (and the dissent) seek to draw from the phrase \"post-probationary uniformed personnel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before leaving this point, we note that our dissenting colleague sees \"no basis for concluding that `firefighter' is the operative word\" in the <i>Beecher</i> decree and the two interim decrees that followed. Yet that word appears no fewer than twenty-six times in those decrees, while the term \"uniformed personnel\" appears only once. This repeated emphasis, especially when coupled with the fact that the litigation revolved around the position of firefighter and did not concern other ranks, makes it perfectly clear that \"firefighter\" is indeed the operative term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the defendants strive to convince us that we should defer to a 1987 memorandum issued by the MDPA, which indicates that, for <i>Beecher</i> purposes, the first variable should consist of \"the actual percentage of the authorized uniformed permanent full-time force which is made up of tenured Black or Hispanic officers of any rank.\" We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deference typically owed by a court to an administrative agency derives from the fact that the agency has been entrusted by a legislative body to administer a statute enacted under that branch's separate constitutional authority. <i>See Chevron, U.S.A.

A federal appellate court owes no deference to such an agency when endeavoring to discern the meaning and constitutional limits of such a decree. After all, if the judiciary is the final arbiter as to questions of statutory construction and must refuse to accept administrative interpretations that contradict clearly ascertainable legislative intent, <i>see id.</i> at 843 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Since unjustified discrimination accounted for the latter fact, [it] cannot excuse the former.\"). They assert that not including higher ranks within the term \"firefighter\" would diminish the efficacy of the decree and reward appointing authorities for keeping minorities in the firefighter rank (thus perpetuating underrepresentation in the higher echelons). For that reason, they argue, it makes sense to require parity department-wide before allowing a community to escape from the constraints imposed by the <i>Beecher</i> decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is specious. We have determined, and the defendants concede, that the parties never intended the decree to address promotions. On that basis alone, it would be improper to extend the decree's reach by judicial fiat. <i>See Boston Police Superior Officers,</i> 147 F.3d at 17-18. Furthermore, alleging that unconstitutional hiring practices within the BFD have caused a disparate impact on the number of minorities in the higher echelons is a heavy charge. Such an allegation should not be addressed in the abstract, but, rather, should be squarely propounded by an injured party with standing to sue and litigated to a just conclusion. Because the litigation giving rise to the <i>Beecher</i> decree is of a different nature than the justification that the defendants now offer, the decree is a constitutionally insufficient vehicle for addressing that justification. <i>See id.</i> at 18; <i>see also Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 802 (\"The mere fact that an institution once was found to have practiced discrimination is insufficient, in and of itself, to satisfy a state actor's burden of producing the reliable evidence required to uphold race-based action.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the City and the intervenor make an argument of last resort. They contend that their interpretation of the term \"firefighter\" is proper because they have assumed all along that the term embraced more than entry-level personnel. In the circumstances of this case, such a contention does not get them very far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In pressing this point, the defendants lean heavily upon past practice of the MDPA and attempt to apply language derived from <i>Mackin</i> to that practice. There, we rejected the argument that static 1974 population figures controlled the measurement of parity. In so doing, we wrote that \"[f]ew things evidence a decree's meaning more persuasively than an immutable, decade-old pattern of past practice under the decree, consensually engaged in by all sides in the underlying litigation that produced the decree.\" 969 F.2d at 1276.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That language is inapposite here. In <i>Mackin,</i> we were using a uniformly accepted past practice to validate a facially plausible interpretation of the <i>Beecher</i> decree (i.e., that current population figures would control). <i>See id.</i> We deemed that past practice confirmatory of what appeared to be a commonsense reading of the verbiage chosen by the parties and approved by the district court. In contrast, the defendants here attempt to use an administrative practice first inaugurated in 1987 (thirteen years after the entry of the <i>Beecher</i> decree), and never directly challenged, to change the meaning of plain language and thus to validate an unlikely interpretation that is implausible in the context of the underlying litigation (and one which, in the bargain, would open the decree to constitutional attack). To the extent that the MDPA's past practice points toward that suggested interpretation, it lacks record support and therefore cannot dominate the decisional calculus. <i>See Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 802; <i>Stuart,</i> 951 F.2d at 454-55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To dwell on this issue would be pointless. It suffices to say that the history and purpose of the litigation, the language of the decree, and the usage of the BFD make manifest that the term \"firefighter,\" as used in the <i>Beecher</i> decree, was intended to include only those persons serving in the entry-level rank. Interpreting \"firefighter\" more broadly would rip the decree from its constitutional moorings, twist its language into something alien to its evident purpose, and violate settled principles of contract law. Accordingly, the proper parity-measuring device &#8212; what we have called the first variable &#8212; comprises the percentage of minorities in the entry-level rank of the BFD as of the relevant date (November of 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Second Variable.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the comparison that <i>Beecher</i> demands &#8212; the second variable &#8212; the Candidates, citing cases decided after the entry of the original <i>Beecher</i> decree, assert that in affirmative action employment cases minority representation must be measured against the specific adult population that comprises the qualified labor pool. <i>See City of Richmond v.

Whether or not some other standard might be more precise, the fact remains that the firefighter position is of the type contemplated by the <i>Croson</i> Court. Thus, the parties' original bargain for a community-wide pool and the district court's endorsement of that concept are entitled to great weight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Navarro-Ayala,</i> 951 F.2d at 1339 (reasoning that the district court is best able to decide certain types of parameters in public institutional reform litigation and, thus, is owed deference when the scope of the parties' original bargain is not at issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reaffirm, therefore, that the appropriate standard for measuring compliance with the <i>Beecher</i> decree &#8212; what we have termed the second variable &#8212; consists of contemporaneous population statistics depicting the percentage of minorities within the overall community. It follows that a fire department subject to the <i>Beecher</i> decree will remain so until that department succeeds in demonstrating that it has achieved \"the decree's actual objective: rough parity,\" <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1277, measured by establishing the percentage of minorities among entry-level firefighters in the particular department and comparing that ratio to the percentage of minorities within the general population of the local community.

If that algorithm does not yield ratios that show parity (or, at least, rough parity) between the percentage of minorities in the entry-level rank of the BFD and the percentage of minorities in the City of Boston as a whole, then the entry of summary judgment in the City's favor must stand. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v.

That is of purely academic interest in this case for the pertinent facts are uncontradicted. The court below developed the factual record sufficiently to demonstrate that, when the City recruited the 2000 hiring class, blacks and Hispanics comprised approximately 40% of the firefighters within the BFD. At the same time, blacks and Hispanics constituted slightly over 38% of Boston's overall population. <i>Quinn,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 162. Hence, parity had been achieved, and the City had become eligible for release from the strictures of the <i>Beecher</i> decree. <i>See Beecher II,</i> 504 F.2d at 1026-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these facts, the district court's error was not harmless. After all, a public employer who consents to the use of race as a factor in order to palliate the lingering effects of past discrimination must maintain continuous oversight in order to ensure that the decree works the least possible harm to other innocent persons competing for employment. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

From that point forward, the employer has no basis to continue preferring minorities. <i>See id.; see also Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1276 (\"An intrusion by a federal court into the affairs of local government should be kept to a bare minimum and not be allowed to continue after the violation has abated and its pernicious effects have been cured.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the City's continued resort to race-based preferences from and after the time when parity was achieved fails the second prong of the strict scrutiny analysis. <i>See Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 309, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In that spirit, the original <i>Beecher</i> court invoked its equitable powers to fashion affirmative relief for a perceived injury even after explicitly disavowing any finding that the \"exclusionary policy [giving rise to the litigation] ha[d] been followed intentionally or by design.\" <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Candidates have neither offered any evidence that the City acted in bad faith nor otherwise set forth a plausible basis that would justify a court in second-guessing the specific decisions made by the City in the 2000 hiring cycle. In a similar vein, they have not established that the persons actually hired were either complicit in some scheme or somehow undeserving of their appointments.

The fact remains that they have succeeded in showing that the City applied a consent decree, previously held to be constitutional, for too long. The result was that the City infringed the Candidates' constitutional rights when it acted upon their applications for appointment to the BFD. They should at least have had the opportunity to compete for the positions that they coveted free of the constraints imposed by the <i>Beecher</i> decree. <i>See Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Balancing these competing considerations, we hold that the BFD's decisions to appoint specific individuals during the 2000 hiring cycle were valid exercises of its responsibility to provide the citizens of Boston with a full complement of qualified firefighters. <i>See Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 520. Nevertheless, the application of the decree to the 2000 hiring cycle violated the Candidates' constitutional rights by depriving them of an equal opportunity to compete for positions on the BFD. <i>See Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The goal of the <i>Beecher</i> decree was to eliminate discriminatory practices in the recruitment and hiring of firefighters in communities subject to the Massachusetts Civil Service laws, and, relatedly, to remedy the effects of past discrimination in recruitment and hiring. Remediation has taken more than a quarter-century. At long last, however, that objective has been achieved with respect to the BFD; parity has been reached between the percentage of minority firefighters in the BFD and the percentage of minorities in the City as a whole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is a significant landmark along the road to equality, we add a word of caution. We are not Pollyannas, and we recognize that achieving parity at the firefighter level is not tantamount to saying that all is well in regard to racial and ethnic issues within the BFD as a whole. To the extent that inequalities remain, however, they are not within the compass of either the <i>Beecher</i> decree or this litigation. Nor will we reach out for them &#8212; issues of constitutional magnitude should not be the subject of speculation, but, rather, should be litigated fully by parties with standing to represent various pertinent points of view. For today, we fulfill our responsibility by holding that the City's appointment of firefighters ought no longer be subject to the strictures of the <i>Beecher</i> decree.

This seems supportable in light of Judge Freedman's recognition that the enjoined party had the power to reconfigure the contours of the labor pool. The authorities cited by the Candidates involve parties without such leverage vis-&#224;-vis the reach of the remedy; where such leverage exists, however, measuring parity against general population statistics prevents a public employer enjoined for discriminatory practices in violation of federal law from manipulating the remedy to suit its fancy. So viewed, Judge Freedman's shaping of the second variable is a good example of why \"broad judicial discretion [is often] crucial for the district judge to secure complex legal goals.\" <i>Navarro-Ayala,</i> 951 F.2d at 1338 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Our dissenting brother never squarely addresses the Candidates' argument that \"even assuming that general population statistics are to be considered, the minority composition of the Department's firefighters (39.9%) exceeded the minority composition of the general population of Boston (38.3%).

Indeed, the majority attributes an argument to the Candidates that they have not made in this litigation &#8212; that the court and the parties to the <i>Beecher</i> decree understood as a matter of original intent that minority presence in the fire departments subject to the decree would be calculated by considering only the entry-level firefighter rank. The Candidates acknowledge that \"[w]hen the <i>Beecher</i> decree was originally conceived, its apparent goal was to generate racial parity in the Fire Department as a whole, as opposed to merely the firefighter ranks.\" Instead, the Candidates argue that we should focus only on the entry-level ranks because changed circumstances since 1974 and 1992, when we last reviewed the <i>Beecher</i> decree in <i>Mackin v.

Instead, there are a variety of terms used, only one of which is the word \"firefighter.\" The relevant question, then, is which of the early formulations of the measurement of parity captures the intent of the parties and the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dissent proceeds in three parts. In part I, I address the majority's conclusion that the <i>Beecher</i> decree always contemplated that the first variable, to use the majority's language, would only consider the percentage of minorities in the entry-level firefighter ranks. In Part II, I address the majority's assertion that narrow tailoring requires this interpretation of the decree to avoid constitutional problems. In Part III, I evaluate the Candidates' argument that changed circumstances since the entry of the <i>Beecher</i> decree require that the decree <i>now</i> be read to measure parity by focusing only on the firefighter ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Interpreting the Decree</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the original <i>Beecher</i> decree issued on February 8, 1974, the court used the phrase \"complement of minorities\" in the operative sentence explaining when a city's fire department could receive an exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2133858\"><a href=\"/opinion/2133858/boston-chapter-naacp-inc-v-beecher/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In its Interim Consent Decree of April 17, 1975 (signed by the parties), the court for the first time used the term \"firefighter\" in explaining the process for obtaining an exemption: \"The Director [of Personnel Administration] shall notify the plaintiffs and supply evidence to the plaintiffs whenever a particular city or town has achieved a <i>complement of Black and Spanish-surnamed firefighters</i> commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community ....\" <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> No. 72-3060-F, slip op. at 4 (D.Mass. Apr. 17, 1975) (emphasis added). Soon thereafter, though, the parties signed the \"Agreement to Effectuate Interim Consent Decree,\" which again discusses exemptions. Paragraph 11 of that Agreement states: \"No fire department ... may be exempted ... unless the appointing authority has first petitioned the Division that the percentage of <i>post-probationary minority uniformed personnel</i> equals the percentage of minorities in the city or town served by said department ....\" <i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> No. 72-3060-F, slip op. at 6 (D.Mass. Nov. 25, 1975) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presented with these three formulations, the majority chooses to focus on the word \"firefighter\" in the April 1975 Interim Consent Decree as the critical word and dismisses the formulation in the final agreement of the parties (\"the percentage of post-probationary minority uniformed personnel\") as a \"casual (and wholly unexplained) linguistic switch.\" This dismissive characterization seems odd, especially since the phrase \"post-probationary minority uniformed personnel\" in the November 1975 Agreement is far closer to the general language of the original <i>Beecher</i> decree (\"complement of minorities\") than the word \"firefighter\" used in the April Interim Decree. The \"complement of minorities\" and \"post-probationary minority uniformed personnel\" formulations also seem to capture the purpose that the <i>Beecher</i> court attributed to its own decree &#8212; to remedy the \"exclusion of minorities from the fire department\" &#8212; than does the word \"firefighter.\" <i>Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 519-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, there is support for competing views in the shifting word choices of these three decrees. The language itself does not tell us definitively what the court and parties intended for the measure of the first variable. But the use of the word \"firefighter\" is part of the ambiguity &#8212; not the answer to it. In the sequence of language in the three decrees, there is no basis for concluding that \"firefighter\" is the operative word and that determining its plain meaning will answer the intent question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Instead, we must acknowledge that the competing formulations of the first variable create an inescapable ambiguity which must be resolved by resort to extrinsic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already opined in this litigation on the kind of persuasive evidence that helps resolve such ambiguities. \"Few things evidence a decree's meaning more persuasively than [a] ... pattern of past practice under the decree ....\" <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1276. The City and the NAACP produced evidence that Massachusetts has required municipalities seeking exemptions from the decree to compare the percentage of minorities in the population of their city or town to the percentage of minority personnel among their departments' <i>entire uniformed personnel.</i> Using this formula, forty-five municipalities originally subject to the decree have received exemptions. An affidavit in the record explains that no department's appointing authority has objected to this formula since it has been in place. This understanding of the decree has been memorialized in a 1987 memorandum circulated by the Massachusetts Department of Personnel Administration outlining \"the process and the criteria for seeking approval for exemption\" from the <i>Beecher</i> decree. This memorandum, using the same terminology as the November 1975 Agreement, states that a municipality must consider the \"full-time uniformed force\" and calculate the percentage of \"<i>post-probationary</i> (tenured) full-time permanent Black or Hispanic members of the uniformed force\" to determine whether parity has been achieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority dismisses the importance of this memorandum, concluding that \"a federal appellate court owes no deference to [a state agency helping to administer compliance with a federal judicial decree] when endeavoring to discern the meaning and constitutional limits of such a decree.\" As a generality this point is a fair one. But this memorandum from the Massachusetts Department of Personnel Administration demonstrates much more than a reasonable interpretation of ambiguous language in a federal decree by a helpful state agency. This memorandum describes a \"pattern of past practice\" of the application of language in the November 1975 Agreement by one of the parties to the original litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioners of the Massachusetts Division of Civil Service were some of the named defendants in the consolidated <i>Beecher</i> litigation. At some point, the Department of Personnel Administration became the successor to the Division of Civil Services and responsible for carrying out the remedial provisions of the decree. Paragraph 1 of the April 1975 decree describes how the \"Director of Civil Service [hereinafter Director shall mean the Director, his successors, or after July 1, 1975, the Personnel Administrator]\" should implement the original <i>Beecher</i> decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Paragraph 1 of the November 1975 Agreement refers to \"The Division<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> of Personnel Administration (formerly known as the Division of Civil Service, and hereinafter, the `Division') ....\" Paragraph 11 of the November 1975 Agreement designates the \"Division\" as the agency to which municipal fire departments should apply for exemptions from the decree. The November 1975 Agreement was also signed by counsel for the \"Director of Personnel Administration.\" The memorandum in question, then, was not issued by an agency that was a stranger to the underlying litigation. Instead, it was crafted by a party to the <i>Beecher</i> litigation with the court-ordered responsibility to review the petitions of municipal fire departments for exemption from the decree. Under these circumstances, the insistence in <i>Mackin</i> on the persuasive value of a pattern of past practice under the decree is particularly apt. <i>See also Navarro-Ayala v.

However, there is no plain language in the decrees on the issue of the first variable, and the \"unlikely interpretation\" was one adopted by one of the parties to the underlying litigation and complied with by many other municipalities subject to the decree. Therefore, the majority's interpretation of the decree runs contrary both to Massachusetts's demonstrated understanding of it and to the lengthy history of its application in granting many exemptions from the decree over a period of at least sixteen years (that is, since 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also difficult to reconcile the majority's interpretation of the decree with incentives that would have seemed sensible to the parties to the decree. If, at the time the decree was entered, a city fire department knew that it needed to show parity only in its entry-level class to receive an exemption from the decree, it could achieve its goals more quickly by keeping all the minority firefighters it hired at the entry level &#8212; that is, by selecting for promotion only non-minority firefighters. The majority's interpretation would have provided an incentive for fire departments <i>not</i> to promote the black and Hispanic firefighters it hired under the terms of the decree. Every minority firefighter promoted to an officer position would have been another black or Hispanic member of the department that did not count towards the calculation of parity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there is no evidence in the record that the Boston Fire Department (\"BFD\") has ever discriminated against black and Hispanic firefighters in its previous promotion decisions, the majority's interpretation of the decree creates an incentive for discriminatory behavior for those municipalities still subject to the decree after the resolution of this case. I cannot imagine that the plaintiffs in the <i>Beecher</i> litigation and the district court would have decided upon a remedy that provides incentives so at odds with the purpose of the litigation and the relief ordered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Narrow Tailoring</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its interpretation of the <i>Beecher</i> decree, the majority contends that the interpretation advanced by the city and the NAACP \"would mean that the <i>Beecher</i> decree was not narrowly tailored to serve its stated purpose.\" In elaborating on this point, the majority raises another argument that was not raised by the Candidates:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an interpretation would effectively transform an instrument carefully crafted to eliminate discrimination in recruitment and hiring into general leverage favoring minorities in a much wider variety of matters. In most of those areas &#8212; promotion is a good example &#8212; no justification for systematic preferential treatment of minorities has been established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I understand it, the majority reasons that the interpretation of the <i>Beecher</i> decree advocated by the NAACP and the city would impermissibly benefit minority firefighters by somehow giving them preferences for promotions even though the <i>Beecher</i> court made no findings regarding the constitutionality of the promotion policies of the fire departments subject to the decree. This effect of the <i>Beecher</i> decree, the majority concludes, would render it unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree with this conclusion because the decree does not in fact have the effect of granting minorities preferential treatment in promotions. That is, I fail to see how merely calculating parity by taking the entire department into consideration leads to a \"systematic preferential treatment of minorities\" in the promotion process. First, there is no evidence in the record that minority firefighters hired in accordance with the <i>Beecher</i> decree have received preferences for promotions. Therefore, the majority's conclusion about such an effect is entirely speculative. Second, the logic of the majority's \"preferential treatment\" argument is problematic. By its terms, the <i>Beecher</i> decree does not explicitly address the promotion policies of the BFD or any other fire department in any way. Whether parity is calculated by taking into consideration merely entry-level firefighters, or by also including lieutenants, captains, and chiefs, the decree does not mandate changes in the department's promotion practices. Because the criteria for promoting firefighters, whatever they may be, are independent from the hiring criteria, the <i>Beecher</i> court's alterations to the BFD's hiring criteria have no effect on its promotion criteria. Therefore, whether or not the <i>Beecher</i> decree continues to direct the method by which the department <i>hires</i> new firefighters, we can only assume, without any evidence to the contrary, that the department will continue to decide <i>promotions</i> in the same way it always has.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, by design, the decree results in an increase in the diversity of the class from which the BFD selects the firefighters for promotion. However, this consequence of the decree cannot be \"general leverage favoring minorities.\" In any organization that promotes from within, the application of a hiring decree that results in the employment of minorities that otherwise would not have been hired necessarily increases the possibility that some of those minorities will be promoted to officers and thereby change the racial makeup of the officer ranks. Just because the decree has the consequence of changing the racial composition of the pool of those eligible for promotions does not mean that it is unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Changed Circumstances</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the Candidates concede that, \"[w]hen the <i>Beecher</i> decree was originally conceived, its apparent goal was to generate racial parity in the Fire Department as a whole, as opposed to merely the firefighter ranks.\" However, they argue that after twenty-eight years, \"a different analysis must be used if the decree is to be implemented in a constitutionally acceptable manner.\" Specifically, the Candidates point to three changed circumstances that they claim require a revised interpretation of the decree. First, they say that it has become evident over time that the decree is ineffective for the purpose of generating racial diversity in the upper ranks of the BFD. Second, the Candidates remind us that twenty-eight years have elapsed since the entry of the <i>Beecher</i> decree, and argue that this is simply too long to wait for the realization of rough parity. Third, when the scope of the inquiry is restricted to consideration of only entry-level firefighters, statistics show that the percentage of minority firefighters exceeds the percentage of minorities in the community, resulting in an \"excess of parity\" at the entry level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frankly, I am at a loss to understand this third \"changed circumstance\" as a discrete argument. The Candidates offer two variations of \"excess of parity.\" In the first, the Candidates use a computation of parity that the majority has rightly rejected. That computation reflects the difference between the percentage of minority firefighters (39.9%) and the minority population of Boston aged 18 and older (32.6%). I agree with the majority that stare decisis requires the use of the percentage of minorities in the general population, rather than the adult population, as the second variable for gauging parity. In the alternative, the Candidates assert that \"even assuming that general population statistics are to be considered, the minority composition of the Department's firefighters (39.9%) exceeded the minority composition of the general population of Boston (38.3%).\" However, after conceding that \"[w]hen the <i>Beecher</i> decree was originally conceived, its apparent goal was to generate racial parity in the Fire Department as a whole, as opposed to merely the firefighter ranks,\" the Candidates do not use this formulation of \"excess of parity\" to articulate a distinct constitutional argument. Instead, they use the statistics as evidence that the decree is not effective for the purposes of achieving this \"apparent goal\" of racial diversity in the upper ranks of the BFD. Hence, because \"excess of parity\" in the firefighter rank is inescapably tied to the first \"changed circumstance\" argument relating to the ineffectiveness of the decree, I will not address this \"excess of parity\" argument independently. Instead, I will incorporate my discussion of excess parity in the ineffectiveness argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While modification of a consent decree is warranted if there is \"a significant change either in factual conditions or in law,\" <i>Rufo v.

Ineffectiveness of the Decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates assert that although 39.9% of entry-level firefighters in the BFD are minorities, only 6.2% (22 of 350) of uniformed personnel above the rank of firefighter are minorities. They assert that \"after 28 years, this is not a temporary status,\" and that continuation of the decree will only increase disparity in favor of minorities at the entry level. Claimants argue that this changed circumstance implicates narrow tailoring because the <i>Beecher</i> decree has proven ineffective in achieving its goals. In other words, the unexpected barrier between the entry-level and the upper ranks, experienced by minorities within the BFD, demonstrates that the race-conscious hiring process is not narrowly tailored to serve the decree's goals of parity within the BFD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interestingly, the majority's narrow tailoring argument and the Candidates's narrow tailoring argument are based on contradictory factual premises. The majority rejects the inclusion of higher ranks in the computation of parity because, in part, such inclusion unconstitutionally transforms the decree into an instrument of \"general leverage favoring minorities\" in promotions. By contrast, the Candidates assert that the decree is unconstitutional because it is ineffective in furthering the promotion of minorities to the upper ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two ways to understand the Candidates' ineffectiveness argument. The Candidates may be arguing that the <i>Beecher</i> decree, as originally conceived, requires parity at both the entry-level and among the upper ranks. Because of the alleged barrier to the promotion of minority firefighters, the Candidates contend that the decree is ineffective in achieving this goal. Alternatively, they may be arguing that the purpose of the decree is to achieve parity in the department as a whole, irrespective of the distribution of minorities at all levels of the department. Given the barrier to promotions, they assert that the only way this parity can be achieved is indirectly &#8212; that is, by impermissible \"overloading\" of minorities at the entry-level to \"offset\" the lack of diversity in the upper ranks &#8212; and that this effect is fatal to narrow tailoring. I will address separately these variations of the ineffectiveness argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Parity at the Entry Level and in the Upper Ranks</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates's first ineffectiveness argument is premised on their characterization of the original purpose of the decree, described as an assumption. That is, they attribute to the district court in <i>Beecher</i> the assumption that \"once the discriminatory effects of the entrance hurdles were removed, minorities would trickle through the fire department somewhat evenly.\" There is a basic flaw in this premise. At the time the <i>Beecher</i> decree was entered, the percentage of minority firefighters in the BFD was less than one percent. It would have been pointless for the <i>Beecher</i> court to make any assumptions about promotion practices when the total number of minorities in the BFD was negligible. Moreover, the court did not enter its decree only to remedy discrimination in the Boston fire department. The <i>Beecher</i> court made fifty-five other municipalities in Massachusetts subject to the <i>Beecher</i> decree, and specifically noted the disproportionately low percentage of minorities in the \"total force\" of other towns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Essentially, there were few minorities to promote in any of the cities or towns, and the Candidates never explain why the <i>Beecher</i> court would have made any assumptions about promotion practices. Therefore, it is unpersuasive to attribute to the <i>Beecher</i> court the assumption described in the Candidates' brief that \"once the discriminatory effects of the entrance hurdles were removed, minorities would trickle through the fire department somewhat evenly.\" Instead, it is more reasonable to attribute to the <i>Beecher</i> court the goal reflected in the explicit language of the decree: \"a complement of minorities commensurate with the percentage of minorities\" within each municipality. <i>Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523. The City, an original party to the decree, states the purpose of the decree well in its brief: \"increasing the total gross proportion of minority fire personnel in each appointing authority.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, as noted earlier, the <i>Beecher</i> court discusses the purpose of the decree in its original opinion ordering remedial action and establishing the framework for the subsequent consent decree. There it states that in 1974 \"blacks and Spanish-surnamed persons represent such an insignificant percentage of the force,\" and that these \"present effects of past discrimination must be remedied.\" <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 519-20. The decree says nothing about anticipating racial proportionality in both the entry-level and the upper ranks. The Candidates' argument of ineffectiveness in achieving such proportionality fails because it is premised on a goal that is nowhere discernible in the <i>Beecher</i> decree or decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Parity in the Department as a Whole</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the purpose of the <i>Beecher</i> decree is to diversify the entire department, without regard to the even distribution of minorities in the entry level and upper ranks, the Candidates argue that, given the barrier to minority promotion in the department, continuation of the decree will only increase disparity in favor of minorities at the entry level. From this changed circumstance, the Candidates offer a complicated narrow tailoring argument that does not lend itself to easy summary. Hence, I quote it at length:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the method of promotion is appropriate, is not discriminatory, and nevertheless leads to racial disparity at the top levels, then it is inappropriate to try to \"offset\" legitimate promotions with an increased minority presence at the bottom. In other words, parity may currently exist in the upper levels of the Fire Department, in that it may reflect the appropriate proportion of minorities in the <i>qualified</i> labor pool for such promotions.... If so, this parity can not be used to justify further hiring quotas in the lower ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, if lack of minorities at the top levels is the result of a discriminatory promotional procedure (of which there is no proof), the requirement to \"narrowly tailor\" racial preferences requires that the specific promotional problem be addressed directly, and not indirectly through affirmative action at the lowest level. Indeed, more minorities in a lower position does not remedy the problem of a \"discriminatory\" promotional process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To comply with strict scrutiny, a racial remedy must be <i>effective.</i> It is inappropriate to address alleged disparity in the upper ranks indirectly using racial preferences to fill the lower ranks, when minorities are not being promoted in proportionate numbers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates's narrow tailoring argument asserts that there are <i>only</i> two possible causes for the discrepancy between the percentage of minorities at the entry-level and the percentage of minorities in the upper ranks: (a) the low percentage of minorities in the upper ranks is an accurate reflection of the qualified applicant pool, or (b) the low percentage of minorities reflects discrimination in the promotion process. They say that if the barrier to promotion is due to the lack of qualified minority applicants, then the decree is not narrowly tailored because it requires the overloading of minorities at the entry-level to offset this dearth of minorities qualified for the upper ranks. Alternately, if the barrier to promotion is due to discrimination, the decree is ineffective in addressing this problem because it focuses only on hiring practices. Since there are only two possible causes of the discrepancy between the percentage of minorities at the entry-level and the percentage of minorities in the upper ranks, and each cause demonstrates that the decree is not narrowly tailored to serve the decree's goals of parity within the entire Fire Department, the Candidates argue that this \"conundrum,\" as they describe it, conclusively proves that the decree fails the narrow tailoring test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This logic reveals another flawed premise. Causes (a) and (b) do not represent the universe of possible explanations for the discrepancy. In fact, the City offers a third plausible and constitutionally sound explanation. Based on its experience with public employment affirmative action programs, the City posits that it may just take a long time for affirmative action measures at the entry level of the BFD to influence minority representation in the higher ranks. Instead of being evidence of a barrier to promotion, the fact that only 6.2% of the higher ranks of the department is minority may evidence an inescapably slow process of growing diversity throughout the department. At the time the <i>Beecher</i> decree was implemented in 1974, minorities represented only 0.9% of the total BFD. <i>Beecher I,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 514. While far from representative of the minority population of the community, the 6.2% minority representation in the upper ranks is a significant increase indicating that the decree, however slowly, is fostering diversity in the upper ranks. Indeed, there has been a demonstrable increase in the number of minority officers recently. The City's response to the Candidates' interrogatories, included in the summary judgment record, indicates that there were 17 minority officers in 1998, 18 in 1999, and 22 in 2000. Over a span of two years, the percentage of minority officers increased from 4.8% to 6.2%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the slow rate of change in the officer ranks is not surprising in an organization the size of the BFD. While the department employs over 1500 firefighting personnel, only 350 of those hold officer positions &#8212; less than 25 percent. Although the record reveals that it is not uncommon for Boston to hire 50 new firefighters in a particular year, it is highly unlikely that a department with only 350 officer positions will promote that many over the same time period. Because the annual promotion rate will generally be much lower than the annual hiring rate, evidence that minorities are not penetrating the upper levels of the department as quickly as the entry level is predictable. In concluding that there is an intractable barrier to minority promotion in the department merely because there are only 22 minority officers, the Candidates take too grudging a view of progress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With their conundrum argument, the Candidates have constructed an argument designed to succeed on the basis of logic instead of proof: because both of the possible explanations for the discrepancy between the percentages of minorities in the entry-levels and upper ranks indicate a lack of narrow tailoring, they assert that they do not have to prove the reality of either explanation. However, as noted, the logic is faulty because it fails to account for other plausible and constitutionally sound explanations for the discrepancy. Therefore, even on the assumption that there might be a narrow tailoring problem with the <i>Beecher</i> decree if either of the Candidates' explanations of the discrepancy were real (unqualified applicants for promotion or discriminatory promotion practices), the Candidates must offer proof of one of these explanations. They have failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Candidates themselves point out, there is no evidence of discriminatory promotion practices. The alternative \"unqualified applicants\" explanation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> is objectionable on a number of grounds. First, the <i>Beecher</i> court found that the entrance examination for firefighters was not indicative of job performance and had a discriminatory impact on minorities. <i>Beecher</i> 371 F.Supp. at 517-18. Second, as we made clear in <i>Mackin,</i> 969 F.2d at 1278, the <i>Beecher</i> court specifically designed the decree to require the hiring of only qualified applicants. Third, the Candidates themselves assert that the entry-level and promotional positions have \"markedly different skill, experience and knowledge requirements,\" making performance on the entrance examination of little relevance to promotional success. There is simply no proof in this record that the 6.2% statistic represents the \"appropriate proportion of minorities in the <i>qualified</i> labor pool for such promotions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Candidates bear the burden of proving the existence of changed circumstances undermining the constitutionality of a consent decree. <i>Rufo,</i> 502 U.S. at 383, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least since our decision in <i>Mackin</i> ten years ago, the <i>Beecher</i> decree has had a settled meaning. Pursuant to that settled meaning, the fire departments of eighty percent of the municipalities subject to the <i>Beecher</i> decree have achieved compliance with it. Now, faced with a renewed challenge to the decree by Candidates who feel themselves unfairly barred from employment opportunities in the BFD, the majority finds new meaning in an old decree. I disagree with that conclusion. It cannot be reconciled with our precedent in <i>Mackin,</i> sound principles of interpretation applicable to a consent decree, or the history of this case. Taking a different tack, the Candidates challenge the <i>Beecher</i> decree by constructing changed circumstances arguments that are unpersuasive because of faulty logic, the absence of proof, and prior rejection in Mackin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Beecher</i> decree is not just about the BFD. It was and remains a decree applicable to other cities and towns in Massachusetts. Although it is regrettable that the substantial progress of the BFD in ending its discriminatory hiring practices has not yet reached the goal of rough parity required by the decree, that remaining gap is no justification for altering a decree which requires, with a formula now long accepted, that the \"present effects of past discrimination must be remedied.\" <i>Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 520. Until that gap is closed, the remedial purpose of the decree remains unfulfilled. We should stay the course, not abandon it. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge, TORRUELLA, SELYA, LYNCH<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>, LIPEZ, and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel of judges that rendered the decision in this case having voted to deny the petitions for rehearing with one judge dissenting and the suggestions for rehearing en banc having been carefully considered by the judges of the Court in regular active service and a majority of said judges not having voted to order that the appeal be reheard by the Court en banc,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is ordered that the petitions for rehearing and the suggestions for rehearing enc banc be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Judge Boundin, Judge Torruella and Judge Lipez would grant the petitions for rehearing en banc.

I will not repeat those reasons here. However, without suggesting any disrespect for the majority's views, I wish to record my vote for rehearing en banc and state my concern about any possible implications of the majority's reliance on the narrow tailoring doctrine. That reliance does not seem central to the majority's holding. Moreover, given the close vote on the en banc petitions, that reliance may have limited value for any future litigation involving the application of the narrow tailoring doctrine to a race-conscious remedial decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> In our first review of the decree, we paraphrased the parity paragraph of the decree, saying that \"[t]he decree remains in force, for each local fire department, until that department attains sufficient minority fire fighters to have a percentage on the force approximately equal to the percentage of minorities in the locality.\"<i>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. v. Beecher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322423\"><a href=\"/opinion/322423/8-fair-emplpraccas-855-8-empl-prac-dec-p-9678-8-empl-prac-dec-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span>, 1026-27 (1st Cir. 1974). While the use of the term \"fire fighters\" may have been a shorthand description of the decree, it certainly should not supplant the language of the original decree.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The majority dismisses the city's reliance on the terminology of the November 1975 Agreement because that Agreement \"incorporates by reference paragraph 7\" of the April 1975 decree, which uses the term \"firefighters,\" and therefore \"leads us back to our starting point.\" The majority assumes that the April 1975 decree should be the court's \"starting point.\" The starting point of the analysis should be the original<i>Beecher</i> decree &#8212; which uses the phrase \"complement of minorities.\" <i>Beecher,</i> 371 F.Supp. at 523.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> In support of its argument that \"firefighter\" is the operative term for interpreting the decree, the majority notes that the term \"firefighter\" is used \"no fewer than twenty-six times in the decrees, while the term `uniformed personnel' appears only once.\" While likely true, this statement is beside the point. For example, the term \"firefighter\" is used no fewer than ten times simply to describe the examination given to candidates, for example \"valid firefighter entrance examination\" and \"fire fighter examination.\" As I indicated, one must focus on the operative term of the decrees, i.e. the language which explains the meaning of parity. In that context, the word \"firefighter\" is one of only three formulations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The bracketed words are in the April 1975 decree</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Although the<i>Beecher</i> court referred to the <i>Division</i> of Personnel Administration, the agency calls itself the <i>Department</i> of Personnel Administration. I assume that the agencies in question are one and the same. There does not currently exist a Massachusetts agency with the official name <i>Division</i> of Personnel Administration.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> In a footnote to its opinion, the majority cites this point as evidence that I do not understand the difference between strict scrutiny and rational basis review. Self-evidently, I make this point only in support of the original meaning of the decree advanced by the defendants and acknowledged by the Candidates. I do not proffer it as a constitutional basis for upholding the decree. My conclusion that this original interpretation of the decree is constitutional, or more specifically, that it is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest, is presented in the section that follows</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> \"The City of Springfield has a black population of approximately 13%. Of 475 firefighters in that city, one is black and none are Spanish-surnamed. The one black represents 0.2% of the<i>total force.</i> The City of Cambridge has a black population of 6.1%, and a fire fighting force of 305 men, four of whom are black; one is Spanish-surnamed. They represent approximately 2% of the <i>total force.</i> New Bedford has a black population of approximately 3.5%. Minorities represent approximately 1% of the fire force.
