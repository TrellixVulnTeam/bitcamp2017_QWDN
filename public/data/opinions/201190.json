Garcia, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-Pabón, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                         August 12, 2004\n\f           Per       Curiam.         These   appeals     raise    ongoing      issues\n\npertaining     to    supervised       release    conditions      that   were   first\n\naddressed in this circuit in United States v. Melendez-Santana, 353\n\nF.3d 93 (1st Cir. 2003).         In this opinion, we hold that a mandatory\n\ndrug testing condition may be included in the written sentencing\n\njudgment without having been mentioned at sentencing. We also hold\n\nthat the standard supervised release conditions set out in the\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines may be adopted by reference at\n\nthe sentencing hearing.\n\n             I.     Background\n\n           In separate criminal proceedings, Higinio Alejandro-\n\nCastillo (\"Castillo\") and Mesfin Haile Tulloch (\"Tulloch\") pled\n\nguilty to entering or attempting to reenter the United States in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and (b)(2).              They were sentenced to\n\nterms of imprisonment and three-year terms of supervised release.\n\nOn   appeal,      each   of   them    contends    that   the     sentencing     court\n\nimproperly delegated sentencing authority to the probation officer\n\nby allowing the officer to determine how many drug tests were\n\nrequired during their terms on supervision.               See Melendez-Santana,\n\n353 F.3d at 106 (holding that 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d) \"requires courts\n\nto determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed\n\nbeyond the statutory minimum of three\").                 They also contend that\n\nthe court included supervised release conditions in the written\n\njudgments that were not mentioned specifically at the sentencing\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fhearings, in violation of their right to be present at sentencing.\n\nSee id. at 99-100 (explaining this constitutional and statutory\n\nright).   To the extent appellants could have raised their present\n\nclaims of error at their respective sentencing proceedings, but did\n\nnot, we review those claims for plain error; otherwise, our review\n\nis for abuse of discretion.        Id. at    102, 107 n.14.\n\n            II.    The Claims\n\n            A.    Delegation\n\n            At Castillo's sentencing hearing, the court made no\n\nmention   of     drug   testing.    Its     written   judgment   included   a\n\nsupervised release condition requiring him to submit to one drug\n\ntest within 15 days of release from imprisonment \"and thereafter as\n\nrequired by the US Probation Officer.\"            In Tulloch's case, the\n\ncourt ordered him at sentencing to submit to three \"periodic drug\n\ntests,\" but made no reference to the probation officer.                   Its\n\nwritten judgment ordered one drug test within the first 15 days\n\nafter release and \"at least two periodic drug tests thereafter, as\n\ndirected by the probation officer.\"\n\n            Appellants assert that the written conditions improperly\n\ndelegated   each    court's     sentencing    authority   by   allowing   the\n\nprobation officer to determine the maximum number of drug tests.\n\nWe agree. In each case, the sentencing court essentially \"vest[ed]\n\nthe probation officer with the discretion to order an unlimited\n\nnumber of drug tests,\" which it could not do.             Melendez-Santana,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f353 F.3d at 103.      On remand, we direct the respective courts to\n\nstrike the improper delegation from their written judgments.\n\n            Tulloch   makes    an   additional   delegation   claim.   He\n\ncontends that the court impermissibly allowed the probation officer\n\nto determine the timing of the drug tests.         We reject this claim.\n\nAs our previous cases indicate, the scheduling of tests to ensure\n\ncompliance with supervised release conditions is an administrative\n\ntask that probation officers lawfully may perform.             See United\n\nStates v. York, 357 F.3d 14, 21-22 (1st Cir. 2004) (sustaining\n\ncondition ordering \"periodic\" polygraph examinations); see also\n\nMelendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 103 (expressing doubt that Congress\n\nwould expect courts to become involved in scheduling drug tests)\n\n(dictum).\n\n            B.   Right to be Present\n\n            Both appellants assert a violation of their right to be\n\npresent at sentencing.        Castillo complains that the drug testing\n\ncondition was never mentioned at his sentencing hearing.1         Tulloch\n\n\n     1\n      The government agrees that Castillo's right to be present was\nviolated, raising the question whether there is anything left for\nthis court to do. We conclude that we may, and should, address the\nissue, and we reach a different conclusion than the parties. See\nComputervision Corp. & Subsid. v. Commissioner, 164 F.3d 73, 75\n(1st Cir. 1999) (stating that the decision whether to address\nconceded issues is a \"prudential\" one and describing the pertinent\nconsiderations).     Given the widespread use of boilerplate\nsentencing judgment forms, which often recite conditions not\nspecifically mentioned at sentencing, the issues presented by these\nappeals will be recurrent ones. Addressing them now will provide\nguidance to district courts and criminal defendants alike.\nMoreover, these issues are not technical or complex, and they have\n\n                                     -4-\n\fobjects   to      the       standard      conditions     contained    in    his     written\n\njudgment on the ground that the district court had only generally\n\nreferenced them at sentencing.2                    To succeed on appeal, appellants\n\nmust show that the challenged written conditions \"conflict in a\n\nmaterial way\" with their oral sentences.                       Melendez-Santana, 353\n\nF.3d at 100.            We conclude that there is no material conflict\n\nbetween appellants' oral sentences imposing terms of supervised\n\nrelease and the written conditions they challenge.                         We turn first\n\nto Castillo's claim.\n\n             1.     Castillo\n\n           In       theory,         requiring       repeated   drug       testing     could\n\nconceivably        inflict          a     significant     burden     on     supervisees.\n\nTherefore,     if       a    drug       testing    condition   is   not    mentioned     at\n\nsentencing, defendants might reasonably claim that their right to\n\nbe present has been violated.                     Context is critical, however.          In\n\nthis case, as our discussion below indicates, the written judgment\n\nsimply imposes the same burden on Castillo as his oral sentence\n\ndirecting him to serve a supervised release term. Therefore, there\n\nis no material conflict between his written and oral sentences.\n\nSee id., 353 F.3d at 100 (suggesting that a material conflict\n\n\nbeen explored carefully in the decisions cited herein, making\nadversary briefing less critical than it otherwise might be.\n     2\n      The district court told Tulloch that during the supervised\nrelease term \"you will comply with the standard conditions as set\nforth in the guidelines[.]\" The written judgment included fourteen\nof the fifteen standard conditions listed in the Guidelines.\n\n                                              -5-\n\fexists   where   the   written   sentence   imposes   a    \"potentially\n\nsignificant new burden on the Defendant\").\n\n          Castillo was sentenced in 2002, and drug testing has been\n\na mandatory condition of supervision since 1994.      In that year, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3583(d) was amended to require drug testing as an explicit\n\ncondition for defendants on supervised release.           18 U.S.C.A. §\n\n3583(d) (2000) (historical and statutory notes); Melendez-Santana,\n\n353 F.3d at 104.   In 1997, the United States Sentencing Guidelines\n\nwere amended accordingly, referencing the mandatory drug testing\n\nrequirement for the first time.    U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n§ 5D1.3(a)(4) (1997); see 18 U.S.C.A. Fed. Sent. Guidelines (2004\n\nSupp. Pamphlet) (historical notes, 1997 Amendments); United States\n\nv. Jackson, 189 F.3d 820, 822 (9th Cir. 1999) (noting that, prior\n\nto the 1997 amendment, courts had discretion to impose a drug\n\ntesting condition under § 5D1.3(b)).        Since their amendment, §\n\n3583(d) and Guideline § 5D1.3(a)(4) have provided defendants facing\n\nsupervised release terms with constructive notice that they will be\n\nrequired to undergo drug testing during their supervised release\n\nterms.   See United States v. Paul, 274 F.3d 155, 172 (5th Cir.\n\n2001) (holding that the Guidelines give constructive notice of\n\nmandatory sex offender registration condition), cert. denied, 535\n\nU.S. 1002 (2002); United States v. Brown, 235 F.3d 2, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (similar; special condition). The statute and guideline also\n\nindicate that the only prerequisite for the drug testing condition\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fis that the court impose a supervised release term at sentencing,\n\nas it did in this case.          Before he was sentenced, moreover,\n\nCastillo knew that he would receive a supervised release term and\n\nwould be subject to certain conditions during that term.             At his\n\nplea hearing, he was told about the supervised release term, that\n\ncertain conditions would apply, and that he would be reimprisoned\n\nif he violated them.      He knew further that his sentence would be\n\ndetermined under the Guidelines.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the court imposed a three-year\n\nterm of supervised release.          It mentioned some of the applicable\n\nconditions, but not the mandatory drug testing condition.            In its\n\nwritten judgment, the court ordered drug testing. It did not check\n\nthe box on the judgment form that courts use to suspend or\n\nameliorate the condition in particular cases.3          Thus, the failure\n\nto   mention   drug   testing   at    sentencing   appears   to   have   been\n\ninadvertent.\n\n           On these facts, we believe that the reasoning in United\n\nStates v. Truscello, 168 F.3d 61 (2d Cir. 1999), applies.          See also\n\nUnited States v. Torres-Aguilar, 352 F.3d 934, 938 (5th Cir. 2003)\n\n\n\n      3\n      Section 3583(d) provides that the drug testing condition \"may\nbe ameliorated or suspended by the court as provided in section\n3563(a)(4) [sic].\" The intended cross-reference is to 18 U.S.C. §\n3563(a)(5), which provides that the mandatory drug testing\ncondition applicable to probationers may be ameliorated or\nsuspended by the court \"for any individual defendant if the\ndefendant's presentence report indicates a low risk of future\nsubstance abuse by the defendant.\"\n\n                                      -7-\n\f(per curiam) (finding the reasoning in Truscello to be persuasive).\n\nIn Truscello, the Second Circuit considered whether the sentencing\n\ncourt's failure to mention any conditions at all at sentencing\n\nafter imposing a term of supervised release precluded it from\n\nsubsequently including certain mandatory and standard conditions in\n\nits written judgment.    The court of appeals held that it did not\n\nbecause there was no \"actual\" or \"real inconsistency\" between the\n\norally imposed term of supervised release and the written judgment\n\nspecifying   the   conditions   applicable   to   such   term.4   As   it\n\nexplained, implicit in the very nature of supervision is that\n\nconditions are placed on the supervised defendant; thus, in its\n\nview, the district court's written judgment merely clarified the\n\nambiguity in the oral sentence.     Truscello, 168 F.3d at 63.\n\n          Castillo contends that he did not have an opportunity at\n\nsentencing to object to the drug testing condition. He claims that\n\nit was not warranted because he had not used controlled substances\n\nfor years and because the court did not find him to be at risk for\n\nfuture drug abuse.      As noted above, however, only one fact is\n\nnecessary to trigger application of the drug testing condition --\n\nthat the district court order a term of supervised release, as it\n\n\n\n     4\n      In evaluating whether a written condition violates a\ndefendant's right to be present, the Second Circuit looks for a\n\"direct\" conflict with the oral sentence, Truscello, 168 F.3d at\n62, whereas we look for a \"material\" conflict, Melendez-Santana,\n353 F.3d at 100. If there is any difference in these standards, it\ndoes not affect disposition of these cases.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdid here at the sentencing hearing.         If, in order to alter his\n\notherwise    applicable    sentence,    Castillo   had   wished   to   take\n\nadvantage of the statutory provision allowing amelioration, he\n\nshould have raised that issue with the court at sentencing and made\n\nthe appropriate factual argument.\n\n            In sum, we sustain the written drug testing condition (as\n\namended, see footnote 1 above) because the burden it imposes is\n\nconsistent with the burden mandated by § 3583(d), of which Castillo\n\nhad constructive notice.      We might reach a different result if a\n\nsentencing court were to impose a written drug testing condition,\n\nnot announced at the sentencing hearing, which orders more drug\n\ntests than the minimum three required by the statute.         The statute\n\nleaves the imposition of additional tests to the discretion of the\n\ndistrict court.     Ordering drug tests beyond the statutory minimum\n\ncould conceivably impose a \"potentially significant new burden\" on\n\na defendant, Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 100, and defendants\n\nmight be able to make some argument at sentencing that could\n\ninfluence the court's determination.       However, we need not decide\n\nthat matter now.\n\n            2.   Tulloch\n\n            At sentencing, the district court imposed a term of\n\nsupervised release on Tulloch and described various supervised\n\nrelease conditions. Among other things, it directed him to \"comply\n\nwith the standard conditions as set forth in the guidelines,\" but\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fit did not describe them in detail.            The written judgment included\n\nconditions substantially similar to the first fourteen of the\n\nfifteen standard conditions set out in the Guidelines.5                   See U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines Manual § 5D1.3(c)(1)-(14) (2001).                    Tulloch\n\ncontends    that     the   court's   general     reference    to    the   standard\n\nconditions    failed       adequately    to    notify   him   which   conditions\n\nactually would be imposed, thus depriving him of his opportunity to\n\nobject to them.        Moreover, he claims that allowing adoption by\n\nreference permits sentencing courts to indiscriminately impose\n\nstandard conditions on defendants.\n\n             For a variety of reasons, we disagree. As with Castillo,\n\nTulloch knew before he was sentenced that he faced a term of\n\nsupervised release, that conditions would apply during that term,\n\nand that the Guidelines controlled his sentencing.                 The Guidelines\n\nflatly recommend the standard conditions, without qualification or\n\nprerequisite (other than that a term of supervised release be\n\nimposed).       U.S.S.G.      §   5D1.3(c)      (\"The   following     'standard'\n\nconditions     are     recommended      for    supervised     release.\")        At\n\nsentencing, moreover, the court made clear that the standard\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The fifteenth condition was not applicable because at\nsentencing the court ordered \"immediate\" payment of the mandatory\nspecial assessment. The omitted guideline, § 5D1.3(c)(15), imposes\na notification requirement on released defendants who have not yet\npaid their special assessments.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fGuideline conditions would apply,6 and the written judgment imposed\n\nall that were applicable.    Thus, the court's oral and written\n\nsentences were entirely consistent: they imposed the very same\n\nburdens on Tulloch.   Indeed, Tulloch does not complain that the\n\nwritten conditions are more onerous, and he does not object to any\n\nparticular condition; his objection seems entirely theoretical.\n\nBut we see no potential for abuse in allowing courts to streamline\n\nsentencing proceedings by incorporating by reference such well-\n\nknown, commonly used conditions of supervised release. See Torres-\n\nAguilar, 352 F.3d at 938; Truscello, 168 F.3d at 63.7      And, in\n\nother contexts, we have allowed incorporation by reference at\n\nsentencing.   See United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (\"As a general rule, a trial court lawfully may make\n\nimplicit findings with regard to sentencing matters, incorporating\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      If Tulloch had desired additional clarification, he easily\ncould have asked for it at the sentencing hearing.\n     7\n      Indeed, as Truscello indicates, standard conditions either\nimpose requirements essential to the basic administration of the\nsupervised release system, or regulate other matters necessary to\neffect the purpose of supervised release.     168 F.3d at 63; see\nMelendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 96 (characterizing the standard\nconditions as generally involving the defendant's responsibilities\nto the probation officer or rehabilitative requirements). They are\nso uniformly imposed that they have become boilerplate in federal\ncourts. Truscello, 168 F.3d at 63. Consequently, we doubt that\ndefendants can legitimately claim surprise or raise right-to-be-\npresent claims when the standard conditions set out in the\nGuidelines are included in a written judgment without having been\nmentioned at the sentencing hearing.\n\n                               -11-\n\fby reference suitably detailed suggestions limned in the PSI Report\n\nor advanced by a party.\") (concerning drug quantity determination).\n\n             We direct the district courts in these appeals to strike\n\nthe improper delegation to the probation officer from their written\n\njudgments.    The district court in Appeal No. 02-2410 is ordered to\n\namend the drug testing condition to provide for the minimum number\n\nof drug tests mandated in 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d).               In all other\n\nrespects,    the   judgments   of   conviction   and   the   sentences   are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f",

These   appeals     raise    ongoing      issues\n\npertaining     to    supervised       release    conditions      that   were   first\n\naddressed in this circuit in United States v. Melendez-Santana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200784\"><a href=\"/opinion/200784/united-states-v-melendez-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2003).         In this opinion, we hold that a mandatory\n\ndrug testing condition may be included in the written sentencing\n\njudgment without having been mentioned at sentencing. We also hold\n\nthat the standard supervised release conditions set out in the\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines may be adopted by reference at\n\nthe sentencing hearing.\n\n             I.     Background\n\n           In separate criminal proceedings, Higinio Alejandro-\n\nCastillo (\"Castillo\") and Mesfin Haile Tulloch (\"Tulloch\") pled\n\nguilty to entering or attempting to reenter the United States in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and (b)(2).              They were sentenced to\n\nterms of imprisonment and three-year terms of supervised release.\n\nOn   appeal,      each   of   them    contends    that   the     sentencing     court\n\nimproperly delegated sentencing authority to the probation officer\n\nby allowing the officer to determine how many drug tests were\n\nrequired during their terms on supervision.               See Melendez-Santana,\n\n353 F.3d at 106 (holding that 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d) \"requires courts\n\nto determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed\n\nbeyond the statutory minimum of three\").                 They also contend that\n\nthe court included supervised release conditions in the written\n\njudgments that were not mentioned specifically at the sentencing\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fhearings, in violation of their right to be present at sentencing.\n\nSee id. at 99-100 (explaining this constitutional and statutory\n\nright).   To the extent appellants could have raised their present\n\nclaims of error at their respective sentencing proceedings, but did\n\nnot, we review those claims for plain error; otherwise, our review\n\nis for abuse of discretion.        Id. at    102, 107 n.14.\n\n            II.    The Claims\n\n            A.    Delegation\n\n            At Castillo's sentencing hearing, the court made no\n\nmention   of     drug   testing.    Its     written   judgment   included   a\n\nsupervised release condition requiring him to submit to one drug\n\ntest within 15 days of release from imprisonment \"and thereafter as\n\nrequired by the US Probation Officer.\"            In Tulloch's case, the\n\ncourt ordered him at sentencing to submit to three \"periodic drug\n\ntests,\" but made no reference to the probation officer.                   Its\n\nwritten judgment ordered one drug test within the first 15 days\n\nafter release and \"at least two periodic drug tests thereafter, as\n\ndirected by the probation officer.\"\n\n            Appellants assert that the written conditions improperly\n\ndelegated   each    court's     sentencing    authority   by   allowing   the\n\nprobation officer to determine the maximum number of drug tests.\n\nWe agree. In each case, the sentencing court essentially \"vest[ed]\n\nthe probation officer with the discretion to order an unlimited\n\nnumber of drug tests,\" which it could not do.             Melendez-Santana,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f353 F.3d at 103.      On remand, we direct the respective courts to\n\nstrike the improper delegation from their written judgments.\n\n            Tulloch   makes    an   additional   delegation   claim.   He\n\ncontends that the court impermissibly allowed the probation officer\n\nto determine the timing of the drug tests.         We reject this claim.\n\nAs our previous cases indicate, the scheduling of tests to ensure\n\ncompliance with supervised release conditions is an administrative\n\ntask that probation officers lawfully may perform.

York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200831\"><a href=\"/opinion/200831/united-states-v-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-22 (1st Cir. 2004) (sustaining\n\ncondition ordering \"periodic\" polygraph examinations); see also\n\nMelendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 103 (expressing doubt that Congress\n\nwould expect courts to become involved in scheduling drug tests)\n\n(dictum).\n\n            B.   Right to be Present\n\n            Both appellants assert a violation of their right to be\n\npresent at sentencing.        Castillo complains that the drug testing\n\ncondition was never mentioned at his sentencing hearing.1         Tulloch\n\n\n     1\n      The government agrees that Castillo's right to be present was\nviolated, raising the question whether there is anything left for\nthis court to do. We conclude that we may, and should, address the\nissue, and we reach a different conclusion than the parties. See\nComputervision Corp. & Subsid. v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198281\"><a href=\"/opinion/198281/computervision-corp-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75\n(1st Cir. 1999) (stating that the decision whether to address\nconceded issues is a \"prudential\" one and describing the pertinent\nconsiderations).     Given the widespread use of boilerplate\nsentencing judgment forms, which often recite conditions not\nspecifically mentioned at sentencing, the issues presented by these\nappeals will be recurrent ones. Addressing them now will provide\nguidance to district courts and criminal defendants alike.\nMoreover, these issues are not technical or complex, and they have\n\n                                     -4-\n\fobjects   to      the       standard      conditions     contained    in    his     written\n\njudgment on the ground that the district court had only generally\n\nreferenced them at sentencing.2                    To succeed on appeal, appellants\n\nmust show that the challenged written conditions \"conflict in a\n\nmaterial way\" with their oral sentences.                       Melendez-Santana, 353\n\nF.3d at 100.            We conclude that there is no material conflict\n\nbetween appellants' oral sentences imposing terms of supervised\n\nrelease and the written conditions they challenge.                         We turn first\n\nto Castillo's claim.\n\n             1.     Castillo\n\n           In       theory,         requiring       repeated   drug       testing     could\n\nconceivably        inflict          a     significant     burden     on     supervisees.\n\nTherefore,     if       a    drug       testing    condition   is   not    mentioned     at\n\nsentencing, defendants might reasonably claim that their right to\n\nbe present has been violated.                     Context is critical, however.          In\n\nthis case, as our discussion below indicates, the written judgment\n\nsimply imposes the same burden on Castillo as his oral sentence\n\ndirecting him to serve a supervised release term. Therefore, there\n\nis no material conflict between his written and oral sentences.\n\nSee id., 353 F.3d at 100 (suggesting that a material conflict\n\n\nbeen explored carefully in the decisions cited herein, making\nadversary briefing less critical than it otherwise might be.\n     2\n      The district court told Tulloch that during the supervised\nrelease term \"you will comply with the standard conditions as set\nforth in the guidelines[.]\" The written judgment included fourteen\nof the fifteen standard conditions listed in the Guidelines.\n\n                                              -5-\n\fexists   where   the   written   sentence   imposes   a    \"potentially\n\nsignificant new burden on the Defendant\").\n\n          Castillo was sentenced in 2002, and drug testing has been\n\na mandatory condition of supervision since 1994.      In that year, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3583(d) was amended to require drug testing as an explicit\n\ncondition for defendants on supervised release.           18 U.S.C.A. §\n\n3583(d) (2000) (historical and statutory notes); Melendez-Santana,\n\n353 F.3d at 104.   In 1997, the United States Sentencing Guidelines\n\nwere amended accordingly, referencing the mandatory drug testing\n\nrequirement for the first time.

Since their amendment, §\n\n3583(d) and Guideline § 5D1.3(a)(4) have provided defendants facing\n\nsupervised release terms with constructive notice that they will be\n\nrequired to undergo drug testing during their supervised release\n\nterms.

The statute and guideline also\n\nindicate that the only prerequisite for the drug testing condition\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fis that the court impose a supervised release term at sentencing,\n\nas it did in this case.          Before he was sentenced, moreover,\n\nCastillo knew that he would receive a supervised release term and\n\nwould be subject to certain conditions during that term.             At his\n\nplea hearing, he was told about the supervised release term, that\n\ncertain conditions would apply, and that he would be reimprisoned\n\nif he violated them.      He knew further that his sentence would be\n\ndetermined under the Guidelines.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the court imposed a three-year\n\nterm of supervised release.          It mentioned some of the applicable\n\nconditions, but not the mandatory drug testing condition.            In its\n\nwritten judgment, the court ordered drug testing. It did not check\n\nthe box on the judgment form that courts use to suspend or\n\nameliorate the condition in particular cases.3          Thus, the failure\n\nto   mention   drug   testing   at    sentencing   appears   to   have   been\n\ninadvertent.\n\n           On these facts, we believe that the reasoning in United\n\nStates v. Truscello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761782\"><a href=\"/opinion/761782/united-states-v-dominick-truscello-john-gammarano-salvatore-lombardi-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1999), applies.          See also\n\nUnited States v. Torres-Aguilar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 938 (5th Cir. 2003)\n\n\n\n      3\n      Section 3583(d) provides that the drug testing condition \"may\nbe ameliorated or suspended by the court as provided in section\n3563(a)(4) [sic].\" The intended cross-reference is to 18 U.S.C. §\n3563(a)(5), which provides that the mandatory drug testing\ncondition applicable to probationers may be ameliorated or\nsuspended by the court \"for any individual defendant if the\ndefendant's presentence report indicates a low risk of future\nsubstance abuse by the defendant.\"\n\n                                      -7-\n\f(per curiam) (finding the reasoning in Truscello to be persuasive).\n\nIn Truscello, the Second Circuit considered whether the sentencing\n\ncourt's failure to mention any conditions at all at sentencing\n\nafter imposing a term of supervised release precluded it from\n\nsubsequently including certain mandatory and standard conditions in\n\nits written judgment.    The court of appeals held that it did not\n\nbecause there was no \"actual\" or \"real inconsistency\" between the\n\norally imposed term of supervised release and the written judgment\n\nspecifying   the   conditions   applicable   to   such   term.4   As   it\n\nexplained, implicit in the very nature of supervision is that\n\nconditions are placed on the supervised defendant; thus, in its\n\nview, the district court's written judgment merely clarified the\n\nambiguity in the oral sentence.     Truscello, 168 F.3d at 63.\n\n          Castillo contends that he did not have an opportunity at\n\nsentencing to object to the drug testing condition. He claims that\n\nit was not warranted because he had not used controlled substances\n\nfor years and because the court did not find him to be at risk for\n\nfuture drug abuse.      As noted above, however, only one fact is\n\nnecessary to trigger application of the drug testing condition --\n\nthat the district court order a term of supervised release, as it\n\n\n\n     4\n      In evaluating whether a written condition violates a\ndefendant's right to be present, the Second Circuit looks for a\n\"direct\" conflict with the oral sentence, Truscello, 168 F.3d at\n62, whereas we look for a \"material\" conflict, Melendez-Santana,\n353 F.3d at 100. If there is any difference in these standards, it\ndoes not affect disposition of these cases.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdid here at the sentencing hearing.         If, in order to alter his\n\notherwise    applicable    sentence,    Castillo   had   wished   to   take\n\nadvantage of the statutory provision allowing amelioration, he\n\nshould have raised that issue with the court at sentencing and made\n\nthe appropriate factual argument.\n\n            In sum, we sustain the written drug testing condition (as\n\namended, see footnote 1 above) because the burden it imposes is\n\nconsistent with the burden mandated by § 3583(d), of which Castillo\n\nhad constructive notice.      We might reach a different result if a\n\nsentencing court were to impose a written drug testing condition,\n\nnot announced at the sentencing hearing, which orders more drug\n\ntests than the minimum three required by the statute.         The statute\n\nleaves the imposition of additional tests to the discretion of the\n\ndistrict court.     Ordering drug tests beyond the statutory minimum\n\ncould conceivably impose a \"potentially significant new burden\" on\n\na defendant, Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 100, and defendants\n\nmight be able to make some argument at sentencing that could\n\ninfluence the court's determination.       However, we need not decide\n\nthat matter now.\n\n            2.   Tulloch\n\n            At sentencing, the district court imposed a term of\n\nsupervised release on Tulloch and described various supervised\n\nrelease conditions. Among other things, it directed him to \"comply\n\nwith the standard conditions as set forth in the guidelines,\" but\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fit did not describe them in detail.            The written judgment included\n\nconditions substantially similar to the first fourteen of the\n\nfifteen standard conditions set out in the Guidelines.5                   See U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines Manual § 5D1.3(c)(1)-(14) (2001).                    Tulloch\n\ncontends    that     the   court's   general     reference    to    the   standard\n\nconditions    failed       adequately    to    notify   him   which   conditions\n\nactually would be imposed, thus depriving him of his opportunity to\n\nobject to them.        Moreover, he claims that allowing adoption by\n\nreference permits sentencing courts to indiscriminately impose\n\nstandard conditions on defendants.\n\n             For a variety of reasons, we disagree. As with Castillo,\n\nTulloch knew before he was sentenced that he faced a term of\n\nsupervised release, that conditions would apply during that term,\n\nand that the Guidelines controlled his sentencing.                 The Guidelines\n\nflatly recommend the standard conditions, without qualification or\n\nprerequisite (other than that a term of supervised release be\n\nimposed).       U.S.S.G.      §   5D1.3(c)      (\"The   following     'standard'\n\nconditions     are     recommended      for    supervised     release.\")        At\n\nsentencing, moreover, the court made clear that the standard\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The fifteenth condition was not applicable because at\nsentencing the court ordered \"immediate\" payment of the mandatory\nspecial assessment. The omitted guideline, § 5D1.3(c)(15), imposes\na notification requirement on released defendants who have not yet\npaid their special assessments.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fGuideline conditions would apply,6 and the written judgment imposed\n\nall that were applicable.    Thus, the court's oral and written\n\nsentences were entirely consistent: they imposed the very same\n\nburdens on Tulloch.   Indeed, Tulloch does not complain that the\n\nwritten conditions are more onerous, and he does not object to any\n\nparticular condition; his objection seems entirely theoretical.\n\nBut we see no potential for abuse in allowing courts to streamline\n\nsentencing proceedings by incorporating by reference such well-\n\nknown, commonly used conditions of supervised release. See Torres-\n\nAguilar, 352 F.3d at 938; Truscello, 168 F.3d at 63.7      And, in\n\nother contexts, we have allowed incorporation by reference at\n\nsentencing.   See United States v. Tavano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195113\"><a href=\"/opinion/195113/united-states-v-tavano/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (\"As a general rule, a trial court lawfully may make\n\nimplicit findings with regard to sentencing matters, incorporating\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      If Tulloch had desired additional clarification, he easily\ncould have asked for it at the sentencing hearing.\n     7\n      Indeed, as Truscello indicates, standard conditions either\nimpose requirements essential to the basic administration of the\nsupervised release system, or regulate other matters necessary to\neffect the purpose of supervised release.     168 F.3d at 63; see\nMelendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 96 (characterizing the standard\nconditions as generally involving the defendant's responsibilities\nto the probation officer or rehabilitative requirements).
