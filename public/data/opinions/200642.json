R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                          For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-1296\n\n                         MARILYN SILVA-VALENTIN,\n\n                           Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                        v.\n\n                   COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY,\n\n                           Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n              [Hon. Justo Arenas, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Melba N. Rivera-Camacho and Melba N. Rivera Camacho & Assoc.\non brief for appellant.\n     Robert J. Triba, Regional Chief Counsel, Social Security\nAdministration, H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Camille Velez-\nRive, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             September 11, 2003\n\f           Per Curiam. Claimant Marilyn Silva-Valentin appeals from\n\nthe district court's judgment affirming the denial of Social\n\nSecurity disability benefits. The Commissioner of Social Security,\n\nupon reviewing the record, found (1) that claimant retained the\n\ncapacity for the performance of essentially the full range of\n\nmedium work, except for having to avoid highly stressful activities\n\nand the use of her hands for fine manipulations, and (2) that\n\nclaimant's mental impairment and her complaints of disabling pain\n\nnonetheless did not impose significant nonexertional limitations on\n\nher capacity for such work.         The Commissioner therefore used the\n\nMedical Vocational Guidelines (the \"Grid\"), 20 C.F.R. Part 404,\n\nSubpart P, App. 2, as a framework, to conclude that claimant was\n\nnot   disabled.      We    affirm   the   district   court's   judgment   for\n\nessentially the reasons stated by the magistrate judge in his\n\nOpinion and Order.        We add only the following comments.\n\n           1.     Claimant's Allegations of Disabling Pain.       Given the\n\ndearth of any medical findings regarding, or any treatment for,\n\nclaimant's hand, back, or neck conditions, during the relevant time\n\nperiod -- February 5, 1998 through December 31, 1999 --                   the\n\ndecision of the administrative law judge (ALJ) not to fully credit\n\nclaimant's complaints of disabling pain is well-supported in the\n\nrecord.   As we have stated, \"[i]n determining the weight to be\n\ngiven to allegations of pain . . . complaints of pain need not be\n\nprecisely corroborated by objective findings, but they must be\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fconsistent with medical findings.\"        Dupuis v. Secretary of Health\n\nand Human Services, 869 F.2d 622, 623 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam)\n\n(emphasis added).    In other words, there must be some evidence to\n\nsupport the claimant's complaints, and there is very little here.\n\nSee id.\n\n           2.       Claimant's     Treating   Physician's   Opinion   of\n\nDisability.     On appeal, claimant argues that the ALJ should have\n\ncredited   the    opinion   of     Dr.    Reyes,   claimant's   treating\n\npsychiatrist, that her depression was completely disabling. Social\n\nSecurity Ruling 96-2p, Giving Controlling Weight to Treating Source\n\nMedical Opinions, 1996 WL 374188, outlines the process to be used\n\nto determine the weight to be given to the opinions of treating\n\nphysicians.     To be controlling, among other things, the opinion\n\nmust \"not [be] inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in\n\nthe case record.\"     Id. at *1.\n\n           We first note that, during the relevant time, Dr. Reyes\n\nreported that claimant's judgment was logical and her intellectual\n\nfunctioning was fair.    Further, Dr. Reyes's opinion of a disabling\n\ncondition is inconsistent with the other evidence in the record,\n\nparticularly the examination of claimant by Dr. Tejeda and the RFC\n\nassessment completed by the non-examining physician.        See Gordils\n\nv. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 921 F.2d 327, 329 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (per curiam) (the opinion of an examining consultant and\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fa non-examining physician who completed an RFC assessment can\n\nconstitute \"substantial evidence\").\n\n          Both of these other reports essentially indicated that,\n\nat most, claimant had moderate difficulties in concentrating, but\n\nthat, at a minimum, her thought processes were intact, and she\n\nretained the ability to engage in simple work.       Combined with Dr.\n\nReyes's own observation that claimant's intellectual functioning\n\nwas fair, it would be difficult to say that the ALJ erred in not\n\ngiving controlling weight to the opinion of Dr. Reyes that claimant\n\nwas disabled.   As we have stated, conflicts in the evidence are for\n\nthe Commissioner, not the courts.        See Rodriguez v. Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n          3.    The Use of the Grid.     Claimant finally argues, in a\n\nvery conclusory manner, that, due to her nonexertional limitations,\n\nreliance on the Grid was prohibited; rather, she maintains, the\n\ntestimony of a vocational expert was required.            In relation to\n\nclaimant's pain, and as noted above, the record supports the ALJ's\n\nconclusion that claimant's complaints were not credible as to the\n\nseverity and disabling nature of the pain.        Thus, there also is\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ's decision\n\nthat the pain was not a significant nonexertional limitation.\n\n          As    for   claimant's   mental   impairment,    although   the\n\nquestion is closer, we nonetheless think that the use of the Grid\n\nwas appropriate in this case.       In particular, claimant here has\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fessentially the same profile as the claimant in Ortiz v. Secretary\n\nof Health and Human Services, 890 F.2d 520 (1st Cir. 1989), where\n\nwe affirmed the use of the Grid.      The only difference is that\n\nclaimant, in the case at hand, was rated as being moderately\n\nlimited in accepting supervision and in coping with changes in the\n\nwork place.\n\n           In relation to the latter restriction, however, the RFC\n\nevaluator specified, in the comment section of the RFC assessment\n\nform, that claimant could respond to \"minimal changes\" in the work\n\nsetting.   Further, both Drs. Reyes and Tejeda opined that claimant\n\nwas cooperative, an indication that although she was rated as\n\nhaving moderate limits in accepting supervision, she certainly was\n\nnot precluded from coping with having a supervisor.   Finally, and\n\nas in Ortiz, \"claimant's characteristics did not position [her]\n\nnear the disabled/not disabled dividing line under the Grid rules.\"\n\nSee id. at 527-28; Grid Rule No. 203.29, Table No. 3.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
