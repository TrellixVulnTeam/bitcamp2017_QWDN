BACKGROUND\n\n           To   the   extent    that     these      challenges   involve   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, \"[w]e recite the pertinent facts in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict.\"            United States v. Downs-\n\nMoses, 329 F.3d 253, 257 (1st Cir. 2003).           Jordan and Bucci's other\n\nchallenges do not involve serious factual disputes or do not demand\n\nimmediate resolution on direct appeal.\n\n           On July 6, 2004, a grand jury returned an eight-count\n\nindictment1 against Bucci, Jordan, and Francis \"Skeeter\" Muolo.\n\n\n     1\n      Count 1 charged the defendants with conspiracy to distribute,\nand to possess with intent to distribute, over 500 grams of cocaine\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.       Count 2 charged them with\npossession with intent to distribute over 500 grams of cocaine\npursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Count 3 charged them with using\n\n                                     -2-\n\fMuolo pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and possession charges of\n\nthe indictment pursuant to an agreement with the Government.         As\n\npart of this agreement, Muolo agreed to provide testimony against\n\nBucci and Jordan (although he was not, in fact, called to the\n\nstand).    He was sentenced to fifty-seven months' imprisonment.\n\n            This case involves the robbery of a drug dealer by other\n\ndrug dealers, including Bucci, and Jordan, a police officer.\n\nJordan, a member of the Malden, Massachusetts, Police Department\n\nsince 1985, became a narcotics detective during the mid-1990's. In\n\n2003, Jordan renewed an old acquaintance with an individual named\n\nJon Minotti, a former corrections officer who worked in real estate\n\nand   as   a   plasterer.    At   some   time   during   their   renewed\n\nrelationship, Jordan began to purchase marijuana from Minotti, who\n\ndealt drugs to support his own habit.       Jordan expressed anger to\n\nMinotti regarding the amount of money that cocaine dealers earned\n\nthrough their illicit trade.\n\n            Sometime during 2003, Minotti informed Bucci, another old\n\nacquaintance for whom he had recently performed plastering work,2\n\n\nor carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking\ncrime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 9214(c)(1)(A). Count 4 charged\nJordan with witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1512(b)(3).    Count 5 charged Bucci with another count of\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine. Finally, Counts 6\nthrough 8 charged Jordan with making false statements to the DEA,\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.\n      2\n      Minotti and Bucci also engaged in several unrelated drug\ntransactions.   The district court, however, excluded evidence\nregarding these deals as unduly prejudicial. Thus, we will not\n\n                                  -3-\n\fof his friendship with Jordan.       Also during 2003, Minotti met yet\n\nanother   drug   dealer,   Carlos   Ruiz,3   from   whom   he   periodically\n\npurchased ounce quantities of cocaine. Minotti introduced Bucci to\n\nRuiz later that year, but told Ruiz that Bucci's name was \"Gino.\"\n\n           In late November or early December 2003, while at the\n\napartment of a friend, Bryan Raftery,4 Bucci informed Minotti that\n\nhe wanted to rob Ruiz, with whom he was angry.             Bucci devised a\n\nplan in which Jordan would arrive to \"bust\" a drug deal between\n\nMinotti and Ruiz, allowing Minotti to escape with the drugs.\n\nMuolo, another friend of Minotti, was recruited as Minotti's\n\ngetaway driver.      Minotti relayed the proposal to Jordan, who\n\ninitially expressed some reluctance at participating.\n\n           Undeterred by Jordan's lack of enthusiasm for the scheme,\n\nBucci proceeded with alacrity.      A few days before Christmas, Bucci\n\ndirected Minotti to order three kilograms of cocaine from Ruiz on\n\n\n\nconsider them in our review.\n     3\n      Ruiz pleaded guilty to a separate indictment. He received\nsubstantial sentence reductions in exchange for his testimony\nagainst Bucci and Jordan. Additionally, he received safety valve\ntreatment for which he almost certainly would not have been\neligible had the government disclosed information, adduced in this\ncase, to the sentencing court concerning numerous threats Ruiz made\nagainst Minotti.    The jury, of course, was entitled to credit\nRuiz's testimony, which was mostly corroborated by reliable\nevidence, despite these inducements.\n     4\n      Raftery, despite a grant of immunity, refused to testify at\nthe defendants' trial and was held in civil contempt.           He\nsubsequently pleaded guilty to criminal contempt and was sentenced\nto probation.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhis behalf.    On December 23, after some negotiations, Minotti and\n\nRuiz settled on a price of either $27,000.00 or $28,000.00 per\n\nkilogram and agreed to meet at Minotti's house at 10:00 a.m. the\n\nnext day to complete the transaction.                 With time running short,\n\nMinotti again solicited Jordan's help.                    Jordan, although still\n\nambivalent, proposed that everyone involved in the prospective\n\nrobbery meet in the parking lot of the Malden Medical Center the\n\nnext day.\n\n            Around 8:30 a.m. on December 24, Bucci, in his black S500\n\nMercedes Benz, license plate number 3802YL, drove to Minotti's\n\nhouse.    Muolo apparently arrived separately.                From there, Bucci,\n\nMinotti, and Muolo drove in Minotti's vehicle, a black Chevrolet\n\nAvalanche, to the Medical Center.             There, they met Jordan, who was\n\ndriving   an   unmarked      police   car,     a    tan   Honda.   Despite    some\n\nlingering reservations, he agreed to participate in the scheme in\n\nexchange for $30,000.00.         Jordan suggested that Minotti \"escape\"\n\nwith the stolen drugs through a strip of woods adjacent to the\n\nMedical Center.       From there, Minotti could reach a nearby street,\n\nwhere Muolo would pick him up.         Bucci proposed that Jordan call for\n\nback-up   to   make    the    bust    appear       more   realistic,   but   Jordan\n\ndemurred.\n\n            Unbeknownst to the conspirators, the DEA had tapped\n\nRuiz's phone as part of an ongoing, mostly unrelated narcotics\n\ninvestigation.        Around December 20, 2003, the DEA intercepted\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fcommunications between Ruiz and Minotti regarding the proposed\n\ntransaction.      In response, the DEA set up roving surveillance\n\noutside Minotti's residence, commencing at approximately 9:00 a.m.\n\non    December   24.   At   9:10    a.m.,     DEA   Agent   Jean   Drouin   and\n\nMassachusetts State Police Sergeant Thomas Quin observed a black\n\nMercedes parked in the driveway with license plate number 3802YL,\n\nbut noted that Minotti's black Chevrolet Avalanche was absent.\n\nWhen the agents returned at 9:42 a.m., the Mercedes was gone, but\n\nMinotti's Avalanche had returned.\n\n            At 9:55 a.m., Ruiz arrived in a maroon Buick Park Avenue.\n\nRuiz and Minotti left the house together in Ruiz's car to travel to\n\nthe   Medical    Center.    After   a   few    seconds,     however,   Minotti\n\ninstructed Ruiz to turn around, under the pretense that he had\n\nforgotten his cell phone.       In reality, Minotti was experiencing\n\ndoubts about the wisdom of robbing Ruiz.            Leaving Ruiz in the car,\n\nMinotti called Bucci to express these concerns. Minotti told Bucci\n\nthat the deal would not work anyway, falsely explaining that Ruiz\n\nwanted to be paid before relinquishing physical possession of the\n\ncocaine.    Bucci instructed Minotti to hand over the phone to Ruiz.\n\nAfter a conversation between the two, which Minotti overheard, Ruiz\n\nagreed to bring all of the cocaine to the parking lot of the\n\nMedical Center, to permit Bucci an opportunity to test its quality.\n\n            When Minotti and Ruiz arrived at the Medical Center they\n\npulled alongside Bucci's vehicle, which was positioned against a\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\frail, facing outward to the parking lot.   Minotti exited the car,\n\ntaking with him all three kilograms of cocaine. After observing\n\nJordan's car entering the parking lot, perhaps twenty or third\n\nyards distant, Minotti immediately fled down an embankment into the\n\nwoods carrying the three kilograms with him.\n\n           Jordan positioned his car directly behind Ruiz's Buick,\n\nblocking Ruiz (but not Bucci) from escape.         Jordan, in plain\n\nclothes, exited the car, shouted \"Malden Police,\" and pointed a gun\n\nat Ruiz.   Jordan ordered both Ruiz and Bucci from their vehicles\n\nand frisked both men.    Jordan searched Ruiz's car, examined his\n\nlicense, and performed a warrant check.        He did not, however,\n\nperform any similar investigation of Bucci.     Jordan then informed\n\nRuiz, \"It's your lucky day.   I'm going to let you go.   You have a\n\nmerry Christmas.\"   Ruiz returned to his car and left the parking\n\nlot.   Jordan departed the parking lot as well, driving directly\n\npast Agent Drouin and Sergeant Quin's surveillance location. Bucci\n\nleft his car and entered the Medical Center.    A few minutes later,\n\nJordan returned to the parking lot and drove to the entrance of the\n\nMedical Center.   Bucci exited the Medical Center, and the two men\n\nhad a brief conversation before going their separate ways.\n\n           Muolo and Minotti took the cocaine to Muolo's apartment\n\nin Stoneham.   Once Bucci arrived, the conspirators opened one of\n\nthe bags of cocaine.    Taking the cocaine, Bucci indicated that he\n\nplanned to sell it and split the proceeds with the others.   Because\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fJordan was impatient to receive his share of the money, Bucci,\n\nMinotti, and Muolo decided to give him whatever cash was available\n\nby the end of the night.\n\n            Later    that    afternoon,    Ruiz    and   his   brother-in-law,\n\nArmando Lovos, arrived at Minotti's house in a blue SUV.                   Ruiz\n\nsuspected that the drug bust had been a setup, did not believe that\n\nJordan was a real police officer, and was unsurprisingly furious\n\nwith    Minotti.      Ruiz   demanded     that    the    cocaine   be   returned\n\nimmediately.       Minotti replied that he had abandoned the drugs in\n\nthe woods and refused to return to search for them, ostensibly for\n\nfear that the police would be there.               Still unsatisfied, Ruiz\n\nnevertheless left to search for the cocaine in the woods near the\n\nMedical Center.       After Ruiz's departure, Minotti called Bucci to\n\ninform him of Ruiz's visit. Bucci suggested to Minotti that Jordan\n\nshould confront Ruiz at the Medical Center to demonstrate his\n\nlegitimacy.    Minotti communicated this suggestion to Jordan, who\n\nagreed to look for Ruiz at the Medical Center.\n\n            At the Medical Center, Jordan encountered Ruiz and Lovos.\n\nJordan took Lovos's identification, but did not run a warrant\n\ncheck.    Instead, he simply instructed Ruiz and Lovos to leave the\n\narea.    Recordings from the DEA's wire on Ruiz substantiate that\n\nRuiz was convinced he had been ripped off and that he knew Jordan\n\nwas not an honest policeman.         In fact, Jordan's appearance only\n\nreinforced Ruiz's suspicions, as he rightly inferred that one of\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthe conspirators had tipped Jordan off that Ruiz and Lovos were\n\nreturning to the Medical Center to search for the supposedly\n\nabandoned cocaine.\n\n            At about 10:15 p.m., Minotti received a voicemail from\n\nBucci indicating that he had left money in a \"blue tub\" outside\n\nMinotti's    back   door.   After    finding   the   money,   Minotti     took\n\n$5,000.00 for himself to satisfy an unrelated debt and delivered\n\nthe remainder to Jordan at his home.       Jordan later complained that\n\nthe black bag contained only $15,000.00 and demanded the rest of\n\nhis payment.    Bucci, again via Minotti, promised Jordan that he\n\nwould receive the rest of his payment once Bucci was able to sell\n\nthe cocaine.\n\n            On December 26, Jordan stopped by Minotti's house to make\n\nsure Minotti was unharmed, that Ruiz had not returned, and to\n\nascertain when he would receive the rest of his money.               Jordan\n\ninstructed    Minotti   that,   if   questioned,     he   should   tell    law\n\nenforcement officers that he had been acting as an informant for\n\nJordan in an attempt to catch Ruiz dealing drugs.          Just then, Ruiz\n\nappeared at Minotti's home, accompanied by four or five henchmen.\n\nJordan left, covering his face in an unsuccessful bid to avoid\n\nrecognition.\n\n            Ruiz suggested that Minotti should get in the car with\n\nhim.   Under the pretext of getting his coat, Minotti returned\n\ninside to call Jordan for help. Jordan suggested that Minotti call\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthe police and complain about Ruiz trespassing, which Minotti did.\n\nWhen the police arrived, Minotti informed them of his ostensible\n\nrole as Jordan's informant.       The police instructed Ruiz, who\n\neventually admitted to them that he was there to collect a drug\n\ndebt, to leave.\n\n          At that point, Jordan apparently began to regret his role\n\nin the scheme.    At 1:30 p.m. on December 26, Jordan called Agent\n\nDrouin to inquire whether Ruiz was under investigation.      During\n\nthis conversation, Jordan asked whether the DEA had attempted any\n\nsurveillance of Ruiz on December 24.    Because Agent Drouin already\n\nsuspected Jordan of illegal activity, he told him that, while Ruiz\n\nwas a target, no operation had taken place on that particular day.\n\nIn an apparent effort to cover his tracks, Jordan informed Agent\n\nDrouin of certain, carefully-selected details regarding the drug\n\nrip-off at the Medical Center.   Several of these details, however,\n\nwere false.\n\n          Next, Jordan contacted Minotti and suggested that they\n\nreturn the cocaine to Ruiz or pay him for it.   Minotti communicated\n\nto Bucci Jordan's desire to undo the robbery. Bucci responded that\n\nthis rescission would be \"stupid\" and dangerous, as he believed\n\ntrying to rescind the robbery would confirm Ruiz's suspicions about\n\nthe rip-off, compounding their problems. At a meeting in Stoneham,\n\nJordan returned a portion of his ill-gotten funds to Minotti, and\n\ninstructed him to give the money to Ruiz.   Despite his reluctance,\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fBucci agreed to surrender his share of the proceeds to Minotti.   As\n\nBucci and Minotti attempted to gather the rest of the cocaine, they\n\nreceived two frantic messages from Muolo indicating that something\n\nbad had happened.    When they arrived at Muolo's apartment, he\n\ninformed them that he had flushed the cocaine down the toilet.5\n\nMinotti went home, took $2,000.00 of his wife's money, and met Ruiz\n\nat the Saugus mall to compensate him for the stolen cocaine.\n\n          In early May 2004, DEA agents arrested Ruiz.     Although\n\nRuiz refused to cooperate fully against his suppliers in Mexico, he\n\nagreed to provide information regarding the drug rip-off.         He\n\npicked Minotti and Bucci out of a lineup.     Before Ruiz agreed to\n\ncooperate, Agent Drouin called Jordan to inform him of Ruiz's\n\narrest, but Jordan expressed very little interest.\n\n          On May 19, 2004, Minotti encountered Muolo, supposedly by\n\nchance, at a Dunkin' Donuts.   Muolo told Minotti that the police\n\nhad asked him to cooperate against Minotti.   He warned Minotti not\n\nto answer the phone if he called and asked to meet at a baseball\n\nfield at 3:00 p.m. Minotti relayed this information to Jordan, who\n\ninstructed Minotti to tell Muolo to \"keep his mouth shut\" and\n\nindicated that he did not want to talk to Minotti anymore.    While\n\nMinotti waited for Muolo at their designated meeting place, DEA\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Later, Muolo informed Minotti that he had, in fact, given the\ncocaine to Bucci and lied to the others at Bucci's request.\n\n                               -11-\n\fAgent Mark Tully and Sergeant Quin approached Minotti, who agreed\n\nto cooperate by wearing a body wire to a meeting with Jordan.\n\n           Minotti arranged to meet Jordan at a skating rink in\n\nMalden.   Although Jordan did not directly inculpate himself, he\n\nmade a plethora of highly suspicious statements that strongly\n\nsuggested that he was part of an unlawful conspiracy of some sort\n\nwith Minotti, Bucci, and Muolo.           The next day, May 20, Jordan\n\nattempted to speak with Minotti at his home, but Minotti refused to\n\nanswer the door.     Later, however, at Sergeant Quin's request,\n\nMinotti placed a recorded call to Jordan.          During the call, Jordan\n\nexpressed further concern about Muolo, directing Minotti to tell\n\nMuolo \"not to give the bid out.\"\n\n           That same day, Agent Tully arrested Jordan.                Agent\n\nDrouin, supported by several other officers, arrested Bucci outside\n\nof his wife's tanning salon in Malden as he attempted to enter his\n\nblack Mercedes.    After being informed of his rights, Bucci smugly\n\ntaunted   the   officers,   \"You   didn't    get    me   on   any   phones.\"\n\nEventually, Bucci's black Mercedes was seized and its contents were\n\ninventoried. Of particular interest, the vehicle contained ninety-\n\none grams of cocaine dispersed in three separate plastic baggies\n\nthat were contained within one larger bag; two digital scales;\n\n$6,653.00 in cash; four mobile phones and six separate SIM cards6;\n\n\n     6\n      A SIM, or \"security identity module,\" card is the device\nwithin a phone that contains the unique information identifying a\nparticular subscriber.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fand a pager.   Officer Jamie Cepero, a Massachusetts state trooper\n\nassigned to the DEA task force, offered expert testimony regarding\n\nthe contents of Bucci's black Mercedes.     He testified that the\n\nabove-mentioned items were probative of drug trafficking.   Officer\n\nCepero opined that the quantity of drugs found in Bucci's car,\n\nninety-one grams, is inconsistent with mere personal use.   Cepero\n\nalso testified that the contents of Bucci's car lacked indicia of\n\npersonal use, such as straws, mirrors, and razor blades.\n\n          On April 12, 2006, following a trial, a jury returned a\n\nverdict of guilty against both Bucci and Jordan on all counts of\n\nthe indictment. On November 15, 2006, the district court sentenced\n\nBucci to a term of 252 months' imprisonment and Jordan to a term of\n\n180 months' imprisonment.   The defendants filed timely notices of\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f                              II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Bucci7\n\n1.   Ineffective Assistance\n\n              Bucci contends that his trial counsel's performance was\n\nso deficient as to violate the Sixth Amendment and require reversal\n\nof his convictions.     \"We have held with a regularity bordering on\n\nthe monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance\n\ncannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions,\n\nbut, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by,\n\nthe trial court.\"     United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 410 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted)).      Nevertheless, in\n\nan exceptional case, the record may be adequately developed to\n\npermit meaningful review.     Id.    In this instance, however, we are\n\nunable to draw any reasoned conclusions from the cold record.\n\n              Bucci makes several fact-intensive complaints regarding\n\nhis trial counsel's purportedly deficient performance.      First, he\n\nasserts that trial counsel, in his opening argument, promised to\n\n\n      7\n      Bucci has filed four pro se motions that remain pending. We\ndeny Bucci's motion to supplement the record (Docket No. 102) and\nhis motion to correct the trial transcript (Docket No. 152). These\nmatters are better addressed by the district court on a petition\nfor collateral review.      We grant Bucci's second motion to\nsupplement the record (Docket No. 128), given that the document in\nquestion has already been made a part of the record by the district\ncourt. It is not, however, pertinent to any issue pending before\nus. Finally, we deny Bucci's motion to file a supplemental reply\nbrief (Docket No. 155). We require no further elaboration of his\nclaims of error.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe jury that he would present an alibi witness, Lisa Murphy, who\n\nwould   testify     that    Bucci's      activities      on   December    24     were\n\ninconsistent with the Government's theory of the case.                     Second,\n\nBucci   complains    that    trial    counsel     addressed     the    prospective\n\ntestimony of Muolo during his opening statement, despite the fact\n\nthat the Government did not indicate an intention to call Muolo\n\nduring its own opening statement. Third, Bucci contends that trial\n\ncounsel rendered deficient performance by failing to lay the\n\nfoundation   for    and    offer   the    testimony      of   Ross    Minnoti,    Jon\n\nMinotti's brother, who was purportedly willing to testify that Jon\n\nMinotti informed him that Bucci was innocent, and that he was only\n\nimplicating Bucci to save his own skin.               These three issues are\n\nbest left for a collateral proceeding where Bucci will have the\n\nopportunity to develop the record to explicate his claim.\n\n           Lastly, we address trial counsel's closing argument.\n\nDuring closing, trial counsel was twice admonished for making\n\nimproper remarks.         First, trial counsel asked rhetorically, \"If\n\nBr[y]an Raftery made those calls for Anthony Bucci, why didn't he\n\ncome in here and tell you about them?\"             Following an objection by\n\nthe   Government,    the    district      court   gave    a   forceful    limiting\n\ninstruction, informing the jury that trial counsel's remarks were\n\nimproper and that \"the government had intended to call Mr. Raftery\n\nand he, Mr. Raftery, refused to testify.            He is absent in this case\n\nbecause he refuses to be present.\"            Later, trial counsel accused\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fthe Government of knowingly and deliberately presenting perjured\n\ntestimony.      Again, the district court instructed the jury that\n\ntrial counsel's actions were improper.\n\n               Undoubtedly, the limiting instructions issued by the\n\ndistrict judge in response to trial counsel's remarks did little to\n\nadvance Bucci's cause before the jury.             At the same time, these\n\nevents do not independently give rise to sufficient prejudice to\n\nmerit reversal of Bucci's convictions.             At worst, they may have\n\ncost Bucci some of the good will of the jury.         The evidence against\n\nBucci was overwhelming, and trial counsel's comments and the\n\ncorresponding limiting instructions did nothing to add to the\n\nmountain of inculpatory evidence arrayed against him.               Federal\n\nagents observed Bucci's vehicle at Minotti's house the morning of\n\nthe rip-off; Bucci was observed by federal agents at the scene of\n\nthe   crime,    parked   alongside   Ruiz;   the    agents   observed   Bucci\n\nspeaking with Jordan outside the Medical Center immediately after\n\nthe rip-off; and cocaine, two digital scales, $6,653.00 in cash,\n\nfour mobile phones and six separate SIM cards, and a pager were\n\nfound in Bucci's vehicle upon his arrest.              Finally, of course,\n\nMinotti's and, to a lesser extent, Ruiz's testimony directly\n\nimplicated Bucci in the crime.\n\n2.    Matters Related to Severance\n\n            Bucci argues that the district court erred by denying his\n\nmotion to sever.     At issue is Exhibit 24, a recording of a May 19,\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f2004,    conversation          between     Bucci's      codefendant,        Jordan,    and\n\nMinotti, in which Bucci's name is mentioned.                         The recording was\n\nproperly introduced against Jordan as an admission.                         The district\n\ncourt ruled, however, that Jordan's statements were inadmissible\n\nhearsay in relation to Bucci.                   The district court denied Bucci's\n\npretrial motion to sever as well as his trial motion to redact his\n\nname from the statements.             To protect Bucci from unfair prejudice,\n\nthe district court, on two separate occasions, instructed the jury\n\nthat the statements were not admissible against Bucci.                                Bucci\n\nconcedes that his Confrontation Clause rights were not violated\n\nbecause Jordan testified in his own defense at trial.                         California\n\nv. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 164 (1970) (holding that \"the Confrontation\n\nClause    does    not     require         excluding     from    evidence      the     prior\n\nstatements of a witness who concedes making those statements\").\n\nThus,    the     issue        at   hand    is    one    of    evidence      rather     than\n\nconstitutional law.\n\n               We \"review the denial of a motion to sever only for a\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion.\"                   United States v. Page, ___ F.3d\n\n___,    ___,    2008     WL    820741,     at    *6    (1st   Cir.   Mar.    28,     2008).\n\n\"[S]everance is particularly difficult to obtain where, as here,\n\nmultiple defendants share a single indictment.\"                          Id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 37 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).                To merit reversal on the basis of a\n\ndistrict court's denial of severance, a \"defendant must show\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\f'prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Turner, 501 F.3d 59, 73 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 49 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n\"[S]everance is particularly disfavored in conspiracy cases.\"                      Id.\n\n           As a general matter, we cannot say that the district\n\ncourt abused its wide discretion in refusing to grant separate\n\ntrials at the outset of the proceedings.                Our jurisprudence favors\n\ntrying co-conspirators together, despite the reality that evidence\n\nadmissible against one defendant may be, and often is, inadmissible\n\nwith   regard    to    others.        See,    e.g.,   id.    We   see   no   unusual\n\ncircumstances that should have tilted the balance in favor of\n\nseverance in this particular case.\n\n           Second, we address Bucci's contention that the district\n\ncourt committed reversible error by issuing a limiting instruction\n\nrather than redacting Bucci's name from the recording and the\n\ntranscript provided to the jury.                  Even where the Confrontation\n\nClause is implicated, we ordinarily presume that jurors will follow\n\nlimiting instructions.        United States v. Rodríguez-Durán, 507 F.3d\n\n749, 769 (1st Cir. 2007).         Occasionally, however, at least in the\n\nconstitutional        context,    a    limiting       instruction   will     not   be\n\nsufficient      to    preserve    a        co-defendant's    rights     where      the\n\nextrajudicial         statement       is     \"powerfully    incriminating\"         and\n\n\"'inculpatory on its face.'\"               Id. (quoting United States v. Vega\n\nMolina, 407 F.3d 511, 520 (1st Cir. 2005)).                 \"Statements that are\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fincriminating only when linked to other evidence in the case\" do\n\nnot merit such scrutiny.    Id. (quoting Vega Molina, 407 F.3d at\n\n520) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          The district court determined that Jordan's remarks,\n\nwhile powerfully incriminating as to Jordan, did not directly\n\ninculpate Bucci.      Significantly, defense counsel candidly and\n\nexplicitly agreed with this assessment while arguing Bucci's motion\n\nto sever. To be sure, Jordan's remarks were neither flattering nor\n\nhelpful to Bucci's defense.       The recording contains numerous\n\nderisive references to Bucci as well as a discussion concerning\n\nwhether Bucci had been arrested and whether he was providing\n\ninformation to law enforcement. Thus, the recording surely implies\n\nthat Bucci participated with Jordan and Minotti in an illicit\n\nundertaking of some species.   Nevertheless, we cannot say that the\n\ndistrict court erred by refusing to redact the recording to exclude\n\nBucci's name.     In light of our presumption that jurors follow\n\nlimiting instructions such as those given here, the absence of\n\nconstitutional error, and the inferential nature by which Jordan's\n\nstatements link Bucci to the charged conduct, we find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     Moreover, any error was clearly harmless given the\n\nsubstantial evidence of guilt as described above.8\n\n\n\n     8\n      Indeed, to the extent that Bucci claims that Jordan's\nstatements were prejudicial because they were derogatory, we note\nthat Bucci's own theory of the case rested on the premise that he\nwas a drug addict rather than a drug dealer.\n\n                                -19-\n\f               Finally, Bucci asserts that the prosecutor's closing\n\nremarks made it impossible for the jurors to follow the district\n\ncourt's limiting instruction.           See Vega Molina, 407 F.3d at 522\n\n(reversing conviction where prosecutor implored jury to infer\n\ndefendant's guilt from codefendant's redacted confession). Because\n\nhe failed to object at trial, we review this aspect of his\n\nchallenge only for plain error.          Rodríguez-Durán, 507 F.3d at 770-\n\n71.    In large part, references to the May 19 conversation were\n\nrestricted entirely to the prosecutor's discussion of Jordan.\n\nNeither the prosecutor nor the court were required to remind the\n\njurors by rote, in each instance the recording was mentioned, that\n\nthe recording was not admissible against Bucci.                We think that the\n\ndistrict court's two separate admonitions that the jurors should\n\nnot consider the May 19 recording as evidence against Bucci were\n\nsufficient to prevent confusion.\n\n               Bucci argues that the prosecutor's final summation, when\n\nhe    called    for   a   guilty   verdict    against   both    defendants,   was\n\nimproper. Following a brief discussion of Bucci's culpability, the\n\nprosecutor stated:\n\n               David Jordan, ladies and gentleman, at every\n               step of this case . . . David Jordan chose to\n               stand on the side of the criminal instead of\n               the side of law enforcement. On December 24th\n               at the Malden Medical Center parking lot, on\n               December 26th when he was not protecting Jon\n               Minotti and his family from the men who showed\n               up at his home, in each of the calls with\n               Agent Drouin, and on . . . May 19 as well.\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f          Ladies and gentleman, the most compelling\n          testimony in this case, the most compelling\n          word in this case didn't come from Jon\n          Minotti.   The most persuasive testimony in\n          this case didn't come from Carloz Ruiz.    It\n          didn't even come from the agents [who]\n          testified in this case. Ladies and gentlemen,\n          the most persuasive, the most compelling, and\n          the most damning words in this case came from\n          David Jordan's own mouth, both on that tape\n          and when he got up on that witness stand and\n          he lied to you.\n\n          Ladies and gentleman, I ask you to find both\n          of these men guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\n          of all the counts.\n\n          Thank you.\n\n          It is readily apparent, in context, that the discussion\n\nof the recording concerned Jordan alone.         The prosecutor had\n\nalready summed up his case regarding Bucci before discussing Jordan\n\nfor the final time.    By contrast, in Vega Molina, a case upon which\n\nBucci relies, the prosecutor explicitly requested the jury to\n\nconvict the defendant based on the co-defendant's out-of-court\n\nconfession, over the objection of the defendant and without a\n\nlimiting instruction.     407 F.3d at 522.   In Richardson v. Marsh,\n\n481 U.S. 200 (1987), to which Bucci also cites, the prosecutor\n\nargued that information gleaned from a codefendant's confession\n\nsupported an inference of guilt.    See id. at 205 & n.2.   Here, the\n\nfacts fall well short of showing such prejudicial conduct.\n\n          Finally, to the extent they did invite confusion, we see\n\nvery little prejudice in the prosecutor's remarks.       As detailed\n\nabove, the evidence against Bucci was daunting and his theory of\n\n                                 -21-\n\finnocence scarcely credible.               Moreover, the recording was not\n\nhighly incriminating of Bucci.            While it suggested that Jordan did\n\nnot consider him to be an exemplary citizen, the jury already knew\n\nthat    from    the    contents    of    his    black   Mercedes.     Thus,    the\n\nprosecutor's      comments   during       closing   argument    do   not   warrant\n\nreversal of Bucci's convictions.\n\n3.   Courtroom Closures\n\n               In a separate pro se brief, Bucci maintains that reversal\n\nof   his   convictions      is    necessary     because   the   district     court\n\ncommitted structural error by closing the courtroom to the public\n\non two occasions.         Because Bucci failed to object at trial, we\n\nreview only for plain error.            See United States v. Thomas, Nos. 98-\n\n1051, 98-1052, 98-1116, 2000 WL 236481, at *2 (2d Cir. Feb. 14,\n\n2000)   (unpublished      summary       disposition)    (applying    plain   error\n\nanalysis to purported violation of defendant's right to public\n\ntrial).\n\n               The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the\n\nright to a public trial.             Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 46\n\n(1984); Owens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 61 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nBucci argues that the district court erred by closing the courtroom\n\nduring jury selection and later during a contempt proceeding\n\nagainst Raftery.          We decline to address his challenge to the\n\npurported closure during jury selection at this time because it is\n\nnot yet ripe.         Although Bucci has attempted to submit additional\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fevidence to supplement the Spartan record, it remains inadequate to\n\npermit meaningful review. Bucci will have an opportunity, if he so\n\nchooses, to present this argument in a petition for collateral\n\nrelief before the district court.            At that point, the district\n\ncourt may hold an evidentiary hearing to test the merits of Bucci's\n\nclaim.    See id. at 66.\n\n            Bucci also argues that the district court erred by\n\nclosing    the   courtroom   during    the   contempt    proceeding   against\n\nRaftery.     During this hearing, the Government called its next\n\nprospective witness, Raftery, to the stand.             As expected, Raftery\n\nrefused to testify, despite a grant of immunity. He indicated that\n\nhe was concerned about potential perjury charges due to conflicts\n\nbetween his anticipated testimony and the statements he made before\n\nthe grand jury and federal agents.             The district court placed\n\nRaftery in civil contempt and warned him of the possibility that\n\ncriminal contempt charges might be filed against him should he not\n\ntestify.    Despite these remonstrations, Raftery persisted in his\n\nrefusal to testify.     At the end of the hearing, the district court\n\nordered that Raftery be taken into immediate custody.\n\n            Bucci's argument is flawed in two ways. First, the Sixth\n\nAmendment's requirement that a trial be public does not apply with\n\nits usual force to criminal contempt proceedings.             See Levine v.\n\nUnited States, 362 U.S. 610, 616 (1960).         Here, the district court\n\nspecifically indicated that Raftery would be set free if he agreed\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fto testify.     Thus, the contempt order was civil, not criminal, in\n\nnature.     See Int'l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell,\n\n512 U.S. 821, 827-28 (1994).              Civil contempt proceedings are not\n\ngoverned by the Sixth Amendment and require fewer procedural\n\nprotections.        See United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d 655, 661 (1st\n\nCir.   1995)    (stating      that   \"a   court       may   impose   civil    contempt\n\nsanctions pursuant to . . . minimal procedures\" but that \"criminal\n\ncontempt sanctions may be imposed only if the court provides\n\ncertain constitutional protections\"); accord Santibáñez v. Weir\n\nMcMahon & Co., 105 F.3d 234, 242-43 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding that\n\nprotections of Sixth Amendment do not apply to civil contempt\n\nproceedings); Northeast Women's Ctr., Inc. v. McMonagle, 939 F.2d\n\n57, 68-69 (3d Cir. 1991) (explaining that \"arguments predicated on\n\nthe Sixth Amendment are inapposite\" to civil contempt proceeding);\n\nIn re Di Bella, 518 F.2d 955, 958 (2nd Cir. 1975) (rejecting\n\nchallenge      to   courtroom     closure        in   civil    contempt      context).\n\nConsequently, not even Raftery himself, much less Bucci, could have\n\ninvoked the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial during the\n\ncivil contempt hearing.\n\n            Second,     the    contempt     proceeding        against   Raftery   was\n\nalmost entirely collateral to Bucci's own trial and, thus, any\n\nclosure did not infringe Bucci's Sixth Amendment right. See Petito\n\nv. Artuz, 69 F. App'x 26, 28 (2d Cir. 2003) (unpublished summary\n\ndisposition) (rejecting defendant's Fifth Amendment challenge to\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\fcourt's decision to exclude him from contempt proceeding against\n\nrecalcitrant witness); United States v. Melchor Moreno, 536 F.2d\n\n1042, 1047 n.7 (5th Cir. 1976) (explaining that \"[t]he usual Sixth\n\nAmendment rights of cross-examination were only peripherally at\n\nstake here, since the hearing did not relate to guilt but to the\n\ncollateral issue of whether [a witness's Fifth Amendment] privilege\n\nwas properly invoked\"); see also Brown v. Kuhlmann, 142 F.3d 529,\n\n541 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding that courtroom closure during trial\n\nitself did not infringe defendant's Sixth Amendment rights where it\n\ninvolved cumulative testimony related to matter collateral to\n\ncharged offense); United States v. Gallagher, 576 F.2d 1028, 1040\n\n(3d   Cir.   1978)   (finding   no   error   where   trial   judge   cleared\n\ncourtroom, not excepting even attorneys, to explore possible self-\n\nincrimination issues related to witness).\n\n             During this particular closure, no evidence was presented\n\nagainst either defendant; the defendants and their counsel were\n\npermitted to remain; and the courtroom was promptly reopened at the\n\nconclusion of the contempt proceeding.          In the end, the temporal\n\nproximity and causal relationship between Bucci's criminal trial\n\nand the civil contempt hearing against Raftery did not necessarily\n\nrender the two proceedings one and the same.                 Although Bucci\n\nundoubtedly enjoyed a right to compulsory process under the Sixth\n\nAmendment to call Raftery as a witness, he lacked any converse\n\nright to prevent him from testifying.         Put differently, he had no\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fcognizable constitutional interest under the Sixth Amendment in\n\nRaftery's refusal to testify when called by the Government.                Thus,\n\nalthough it would have been better practice for the trial judge to\n\nhave made specific record findings justifying his decision to close\n\nthe courtroom, see Waller, 467 U.S. at 44-47, on these facts and\n\nunder   a   plain   error   standard      of    review,   Bucci     suffered   no\n\nconstitutional deprivation.\n\n4.   Constructive Amendment of the Indictment and Alleged Variances\n\n            Bucci argues in his pro se brief that the district court\n\nerred by permitting a constructive amendment of the indictment.\n\nConstructive amendments are forbidden by the Fifth Amendment, which\n\nguarantees    defendants    the   right    to   be   tried   only    on   charges\n\nindicted by a grand jury.         U.S. Const. amend V; United States v.\n\nFornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 66 (1st Cir. 2005).             \"A constructive\n\namendment is considered prejudicial per se and grounds for reversal\n\nof a conviction.\"     United States v. DeCicco, 439 F.3d 36, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).     To determine whether a constructive amendment has\n\noccurred, we examine whether the terms of the indictment were\n\n\"altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court\n\nafter the grand jury has last passed upon them.\"                    Id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).        Our review is de novo.          United States\n\nv. Hernandez, 490 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f            Bucci also alleges two different but related variances\n\nbetween the indictment and the evidence adduced against him at\n\ntrial.    \"A variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a\n\nscenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the\n\nindictment.\"      United States v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71, 94 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting United States v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1, 12\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted)).                 A variance\n\nmandates reversal only where it is both material and prejudicial.\n\nId.\n\n            In his brief, Bucci conflates his constructive amendment\n\nargument with his variance claim.          Rather than engage in a futile\n\nendeavor to parse the two, we address them simultaneously.                    His\n\nunderlying challenge lacks merit under either theory. First, Bucci\n\nasserts    that   while   the   indictment       alleged     a   conspiracy       to\n\ndistribute   cocaine,     the   evidence    at    trial      supported     only    a\n\nconspiracy to commit robbery.         Second, Bucci contends that the\n\nindictment was faulty because it failed to allege a Hobbs Act\n\nconspiracy. Bucci asserts that this failure prejudiced him because\n\nsome of the jurors may have relied upon the drug rip-off to convict\n\nBucci of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.\n\n            Bucci's   challenges    appear       to   rest    upon   two   faulty\n\npremises. First, while it is possible that the evidence could have\n\nsupported other charges, a grand jury is under no obligation to\n\nindict    every   conceivable    crime     potentially       implicated     by     a\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fdefendant's conduct.            The possible Hobbs Act violation Bucci\n\ndescribes is not mutually exclusive with the charges contained\n\nwithin the indictment. Second, Bucci's argument consists of little\n\nmore   than     utter    speculation    that   the    jury   disregarded      its\n\ninstructions by convicting him of an uncharged offense.                Given the\n\nsubstantial evidence indicating that Bucci did, in fact, conspire\n\nto possess and distribute cocaine, we cannot infer that any jurors\n\ndecided that Bucci did not conspire to possess and distribute\n\ncocaine, but convicted him of that offense, heedless of the law, on\n\nthe basis that he conspired to commit robbery.                   He has utterly\n\nfailed to demonstrate either a constructive amendment of the\n\nindictment or a variance between the indictment and the evidence\n\nadduced at trial.       He cannot obtain relief on the counterintuitive\n\ntheory that the jury could have convicted him of other, additional\n\ncrimes   that    were    neither    charged    nor    detailed    in   the    jury\n\ninstructions.\n\n5.   The Firearm Count\n\n           Next,    in    his    pro   se   brief    Bucci   argues    that    the\n\nGovernment failed to introduce sufficient evidence for a properly\n\ninstructed jury to convict him of Count 3 of the indictment,\n\npossession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).            We review claims related to\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence de novo.              United States v. De La\n\nCruz, 514 F.3d 121, 141 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\f            \"The basic elements of a § 924(c)[] violation are '(1)\n\nthat the defendant committed the predicate drug trafficking crime\n\n. . .; (2) that the defendant knowingly carried or used a firearm;\n\nand (3) that the defendant did so during and in relation to the\n\nspecified predicate offense.'\"        United States v. Flecha-Maldonado,\n\n373 F.3d 170, 179 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v.\n\nFigueroa-Encarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir. 2003) (alteration\n\nin original)).      However, any particular defendant need not have\n\nphysically carried the gun for liability to attach.                   See id.\n\nRather, under Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946), the\n\nGovernment may show \"that a co-conspirator carried or used a\n\nfirearm    in   furtherance    of   the   conspiracy    and   that   this   was\n\nreasonably foreseeable to the defendant.\"              Flecha-Maldonado, 373\n\nF.3d at 179.\n\n            At trial, the Government relied on the theory that it was\n\nreasonably foreseeable to Bucci that Jordan would utilize a firearm\n\nduring the drug rip-off.       Bucci cites to United States v. Medina-\n\nRoman, 376 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), for the proposition that the\n\ngovernment was required to prove that Bucci knew \"to a practical\n\ncertainty\" that Jordan would carry or use a firearm in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy.      Id. at 5-6.       Such reliance is mistaken.        In\n\nMedina-Roman, the defendant was not notified of potential Pinkerton\n\nliability during her guilty plea and, thus, the Government was held\n\nto   the   higher   standard   associated    with   aiding    and    abetting.\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fMedina-Roman, 376 F.3d at 3 n.4, 6.        Here, the district court\n\nproperly instructed the jury concerning Pinkerton liability.     See\n\nUnited States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(holding that a \"district court may give a Pinkerton charge even\n\nthough the indictment does not plead vicarious liability\").    There\n\nwas ample evidence for the jury to conclude that Jordan's use of\n\nthe firearm was reasonably foreseeable to Bucci.\n\n            Bucci's ancillary argument, that the Government failed to\n\nprove a conspiracy to commit a drug trafficking offense, is equally\n\nmistaken.    The Government adduced sufficient evidence to convict\n\nBucci of just such a conspiracy.\n\n6.   The Jury Instructions\n\n            Next, Bucci contends in his pro se brief that the jury\n\ninstructions were erroneous because they presented the jury with an\n\nunfair Hobson's choice. He reasons that the instructions precluded\n\nthe jury from finding Bucci not guilty of Count 3 because they\n\nprovided for conviction based on either reasonable foreseeability\n\nor actual knowledge.    This argument is absurd as a matter of basic\n\nlogic.   The jury could, of course, have found Bucci not guilty of\n\nCount 3 if it either (a) rejected the government's evidence of\n\nconspiracy or (b) determined that Jordan's use of the firearm in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy was not reasonably foreseeable and\n\nthat Bucci had no actual knowledge that it would be used.      It is\n\npermissible for the government to present evidence of guilt tending\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fto demonstrate both actual and constructive knowledge.       See United\n\nStates v. Griffin, Nos. 07-1475, 07-1477, ___ F.3d ___, ___, 2008\n\nWL 1759161, at *5 (1st Cir. Apr. 18, 2008) (affirming conviction\n\nbased on evidence of actual knowledge and willful blindness in tax\n\nevasion prosecution).\n\n7.   Booker Error\n\n            Finally, Bucci argues in his pro se brief that the\n\ndistrict court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines violated\n\nthe Sixth Amendment.     See United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005).     As an initial matter, we categorically reject Bucci's\n\nargument that the remedial Booker opinion was only a temporary fix\n\nsubject to an expiration date.       While the remedial majority may\n\nhave invited Congress to take independent action, see id. at 265,\n\nit contains no indication of eventual constitutional infirmity in\n\nthe absence of a Congressional mandate. More specifically, we have\n\nheld that Booker requires reversal only where judicial fact-finding\n\nincreases    the   statutory   maximum   penalty.   United   States   v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 79 (1st Cir. 2005).        The 168 month\n\nsentence Bucci received for drug trafficking and the 84 month\n\nsentence he received for the weapons charge were both near the low\n\nend of the guidelines' ranges, far below the statutory maximums.\n\nThus, Bucci's claim of Booker error is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fB.   Jordan9\n\n           Jordan   contends   that   the   district   court   erred   by\n\npermitting the Government to redact portions of the recording          and\n\ntranscript of a December 24, 2003, conversation between Ruiz and\n\nMinotti. At trial, Jordan requested that the redacted materials be\n\nincluded pursuant to Rule 106 of the Federal Rule of Evidence for\n\npurposes of impeachment.\n\n           Jordan concedes that the rule against hearsay would have\n\nprevented him from independently offering these statements for\n\nsubstantive purposes.      Rule 106, which codifies the common law\n\ndoctrine of completeness, provides that\n\n           When a writing or recorded statement or part\n           thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse\n           party may require the introduction at that\n           time of any other part or any other writing or\n           recorded statement which ought in fairness to\n           be considered contemporaneously with it.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 106. We review a district court's rulings concerning\n\nRule 106 for abuse of discretion.        United States v. Millan, 230\n\nF.3d 431, 434-35 (1st Cir. 2000).     A defendant must show prejudice\n\nin order to obtain relief.     See United States v. Awon, 135 F.3d 96,\n\n\n\n      9\n      Jordan argues that the district court erred by determining\nthat he was subject to a mandatory minimum on the weapons charge\nbecause he brandished the firearm during the drug rip-off.       He\ncontends that brandishing a firearm is an element of the offense\nand, therefore, the government was obligated to prove this fact to\na jury in light of Booker. He acknowledges, however, that this\nchallenge is foreclosed by our decision in United States v.\nLizardo, 445 F.3d 73, 89-90 (1st Cir. 2006), and urges it merely to\npreserve his rights for further review.\n\n                                  -32-\n\f101-02 (1st Cir. 1998), abrogated on other grounds by United States\n\nv. Piper, 298 F.3d 47, 57 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Peculiarly, the Government maintains that the purview of\n\nRule 106 is limited to the order of proof.           To the contrary, our\n\ncase law unambiguously establishes that the rule of completeness\n\nmay   be   invoked   to   facilitate   the   introduction   of   otherwise\n\ninadmissible evidence.      See United States v. Simonelli, 237 F.3d\n\n19, 28 (1st Cir. 2001); Awon, 135 F.3d at 101.        Other circuits have\n\nheld differently, see, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 502 F.3d\n\n931, 965 n.9 (9th Cir. 2007), but we adhere to our own precedent.\n\n            Nonetheless,    the   district   court   did   not   abuse   its\n\ndiscretion by refusing to require the Government to present the\n\nredacted portions of the December 24 conversation. Jordan contends\n\nthat fairness required the admission of the redacted portions\n\nbecause they undermined the credibility of Minotti and Ruiz and\n\nbecause the excerpts were unduly fragmented and confusing. Neither\n\nof these arguments is well-founded.\n\n            First, we address the issue of credibility.              As an\n\ninitial matter, we note that the district court permitted defense\n\ncounsel to use the redacted statements in cross-examination, and\n\nthat defense counsel did so effectively.         Although timing may be\n\nimportant in some situations, we see no such prejudice here.\n\nMoreover, the record is pellucid that defense counsel had abundant\n\nopportunity to impeach both Ruiz and Minotti on numerous different\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fgrounds.      During the extensive cross-examination, defense counsel\n\nwas able to reveal the witnesses' myriad (and typically self-\n\nserving) inconsistencies and general dishonesty; drug abuse; drug\n\ndealing and other lawbreaking; use of foul and offensive language;\n\nand the inducement provided by the Government.                     Frankly, given the\n\nrecord before us, it is hard to imagine that the jury could have\n\nfound    either       Ruiz      or   Minotti      to    be    credible      absent     the\n\ncorroboratory evidence supplied by the Government.                          If the jury\n\ncredited their testimony at all, it did so with full knowledge that\n\nboth    men   were    scoundrels      motivated        by    the   carrot    of   reduced\n\nsentences (and, in Ruiz's case, revenge).                    Additional impeachment\n\nwould have been cumulative.             Thus, the district court acted well\n\nwithin    its   expansive        discretion       by    refusing     to     require    the\n\nintroduction         of   the    redacted      portions       of    the     December    24\n\nconversation pursuant to Rule 106.\n\n              Jordan's second contention fares only slightly better.\n\nOn appeal, Jordan argues that the excerpts of the December 24\n\nconversation are confusing, but he fails to point to specific\n\nportions      that    might      suggest    prejudicial         ambiguity.        Having\n\nindependently reviewed the evidence, we hold that any error was\n\nharmless.\n\n              We acknowledge that one excerpt might initially have\n\ngenerated some confusion.             The redacted transcript reads:\n\n\n\n\n                                           -34-\n\f           [Ruiz]: Look, first of all look . . . how did\n           . . . the guy know that I was going to go back\n           over there because somebody had to tell him.\n\n           [Minotti]:    You're out of your mind.\n\n                                   ...\n\n           [Ruiz]: I already told Tommy to get me his\n           . . . address, if you don't give [it] to me[.]\n\nExh. 8(c) (second alteration in original). In context, it is clear\n\nthat Ruiz's first statement refers to his second encounter with\n\nJordan at the Malden Medical Center, when he went back to the scene\n\nin search of his cocaine.          The second statement by Ruiz, as\n\nclarified by the redacted material, refers to Bucci.         Without the\n\nredacted portions, however, Ruiz's second statement appears to\n\nrefer to Jordan instead.\n\n           Nevertheless, the error was harmless.           First, it is\n\ndifficult to see how the mistaken impression possibly caused by the\n\nexcerpts might have prejudiced Jordan.             The evidence clearly\n\nestablished that Ruiz believed Jordan to be either a counterfeit or\n\ncorrupt policeman.      Second, the Government actually clarified on\n\ndirect examination that Ruiz was referring to \"Gino,\" not Jordan.\n\nFinally, as explained above, Jordan was afforded ample opportunity\n\nto   correct   any   possible   misapprehensions    by   extensive   cross\n\nexamination.\n\n                            III.   CONCLUSION\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm both Bucci's and\n\nJordan's convictions and sentences.\n\n                                   -35-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -36-\n\f",

Defendant-appellant David A. Jordan was convicted of conspiracy to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, over 500 grams of cocaine; possession with intent to distribute cocaine; the use or carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime; witness tampering; and three counts of making false statements to the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>To the extent that these challenges involve the sufficiency of the evidence, \"[w]e recite the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Downs-Moses,</i> 329 F.3d 253, 257 (1st Cir. 2003). Jordan and Bucci's other challenges do not involve serious factual disputes or do not demand immediate resolution on direct appeal.</p>\n<p>On July 6, 2004, a grand jury returned an eight-count indictment<sup>[1]</sup> against Bucci, Jordan, and Francis \"Skeeter\" Muolo. Muolo pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and possession charges of the indictment pursuant to an agreement with the Government. As part of this agreement, Muolo agreed to provide testimony against Bucci and Jordan (although he was not, in fact, called to the stand). He was sentenced to fifty-seven months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>This case involves the robbery of a drug dealer by other drug dealers, including Bucci, and Jordan, a police officer. Jordan, a member of the Malden, Massachusetts, Police Department since 1985, became a narcotics detective during the mid-1990's. In 2003, Jordan renewed an old acquaintance with an individual named Jon Minotti, a former corrections officer who worked in real estate and as a plasterer. At some time during their renewed relationship, Jordan began to purchase marijuana from Minotti, who dealt drugs to support his own habit. Jordan expressed anger to Minotti regarding the amount of money that cocaine dealers earned through their illicit trade.</p>\n<p>Sometime during 2003, Minotti informed Bucci, another old acquaintance for whom he had recently performed plastering work,<sup>[2]</sup> of his friendship with Jordan. Also during 2003, Minotti met yet another drug dealer, Carlos Ruiz,<sup>[3]</sup> from whom he periodically purchased ounce quantities of cocaine. Minotti introduced Bucci to Ruiz <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> later that year, but told Ruiz that Bucci's name was \"Gino.\"</p>\n<p>In late November or early December 2003, while at the apartment of a friend, Bryan Raftery,<sup>[4]</sup> Bucci informed Minotti that he wanted to rob Ruiz, with whom he was angry. Bucci devised a plan in which Jordan would arrive to \"bust\" a drug deal between Minotti and Ruiz, allowing Minotti to escape with the drugs. Muolo, another friend of Minotti, was recruited as Minotti's getaway driver. Minotti relayed the proposal to Jordan, who initially expressed some reluctance at participating.</p>\n<p>Undeterred by Jordan's lack of enthusiasm for the scheme, Bucci proceeded with alacrity. A few days before Christmas, Bucci directed Minotti to order three kilograms of cocaine from Ruiz on his behalf. On December 23, after some negotiations, Minotti and Ruiz settled on a price of either $27,000.00 or $28,000.00 per kilogram and agreed to meet at Minotti's house at 10:00 a.m. the next day to complete the transaction. With time running short, Minotti again solicited Jordan's help. Jordan, although still ambivalent, proposed that everyone involved in the prospective robbery meet in the parking lot of the Malden Medical Center the next day.</p>\n<p>Around 8:30 a.m. on December 24, Bucci, in his black S500 Mercedes Benz, license plate number 3802YL, drove to Minotti's house. Muolo apparently arrived separately. From there, Bucci, Minotti, and Muolo drove in Minotti's vehicle, a black Chevrolet Avalanche, to the Medical Center. There, they met Jordan, who was driving an unmarked police car, a tan Honda. Despite some lingering reservations, he agreed to participate in the scheme in exchange for $30,000.00. Jordan suggested that Minotti \"escape\" with the stolen drugs through a strip of woods adjacent to the Medical Center. From there, Minotti could reach a nearby street, where Muolo would pick him up. Bucci proposed that Jordan call for back-up to make the bust appear more realistic, but Jordan demurred.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to the conspirators, the DEA had tapped Ruiz's phone as part of an ongoing, mostly unrelated narcotics investigation. Around December 20, 2003, the DEA intercepted communications between Ruiz and Minotti regarding the proposed transaction. In response, the DEA set up roving surveillance outside Minotti's residence, commencing at approximately 9:00 a.m. on December 24. At 9:10 a.m., DEA Agent Jean Drouin and Massachusetts State Police Sergeant Thomas Quin observed a black Mercedes parked in the driveway with license plate number 3802YL, but noted that Minotti's black Chevrolet Avalanche was absent. When the agents returned at 9:42 a.m., the Mercedes was gone, but Minotti's Avalanche had returned.</p>\n<p>At 9:55 a.m., Ruiz arrived in a maroon Buick Park Avenue. Ruiz and Minotti left the house together in Ruiz's car to travel to the Medical Center. After a few seconds, however, Minotti instructed Ruiz to turn around, under the pretense that he had forgotten his cell phone. In reality, Minotti was experiencing doubts about the wisdom of robbing Ruiz. Leaving Ruiz in the car, Minotti called Bucci to express these concerns. Minotti told Bucci that the deal would not work anyway, falsely explaining that Ruiz wanted to be paid before relinquishing physical possession of the cocaine. Bucci instructed Minotti to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> hand over the phone to Ruiz. After a conversation between the two, which Minotti overheard, Ruiz agreed to bring all of the cocaine to the parking lot of the Medical Center, to permit Bucci an opportunity to test its quality.</p>\n<p>When Minotti and Ruiz arrived at the Medical Center they pulled alongside Bucci's vehicle, which was positioned against a rail, facing outward to the parking lot. Minotti exited the car, taking with him all three kilograms of cocaine. After observing Jordan's car entering the parking lot, perhaps twenty or third yards distant, Minotti immediately fled down an embankment into the woods carrying the three kilograms with him.</p>\n<p>Jordan positioned his car directly behind Ruiz's Buick, blocking Ruiz (but not Bucci) from escape. Jordan, in plain clothes, exited the car, shouted \"Malden Police,\" and pointed a gun at Ruiz. Jordan ordered both Ruiz and Bucci from their vehicles and frisked both men. Jordan searched Ruiz's car, examined his license, and performed a warrant check. He did not, however, perform any similar investigation of Bucci. Jordan then informed Ruiz, \"It's your lucky day. I'm going to let you go. You have a merry Christmas.\" Ruiz returned to his car and left the parking lot. Jordan departed the parking lot as well, driving directly past Agent Drouin and Sergeant Quin's surveillance location. Bucci left his car and entered the Medical Center. A few minutes later, Jordan returned to the parking lot and drove to the entrance of the Medical Center. Bucci exited the Medical Center, and the two men had a brief conversation before going their separate ways.</p>\n<p>Muolo and Minotti took the cocaine to Muolo's apartment in Stoneham. Once Bucci arrived, the conspirators opened one of the bags of cocaine. Taking the cocaine, Bucci indicated that he planned to sell it and split the proceeds with the others. Because Jordan was impatient to receive his share of the money, Bucci, Minotti, and Muolo decided to give him whatever cash was available by the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Later that afternoon, Ruiz and his brother-in-law, Armando Lovos, arrived at Minotti's house in a blue SUV. Ruiz suspected that the drug bust had been a setup, did not believe that Jordan was a real police officer, and was unsurprisingly furious with Minotti. Ruiz demanded that the cocaine be returned immediately. Minotti replied that he had abandoned the drugs in the woods and refused to return to search for them, ostensibly for fear that the police would be there. Still unsatisfied, Ruiz nevertheless left to search for the cocaine in the woods near the Medical Center. After Ruiz's departure, Minotti called Bucci to inform him of Ruiz's visit. Bucci suggested to Minotti that Jordan should confront Ruiz at the Medical Center to demonstrate his legitimacy. Minotti communicated this suggestion to Jordan, who agreed to look for Ruiz at the Medical Center.</p>\n<p>At the Medical Center, Jordan encountered Ruiz and Lovos. Jordan took Lovos's identification, but did not run a warrant check. Instead, he simply instructed Ruiz and Lovos to leave the area. Recordings from the DEA's wire on Ruiz substantiate that Ruiz was convinced he had been ripped off and that he knew Jordan was not an honest policeman. In fact, Jordan's appearance only reinforced Ruiz's suspicions, as he rightly inferred that one of the conspirators had tipped Jordan off that Ruiz and Lovos were returning to the Medical Center to search for the supposedly abandoned cocaine.</p>\n<p>At about 10:15 p.m., Minotti received a voicemail from Bucci indicating that he had left money in a \"blue tub\" outside Minotti's back door. After finding the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> money, Minotti took $5,000.00 for himself to satisfy an unrelated debt and delivered the remainder to Jordan at his home. Jordan later complained that the black bag contained only $15,000.00 and demanded the rest of his payment. Bucci, again via Minotti, promised Jordan that he would receive the rest of his payment once Bucci was able to sell the cocaine.</p>\n<p>On December 26, Jordan stopped by Minotti's house to make sure Minotti was unharmed, that Ruiz had not returned, and to ascertain when he would receive the rest of his money. Jordan instructed Minotti that, if questioned, he should tell law enforcement officers that he had been acting as an informant for Jordan in an attempt to catch Ruiz dealing drugs. Just then, Ruiz appeared at Minotti's home, accompanied by four or five henchmen. Jordan left, covering his face in an unsuccessful bid to avoid recognition.</p>\n<p>Ruiz suggested that Minotti should get in the car with him. Under the pretext of getting his coat, Minotti returned inside to call Jordan for help. Jordan suggested that Minotti call the police and complain about Ruiz trespassing, which Minotti did. When the police arrived, Minotti informed them of his ostensible role as Jordan's informant. The police instructed Ruiz, who eventually admitted to them that he was there to collect a drug debt, to leave.</p>\n<p>At that point, Jordan apparently began to regret his role in the scheme. At 1:30 p.m. on December 26, Jordan called Agent Drouin to inquire whether Ruiz was under investigation. During this conversation, Jordan asked whether the DEA had attempted any surveillance of Ruiz on December 24. Because Agent Drouin already suspected Jordan of illegal activity, he told him that, while Ruiz was a target, no operation had taken place on that particular day. In an apparent effort to cover his tracks, Jordan informed Agent Drouin of certain, carefully-selected details regarding the drug rip-off at the Medical Center. Several of these details, however, were false.</p>\n<p>Next, Jordan contacted Minotti and suggested that they return the cocaine to Ruiz or pay him for it. Minotti communicated to Bucci Jordan's desire to undo the robbery. Bucci responded that this rescission would be \"stupid\" and dangerous, as he believed trying to rescind the robbery would confirm Ruiz's suspicions about the rip-off, compounding their problems. At a meeting in Stoneham, Jordan returned a portion of his ill-gotten funds to Minotti, and instructed him to give the money to Ruiz. Despite his reluctance, Bucci agreed to surrender his share of the proceeds to Minotti. As Bucci and Minotti attempted to gather the rest of the cocaine, they received two frantic messages from Muolo indicating that something bad had happened. When they arrived at Muolo's apartment, he informed them that he had flushed the cocaine down the toilet.<sup>[5]</sup> Minotti went home, took $2,000.00 of his wife's money, and met Ruiz at the Saugus mall to compensate him for the stolen cocaine.</p>\n<p>In early May 2004, DEA agents arrested Ruiz. Although Ruiz refused to cooperate fully against his suppliers in Mexico, he agreed to provide information regarding the drug rip-off. He picked Minotti and Bucci out of a lineup. Before Ruiz agreed to cooperate, Agent Drouin called Jordan to inform him of Ruiz's arrest, but Jordan expressed very little interest.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> On May 19, 2004, Minotti encountered Muolo, supposedly by chance, at a Dunkin' Donuts. Muolo told Minotti that the police had asked him to cooperate against Minotti. He warned Minotti not to answer the phone if he called and asked to meet at a baseball field at 3:00 p.m. Minotti relayed this information to Jordan, who instructed Minotti to tell Muolo to \"keep his mouth shut\" and indicated that he did not want to talk to Minotti anymore. While Minotti waited for Muolo at their designated meeting place, DEA Agent Mark Tully and Sergeant Quin approached Minotti, who agreed to cooperate by wearing a body wire to a meeting with Jordan.</p>\n<p>Minotti arranged to meet Jordan at a skating rink in Malden. Although Jordan did not directly inculpate himself, he made a plethora of highly suspicious statements that strongly suggested that he was part of an unlawful conspiracy of some sort with Minotti, Bucci, and Muolo. The next day, May 20, Jordan attempted to speak with Minotti at his home, but Minotti refused to answer the door. Later, however, at Sergeant Quin's request, Minotti placed a recorded call to Jordan. During the call, Jordan expressed further concern about Muolo, directing Minotti to tell Muolo \"not to give the bid out.\"</p>\n<p>That same day, Agent Tully arrested Jordan. Agent Drouin, supported by several other officers, arrested Bucci outside of his wife's tanning salon in Malden as he attempted to enter his black Mercedes. After being informed of his rights, Bucci smugly taunted the officers, \"You didn't get me on any phones.\" Eventually, Bucci's black Mercedes was seized and its contents were inventoried. Of particular interest, the vehicle contained ninety-one grams of cocaine dispersed in three separate plastic baggies that were contained within one larger bag; two digital scales; $6,653.00 in cash; four mobile phones and six separate SIM cards<sup>[6]</sup>; and a pager. Officer Jamie Cepero, a Massachusetts state trooper assigned to the DEA task force, offered expert testimony regarding the contents of Bucci's black Mercedes. He testified that the above-mentioned items were probative of drug trafficking. Officer Cepero opined that the quantity of drugs found in Bucci's car, ninety-one grams, is inconsistent with mere personal use. Cepero also testified that the contents of Bucci's car lacked indicia of personal use, such as straws, mirrors, and razor blades.</p>\n<p>On April 12, 2006, following a trial, a jury returned a verdict of guilty against both Bucci and Jordan on all counts of the indictment. On November 15, 2006, the district court sentenced Bucci to a term of 252 months' imprisonment and Jordan to a term of 180 months' imprisonment. The defendants filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Bucci</i><sup>[7]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Ineffective Assistance</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Bucci contends that his trial counsel's performance was so deficient as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> to violate the Sixth Amendment and require reversal of his convictions. \"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 410 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Nevertheless, in an exceptional case, the record may be adequately developed to permit meaningful review. <i>Id.</i> In this instance, however, we are unable to draw any reasoned conclusions from the cold record.</p>\n<p>Bucci makes several fact-intensive complaints regarding his trial counsel's purportedly deficient performance. First, he asserts that trial counsel, in his opening argument, promised to the jury that he would present an alibi witness, Lisa Murphy, who would testify that Bucci's activities on December 24 were inconsistent with the Government's theory of the case. Second, Bucci complains that trial counsel addressed the prospective testimony of Muolo during his opening statement, despite the fact that the Government did not indicate an intention to call Muolo during its own opening statement. Third, Bucci contends that trial counsel rendered deficient performance by failing to lay the foundation for and offer the testimony of Ross Minnoti, Jon Minotti's brother, who was purportedly willing to testify that Jon Minotti informed him that Bucci was innocent, and that he was only implicating Bucci to save his own skin. These three issues are best left for a collateral proceeding where Bucci will have the opportunity to develop the record to explicate his claim.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we address trial counsel's closing argument. During closing, trial counsel was twice admonished for making improper remarks. First, trial counsel asked rhetorically, \"If Br[y]an Raftery made those calls for Anthony Bucci, why didn't he come in here and tell you about them?\" Following an objection by the Government, the district court gave a forceful limiting instruction, informing the jury that trial counsel's remarks were improper and that \"the government had intended to call Mr. Raftery and he, Mr. Raftery, refused to testify. He is absent in this case because he refuses to be present.\" Later, trial counsel accused the Government of knowingly and deliberately presenting perjured testimony. Again, the district court instructed the jury that trial counsel's actions were improper.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the limiting instructions issued by the district judge in response to trial counsel's remarks did little to advance Bucci's cause before the jury. At the same time, these events do not independently give rise to sufficient prejudice to merit reversal of Bucci's convictions. At worst, they may have cost Bucci some of the good will of the jury. The evidence against Bucci was overwhelming, and trial counsel's comments and the corresponding limiting instructions did nothing to add to the mountain of inculpatory evidence arrayed against him. Federal agents observed Bucci's vehicle at Minotti's house the morning of the rip-off; Bucci was observed by federal agents at the scene of the crime, parked alongside Ruiz; the agents observed Bucci speaking with Jordan outside the Medical Center immediately after the rip-off; and cocaine, two digital scales, $6,653.00 in cash, four mobile phones and six separate SIM cards, and a pager were found in Bucci's vehicle upon <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> his arrest. Finally, of course, Minotti's and, to a lesser extent, Ruiz's testimony directly implicated Bucci in the crime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Matters Related to Severance</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Bucci argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to sever. At issue is Exhibit 24, a recording of a May 19, 2004, conversation between Bucci's codefendant, Jordan, and Minotti, in which Bucci's name is mentioned. The recording was properly introduced against Jordan as an admission. The district court ruled, however, that Jordan's statements were inadmissible hearsay in relation to Bucci. The district court denied Bucci's pretrial motion to sever as well as his trial motion to redact his name from the statements. To protect Bucci from unfair prejudice, the district court, on two separate occasions, instructed the jury that the statements were not admissible against Bucci. Bucci concedes that his Confrontation Clause rights were not violated because Jordan testified in his own defense at trial. <i>California v. Green,</i> 399 U.S. 149, 164, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (holding that \"the Confrontation Clause does not require excluding from evidence the prior statements of a witness who concedes making those statements\"). Thus, the issue at hand is one of evidence rather than constitutional law.</p>\n<p>We \"review the denial of a motion to sever only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Page,</i> 521 F.3d 101, 109 (1st Cir.2008). \"[S]everance is particularly difficult to obtain where, as here, multiple defendants share a single indictment.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 425 F.3d 23, 37 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted)). To merit reversal on the basis of a district court's denial of severance, a \"defendant must show `prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.'\" <i>United States v. Turner,</i> 501 F.3d 59, 73 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d 36, 49 (1st Cir.1999)). \"[S]everance is particularly disfavored in conspiracy cases.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>As a general matter, we cannot say that the district court abused its wide discretion in refusing to grant separate trials at the outset of the proceedings. Our jurisprudence favors trying co-conspirators together, despite the reality that evidence admissible against one defendant may be, and often is, inadmissible with regard to others. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> We see no unusual circumstances that should have tilted the balance in favor of severance in this particular case.</p>\n<p>Second, we address Bucci's contention that the district court committed reversible error by issuing a limiting instruction rather than redacting Bucci's name from the recording and the transcript provided to the jury. Even where the Confrontation Clause is implicated, we ordinarily presume that jurors will follow limiting instructions. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Durán,</i> 507 F.3d 749, 769 (1st Cir.2007). Occasionally, however, at least in the constitutional context, a limiting instruction will not be sufficient to preserve a co-defendant's rights where the extrajudicial statement is \"powerfully incriminating\" and \"`inculpatory on its face.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 520 (1st Cir.2005)). \"Statements that are incriminating only when linked to other evidence in the case\" do not merit such scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 520) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The district court determined that Jordan's remarks, while powerfully incriminating as to Jordan, did not directly inculpate Bucci. Significantly, defense counsel candidly and explicitly agreed with this assessment while arguing Bucci's motion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> to sever. To be sure, Jordan's remarks were neither flattering nor helpful to Bucci's defense. The recording contains numerous derisive references to Bucci as well as a discussion concerning whether Bucci had been arrested and whether he was providing information to law enforcement. Thus, the recording surely implies that Bucci participated with Jordan and Minotti in an illicit undertaking of some species. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the district court erred by refusing to redact the recording to exclude Bucci's name. In light of our presumption that jurors follow limiting instructions such as those given here, the absence of constitutional error, and the inferential nature by which Jordan's statements link Bucci to the charged conduct, we find no abuse of discretion. Moreover, any error was clearly harmless given the substantial evidence of guilt as described above.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, Bucci asserts that the prosecutor's closing remarks made it impossible for the jurors to follow the district court's limiting instruction. <i>See </i><i>Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 522 (reversing conviction where prosecutor implored jury to infer defendant's guilt from codefendant's redacted confession). Because he failed to object at trial, we review this aspect of his challenge only for plain error. <i>Rodríguez-Durán,</i> 507 F.3d at 770-71. In large part, references to the May 19 conversation were restricted entirely to the prosecutor's discussion of Jordan. Neither the prosecutor nor the court were required to remind the jurors by rote, in each instance the recording was mentioned, that the recording was not admissible against Bucci. We think that the district court's two separate admonitions that the jurors should not consider the May 19 recording as evidence against Bucci were sufficient to prevent confusion.</p>\n<p>Bucci argues that the prosecutor's final summation, when he called for a guilty verdict against both defendants, was improper. Following a brief discussion of Bucci's culpability, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote>David Jordan, ladies and gentleman, at every step of this case . . . David Jordan chose to stand on the side of the criminal instead of the side of law enforcement. On December 24th at the Malden Medical Center parking lot, on December 26th when he was not protecting Jon Minotti and his family from the men who showed up at his home, in each of the calls with Agent Drouin, and on . . . May 19 as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Ladies and gentleman, the most compelling testimony in this case, the most compelling word in this case didn't come from Jon Minotti. The most persuasive testimony in this case didn't come from Carloz Ruiz. It didn't even come from the agents [who] testified in this case. Ladies and gentlemen, the most persuasive, the most compelling, and the most damning words in this case came from David Jordan's own mouth, both on that tape and when he got up on that witness stand and he lied to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Ladies and gentleman, I ask you to find both of these men guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all the counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p>It is readily apparent, in context, that the discussion of the recording concerned Jordan alone. The prosecutor had already summed up his case regarding Bucci before discussing Jordan for the final time. By contrast, in <i>Vega Molina,</i> a case upon which Bucci relies, the prosecutor explicitly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> requested the jury to convict the defendant based on the co-defendant's out-of-court confession, over the objection of the defendant and without a limiting instruction. 407 F.3d at 522. In <i>Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), to which Bucci also cites, the prosecutor argued that information gleaned from a codefendant's confession supported an inference of guilt. <i>See id.</i> at 205 &amp; n. 2, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Here, the facts fall well short of showing such prejudicial conduct.</p>\n<p>Finally, to the extent they did invite confusion, we see very little prejudice in the prosecutor's remarks. As detailed above, the evidence against Bucci was daunting and his theory of innocence scarcely credible. Moreover, the recording was not highly incriminating of Bucci. While it suggested that Jordan did not consider him to be an exemplary citizen, the jury already knew that from the contents of his black Mercedes. Thus, the prosecutor's comments during closing argument do not warrant reversal of Bucci's convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Courtroom Closures</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In a separate <i>pro se</i> brief, Bucci maintains that reversal of his convictions is necessary because the district court committed structural error by closing the courtroom to the public on two occasions. Because Bucci failed to object at trial, we review only for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Thomas,</i> Nos. 98-1051, 98-1052, 98-1116, 2000 WL 236481, at *2, ___ Fed. Appx. ___, ___ (2d Cir. Feb.14, 2000) (unpublished summary disposition) (applying plain error analysis to purported violation of defendant's right to public trial).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to a public trial. <i>Waller v. Georgia,</i> 467 U.S. 39, 46, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984); <i>Owens v. United States,</i> 483 F.3d 48, 61 (1st Cir.2007). Bucci argues that the district court erred by closing the courtroom during jury selection and later during a contempt proceeding against Raftery. We decline to address his challenge to the purported closure during jury selection at this time because it is not yet ripe. Although Bucci has attempted to submit additional evidence to supplement the Spartan record, it remains inadequate to permit meaningful review. Bucci will have an opportunity, if he so chooses, to present this argument in a petition for collateral relief before the district court. At that point, the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing to test the merits of Bucci's claim. <i>See id.</i> at 66.</p>\n<p>Bucci also argues that the district court erred by closing the courtroom during the contempt proceeding against Raftery. During this hearing, the Government called its next prospective witness, Raftery, to the stand. As expected, Raftery refused to testify, despite a grant of immunity. He indicated that he was concerned about potential perjury charges due to conflicts between his anticipated testimony and the statements he made before the grand jury and federal agents. The district court placed Raftery in civil contempt and warned him of the possibility that criminal contempt charges might be filed against him should he not testify. Despite these remonstrations, Raftery persisted in his refusal to testify. At the end of the hearing, the district court ordered that Raftery be taken into immediate custody.</p>\n<p>Bucci's argument is flawed in two ways. First, the Sixth Amendment's requirement that a trial be public does not apply with its usual force to criminal contempt proceedings. <i>See </i><i>Levine v. United States,</i> 362 U.S. 610, 616, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960). Here, the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> court specifically indicated that Raftery would be set free if he agreed to testify. Thus, the contempt order was civil, not criminal, in nature. <i>See </i><i>Int'l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell,</i> 512 U.S. 821, 827-28, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994). Civil contempt proceedings are not governed by the Sixth Amendment and require fewer procedural protections. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Winter,</i> 70 F.3d 655, 661 (1st Cir.1995) (stating that \"a court may impose civil contempt sanctions pursuant to . . . minimal procedures\" but that \"criminal contempt sanctions may be imposed only if the court provides certain constitutional protections\"); <i>accord </i><i>Santibáñez v. Wier McMahon &amp; Co.,</i> 105 F.3d 234, 242-43 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding that protections of Sixth Amendment do not apply to civil contempt proceedings); <i>Northeast Women's Ctr., Inc. v. McMonagle,</i> 939 F.2d 57, 68-69 (3d Cir.1991) (explaining that \"arguments predicated on the Sixth Amendment are inapposite\" to civil contempt proceeding); <i>In re Di Bella,</i> 518 F.2d 955, 958 (2nd Cir.1975) (rejecting challenge to courtroom closure in civil contempt context). Consequently, not even Raftery himself, much less Bucci, could have invoked the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial during the civil contempt hearing.</p>\n<p>Second, the contempt proceeding against Raftery was almost entirely collateral to Bucci's own trial and, thus, any closure did not infringe Bucci's Sixth Amendment right. <i>See Petito v. Artuz,</i> 69 Fed.Appx. 26, 28 (2d Cir.2003) (unpublished summary disposition) (rejecting defendant's Fifth Amendment challenge to court's decision to exclude <i>him</i> from contempt proceeding against recalcitrant witness); <i>United States v. Melchor Moreno,</i> 536 F.2d 1042, 1047 n. 7 (5th Cir.1976) (explaining that \"[t]he usual Sixth Amendment rights of cross-examination were only peripherally at stake here, since the hearing did not relate to guilt but to the collateral issue of whether [a witness's Fifth Amendment] privilege was properly invoked\"); <i>see also </i><i>Brown v. Kuhlmann,</i> 142 F.3d 529, 541 (2d Cir.1998) (holding that courtroom closure during trial itself did not infringe defendant's Sixth Amendment rights where it involved cumulative testimony related to matter collateral to charged offense); <i>United States v. Gallagher,</i> 576 F.2d 1028, 1040 (3d Cir.1978) (finding no error where trial judge cleared courtroom, not excepting even attorneys, to explore possible self-incrimination issues related to witness).</p>\n<p>During this particular closure, no evidence was presented against either defendant; the defendants and their counsel were permitted to remain; and the courtroom was promptly reopened at the conclusion of the contempt proceeding. In the end, the temporal proximity and causal relationship between Bucci's criminal trial and the civil contempt hearing against Raftery did not necessarily render the two proceedings one and the same. Although Bucci undoubtedly enjoyed a right to compulsory process under the Sixth Amendment to call Raftery as a witness, he lacked any converse right to prevent him from testifying. Put differently, he had no cognizable constitutional interest under the Sixth Amendment in Raftery's refusal to testify when called by the Government. Thus, although it would have been better practice for the trial judge to have made specific record findings justifying his decision to close the courtroom, <i>see </i><i>Waller,</i> 467 U.S. at 44-47, 104 S.Ct. 2210, on these facts and under a plain error standard of review, Bucci suffered no constitutional deprivation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Constructive Amendment of the Indictment and Alleged Variances</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Bucci argues in his <i>pro se</i> brief that the district court erred by permitting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> a constructive amendment of the indictment. Constructive amendments are forbidden by the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees defendants the right to be tried only on charges indicted by a grand jury. U.S. Const. amend V; <i>United States v. Fornia-Castillo,</i> 408 F.3d 52, 66 (1st Cir. 2005). \"A constructive amendment is considered prejudicial per se and grounds for reversal of a conviction.\" <i>United States v. DeCicco,</i> 439 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir.2006). To determine whether a constructive amendment has occurred, we examine whether the terms of the indictment were \"altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Our review is <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> 490 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Bucci also alleges two different but related variances between the indictment and the evidence adduced against him at trial. \"A variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a scenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Cianci,</i> 378 F.3d 71, 94 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted)). A variance mandates reversal only where it is both material and prejudicial. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In his brief, Bucci conflates his constructive amendment argument with his variance claim. Rather than engage in a futile endeavor to parse the two, we address them simultaneously. His underlying challenge lacks merit under either theory. First, Bucci asserts that while the indictment alleged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, the evidence at trial supported only a conspiracy to commit robbery. Second, Bucci contends that the indictment was faulty because it failed to allege a Hobbs Act conspiracy. Bucci asserts that this failure prejudiced him because some of the jurors may have relied upon the drug rip-off to convict Bucci of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p>Bucci's challenges appear to rest upon two faulty premises. First, while it is possible that the evidence could have supported other charges, a grand jury is under no obligation to indict every conceivable crime potentially implicated by a defendant's conduct. The possible Hobbs Act violation Bucci describes is not mutually exclusive with the charges contained within the indictment. Second, Bucci's argument consists of little more than utter speculation that the jury disregarded its instructions by convicting him of an uncharged offense. Given the substantial evidence indicating that Bucci did, in fact, conspire to possess and distribute cocaine, we cannot infer that any jurors decided that Bucci did not conspire to possess and distribute cocaine, but convicted him of that offense, heedless of the law, on the basis that he conspired to commit robbery. He has utterly failed to demonstrate either a constructive amendment of the indictment or a variance between the indictment and the evidence adduced at trial. He cannot obtain relief on the counterintuitive theory that the jury could have convicted him of other, additional crimes that were neither charged nor detailed in the jury instructions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>The Firearm Count</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Next, in his <i>pro se</i> brief Bucci argues that the Government failed to introduce sufficient evidence for a properly instructed jury to convict him of Count 3 of the indictment, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). We review claims related to the sufficiency of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> the evidence <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> 514 F.3d 121, 141 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>\"The basic elements of a § 924(c)[] violation are `(1) that the defendant committed the predicate drug trafficking crime . . .; (2) that the defendant knowingly carried or used a firearm; and (3) that the defendant did so during and in relation to the specified predicate offense.'\" <i>United States v. Flecha-Maldonado,</i> 373 F.3d 170, 179 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir.2003) (alteration in original)). However, any particular defendant need not have physically carried the gun for liability to attach. <i>See id.</i> Rather, under <i>Pinkerton v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), the Government may show \"that a co-conspirator carried or used a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy and that this was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.\" <i>Flecha-Maldonado,</i> 373 F.3d at 179.</p>\n<p>At trial, the Government relied on the theory that it was reasonably foreseeable to Bucci that Jordan would utilize a firearm during the drug rip-off. Bucci cites to <i>United States v. Medina-Roman,</i> 376 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004), for the proposition that the government was required to prove that Bucci knew \"to a practical certainty\" that Jordan would carry or use a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> at 5-6. Such reliance is mistaken. In <i>Medina-Roman,</i> the defendant was not notified of potential <i>Pinkerton</i> liability during her guilty plea and, thus, the Government was held to the higher standard associated with aiding and abetting. <i>Medina-Roman,</i> 376 F.3d at 3 n. 4, 6. Here, the district court properly instructed the jury concerning <i>Pinkerton</i> liability. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 917 F.2d 607, 612 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that a \"district court may give a <i>Pinkerton</i> charge even though the indictment does not plead vicarious liability\"). There was ample evidence for the jury to conclude that Jordan's use of the firearm was reasonably foreseeable to Bucci.</p>\n<p>Bucci's ancillary argument, that the Government failed to prove a conspiracy to commit a drug trafficking offense, is equally mistaken. The Government adduced sufficient evidence to convict Bucci of just such a conspiracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. <i>The Jury Instructions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Next, Bucci contends in his <i>pro se</i> brief that the jury instructions were erroneous because they presented the jury with an unfair Hobson's choice. He reasons that the instructions precluded the jury from finding Bucci not guilty of Count 3 because they provided for conviction based on either reasonable foreseeability or actual knowledge. This argument is absurd as a matter of basic logic. The jury could, of course, have found Bucci not guilty of Count 3 if it either (a) rejected the government's evidence of conspiracy or (b) determined that Jordan's use of the firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy was not reasonably foreseeable and that Bucci had no actual knowledge that it would be used. It is permissible for the government to present evidence of guilt tending to demonstrate both actual and constructive knowledge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Griffin,</i> Nos. 07-1475, 07-1477, 524 F.3d 71, 78, 2008 WL 1759161, at *5 (1st Cir.2008) (affirming conviction based on evidence of actual knowledge and willful blindness in tax evasion prosecution).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. <i>Booker Error</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, Bucci argues in his <i>pro se</i> brief that the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As an initial matter, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> we categorically reject Bucci's argument that the remedial <i>Booker</i> opinion was only a temporary fix subject to an expiration date. While the remedial majority may have invited Congress to take independent action, <i>see id.</i> at 265, 125 S.Ct. 738, it contains no indication of eventual constitutional infirmity in the absence of a Congressional mandate. More specifically, we have held that <i>Booker</i> requires reversal only where judicial fact-finding increases the statutory maximum penalty. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 79 (1st Cir.2005). The 168 month sentence Bucci received for drug trafficking and the 84 month sentence he received for the weapons charge were both near the low end of the guidelines' ranges, far below the statutory maximums. Thus, Bucci's claim of <i>Booker</i> error is without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Jordan</i><sup>[9]</sup></h2>\n<p>Jordan contends that the district court erred by permitting the Government to redact portions of the recording and transcript of a December 24, 2003, conversation between Ruiz and Minotti. At trial, Jordan requested that the redacted materials be included pursuant to Rule 106 of the Federal Rule of Evidence for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n<p>Jordan concedes that the rule against hearsay would have prevented him from independently offering these statements for substantive purposes. Rule 106, which codifies the common law doctrine of completeness, provides that</p>\n<blockquote>When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.</blockquote>\n<p>Fed.R.Evid. 106. We review a district court's rulings concerning Rule 106 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Millan,</i> 230 F.3d 431, 434-35 (1st Cir.2000). A defendant must show prejudice in order to obtain relief. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Awon,</i> 135 F.3d 96, 101-02 (1st Cir.1998), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>United States v. Piper,</i> 298 F.3d 47, 57 n. 5 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Peculiarly, the Government maintains that the purview of Rule 106 is limited to the order of proof. To the contrary, our case law unambiguously establishes that the rule of completeness may be invoked to facilitate the introduction of otherwise inadmissible evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Simonelli,</i> 237 F.3d 19, 28 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Awon,</i> 135 F.3d at 101. Other circuits have held differently, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 502 F.3d 931, 965 n. 9 (9th Cir.2007), but we adhere to our own precedent.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to require the Government to present the redacted portions of the December 24 conversation. Jordan contends that fairness required the admission of the redacted portions because they undermined the credibility of Minotti and Ruiz and because the excerpts were unduly fragmented and confusing. Neither of these arguments is well-founded.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> First, we address the issue of credibility. As an initial matter, we note that the district court permitted defense counsel to use the redacted statements in cross-examination, and that defense counsel did so effectively. Although timing may be important in some situations, we see no such prejudice here. Moreover, the record is pellucid that defense counsel had abundant opportunity to impeach both Ruiz and Minotti on numerous different grounds. During the extensive cross-examination, defense counsel was able to reveal the witnesses' myriad (and typically self-serving) inconsistencies and general dishonesty; drug abuse; drug dealing and other lawbreaking; use of foul and offensive language; and the inducement provided by the Government. Frankly, given the record before us, it is hard to imagine that the jury could have found either Ruiz or Minotti to be credible absent the corroboratory evidence supplied by the Government. If the jury credited their testimony at all, it did so with full knowledge that both men were scoundrels motivated by the carrot of reduced sentences (and, in Ruiz's case, revenge). Additional impeachment would have been cumulative. Thus, the district court acted well within its expansive discretion by refusing to require the introduction of the redacted portions of the December 24 conversation pursuant to Rule 106.</p>\n<p>Jordan's second contention fares only slightly better. On appeal, Jordan argues that the excerpts of the December 24 conversation are confusing, but he fails to point to specific portions that might suggest prejudicial ambiguity. Having independently reviewed the evidence, we hold that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that one excerpt might initially have generated some confusion. The redacted transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote>[Ruiz]: Look, first of all look . . . how did . . . the guy know that I was going to go back over there because somebody had to tell him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Minotti]: You're out of your mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Ruiz]: I already told Tommy to get me his . . . address, if you don't give [it] to me[.]</blockquote>\n<p>Exh. 8(c) (second alteration in original). In context, it is clear that Ruiz's first statement refers to his second encounter with Jordan at the Malden Medical Center, when he went back to the scene in search of his cocaine. The second statement by Ruiz, as clarified by the redacted material, refers to Bucci. Without the redacted portions, however, Ruiz's second statement appears to refer to Jordan instead.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the error was harmless. First, it is difficult to see how the mistaken impression possibly caused by the excerpts might have prejudiced Jordan. The evidence clearly established that Ruiz believed Jordan to be either a counterfeit or corrupt policeman. Second, the <i>Government</i> actually clarified on direct examination that Ruiz was referring to \"Gino,\" not Jordan. Finally, as explained above, Jordan was afforded ample opportunity to correct any possible misapprehensions by extensive cross examination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm both Bucci's and Jordan's convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Count 1 charged the defendants with conspiracy to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, over 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. Count 2 charged them with possession with intent to distribute over 500 grams of cocaine pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Count 3 charged them with using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). Count 4 charged Jordan with witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3). Count 5 charged Bucci with another count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Finally, Counts 6 through 8 charged Jordan with making false statements to the DEA, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.</p>\n<p>[2]  Minotti and Bucci also engaged in several unrelated drug transactions. The district court, however, excluded evidence regarding these deals as unduly prejudicial. Thus, we will not consider them in our review.</p>\n<p>[3]  Ruiz pleaded guilty to a separate indictment. He received substantial sentence reductions in exchange for his testimony against Bucci and Jordan. Additionally, he received safety valve treatment for which he almost certainly would not have been eligible had the government disclosed information, adduced in this case, to the sentencing court concerning numerous threats Ruiz made against Minotti. The jury, of course, was entitled to credit Ruiz's testimony, which was mostly corroborated by reliable evidence, despite these inducements.</p>\n<p>[4]  Raftery, despite a grant of immunity, refused to testify at the defendants' trial and was held in civil contempt. He subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal contempt and was sentenced to probation.</p>\n<p>[5]  Later, Muolo informed Minotti that he had, in fact, given the cocaine to Bucci and lied to the others at Bucci's request.</p>\n<p>[6]  A SIM, or \"security identity module,\" card is the device within a phone that contains the unique information identifying a particular subscriber.</p>\n<p>[7]  Bucci has filed four <i>pro se</i> motions that remain pending. We deny Bucci's motion to supplement the record (Docket No. 102) and his motion to correct the trial transcript (Docket No. 152). These matters are better addressed by the district court on a petition for collateral review. We grant Bucci's second motion to supplement the record (Docket No. 128), given that the document in question has already been made a part of the record by the district court. It is not, however, pertinent to any issue pending before us. Finally, we deny Bucci's motion to file a supplemental reply brief (Docket No. 155). We require no further elaboration of his claims of error.</p>\n<p>[8]  Indeed, to the extent that Bucci claims that Jordan's statements were prejudicial because they were derogatory, we note that Bucci's own theory of the case rested on the premise that he was a drug addict rather than a drug dealer.</p>\n<p>[9]  Jordan argues that the district court erred by determining that he was subject to a mandatory minimum on the weapons charge because he brandished the firearm during the drug rip-off. He contends that brandishing a firearm is an element of the offense and, therefore, the government was obligated to prove this fact to a jury in light of <i>Booker.</i> He acknowledges, however, that this challenge is foreclosed by our decision in <i>United States v. Lizardo,</i> 445 F.3d 73, 89-90 (1st Cir.2006), and urges it merely to preserve his rights for further review.</p>\n\n</div>",

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>To the extent that these challenges involve the sufficiency of the evidence, \"[w]e recite the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Downs-Moses,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781979\"><a href=\"/opinion/781979/united-states-v-radmen-downs-moses-ramon-sanchez-hernandez-raul/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 257 (1st Cir. 2003). Jordan and Bucci's other challenges do not involve serious factual disputes or do not demand immediate resolution on direct appeal.</p>\n<p>On July 6, 2004, a grand jury returned an eight-count indictment<sup>[1]</sup> against Bucci, Jordan, and Francis \"Skeeter\" Muolo. Muolo pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and possession charges of the indictment pursuant to an agreement with the Government. As part of this agreement, Muolo agreed to provide testimony against Bucci and Jordan (although he was not, in fact, called to the stand). He was sentenced to fifty-seven months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>This case involves the robbery of a drug dealer by other drug dealers, including Bucci, and Jordan, a police officer. Jordan, a member of the Malden, Massachusetts, Police Department since 1985, became a narcotics detective during the mid-1990's. In 2003, Jordan renewed an old acquaintance with an individual named Jon Minotti, a former corrections officer who worked in real estate and as a plasterer. At some time during their renewed relationship, Jordan began to purchase marijuana from Minotti, who dealt drugs to support his own habit. Jordan expressed anger to Minotti regarding the amount of money that cocaine dealers earned through their illicit trade.</p>\n<p>Sometime during 2003, Minotti informed Bucci, another old acquaintance for whom he had recently performed plastering work,<sup>[2]</sup> of his friendship with Jordan. Also during 2003, Minotti met yet another drug dealer, Carlos Ruiz,<sup>[3]</sup> from whom he periodically purchased ounce quantities of cocaine. Minotti introduced Bucci to Ruiz <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> later that year, but told Ruiz that Bucci's name was \"Gino.\"</p>\n<p>In late November or early December 2003, while at the apartment of a friend, Bryan Raftery,<sup>[4]</sup> Bucci informed Minotti that he wanted to rob Ruiz, with whom he was angry. Bucci devised a plan in which Jordan would arrive to \"bust\" a drug deal between Minotti and Ruiz, allowing Minotti to escape with the drugs. Muolo, another friend of Minotti, was recruited as Minotti's getaway driver. Minotti relayed the proposal to Jordan, who initially expressed some reluctance at participating.</p>\n<p>Undeterred by Jordan's lack of enthusiasm for the scheme, Bucci proceeded with alacrity. A few days before Christmas, Bucci directed Minotti to order three kilograms of cocaine from Ruiz on his behalf. On December 23, after some negotiations, Minotti and Ruiz settled on a price of either $27,000.00 or $28,000.00 per kilogram and agreed to meet at Minotti's house at 10:00 a.m. the next day to complete the transaction. With time running short, Minotti again solicited Jordan's help. Jordan, although still ambivalent, proposed that everyone involved in the prospective robbery meet in the parking lot of the Malden Medical Center the next day.</p>\n<p>Around 8:30 a.m. on December 24, Bucci, in his black S500 Mercedes Benz, license plate number 3802YL, drove to Minotti's house. Muolo apparently arrived separately. From there, Bucci, Minotti, and Muolo drove in Minotti's vehicle, a black Chevrolet Avalanche, to the Medical Center. There, they met Jordan, who was driving an unmarked police car, a tan Honda. Despite some lingering reservations, he agreed to participate in the scheme in exchange for $30,000.00. Jordan suggested that Minotti \"escape\" with the stolen drugs through a strip of woods adjacent to the Medical Center. From there, Minotti could reach a nearby street, where Muolo would pick him up. Bucci proposed that Jordan call for back-up to make the bust appear more realistic, but Jordan demurred.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to the conspirators, the DEA had tapped Ruiz's phone as part of an ongoing, mostly unrelated narcotics investigation. Around December 20, 2003, the DEA intercepted communications between Ruiz and Minotti regarding the proposed transaction. In response, the DEA set up roving surveillance outside Minotti's residence, commencing at approximately 9:00 a.m. on December 24. At 9:10 a.m., DEA Agent Jean Drouin and Massachusetts State Police Sergeant Thomas Quin observed a black Mercedes parked in the driveway with license plate number 3802YL, but noted that Minotti's black Chevrolet Avalanche was absent. When the agents returned at 9:42 a.m., the Mercedes was gone, but Minotti's Avalanche had returned.</p>\n<p>At 9:55 a.m., Ruiz arrived in a maroon Buick Park Avenue. Ruiz and Minotti left the house together in Ruiz's car to travel to the Medical Center. After a few seconds, however, Minotti instructed Ruiz to turn around, under the pretense that he had forgotten his cell phone. In reality, Minotti was experiencing doubts about the wisdom of robbing Ruiz. Leaving Ruiz in the car, Minotti called Bucci to express these concerns. Minotti told Bucci that the deal would not work anyway, falsely explaining that Ruiz wanted to be paid before relinquishing physical possession of the cocaine. Bucci instructed Minotti to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> hand over the phone to Ruiz. After a conversation between the two, which Minotti overheard, Ruiz agreed to bring all of the cocaine to the parking lot of the Medical Center, to permit Bucci an opportunity to test its quality.</p>\n<p>When Minotti and Ruiz arrived at the Medical Center they pulled alongside Bucci's vehicle, which was positioned against a rail, facing outward to the parking lot. Minotti exited the car, taking with him all three kilograms of cocaine. After observing Jordan's car entering the parking lot, perhaps twenty or third yards distant, Minotti immediately fled down an embankment into the woods carrying the three kilograms with him.</p>\n<p>Jordan positioned his car directly behind Ruiz's Buick, blocking Ruiz (but not Bucci) from escape. Jordan, in plain clothes, exited the car, shouted \"Malden Police,\" and pointed a gun at Ruiz. Jordan ordered both Ruiz and Bucci from their vehicles and frisked both men. Jordan searched Ruiz's car, examined his license, and performed a warrant check. He did not, however, perform any similar investigation of Bucci. Jordan then informed Ruiz, \"It's your lucky day. I'm going to let you go. You have a merry Christmas.\" Ruiz returned to his car and left the parking lot. Jordan departed the parking lot as well, driving directly past Agent Drouin and Sergeant Quin's surveillance location. Bucci left his car and entered the Medical Center. A few minutes later, Jordan returned to the parking lot and drove to the entrance of the Medical Center. Bucci exited the Medical Center, and the two men had a brief conversation before going their separate ways.</p>\n<p>Muolo and Minotti took the cocaine to Muolo's apartment in Stoneham. Once Bucci arrived, the conspirators opened one of the bags of cocaine. Taking the cocaine, Bucci indicated that he planned to sell it and split the proceeds with the others. Because Jordan was impatient to receive his share of the money, Bucci, Minotti, and Muolo decided to give him whatever cash was available by the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Later that afternoon, Ruiz and his brother-in-law, Armando Lovos, arrived at Minotti's house in a blue SUV. Ruiz suspected that the drug bust had been a setup, did not believe that Jordan was a real police officer, and was unsurprisingly furious with Minotti. Ruiz demanded that the cocaine be returned immediately. Minotti replied that he had abandoned the drugs in the woods and refused to return to search for them, ostensibly for fear that the police would be there. Still unsatisfied, Ruiz nevertheless left to search for the cocaine in the woods near the Medical Center. After Ruiz's departure, Minotti called Bucci to inform him of Ruiz's visit. Bucci suggested to Minotti that Jordan should confront Ruiz at the Medical Center to demonstrate his legitimacy. Minotti communicated this suggestion to Jordan, who agreed to look for Ruiz at the Medical Center.</p>\n<p>At the Medical Center, Jordan encountered Ruiz and Lovos. Jordan took Lovos's identification, but did not run a warrant check. Instead, he simply instructed Ruiz and Lovos to leave the area. Recordings from the DEA's wire on Ruiz substantiate that Ruiz was convinced he had been ripped off and that he knew Jordan was not an honest policeman. In fact, Jordan's appearance only reinforced Ruiz's suspicions, as he rightly inferred that one of the conspirators had tipped Jordan off that Ruiz and Lovos were returning to the Medical Center to search for the supposedly abandoned cocaine.</p>\n<p>At about 10:15 p.m., Minotti received a voicemail from Bucci indicating that he had left money in a \"blue tub\" outside Minotti's back door. After finding the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> money, Minotti took $5,000.00 for himself to satisfy an unrelated debt and delivered the remainder to Jordan at his home. Jordan later complained that the black bag contained only $15,000.00 and demanded the rest of his payment. Bucci, again via Minotti, promised Jordan that he would receive the rest of his payment once Bucci was able to sell the cocaine.</p>\n<p>On December 26, Jordan stopped by Minotti's house to make sure Minotti was unharmed, that Ruiz had not returned, and to ascertain when he would receive the rest of his money. Jordan instructed Minotti that, if questioned, he should tell law enforcement officers that he had been acting as an informant for Jordan in an attempt to catch Ruiz dealing drugs. Just then, Ruiz appeared at Minotti's home, accompanied by four or five henchmen. Jordan left, covering his face in an unsuccessful bid to avoid recognition.</p>\n<p>Ruiz suggested that Minotti should get in the car with him. Under the pretext of getting his coat, Minotti returned inside to call Jordan for help. Jordan suggested that Minotti call the police and complain about Ruiz trespassing, which Minotti did. When the police arrived, Minotti informed them of his ostensible role as Jordan's informant. The police instructed Ruiz, who eventually admitted to them that he was there to collect a drug debt, to leave.</p>\n<p>At that point, Jordan apparently began to regret his role in the scheme. At 1:30 p.m. on December 26, Jordan called Agent Drouin to inquire whether Ruiz was under investigation. During this conversation, Jordan asked whether the DEA had attempted any surveillance of Ruiz on December 24. Because Agent Drouin already suspected Jordan of illegal activity, he told him that, while Ruiz was a target, no operation had taken place on that particular day. In an apparent effort to cover his tracks, Jordan informed Agent Drouin of certain, carefully-selected details regarding the drug rip-off at the Medical Center. Several of these details, however, were false.</p>\n<p>Next, Jordan contacted Minotti and suggested that they return the cocaine to Ruiz or pay him for it. Minotti communicated to Bucci Jordan's desire to undo the robbery. Bucci responded that this rescission would be \"stupid\" and dangerous, as he believed trying to rescind the robbery would confirm Ruiz's suspicions about the rip-off, compounding their problems. At a meeting in Stoneham, Jordan returned a portion of his ill-gotten funds to Minotti, and instructed him to give the money to Ruiz. Despite his reluctance, Bucci agreed to surrender his share of the proceeds to Minotti. As Bucci and Minotti attempted to gather the rest of the cocaine, they received two frantic messages from Muolo indicating that something bad had happened. When they arrived at Muolo's apartment, he informed them that he had flushed the cocaine down the toilet.<sup>[5]</sup> Minotti went home, took $2,000.00 of his wife's money, and met Ruiz at the Saugus mall to compensate him for the stolen cocaine.</p>\n<p>In early May 2004, DEA agents arrested Ruiz. Although Ruiz refused to cooperate fully against his suppliers in Mexico, he agreed to provide information regarding the drug rip-off. He picked Minotti and Bucci out of a lineup. Before Ruiz agreed to cooperate, Agent Drouin called Jordan to inform him of Ruiz's arrest, but Jordan expressed very little interest.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> On May 19, 2004, Minotti encountered Muolo, supposedly by chance, at a Dunkin' Donuts. Muolo told Minotti that the police had asked him to cooperate against Minotti. He warned Minotti not to answer the phone if he called and asked to meet at a baseball field at 3:00 p.m. Minotti relayed this information to Jordan, who instructed Minotti to tell Muolo to \"keep his mouth shut\" and indicated that he did not want to talk to Minotti anymore. While Minotti waited for Muolo at their designated meeting place, DEA Agent Mark Tully and Sergeant Quin approached Minotti, who agreed to cooperate by wearing a body wire to a meeting with Jordan.</p>\n<p>Minotti arranged to meet Jordan at a skating rink in Malden. Although Jordan did not directly inculpate himself, he made a plethora of highly suspicious statements that strongly suggested that he was part of an unlawful conspiracy of some sort with Minotti, Bucci, and Muolo. The next day, May 20, Jordan attempted to speak with Minotti at his home, but Minotti refused to answer the door. Later, however, at Sergeant Quin's request, Minotti placed a recorded call to Jordan. During the call, Jordan expressed further concern about Muolo, directing Minotti to tell Muolo \"not to give the bid out.\"</p>\n<p>That same day, Agent Tully arrested Jordan. Agent Drouin, supported by several other officers, arrested Bucci outside of his wife's tanning salon in Malden as he attempted to enter his black Mercedes. After being informed of his rights, Bucci smugly taunted the officers, \"You didn't get me on any phones.\" Eventually, Bucci's black Mercedes was seized and its contents were inventoried. Of particular interest, the vehicle contained ninety-one grams of cocaine dispersed in three separate plastic baggies that were contained within one larger bag; two digital scales; $6,653.00 in cash; four mobile phones and six separate SIM cards<sup>[6]</sup>; and a pager. Officer Jamie Cepero, a Massachusetts state trooper assigned to the DEA task force, offered expert testimony regarding the contents of Bucci's black Mercedes. He testified that the above-mentioned items were probative of drug trafficking. Officer Cepero opined that the quantity of drugs found in Bucci's car, ninety-one grams, is inconsistent with mere personal use. Cepero also testified that the contents of Bucci's car lacked indicia of personal use, such as straws, mirrors, and razor blades.</p>\n<p>On April 12, 2006, following a trial, a jury returned a verdict of guilty against both Bucci and Jordan on all counts of the indictment. On November 15, 2006, the district court sentenced Bucci to a term of 252 months' imprisonment and Jordan to a term of 180 months' imprisonment. The defendants filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.

Mala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Nevertheless, in an exceptional case, the record may be adequately developed to permit meaningful review. <i>Id.</i> In this instance, however, we are unable to draw any reasoned conclusions from the cold record.</p>\n<p>Bucci makes several fact-intensive complaints regarding his trial counsel's purportedly deficient performance. First, he asserts that trial counsel, in his opening argument, promised to the jury that he would present an alibi witness, Lisa Murphy, who would testify that Bucci's activities on December 24 were inconsistent with the Government's theory of the case. Second, Bucci complains that trial counsel addressed the prospective testimony of Muolo during his opening statement, despite the fact that the Government did not indicate an intention to call Muolo during its own opening statement. Third, Bucci contends that trial counsel rendered deficient performance by failing to lay the foundation for and offer the testimony of Ross Minnoti, Jon Minotti's brother, who was purportedly willing to testify that Jon Minotti informed him that Bucci was innocent, and that he was only implicating Bucci to save his own skin. These three issues are best left for a collateral proceeding where Bucci will have the opportunity to develop the record to explicate his claim.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we address trial counsel's closing argument. During closing, trial counsel was twice admonished for making improper remarks. First, trial counsel asked rhetorically, \"If Br[y]an Raftery made those calls for Anthony Bucci, why didn't he come in here and tell you about them?\" Following an objection by the Government, the district court gave a forceful limiting instruction, informing the jury that trial counsel's remarks were improper and that \"the government had intended to call Mr. Raftery and he, Mr. Raftery, refused to testify. He is absent in this case because he refuses to be present.\" Later, trial counsel accused the Government of knowingly and deliberately presenting perjured testimony. Again, the district court instructed the jury that trial counsel's actions were improper.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the limiting instructions issued by the district judge in response to trial counsel's remarks did little to advance Bucci's cause before the jury. At the same time, these events do not independently give rise to sufficient prejudice to merit reversal of Bucci's convictions. At worst, they may have cost Bucci some of the good will of the jury. The evidence against Bucci was overwhelming, and trial counsel's comments and the corresponding limiting instructions did nothing to add to the mountain of inculpatory evidence arrayed against him. Federal agents observed Bucci's vehicle at Minotti's house the morning of the rip-off; Bucci was observed by federal agents at the scene of the crime, parked alongside Ruiz; the agents observed Bucci speaking with Jordan outside the Medical Center immediately after the rip-off; and cocaine, two digital scales, $6,653.00 in cash, four mobile phones and six separate SIM cards, and a pager were found in Bucci's vehicle upon <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> his arrest. Finally, of course, Minotti's and, to a lesser extent, Ruiz's testimony directly implicated Bucci in the crime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Matters Related to Severance</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Bucci argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to sever. At issue is Exhibit 24, a recording of a May 19, 2004, conversation between Bucci's codefendant, Jordan, and Minotti, in which Bucci's name is mentioned. The recording was properly introduced against Jordan as an admission. The district court ruled, however, that Jordan's statements were inadmissible hearsay in relation to Bucci. The district court denied Bucci's pretrial motion to sever as well as his trial motion to redact his name from the statements. To protect Bucci from unfair prejudice, the district court, on two separate occasions, instructed the jury that the statements were not admissible against Bucci. Bucci concedes that his Confrontation Clause rights were not violated because Jordan testified in his own defense at trial. <i>California v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108189\"><a href=\"/opinion/108189/california-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108189\"><a href=\"/opinion/108189/california-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, the issue at hand is one of evidence rather than constitutional law.</p>\n<p>We \"review the denial of a motion to sever only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v.

Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792073\"><a href=\"/opinion/792073/united-states-v-angel-casas-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted)). To merit reversal on the basis of a district court's denial of severance, a \"defendant must show `prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.'\" <i>United States v. Turner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202914\"><a href=\"/opinion/202914/united-states-v-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v.

Our jurisprudence favors trying co-conspirators together, despite the reality that evidence admissible against one defendant may be, and often is, inadmissible with regard to others. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> We see no unusual circumstances that should have tilted the balance in favor of severance in this particular case.</p>\n<p>Second, we address Bucci's contention that the district court committed reversible error by issuing a limiting instruction rather than redacting Bucci's name from the recording and the transcript provided to the jury. Even where the Confrontation Clause is implicated, we ordinarily presume that jurors will follow limiting instructions. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Durán,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203028\"><a href=\"/opinion/203028/united-states-v-rodriguez-duran/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir.2007). Occasionally, however, at least in the constitutional context, a limiting instruction will not be sufficient to preserve a co-defendant's rights where the extrajudicial statement is \"powerfully incriminating\" and \"`inculpatory on its face.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201589\"><a href=\"/opinion/201589/united-states-v-vega-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 520 (1st Cir.2005)). \"Statements that are incriminating only when linked to other evidence in the case\" do not merit such scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 520) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The district court determined that Jordan's remarks, while powerfully incriminating as to Jordan, did not directly inculpate Bucci. Significantly, defense counsel candidly and explicitly agreed with this assessment while arguing Bucci's motion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> to sever. To be sure, Jordan's remarks were neither flattering nor helpful to Bucci's defense. The recording contains numerous derisive references to Bucci as well as a discussion concerning whether Bucci had been arrested and whether he was providing information to law enforcement. Thus, the recording surely implies that Bucci participated with Jordan and Minotti in an illicit undertaking of some species. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the district court erred by refusing to redact the recording to exclude Bucci's name. In light of our presumption that jurors follow limiting instructions such as those given here, the absence of constitutional error, and the inferential nature by which Jordan's statements link Bucci to the charged conduct, we find no abuse of discretion. Moreover, any error was clearly harmless given the substantial evidence of guilt as described above.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, Bucci asserts that the prosecutor's closing remarks made it impossible for the jurors to follow the district court's limiting instruction. <i>See </i><i>Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 522 (reversing conviction where prosecutor implored jury to infer defendant's guilt from codefendant's redacted confession). Because he failed to object at trial, we review this aspect of his challenge only for plain error. <i>Rodríguez-Durán,</i> 507 F.3d at 770-71. In large part, references to the May 19 conversation were restricted entirely to the prosecutor's discussion of Jordan. Neither the prosecutor nor the court were required to remind the jurors by rote, in each instance the recording was mentioned, that the recording was not admissible against Bucci. We think that the district court's two separate admonitions that the jurors should not consider the May 19 recording as evidence against Bucci were sufficient to prevent confusion.</p>\n<p>Bucci argues that the prosecutor's final summation, when he called for a guilty verdict against both defendants, was improper. Following a brief discussion of Bucci's culpability, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote>David Jordan, ladies and gentleman, at every step of this case . . . David Jordan chose to stand on the side of the criminal instead of the side of law enforcement. On December 24th at the Malden Medical Center parking lot, on December 26th when he was not protecting Jon Minotti and his family from the men who showed up at his home, in each of the calls with Agent Drouin, and on . . . May 19 as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Ladies and gentleman, the most compelling testimony in this case, the most compelling word in this case didn't come from Jon Minotti. The most persuasive testimony in this case didn't come from Carloz Ruiz. It didn't even come from the agents [who] testified in this case. Ladies and gentlemen, the most persuasive, the most compelling, and the most damning words in this case came from David Jordan's own mouth, both on that tape and when he got up on that witness stand and he lied to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Ladies and gentleman, I ask you to find both of these men guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all the counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p>It is readily apparent, in context, that the discussion of the recording concerned Jordan alone. The prosecutor had already summed up his case regarding Bucci before discussing Jordan for the final time. By contrast, in <i>Vega Molina,</i> a case upon which Bucci relies, the prosecutor explicitly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> requested the jury to convict the defendant based on the co-defendant's out-of-court confession, over the objection of the defendant and without a limiting instruction. 407 F.3d at 522. In <i>Richardson v. Marsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span> (1987), to which Bucci also cites, the prosecutor argued that information gleaned from a codefendant's confession supported an inference of guilt. <i>See id.</i> at 205 &amp; n. 2, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1702</span></a></span>. Here, the facts fall well short of showing such prejudicial conduct.</p>\n<p>Finally, to the extent they did invite confusion, we see very little prejudice in the prosecutor's remarks. As detailed above, the evidence against Bucci was daunting and his theory of innocence scarcely credible. Moreover, the recording was not highly incriminating of Bucci. While it suggested that Jordan did not consider him to be an exemplary citizen, the jury already knew that from the contents of his black Mercedes. Thus, the prosecutor's comments during closing argument do not warrant reversal of Bucci's convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Courtroom Closures</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In a separate <i>pro se</i> brief, Bucci maintains that reversal of his convictions is necessary because the district court committed structural error by closing the courtroom to the public on two occasions. Because Bucci failed to object at trial, we review only for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Thomas,</i> Nos. 98-1051, 98-1052, 98-1116, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">236481</span></span>, at *2, ___ Fed. Appx. ___, ___ (2d Cir. Feb.14, 2000) (unpublished summary disposition) (applying plain error analysis to purported violation of defendant's right to public trial).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to a public trial. <i>Waller v. Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111186\"><a href=\"/opinion/111186/waller-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111186\"><a href=\"/opinion/111186/waller-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Bucci argues that the district court erred by closing the courtroom during jury selection and later during a contempt proceeding against Raftery. We decline to address his challenge to the purported closure during jury selection at this time because it is not yet ripe. Although Bucci has attempted to submit additional evidence to supplement the Spartan record, it remains inadequate to permit meaningful review. Bucci will have an opportunity, if he so chooses, to present this argument in a petition for collateral relief before the district court. At that point, the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing to test the merits of Bucci's claim. <i>See id.</i> at 66.</p>\n<p>Bucci also argues that the district court erred by closing the courtroom during the contempt proceeding against Raftery. During this hearing, the Government called its next prospective witness, Raftery, to the stand. As expected, Raftery refused to testify, despite a grant of immunity. He indicated that he was concerned about potential perjury charges due to conflicts between his anticipated testimony and the statements he made before the grand jury and federal agents. The district court placed Raftery in civil contempt and warned him of the possibility that criminal contempt charges might be filed against him should he not testify. Despite these remonstrations, Raftery persisted in his refusal to testify. At the end of the hearing, the district court ordered that Raftery be taken into immediate custody.</p>\n<p>Bucci's argument is flawed in two ways. First, the Sixth Amendment's requirement that a trial be public does not apply with its usual force to criminal contempt proceedings. <i>See </i><i>Levine v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106057\"><a href=\"/opinion/106057/levine-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span>, 616, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106057\"><a href=\"/opinion/106057/levine-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span> (1960). Here, the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> court specifically indicated that Raftery would be set free if he agreed to testify. Thus, the contempt order was civil, not criminal, in nature. <i>See </i><i>Int'l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117872\"><a href=\"/opinion/117872/mine-workers-v-bagwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 827-28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117872\"><a href=\"/opinion/117872/mine-workers-v-bagwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span> (1994). Civil contempt proceedings are not governed by the Sixth Amendment and require fewer procedural protections. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Consequently, not even Raftery himself, much less Bucci, could have invoked the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial during the civil contempt hearing.</p>\n<p>Second, the contempt proceeding against Raftery was almost entirely collateral to Bucci's own trial and, thus, any closure did not infringe Bucci's Sixth Amendment right. <i>See Petito v. Artuz,</i> 69 Fed.Appx. 26, 28 (2d Cir.2003) (unpublished summary disposition) (rejecting defendant's Fifth Amendment challenge to court's decision to exclude <i>him</i> from contempt proceeding against recalcitrant witness); <i>United States v.

In the end, the temporal proximity and causal relationship between Bucci's criminal trial and the civil contempt hearing against Raftery did not necessarily render the two proceedings one and the same. Although Bucci undoubtedly enjoyed a right to compulsory process under the Sixth Amendment to call Raftery as a witness, he lacked any converse right to prevent him from testifying. Put differently, he had no cognizable constitutional interest under the Sixth Amendment in Raftery's refusal to testify when called by the Government. Thus, although it would have been better practice for the trial judge to have made specific record findings justifying his decision to close the courtroom, <i>see </i><i>Waller,</i> 467 U.S. at 44-47, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111186\"><a href=\"/opinion/111186/waller-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A variance mandates reversal only where it is both material and prejudicial. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In his brief, Bucci conflates his constructive amendment argument with his variance claim. Rather than engage in a futile endeavor to parse the two, we address them simultaneously. His underlying challenge lacks merit under either theory. First, Bucci asserts that while the indictment alleged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, the evidence at trial supported only a conspiracy to commit robbery. Second, Bucci contends that the indictment was faulty because it failed to allege a Hobbs Act conspiracy. Bucci asserts that this failure prejudiced him because some of the jurors may have relied upon the drug rip-off to convict Bucci of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p>Bucci's challenges appear to rest upon two faulty premises. First, while it is possible that the evidence could have supported other charges, a grand jury is under no obligation to indict every conceivable crime potentially implicated by a defendant's conduct. The possible Hobbs Act violation Bucci describes is not mutually exclusive with the charges contained within the indictment. Second, Bucci's argument consists of little more than utter speculation that the jury disregarded its instructions by convicting him of an uncharged offense. Given the substantial evidence indicating that Bucci did, in fact, conspire to possess and distribute cocaine, we cannot infer that any jurors decided that Bucci did not conspire to possess and distribute cocaine, but convicted him of that offense, heedless of the law, on the basis that he conspired to commit robbery. He has utterly failed to demonstrate either a constructive amendment of the indictment or a variance between the indictment and the evidence adduced at trial. He cannot obtain relief on the counterintuitive theory that the jury could have convicted him of other, additional crimes that were neither charged nor detailed in the jury instructions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>The Firearm Count</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Next, in his <i>pro se</i> brief Bucci argues that the Government failed to introduce sufficient evidence for a properly instructed jury to convict him of Count 3 of the indictment, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). We review claims related to the sufficiency of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> the evidence <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203128\"><a href=\"/opinion/203128/united-states-v-de-la-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 141 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>\"The basic elements of a § 924(c)[] violation are `(1) that the defendant committed the predicate drug trafficking crime . . .; (2) that the defendant knowingly carried or used a firearm; and (3) that the defendant did so during and in relation to the specified predicate offense.'\" <i>United States v. Flecha-Maldonado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786699\"><a href=\"/opinion/786699/united-states-v-miguel-a-flecha-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 179 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783504\"><a href=\"/opinion/783504/united-states-v-ramon-figueroa-encarnacion-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2003) (alteration in original)). However, any particular defendant need not have physically carried the gun for liability to attach. <i>See id.</i> Rather, under <i>Pinkerton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1489</span></span> (1946), the Government may show \"that a co-conspirator carried or used a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy and that this was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.\" <i>Flecha-Maldonado,</i> 373 F.3d at 179.</p>\n<p>At trial, the Government relied on the theory that it was reasonably foreseeable to Bucci that Jordan would utilize a firearm during the drug rip-off. Bucci cites to <i>United States v. Medina-Roman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201115\"><a href=\"/opinion/201115/united-states-v-medina-roman/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), for the proposition that the government was required to prove that Bucci knew \"to a practical certainty\" that Jordan would carry or use a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> at 5-6. Such reliance is mistaken. In <i>Medina-Roman,</i> the defendant was not notified of potential <i>Pinkerton</i> liability during her guilty plea and, thus, the Government was held to the higher standard associated with aiding and abetting. <i>Medina-Roman,</i> 376 F.3d at 3 n. 4, 6. Here, the district court properly instructed the jury concerning <i>Pinkerton</i> liability. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 612 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that a \"district court may give a <i>Pinkerton</i> charge even though the indictment does not plead vicarious liability\"). There was ample evidence for the jury to conclude that Jordan's use of the firearm was reasonably foreseeable to Bucci.</p>\n<p>Bucci's ancillary argument, that the Government failed to prove a conspiracy to commit a drug trafficking offense, is equally mistaken. The Government adduced sufficient evidence to convict Bucci of just such a conspiracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. <i>The Jury Instructions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Next, Bucci contends in his <i>pro se</i> brief that the jury instructions were erroneous because they presented the jury with an unfair Hobson's choice. He reasons that the instructions precluded the jury from finding Bucci not guilty of Count 3 because they provided for conviction based on either reasonable foreseeability or actual knowledge. This argument is absurd as a matter of basic logic. The jury could, of course, have found Bucci not guilty of Count 3 if it either (a) rejected the government's evidence of conspiracy or (b) determined that Jordan's use of the firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy was not reasonably foreseeable and that Bucci had no actual knowledge that it would be used. It is permissible for the government to present evidence of guilt tending to demonstrate both actual and constructive knowledge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Griffin,</i> Nos. 07-1475, 07-1477, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203299\"><a href=\"/opinion/203299/united-states-v-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 78, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1759161</span></span>, at *5 (1st Cir.2008) (affirming conviction based on evidence of actual knowledge and willful blindness in tax evasion prosecution).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. <i>Booker Error</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, Bucci argues in his <i>pro se</i> brief that the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). As an initial matter, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> we categorically reject Bucci's argument that the remedial <i>Booker</i> opinion was only a temporary fix subject to an expiration date. While the remedial majority may have invited Congress to take independent action, <i>see id.</i> at 265, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, it contains no indication of eventual constitutional infirmity in the absence of a Congressional mandate. More specifically, we have held that <i>Booker</i> requires reversal only where judicial fact-finding increases the statutory maximum penalty. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2005). The 168 month sentence Bucci received for drug trafficking and the 84 month sentence he received for the weapons charge were both near the low end of the guidelines' ranges, far below the statutory maximums. Thus, Bucci's claim of <i>Booker</i> error is without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Jordan</i><sup>[9]</sup></h2>\n<p>Jordan contends that the district court erred by permitting the Government to redact portions of the recording and transcript of a December 24, 2003, conversation between Ruiz and Minotti. At trial, Jordan requested that the redacted materials be included pursuant to Rule 106 of the Federal Rule of Evidence for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n<p>Jordan concedes that the rule against hearsay would have prevented him from independently offering these statements for substantive purposes. Rule 106, which codifies the common law doctrine of completeness, provides that</p>\n<blockquote>When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.</blockquote>\n<p>Fed.R.Evid. 106. We review a district court's rulings concerning Rule 106 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Millan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770873\"><a href=\"/opinion/770873/united-states-v-hanson-wilson-millan/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 434-35 (1st Cir.2000). A defendant must show prejudice in order to obtain relief. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Awon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751217\"><a href=\"/opinion/751217/united-states-v-fred-awon/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 101-02 (1st Cir.1998), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>United States v. Piper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200046\"><a href=\"/opinion/200046/united-states-v-piper/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 57 n. 5 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Peculiarly, the Government maintains that the purview of Rule 106 is limited to the order of proof. To the contrary, our case law unambiguously establishes that the rule of completeness may be invoked to facilitate the introduction of otherwise inadmissible evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Simonelli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771699\"><a href=\"/opinion/771699/united-states-v-peter-simonelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Awon,</i> 135 F.3d at 101. Other circuits have held differently, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1235464\"><a href=\"/opinion/1235464/united-states-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 965 n. 9 (9th Cir.2007), but we adhere to our own precedent.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to require the Government to present the redacted portions of the December 24 conversation. Jordan contends that fairness required the admission of the redacted portions because they undermined the credibility of Minotti and Ruiz and because the excerpts were unduly fragmented and confusing. Neither of these arguments is well-founded.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> First, we address the issue of credibility. As an initial matter, we note that the district court permitted defense counsel to use the redacted statements in cross-examination, and that defense counsel did so effectively. Although timing may be important in some situations, we see no such prejudice here. Moreover, the record is pellucid that defense counsel had abundant opportunity to impeach both Ruiz and Minotti on numerous different grounds. During the extensive cross-examination, defense counsel was able to reveal the witnesses' myriad (and typically self-serving) inconsistencies and general dishonesty; drug abuse; drug dealing and other lawbreaking; use of foul and offensive language; and the inducement provided by the Government. Frankly, given the record before us, it is hard to imagine that the jury could have found either Ruiz or Minotti to be credible absent the corroboratory evidence supplied by the Government. If the jury credited their testimony at all, it did so with full knowledge that both men were scoundrels motivated by the carrot of reduced sentences (and, in Ruiz's case, revenge). Additional impeachment would have been cumulative. Thus, the district court acted well within its expansive discretion by refusing to require the introduction of the redacted portions of the December 24 conversation pursuant to Rule 106.</p>\n<p>Jordan's second contention fares only slightly better. On appeal, Jordan argues that the excerpts of the December 24 conversation are confusing, but he fails to point to specific portions that might suggest prejudicial ambiguity. Having independently reviewed the evidence, we hold that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that one excerpt might initially have generated some confusion. The redacted transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote>[Ruiz]: Look, first of all look . . . how did . . . the guy know that I was going to go back over there because somebody had to tell him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Minotti]: You're out of your mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Ruiz]: I already told Tommy to get me his . . . address, if you don't give [it] to me[.]</blockquote>\n<p>Exh. 8(c) (second alteration in original). In context, it is clear that Ruiz's first statement refers to his second encounter with Jordan at the Malden Medical Center, when he went back to the scene in search of his cocaine. The second statement by Ruiz, as clarified by the redacted material, refers to Bucci. Without the redacted portions, however, Ruiz's second statement appears to refer to Jordan instead.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the error was harmless. First, it is difficult to see how the mistaken impression possibly caused by the excerpts might have prejudiced Jordan. The evidence clearly established that Ruiz believed Jordan to be either a counterfeit or corrupt policeman. Second, the <i>Government</i> actually clarified on direct examination that Ruiz was referring to \"Gino,\" not Jordan. Finally, as explained above, Jordan was afforded ample opportunity to correct any possible misapprehensions by extensive cross examination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm both Bucci's and Jordan's convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Count 1 charged the defendants with conspiracy to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, over 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. Count 2 charged them with possession with intent to distribute over 500 grams of cocaine pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Count 3 charged them with using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). Count 4 charged Jordan with witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3). Count 5 charged Bucci with another count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Finally, Counts 6 through 8 charged Jordan with making false statements to the DEA, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.</p>\n<p>[2]  Minotti and Bucci also engaged in several unrelated drug transactions. The district court, however, excluded evidence regarding these deals as unduly prejudicial. Thus, we will not consider them in our review.</p>\n<p>[3]  Ruiz pleaded guilty to a separate indictment. He received substantial sentence reductions in exchange for his testimony against Bucci and Jordan. Additionally, he received safety valve treatment for which he almost certainly would not have been eligible had the government disclosed information, adduced in this case, to the sentencing court concerning numerous threats Ruiz made against Minotti. The jury, of course, was entitled to credit Ruiz's testimony, which was mostly corroborated by reliable evidence, despite these inducements.</p>\n<p>[4]  Raftery, despite a grant of immunity, refused to testify at the defendants' trial and was held in civil contempt. He subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal contempt and was sentenced to probation.</p>\n<p>[5]  Later, Muolo informed Minotti that he had, in fact, given the cocaine to Bucci and lied to the others at Bucci's request.</p>\n<p>[6]  A SIM, or \"security identity module,\" card is the device within a phone that contains the unique information identifying a particular subscriber.</p>\n<p>[7]  Bucci has filed four <i>pro se</i> motions that remain pending. We deny Bucci's motion to supplement the record (Docket No. 102) and his motion to correct the trial transcript (Docket No. 152). These matters are better addressed by the district court on a petition for collateral review. We grant Bucci's second motion to supplement the record (Docket No. 128), given that the document in question has already been made a part of the record by the district court. It is not, however, pertinent to any issue pending before us. Finally, we deny Bucci's motion to file a supplemental reply brief (Docket No. 155). We require no further elaboration of his claims of error.</p>\n<p>[8]  Indeed, to the extent that Bucci claims that Jordan's statements were prejudicial because they were derogatory, we note that Bucci's own theory of the case rested on the premise that he was a drug addict rather than a drug dealer.</p>\n<p>[9]  Jordan argues that the district court erred by determining that he was subject to a mandatory minimum on the weapons charge because he brandished the firearm during the drug rip-off. He contends that brandishing a firearm is an element of the offense and, therefore, the government was obligated to prove this fact to a jury in light of <i>Booker.</i> He acknowledges, however, that this challenge is foreclosed by our decision in <i>United States v. Lizardo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202178\"><a href=\"/opinion/202178/united-states-v-lizardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 89-90 (1st Cir.2006), and urges it merely to preserve his rights for further review.</p>\n\n</div>",
