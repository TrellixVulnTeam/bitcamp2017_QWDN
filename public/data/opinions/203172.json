Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     William A. Hahn, by Appointment of the Court, with whom Hahn\n& Matkov was on brief for appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Paul R. Moore,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 7, 2008\n\f          STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.       Defendant-appellant Tony\n\nDiaz was convicted of one count of possession of a firearm and\n\nammunition by an illegal alien.    He was sentenced to 262 months in\n\nprison followed by 60 months of supervised release.      Diaz appeals\n\nthe district court’s denial of his motion to suppress evidence, his\n\nconviction, and the sentencing enhancement imposed pursuant to the\n\nArmed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).         After\n\nconsidering Diaz's various arguments on appeal, we affirm his\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n                           I.   Background\n\n          On July 14, 2004, at approximately 12:30 a.m., shots were\n\nfired at Edison Gonzalez and his brother Henry while they were\n\nsitting in their car in a restaurant parking lot in Lawrence,\n\nMassachusetts.   The Gonzalez brothers immediately called 911 and\n\ninformed the police that they had been shot at by a drunk man\n\ndriving a blue BMW, license plate number 3703ZE. The brothers then\n\ndrove to the Lawrence police station where they met with Detective\n\nBrian Burokas and Sergeant Charles Carroll.          Edison told the\n\ndetectives that he could identify the shooter and that he knew\n\nwhere the shooter lived, though he did not know the shooter’s name.\n\nEdison accompanied the detectives to the apartment that he believed\n\nto be the residence of the shooter, but the shooter was not there.\n\n          After the police received the call from the Gonzalez\n\nbrothers, the BMW's description and license plate number were\n\n                                  -2-\n\fbroadcast over the dispatch, along with a warning that the shooter\n\nmight be drunk. Sometime thereafter, Officer Kevin Nigohisian, who\n\nwas on patrol in a marked police cruiser, spotted a blue BMW with\n\nlicense plate 3703ZE.     Officer Nigohisian followed the BMW in his\n\npatrol   car   and   called   for   back-up.   Once   back-up   arrived,\n\nNigohisian activated his lights and signaled the BMW to pull over.\n\nBy that time, several other police cars had arrived at the scene.\n\nFour of the officers exited their cars with guns drawn and ordered\n\nthe driver out of the vehicle.      Two of the officers patted down the\n\ndriver and placed him in handcuffs.        Shortly afterwards, Officer\n\nThomas Caraballo, who had approached the BMW to ascertain whether\n\nthere were any other occupants, opened the passenger-side door and\n\nleaned into the car.     Caraballo then spotted the handle of a gun\n\nprotruding from beneath the passenger seat and called out to alert\n\nthe other officers.1\n\n\n     1\n      At the suppression hearing, Officer Caraballo testified that\nbefore opening the door, he looked through the car window and\ndiscerned the gun in plain view on the floorboard in front of the\npassenger seat. The district court did not find this testimony\ncredible, noting that Detective Burokas testified that Caraballo\nwas leaning into the car when he announced that he had found a gun\nand that the police report indicated that the gun was found under\nthe passenger seat during a protective sweep of the vehicle.\nOfficer Nigohisian's and Sergeant Carroll's testimony, however,\nbuttressed Caraballo's version of events, and the evidence\nindicates that Detective Burokas arrived at the scene slightly\nlater than the first wave of officers and thus may not have been\npresent when Caraballo initially approached the BMW. We do not\nconsider this to be a particularly important evidentiary point to\nresolve. As discussed below, whether Caraballo espied the gun in\nplain view or discovered it in the course of a protective sweep,\nDiaz's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          Almost contemporaneously, Detective Burokas and Sergeant\n\nCarroll arrived at the scene with Edison Gonzalez still in tow.\n\nFrom the backseat of Carroll’s car, Edison identified the driver of\n\nthe BMW as the alleged shooter.    Responding to Officer Caraballo's\n\ndiscovery of a gun, Detective Burokas approached the BMW, donned\n\nlatex gloves, and removed a .45 caliber handgun from underneath the\n\nfront passenger seat.     He unloaded the weapon and found three\n\nrounds of live ammunition in the clip.         The driver was then\n\narrested and taken into custody by the police.\n\n          At booking, the driver gave the name \"Jose Rivera\" along\n\nwith a date of birth.    He was advised of his Miranda rights in\n\nSpanish, both orally and in written form, and indicated that he\n\nunderstood his rights.      An officer asked \"Rivera\" in Spanish\n\nwhether he had a license to carry the gun, to which he answered\n\nthat he had no permit and that he had purchased the gun on the\n\nstreet for $300.   After the officers fingerprinted him, his Social\n\nSecurity number was run and two names--Jose A. Rivera, Jr., and\n\nTony Diaz--were returned.\n\n          On September 8, 2004, a federal grand jury indicted Diaz\n\non one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count I) and one count of\n\npossession of a firearm and ammunition by an unlawful alien in\n\nviolation of   18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(5)(A) (Count II).   Diaz moved to\n\nsuppress the evidence seized by police during the search of the\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fBMW, arguing that the \"protective sweep\" of the car after he was\n\nhandcuffed was a violation of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures.2                   The district court denied\n\nDiaz’s      motion    to    suppress,    concluding      that    the       sweep    of   the\n\ndefendant’s vehicle did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it\n\nwas not unreasonable for police \"to conduct a protective search\n\nafter putting a suspect in handcuffs during a Terry stop so that\n\nthe suspect may be released from handcuffs as soon as police safety\n\nis assured.\"         United States v. Diaz, No. CRIM.A.04-10274, 2005 WL\n\n1027437, at *3 (D. Mass. Apr. 29, 2005).\n\n              A three-day jury trial began on November 7, 2005.3                         On\n\nthe    second    day       of   the   trial,   Joann    Sassone,       a    Records      and\n\nInformation Services Officer for the Boston District Office of\n\nCitizenship      and       Immigration    Services,      Department         of     Homeland\n\nSecurity (\"DHS\"), testified that the Alien Registration number for\n\nDiaz was A90567004, but that previously he had been associated also\n\nwith       another    Alien      Registration    number,        A29710069.          Sassone\n\n\n\n       2\n      Diaz conceded that there were sufficient grounds for the\npolice to conduct a Terry stop of the vehicle. See United States\nv. Diaz, No. CRIM.A.04-10274, 2005 WL 1027437, at *2 (D. Mass.\nApr. 29, 2005).\n       3\n      At trial, the parties stipulated that (1) a person named Tony\nDiaz, also known as Santo Romero, was convicted of a felony for\nwhich the punishment exceeded one year in Middlesex Superior Court\non April 27, 1998; (2) the person convicted of that felony had a\nbirth date of April 7, 1965; and (3) that the Lawrence police had\nsufficient grounds to conduct a Terry stop of the vehicle driven by\nDiaz on July 14, 2004.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fexplained that the Alien Registration files for the two numbers\n\nwere consolidated under file number A90567004 in March of 1992,\n\nwhen   it   was   determined    that    both   files   documented   the    same\n\nindividual.       Sassone identified a number of immigration records\n\ncontained in the consolidated file that were allowed into evidence,\n\nincluding     fingerprint cards.        The evidence indicated that the\n\nalien documented in the file had been deported from the United\n\nStates to the Dominican Republic in 1992, re-entered in 1993, and\n\nwas    deported    again   in   2001.        Sassone   testified    that    the\n\nconsolidated alien file had been searched and yielded no evidence\n\nof permission to reenter, adjustment of status, or any other\n\nauthorization to be in the United States.          Later that same day, FBI\n\nforensics expert Allison Larson testified that the fingerprints on\n\nthe cards in the alien file discussed by Sassone matched the prints\n\ntaken from Diaz at the Lawrence police station after his arrest on\n\nJuly 14, 2004.\n\n            Defense counsel unsuccessfully objected to the admission\n\nof several of the documents in the alien file.                Specifically,\n\ndefense counsel objected to Exhibit 6, a Warning to Alien Ordered\n\nRemoved or Deported for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo R.\n\nRomero, a/k/a Jose Rivera Morales, a/k/a Jose Antonio Morales,\n\ndated April 10, 1997, on hearsay and relevance grounds.             The trial\n\njudge allowed the document into evidence on the condition that the\n\ngovernment link the names referenced in the document to Diaz.                In\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\faddition, defense counsel objected to Exhibit 10, a Dominican\n\nRepublic passport issued to Santo Rodolfo Romero Villar, date of\n\nbirth       April   7,   1965,   on   hearsay   and   authentication   grounds.\n\nFinding that the passport had not been formally authenticated, the\n\ntrial judge refused to allow the document in as an authentic\n\npassport, but admitted it as a business record of DHS.                 Defense\n\ncounsel also objected to Exhibit 12, a Dominican Republic travel\n\nauthorization granting the United States permission to deport Santo\n\nRomero, date of birth April 7, 1965, to the Dominican Republic, as\n\nunauthenticated and hearsay, but the trial judge allowed the\n\ndocument into evidence as a business record of DHS.4\n\n\n        4\n      The following pieces of evidence are also at issue in this\nappeal: Warrant of Deportation for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar,\na/k/a Santo Romero, dated March 6, 1992 (Exhibit 4); Warrant of\nRemoval/Deportation for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo R.\nRomero, a/k/a Jose Rivera Morales, a/k/a Jose Antonio Morales,\ndated April 7, 1997 (Exhibit 5); Immigration Detainer Notice for\nSanto Romero Villar, dated July 14, 2004 (Exhibit 9); Record of\nDeportable Alien for Santo Rodolfo Romero Villar, dated April 22,\n1991 (Exhibit 11); and Certificate of Nonexistence of Record for\nSanto Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo Romero, a/k/a Santo R.\nRomero, attesting that a search of all computer indices and alien\nfiles in relation to A29710069 showed that there was no record of\nthat person seeking permission to reenter the United States after\ndeportation (Exhibit 19).\n     The government also introduced a Form I-700 Application for\nTemporary Worker Status for Santo R. Romero dated November 7, 1988,\nwhich listed Bani, Dominican Republic, as the applicant's\nbirthplace (Exhibit 20); a fingerprint card under the name Santo\nRomero submitted in support of the Form I-700 application (Exhibit\n21); a Form I-693 Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment\nof Status also submitted in support of the Form I-700 application\nunder the name Santo Romero, with a photo attached and a date of\nbirth of April 7, 1965 (Exhibit 14); and a temporary residency card\nissued to Santo R. Romero, DOB 4/7/65, birthplace listed as\nDominican Republic, with a fingerprint (Exhibit 24).\n\n                                         -7-\n\f               The jury found Diaz not guilty on Count I, possession of\n\na firearm by a convicted felon, but guilty on Count II, possession\n\nof a firearm and ammunition by an unlawful alien.              Based on Diaz's\n\nprior convictions,5 his sentence was enhanced pursuant to ACCA, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1).6       This appeal followed.\n\n                                  II.   Discussion\n\n               On appeal, Diaz challenges the district court’s denial of\n\nhis   motion      to   suppress    evidence    seized   from   the   BMW,   the\n\nsufficiency of evidence to convict him of being an unlawful alien\n\nin possession of a firearm and ammunition, and the enhancement\n\napplied to his sentence as a result of previous convictions.\n\nA.    Motion to Suppress\n\n               Our review of the district court’s denial of a motion to\n\nsuppress is plenary.       United States v. Golab, 325 F.3d 63, 66 (1st\n\n\n     All of the above documents were introduced during Sassone's\ntestimony and were contained in alien file A90567004.\n       5\n      The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") lists at least six separate,\ndrug-related convictions for a Tony Diaz or other known aliases,\nincluding Santo Romero. At the sentencing hearing, the government\npresented evidence, including photographs and fingerprints, linking\nthe convictions to the Tony Diaz on trial. Diaz objected that the\nevidence was insufficient to prove that each of the convictions was\nattributable to him.\n       6\n           Section 924(e)(1) states, in relevant part:\n\n      In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of\n      this title and has three previous convictions by any\n      court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for\n      a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both. . .\n      such person shall be fined under this title and\n      imprisoned not less than fifteen years . . . .\n\n                                         -8-\n\fCir. 2003). The district court’s conclusions of law are subject to\n\nde novo review and we examine its factual findings for clear error.\n\nUnited States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          \"[I]t is well-settled that, based merely on reasonable\n\nand articulable suspicion, a police officer may make a brief stop\n\nor 'seizure' of an individual to investigate suspected past or\n\npresent criminal activity.\"       United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d\n\n522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996); accord Terry v. United States, 392 U.S.\n\n1, 21 (1968).      In Terry, the Supreme Court also held that an\n\nofficer may pat-down a suspect for weapons when conducting a brief\n\ninvestigatory stop if \"he has reason to believe that he is dealing\n\nwith an armed and dangerous individual . . . .\"             392 U.S. at 27;\n\naccord United States v. Aitoro, 446 F.3d 246, 252 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          To determine whether an investigatory stop complies with\n\nTerry, we conduct a two-part inquiry.          United States v. Ivery, 427\n\nF.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2005).      We first determine whether there was\n\nobjectively    reasonable    suspicion    to   justify   the   stop   at   its\n\ninception.    Id.; see also Golab, 325 F.3d at 66.         Here, the stop is\n\nnot at issue; the parties stipulated that the police had sufficient\n\nreason to initiate the Terry stop of the vehicle Diaz was driving\n\non the night in question.\n\n          Under the second part of the test, \"we ask whether the\n\nensuing   search    was     'reasonably    related    in    scope     to   the\n\ncircumstances which justified the officers' initial interference.'\"\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fIvery, 427 F.3d at 72 (quoting United States v. Nee, 261 F.3d 79,\n\n83 (1st Cir. 2001)).       Traditionally, \"frisking\" an individual who\n\npolice have reason to believe is in possession of a weapon is\n\nconsidered \"reasonably related in scope\" to stopping an individual\n\nwho is suspected of being involved in past or present criminal\n\nactivity.     See id.      However, in recognition of the significant\n\nhazards associated with roadside encounters, the Supreme Court has\n\nheld that police may also \"frisk\" the passenger compartment of a\n\nvehicle for weapons during a roadside Terry stop, if \"the police\n\nofficer possesses a reasonable belief based on 'specific and\n\narticulable      facts    which,   taken     together    with   the   rational\n\ninferences from those facts, reasonably warrant' the officers in\n\nbelieving that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain\n\nimmediate control of weapons.\"            Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032,\n\n1049 (1983)(quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 21).                The second prong\n\n\"imposes a dual requirement for a permissible warrantless search\n\nfor   weapons:    (1)    the   officers   must   have   actually   harbored   a\n\nsuspicion that the suspect was armed; and (2) that suspicion must\n\nhave been reasonable under the circumstances.\"            Ivery, 427 F.3d at\n\n72 (discussing United States v. Lott, 870 F.2d 778, 783-784 (1st\n\nCir. 1989)).\n\n            There was ample evidence in this case that the officers\n\nactually suspected that Diaz was armed and dangerous and that such\n\nsuspicion was reasonable in light of the circumstances.                   Even\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fassuming arguendo that the district court was correct not to credit\n\nOfficer Caraballo's testimony that he saw a gun in plain view\n\nthrough the car window before entering the car, the government\n\npresented credible evidence indicating that the blue BMW that Diaz\n\nwas driving matched the description of the vehicle, in make and\n\nlicense plate number, driven by the shooter who fired at the\n\nGonzalez   brothers   earlier   that    night.   These   'specific   and\n\narticulable' facts created a reasonable suspicion under Terry and\n\nLong that Diaz had access to a weapon and posed an actual danger to\n\nthe officers.    Conducting a protective sweep of the passenger\n\ncompartment for the weapon was therefore permissible, even though\n\nDiaz was outside the vehicle and under police control.       See Long,\n\n463 U.S. at 1051-52 (reasoning that a suspect may \"break away\" from\n\nthe police or be permitted to reenter the vehicle and then would\n\nhave access to any weapons inside); see also Flowers v. Fiore, 359\n\nF.3d 24, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2004)(finding no constitutional violation\n\nwhere police handcuffed driver and then performed protective sweep\n\nof his car during Terry stop, because officers had reasonable\n\nsuspicion that driver was armed and dangerous); United States v.\n\nTaylor, 162 F.3d 12, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1998)(\"[T]he officers were\n\npermitted to conduct a search of the passenger compartment of the\n\nautomobile for any weapons that might have been accessible to the\n\noccupants.   This limited search of the vehicle for weapons was\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fpermitted even though the occupants had been secured and taken to\n\nthe rear of [the car].\").\n\n            Though Diaz concedes that Long authorizes police officers\n\nto conduct a protective sweep of the passenger compartment of a\n\nvehicle during a roadside Terry stop, he attempts to distinguish\n\nhis situation from Long.     Diaz argues that he was handcuffed and\n\nthus no longer a danger to police when his car was searched.      He\n\ndiscusses Thornton v. United States, 541 U.S. 615 (2004), in which\n\nthe Supreme Court found that a search of a suspect's vehicle after\n\nthe suspect was arrested, handcuffed, and placed in the back of a\n\npatrol car was a permissible search incident to arrest.       Id. at\n\n622-23.    Because Diaz was not formally arrested at the time police\n\nsearched his vehicle, he contends that Thornton does not apply and\n\nthat the search was therefore impermissible.\n\n            We refuse to pursue the red herring of Thornton dangled\n\nby Diaz.    The Supreme Court's opinion in Thornton, regarding the\n\nlawfulness of vehicular searches incident to arrest, does nothing\n\nto abrogate the limited vehicular \"frisk\" permitted during a Terry\n\nstop by Long and its progeny.7   Indeed, the majority's reasoning in\n\n\n     7\n      Furthermore, the Supreme Court's opinion in Thornton was\ncarefully limited to the question whether police may search a\nsuspect's vehicle incident to arrest when an officer's first\ncontact with the suspect occurs after the suspect has exited the\nvehicle.   541 U.S. at 617.   The Supreme Court recently granted\ncertiorari in a case where petitioners seek an answer to the\nquestion more pertinent to the argument Diaz is attempting to make\nhere--that is, whether a warrantless search incident to arrest is\npermissible when there is no demonstrable threat to officer safety\n\n                                 -12-\n\fThornton only strengthens the rationale for the type of search\n\nconducted in this case.    If officer safety concerns justify the\n\nsearch of a vehicle's passenger compartment where the vehicle's\n\noccupant had exited the vehicle before being confronted by police\n\nand was arrested, handcuffed, and secured in the backseat of a\n\npolice car, surely safety concerns justify the same search where\n\nthe vehicle's occupant was only temporarily detained under Terry\n\nand may imminently regain control of the vehicle and its contents.\n\nThus, the district court properly denied Diaz's motion to suppress\n\nthe firearm and ammunition found in the vehicle.\n\nB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Diaz argues on appeal that the government failed to prove\n\nthat he was (1) an alien (2) unlawfully present in the United\n\nStates and (3) in possession of a firearm.     Ordinarily, we would\n\n\n\nor need to preserve evidence. Arizona v. Gant, ___ S. Ct. ___,\n2008 WL 482034 (Feb. 25, 2008). Neither Thornton nor the Court's\nforthcoming opinion in Gant can control in this instance, however,\nwhere the disputed search was conducted incident to a Terry stop by\nofficers who had reason to believe Diaz was armed and dangerous.\nDiaz suggests that the concurring and dissenting opinions in\nThornton call into question the officer safety rationale for\npermitting a search of a passenger compartment when police have\nsecured the occupant in handcuffs outside the vehicle. Even if\nthis were correct (and we take no position on that point), we\nreiterate that Thornton does not control here; Long does. We are\nmindful of the Supreme Court's admonition that, \"if a precedent of\nthis Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on\nreasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of\nAppeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to\nthis Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\"\nAgostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997)(internal quotations\nomitted).\n\n                                -13-\n\freview this sufficiency of the evidence claim by determining\n\nwhether a rational factfinder could have found each of those\n\nelements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.         United\n\nStates v. Garcia, 452 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 2006).         But because\n\nDiaz did not ask the district court for a judgment of acquittal on\n\nthe count for which he was eventually convicted, we review only for\n\nplain error and \"reverse only if the conviction would result in a\n\n'clear and gross injustice.'\"      United States v. Pratt, 496 F.3d\n\n124, 127 (1st Cir. 2007)(quoting United States v. Bello-Perez, 977\n\nF.2d 664, 668 (1st Cir. 1992)).8\n\n           As a preliminary matter, Diaz argues that two documents\n\noffered by the government to prove alienage--the Dominican Republic\n\npassport   and   travel   document--were   erroneously   admitted   into\n\nevidence; he contends that neither was properly authenticated or\n\n\n     8\n      At the conclusion of the government's case-in-chief, Diaz\nmoved for judgment of acquittal on Count I of the indictment only.\nIn fact, as to the first two elements of Count II, the count for\nwhich he was convicted and which he now seeks to overturn on\nappeal, Diaz may well have not only failed to preserve a challenge\nto the sufficiency of the evidence, but waived it entirely. During\nhis closing argument, defense counsel proclaimed to the jury, \"[i]s\nthere any question in your mind. . . that this man right here is an\nillegal alien? They've proven that beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and\nlater reiterated, \"[t]hey've proven beyond a reasonable doubt that\n[Diaz is] an illegal alien.\" See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S.\n725,   733   (1993)  (describing    waiver  as   the   \"intentional\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right\" (internal\nquotations omitted)); United States v. Jimenez, 512 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\nCir. 2007)(\"A waiver is unlike a forfeiture, for the consequence of\na waiver is that the objection in question is unreviewable.\").\nNonetheless, we will assume for the sake of argument that all of\nDiaz's sufficiency of the evidence claims merit a plain error\nreview.\n\n                                  -14-\n\ffully translated from Spanish into English.9             Because we believe\n\nthat a determination that Diaz is an alien would not be plainly\n\nerroneous     even   if   those   two   documents    were     excluded    from\n\nconsideration, resolving Diaz's objections as to the admissibility\n\nof those documents is not critical to our discussion of Diaz's\n\nsufficiency claims.       Nevertheless, we will review the district\n\ncourt's decision to admit the documents for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Holmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 167 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n             The Federal Rules of Evidence require, \"as a condition\n\nprecedent to admissibility[,]. . . evidence sufficient to support\n\na finding that the matter in question is what its proponent\n\nclaims.\"     Fed. R. Evid. 901(a).      The district court admitted the\n\ndocuments as business records of DHS, for the very limited purpose\n\nof showing \"that [DHS] deported a man to the Dominican Republic\n\nwhose name was Santo Romero and had that picture,\" i.e., to connect\n\nDiaz to his alias and prior removal from the country.               See United\n\nStates v. Pluta, 176 F.3d 43, 50 (2d Cir. 1999).              We see no abuse\n\nof discretion on the part of the court in admitting the documents\n\nfor   that   limited   purpose,   given    that   both   of   the   challenged\n\ndocuments included Diaz's photo, the passport also included his\n\n\n\n      9\n      At trial, Diaz also appeared to put forward a hearsay\nobjection, which is mentioned in his brief on appeal but not\nargued. Accordingly, we consider it waived and do not address it.\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\nsome effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n                                    -15-\n\fdate of birth, and both were produced by DHS officials and came\n\nfrom the Alien Registration file associated with Diaz's known\n\naliases.   Under those circumstances, the trial court permissibly\n\nfound that there was \"sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable\n\nperson to believe the evidence is what it purports to be.\"           Garcia,\n\n452 F.3d at 40.\n\n           While   Diaz   objected    to   the   documents   at    trial   on\n\nauthenticity grounds, he did not specifically raise an objection to\n\nthe lack of an English translation.10            We therefore review the\n\ndistrict   court's   decision    to    admit     the   documents     without\n\ntranslation for plain error only. United States v. Morales-Madera,\n\n352 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2003).       As we have said before, \"[i]t is\n\nclear, to the point of perfect transparency, that federal court\n\nproceedings must be conducted in English . . . .             [P]arties are\n\nrequired to translate all foreign documents into English.\"            United\n\nStates v. Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d 1, 5, 7 n.4 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThe submission of foreign language documents unaccompanied by\n\nEnglish translations is error and in ordinary circumstances would\n\nbar those documents from consideration by the court.              See United\n\nStates v. Contreras Palacios, 492 F.3d 39, 43 n.7 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nHere, however, the documents were admitted for a limited purpose,\n\n\n\n     10\n      Diaz did not request translations of the passport or travel\ndocument at trial, but the district judge noted with concern that\nthe documents were untranslated, and the government correctly\nconcedes that it was \"remiss\" in not providing translations.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fand their evidentiary significance was facially apparent in that it\n\ncomprised Diaz's photo (on both documents), the use of his alias\n\n(on both documents) and his signature and birth date (on the\n\npassport).    Cf. id.       Thus it cannot be said that a \"miscarriage of\n\njustice\" resulted from the district court's decision to admit the\n\ndocuments without translation.               Morales-Madera, 352 F.3d at 10.\n\n           1.      Alien\n\n           In addition to the admissibility issues discussed above,\n\nDiaz advances several objections to the evidence submitted by the\n\ngovernment    to    prove     his     alienage.          He    takes    issue   with   the\n\ngovernment's       reliance      on   warrants      and       orders    of   removal   and\n\ndeportation,     which      he   argues      do    not   prove     alienage     beyond   a\n\nreasonable      doubt      because     of    the    different          burden   of   proof\n\napplicable to civil deportation proceedings. Diaz also claims that\n\nthe entry into evidence of the purportedly unauthenticated and\n\nuntranslated Dominican Republic passport and travel document, and\n\nof   the     deportation/removal             orders           without     any    limiting\n\ninstructions, in tandem with the government's heavy emphasis on\n\nthose documents in its opening and closing statements, denied him\n\na fair trial and due process of law in violation of the Fifth and\n\nSixth Amendments.\n\n           We find the totality of the evidence sufficient to permit\n\na rational jury to find Diaz to be an alien beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, let alone meet the lower bar posed by plain error review.\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\fSee   United   States   v.   Martin,     228   F.3d   1,   10   (1st   Cir.\n\n2000)(\"[J]uries need not evaluate pieces of evidence in isolation,\n\nbut   may   draw   conclusions   from    the   sum    of   an   evidentiary\n\npresentation.\"). The government presented, inter alia, fingerprint\n\nand photographic evidence linking Diaz to his various aliases and\n\nto a DHS Alien Registration file showing that he had been ordered\n\nremoved from the country twice before.           That the warrants and\n\norders of deportation/removal stem from civil rather than criminal\n\nproceedings is not fatal to their inclusion into the total calculus\n\nof evidence here, where other evidence strongly supports the\n\ninference of alienage.    See, e.g., Contreras Palacios, 492 F.3d at\n\n43-44 (evidence, which included warrant of deportation, sufficient\n\nto prove defendant was an alien).\n\n            Because Diaz failed to raise his constitutional arguments\n\nat trial, we review his Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims for plain\n\nerror only.    United States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   As noted above, the Dominican Republic passport and travel\n\ndocument were admissible for the limited purpose delineated by the\n\ndistrict court.     If the government unreasonably harped on these\n\ndocuments in its opening and closing statements--an objection which\n\nagain, Diaz did not raise at trial--doing so nevertheless did not\n\nresult in a \"clear and gross injustice.\"        See id. at 105 (\"Where,\n\nas here, the defendant made no objection to the government's\n\nclosing argument at trial, the standard of review is plain error .\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f. . . [Defendant] faces a high hurdle because it is established\n\nthat plain error review is ordinarily limited to blockbusters . .\n\n. .\" (internal quotations omitted)).              Diaz cannot clear this\n\nhurdle,   especially    considering         defense   counsel's    repeated\n\nassertions during his own closing argument that the government had\n\nadduced sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nDiaz was an illegal alien.     Finally, at trial Diaz never requested\n\na limiting instruction with regard to the warrants and orders of\n\ndeportation/removal, and thus \"he is not entitled to argue here\n\nthat the district court's failure to provide a limiting instruction\n\nconstitutes reversible error.\"        United States v. Walter, 434 F.3d\n\n30, 35 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          2.   Unlawfully present\n\n          Diaz asserts that the government did not sufficiently\n\nprove he was unlawfully present in the United States because it did\n\nnot check both of the Alien Registration numbers associated with\n\nhis aliases and did not produce a Certificate of Nonexistence of\n\nRecord for the name \"Tony Diaz.\"       However, as discussed above, the\n\ngovernment   provided   the   jury    with    a   veritable   cornucopia   of\n\nevidence from DHS, on the basis of which it was clearly not plain\n\nerror for the jury to conclude that the Tony Diaz on trial and the\n\nSanto Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo Romero, a/k/a Santo R.\n\nRomero, named on the Certificate of Nonexistence of Record entered\n\ninto evidence were the same person.          This court has held that such\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fa certificate can be used to establish unlawful presence in the\n\nUnited States.      See Scantleberry-Frank, 158 F.3d at 616 n.1.\n\nFurthermore,   Sassone   adequately   explained   why   only   one   Alien\n\nRegistration number was checked, when she testified that the\n\ngovernment ran one number because as of 1992 the two numbers had\n\nbeen consolidated into one file.\n\n          3.   Possession of the firearm and ammunition\n\n          To sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(5)(A),\n\nthe government must present at trial sufficient evidence to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed a\n\nfirearm and ammunition in or affecting interstate commerce.          Diaz\n\ndoes not quibble with the interstate commerce portion of the\n\ncharge, but does contend that the government did not sufficiently\n\nprove possession.    Knowing possession of a firearm may be \"either\n\nactual or constructive.\"    United States v. Wight, 968 F.2d 1393,\n\n1397 (1st Cir. 1992).    \"In order to show constructive possession,\n\nthe government must prove that the defendant 'had dominion and\n\ncontrol over the area where the contraband was found.'\"               Id.\n\n(quoting United States v. Barnes, 890 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)).\n\n          We find that the government proffered sufficient evidence\n\nto meet its burden.      The jury heard evidence that the loaded\n\nfirearm was discovered under the passenger seat, within the lunge\n\narea of the driver's seat, in the car Diaz was driving moments\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fafter police ordered Diaz to exit the vehicle, and that Diaz was\n\nthe only occupant of the vehicle.            The jury also heard Detective\n\nBurokas and Officer Ayala, the Spanish-speaking police officer who\n\nMirandized Diaz, testify that during booking Diaz stated he had\n\nbought the gun on the street for $300.\n\n           Diaz,   on   the   other    hand,    argues   that   there   was    no\n\nevidence that he owned the car in which the gun was found and that\n\nhis fingerprints were not on the gun, ammunition, or clip.                     In\n\naddition, he attempts to cast aspersions on the testimony of\n\nDetective Burokas and Officer Ayala, merely because they did not\n\nvideo or audio-tape Diaz's statement regarding his purchase of the\n\ngun.   We are mindful, however, that as the reviewing court \"we may\n\nneither evaluate the credibility of the witnesses nor weigh the\n\nrelative   merit   of   theories      of     innocence   postulated     by    the\n\ndefendant.\"   United States v. Maldonado-Garcia, 446 F.3d 227, 231\n\n(1st Cir. 2006)(citing United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 56\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)).       Rather, we are tasked with upholding \"any\n\nverdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of the record.\"\n\nUnited States v. Liranzo, 385 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 2004)(internal\n\nquotations omitted).     Even under the more permissive standard for\n\na preserved sufficiency challenge, to say nothing of the plain\n\nerror standard that applies in this case, there was sufficient\n\nevidence for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Diaz\n\npossessed the firearm and ammunition.\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fC.   Sentencing Enhancement\n\n            Diaz   also   protests   the    ACCA   sentencing      enhancement\n\napplied by the district court, arguing that his Sixth Amendment\n\nrights were violated because the enhancement was based on prior\n\nconvictions that were never presented to the jury and proved beyond\n\na reasonable doubt. Constitutional challenges to ACCA enhancements\n\nare subject to de novo review.         See United States v. Duval, 496\n\nF.3d 64, 80 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            We hold, as we have held before, that this argument is\n\nforeclosed by Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224,\n\n226-27 (1998)(holding that fact of prior conviction for sentencing\n\npurposes need not be proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt).               See\n\nUnited States v. Earle       488 F.3d 537, 549 (1st Cir. 2007); Ivery,\n\n427 F.3d at 74-75.        Diaz notes that Justice Thomas, in a recent\n\nconcurrence, cast doubts on the continuing viability of Almendarez-\n\nTorres.     See    Shepard   v.   United    States,   544   U.S.    13,   27-28\n\n(2005)(Thomas, J., concurring).        Diaz relies on a line of Supreme\n\nCourt cases from Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), to\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), through Shepard and\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), to buttress his\n\nargument.    This court has rejected nearly identical arguments in\n\nthe past, however, observing that \"[t]he Shepard majority noted the\n\npossibility that Apprendi may eventually be extended to require\n\nproof of prior convictions to a jury, but cautioned that this 'is\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fup   to    the    future   to   show.'   .   .   .[B]oth   Blakely   and   Booker\n\nrecognized        the   continued    viability     of   the   Almendarez-Torres\n\nexception.\"        Ivery, 427 F.3d at 75 (quoting Shepard, 544 U.S. at 26\n\nn. 5).     Unless and until a majority of the Supreme Court decides\n\notherwise, Almendarez-Torres continues to be binding precedent upon\n\nthis court.        See Earle, 488 F.3d at 549 (affirming that we remain\n\nbound by Almendarez-Torres).\n\n             Diaz lobs one final argument into the mix, contending\n\nthat because he was acquitted of the felon-in-possession charge,\n\nthat prior felony conviction cannot be used as the basis for an\n\nupward adjustment of his base offense level, nor for the ACCA\n\nsentencing enhancement.11           We give \"due deference\" to a district\n\ncourt's findings of fact at sentencing, and will reverse only for\n\nclear error.        United States v. Woodward, 277 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n             Here, Diaz does what he earlier accused the prosecution\n\nof doing, and confounds different findings arrived at during\n\ndifferent proceedings with different burdens of proof. Diaz argues\n\nthat the jury \"necessarily found by its verdict that [he] was not\n\na felon under the conviction presented to them.\"                     That is not\n\ncorrect.         The acquittal on the felon-in-possession charge means\n\n\n\n      11\n      Diaz describes the conviction in question as \"the case listed\non page 9 of the [PSR].\"      That case is the April 27, 1998,\nconviction of one Tony Diaz, also known as Santo Romero, on drug\nfelony charges in Middlesex Superior Court.\n\n                                         -23-\n\fmerely that the jury could not agree that the government had proved\n\nthat     charge    beyond   a   reasonable     doubt.        A    sentencing   judge,\n\nhowever, need only find prior convictions by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.       See id. (\"The government has the burden of proving the\n\nfacts        central   to   upward     adjustments      in       offense   levels   by\n\npreponderance of the evidence, not by proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\")(citing United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 67 (1st Cir.\n\n1991)).       On that basis, we see no clear error here: as the judge\n\nbelow ruled, a preponderance of the evidence adduced at sentencing\n\nsupports the conclusion that Diaz and the Tony Diaz/Santo Romero\n\nconvicted in April 1998 on drug trafficking charges are the same\n\nperson.        The conviction thus serves as a proper basis for the\n\nsentencing enhancements, regardless of the jury verdict.12\n\n                                III.    Conclusion\n\n               For the reasons stated above, the defendant's conviction\n\nand sentence are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n        12\n      It should be noted that Diaz would likely qualify for the\nACCA enhancement even if the disputed April 1998 conviction were\nnot considered. ACCA requires only \"three previous convictions\n. . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both,\ncommitted on occasions different from one another.\" 18 U.S.C. §\n924(e)(1). At the sentencing hearing, the judge made a finding\nattributing only three of the six separate convictions listed in\nthe PSR to Diaz, saying, \"I'm not even making an effort to go\nthrough the other [convictions].\" A preponderance of the evidence\nin the record as we read it, however, suggests that at least one,\nif not all, of the other three convictions, each of which qualifies\nas a separate ACCA predicate offense, could also be attributed to\nDiaz.\n\n                                        -24-\n\f",

After considering Diaz's various arguments on appeal, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>On July 14, 2004, at approximately 12:30 a.m., shots were fired at Edison Gonzalez and his brother Henry while they were sitting in their car in a restaurant parking lot in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The Gonzalez brothers immediately called 911 and informed the police that they had been shot at by a drunk man driving a blue BMW, license plate number 3703ZE. The brothers then drove to the Lawrence police station where they met with Detective Brian Burokas and Sergeant Charles Carroll. Edison told the detectives that he could identify the shooter and that he knew where the shooter lived, though he did not know the shooter's name. Edison accompanied the detectives to the apartment that he believed to be the residence of the shooter, but the shooter was not there.</p>\n<p>After the police received the call from the Gonzalez brothers, the BMW's description and license plate number were broadcast over the dispatch, along with a warning that the shooter might be drunk. Sometime thereafter, Officer Kevin Nigohisian, who was on patrol in a marked police cruiser, spotted a blue BMW with license plate 3703ZE. Officer Nigohisian followed the BMW in his patrol car and called for back-up. Once back-up arrived, Nigohisian activated his lights and signaled the BMW to pull over. By that time, several other police cars had arrived at the scene. Four of the officers exited their cars with guns drawn and ordered the driver out of the vehicle. Two of the officers patted down the driver and placed him in handcuffs. Shortly afterwards, Officer Thomas Caraballo, who had approached the BMW to ascertain whether there were any other occupants, opened the passenger-side door and leaned into the car. Caraballo then spotted the handle of a gun protruding from beneath the passenger seat and called out to alert the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> other officers.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Almost contemporaneously, Detective Burokas and Sergeant Carroll arrived at the scene with Edison Gonzalez still in tow. From the backseat of Carroll's car, Edison identified the driver of the BMW as the alleged shooter. Responding to Officer Caraballo's discovery of a gun, Detective Burokas approached the BMW, donned latex gloves, and removed a .45 caliber handgun from underneath the front passenger seat. He unloaded the weapon and found three rounds of live ammunition in the clip. The driver was then arrested and taken into custody by the police.</p>\n<p>At booking, the driver gave the name \"Jose Rivera\" along with a date of birth. He was advised of his Miranda rights in Spanish, both orally and in written form, and indicated that he understood his rights. An officer asked \"Rivera\" in Spanish whether he had a license to carry the gun, to which he answered that he had no permit and that he had purchased the gun on the street for $300. After the officers fingerprinted him, his Social Security number was run and two names  Jose A. Rivera, Jr., and Tony Diaz  were returned.</p>\n<p>On September 8, 2004, a federal grand jury indicted Diaz on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count I) and one count of possession of a firearm and ammunition by an unlawful alien in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(5)(A) (Count II). Diaz moved to suppress the evidence seized by police during the search of the BMW, arguing that the \"protective sweep\" of the car after he was handcuffed was a violation of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.<sup>[2]</sup> The district court denied Diaz's motion to suppress, concluding that the sweep of the defendant's vehicle did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it was not unreasonable for police \"to conduct a protective search after putting a suspect in handcuffs during a <i>Terry</i> stop so that the suspect may be released from handcuffs as soon as police safety is assured.\" <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> No. CRIM.A. 04-10274, 2005 WL 1027437, at *3 (D.Mass. Apr. 29, 2005).</p>\n<p>A three-day jury trial began on November 7, 2005.<sup>[3]</sup> On the second day of the trial, Joann Sassone, a Records and Information Services Officer for the Boston District <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), testified that the Alien Registration number for Diaz was A90567004, but that previously he had been associated also with another Alien Registration number, A29710069. Sassone explained that the Alien Registration files for the two numbers were consolidated under file number A90567004 in March of 1992, when it was determined that both files documented the same individual. Sassone identified a number of immigration records contained in the consolidated file that were allowed into evidence, including fingerprint cards. The evidence indicated that the alien documented in the file had been deported from the United States to the Dominican Republic in 1992, re-entered in 1993, and was deported again in 2001. Sassone testified that the consolidated alien file had been searched and yielded no evidence of permission to reenter, adjustment of status, or any other authorization to be in the United States. Later that same day, FBI forensics expert Allison Larson testified that the fingerprints on the cards in the alien file discussed by Sassone matched the prints taken from Diaz at the Lawrence police station after his arrest on July 14, 2004.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel unsuccessfully objected to the admission of several of the documents in the alien file. Specifically, defense counsel objected to Exhibit 6, a Warning to Alien Ordered Removed or Deported for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo R. Romero, a/k/a Jose Rivera Morales, a/k/a Jose Antonio Morales, dated April 10, 1997, on hearsay and relevance grounds. The trial judge allowed the document into evidence on the condition that the government link the names referenced in the document to Diaz. In addition, defense counsel objected to Exhibit 10, a Dominican Republic passport issued to Santo Rodolfo Romero Villar, date of birth April 7, 1965, on hearsay and authentication grounds. Finding that the passport had not been formally authenticated, the trial judge refused to allow the document in as an authentic passport, but admitted it as a business record of DHS. Defense counsel also objected to Exhibit 12, a Dominican Republic travel authorization granting the United States permission to deport Santo Romero, date of birth April 7, 1965, to the Dominican Republic, as unauthenticated and hearsay, but the trial judge allowed the document into evidence as a business record of DHS.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> The jury found Diaz not guilty on Count I, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, but guilty on Count II, possession of a firearm and ammunition by an unlawful alien. Based on Diaz's prior convictions,<sup>[5]</sup> his sentence was enhanced pursuant to ACCA, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).<sup>[6]</sup> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Diaz challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from the BMW, the sufficiency of evidence to convict him of being an unlawful alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and the enhancement applied to his sentence as a result of previous convictions.</p>\n<p><i>A. Motion to Suppress</i></p>\n<p>Our review of the district court's denial of a motion to suppress is plenary. <i>United States v. Golab,</i> 325 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir.2003). The district court's conclusions of law are subject to de novo review and we examine its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>\"[I]t is well-settled that, based merely on reasonable and articulable suspicion, a police officer may make a brief stop or 'seizure' of an individual to investigate suspected past or present criminal activity.\" <i>United States v. McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir.1996); <i>accord </i><i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). In <i>Terry,</i> the Supreme Court also held that an officer may pat-down a suspect for weapons when conducting a brief investigatory stop if \"he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual. . . .\" 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868; <i>accord </i><i>United States v. Aitoro,</i> 446 F.3d 246, 252 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>To determine whether an investigatory stop complies with <i>Terry,</i> we conduct a two-part inquiry. <i>United States v. Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir.2005). We first determine whether there was objectively reasonable suspicion to justify the stop at its inception. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Golab,</i> 325 F.3d at 66. Here, the stop is not at issue; the parties stipulated that the police had sufficient reason to initiate the <i>Terry</i> stop of the vehicle Diaz was driving on the night in question.</p>\n<p>Under the second part of the test, \"we ask whether the ensuing search was 'reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the officers' initial interference.'\" <i>Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d at 72 (quoting <i>United States v. Nee,</i> 261 F.3d 79, 83 (1st Cir.2001)). Traditionally, \"frisking\" an individual who police have reason to believe is in possession of a weapon is considered \"reasonably related in scope\" to stopping an individual who is suspected of being involved in past or present criminal activity. <i>See id.</i> However, in recognition of the significant hazards associated with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> roadside encounters, the Supreme Court has held that police may also \"frisk\" the passenger compartment of a vehicle for weapons during a roadside <i>Terry</i> stop, if \"the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on `specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant' the officers in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.\" <i>Michigan v. Long,</i> 463 U.S. 1032, 1049, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983)(quoting <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868). The second prong \"imposes a dual requirement for a permissible warrantless search for weapons: (1) the officers must have actually harbored a suspicion that the suspect was armed; and (2) that suspicion must have been reasonable under the circumstances.\" <i>Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d at 72 (discussing <i>United States v. Lott,</i> 870 F.2d 778, 783-784 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p>There was ample evidence in this case that the officers actually suspected that Diaz was armed and dangerous and that such suspicion was reasonable in light of the circumstances. Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the district court was correct not to credit Officer Caraballo's testimony that he saw a gun in plain view through the car window before entering the car, the government presented credible evidence indicating that the blue BMW that Diaz was driving matched the description of the vehicle, in make and license plate number, driven by the shooter who fired at the Gonzalez brothers earlier that night. These \"specific and articulable\" facts created a reasonable suspicion under <i>Terry</i> and <i>Long</i> that Diaz had access to a weapon and posed an actual danger to the officers. Conducting a protective sweep of the passenger compartment for the weapon was therefore permissible, even though Diaz was outside the vehicle and under police control. <i>See </i><i>Long,</i> 463 U.S. at 1051-52, 103 S.Ct. 3469 (reasoning that a suspect may \"break away\" from the police or be permitted to reenter the vehicle and then would have access to any weapons inside); <i>see also </i><i>Flowers v. Fiore,</i> 359 F.3d 24, 30-31 (1st Cir.2004)(finding no constitutional violation where police handcuffed driver and then performed protective sweep of his car during <i>Terry</i> stop, because officers had reasonable suspicion that driver was armed and dangerous); <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 162 F.3d 12, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1998)(\"[T]he officers were permitted to conduct a search of the passenger compartment of the automobile for any weapons that might have been accessible to the occupants. This limited search of the vehicle for weapons was permitted even though the occupants had been secured and taken to the rear of [the car].\").</p>\n<p>Though Diaz concedes that <i>Long</i> authorizes police officers to conduct a protective sweep of the passenger compartment of a vehicle during a roadside <i>Terry</i> stop, he attempts to distinguish his situation from <i>Long.</i> Diaz argues that he was handcuffed and thus no longer a danger to police when his car was searched. He discusses <i>Thornton v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 615, 124 S.Ct. 2127, 158 L.Ed.2d 905 (2004), in which the Supreme Court found that a search of a suspect's vehicle after the suspect was arrested, handcuffed, and placed in the back of a patrol car was a permissible search incident to arrest. <i>Id.</i> at 622-23, 124 S.Ct. 2127. Because Diaz was not formally arrested at the time police searched his vehicle, he contends that <i>Thornton</i> does not apply and that the search was therefore impermissible.</p>\n<p>We refuse to pursue the red herring of <i>Thornton</i> dangled by Diaz. The Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Thornton,</i> regarding the lawfulness of vehicular searches incident to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> arrest, does nothing to abrogate the limited vehicular \"frisk\" permitted during a <i>Terry</i> stop by <i>Long</i> and its progeny.<sup>[7]</sup> Indeed, the majority's reasoning in <i>Thornton</i> only strengthens the rationale for the type of search conducted in this case. If officer safety concerns justify the search of a vehicle's passenger compartment where the vehicle's occupant had exited the vehicle before being confronted by police and was arrested, handcuffed, and secured in the backseat of a police car, surely safety concerns justify the same search where the vehicle's occupant was only temporarily detained under <i>Terry</i> and may imminently regain control of the vehicle and its contents. Thus, the district court properly denied Diaz's motion to suppress the firearm and ammunition found in the vehicle.</p>\n<p><i>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n<p>Diaz argues on appeal that the government failed to prove that he was (1) an alien (2) unlawfully present in the United States and (3) in possession of a firearm. Ordinarily, we would review this sufficiency of the evidence claim by determining whether a rational factfinder could have found each of those elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 452 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir.2006). But because Diaz did not ask the district court for a judgment of acquittal on the count for which he was eventually convicted, we review only for plain error and \"reverse only if the conviction would result in a `clear and gross injustice.'\" <i>United States v. Pratt,</i> 496 F.3d 124, 127 (1st Cir.2007)(quoting <i>United States v. Bello-Perez,</i> 977 F.2d 664, 668 (1st Cir.1992)).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> As a preliminary matter, Diaz argues that two documents offered by the government to prove alienagethe Dominican Republic passport and travel documentwere erroneously admitted into evidence; he contends that neither was properly authenticated or fully translated from Spanish into English.<sup>[9]</sup> Because we believe that a determination that Diaz is an alien would not be plainly erroneous even if those two documents were excluded from consideration, resolving Diaz's objections as to the admissibility of those documents is not critical to our discussion of Diaz's sufficiency claims. Nevertheless, we will review the district court's decision to admit the documents for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Holmquist,</i> 36 F.3d 154, 167 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>The Federal Rules of Evidence require, \"as a condition precedent to admissibility[,] . . . evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\" Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). The district court admitted the documents as business records of DHS, for the very limited purpose of showing \"that [DHS] deported a man to the Dominican Republic whose name was Santo Romero and had that picture,\" <i>i.e.,</i> to connect Diaz to his alias and prior removal from the country. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Pluta,</i> 176 F.3d 43, 50 (2d Cir.1999). We see no abuse of discretion on the part of the court in admitting the documents for that limited purpose, given that both of the challenged documents included Diaz's photo, the passport also included his date of birth, and both were produced by DHS officials and came from the Alien Registration file associated with Diaz's known aliases. Under those circumstances, the trial court permissibly found that there was \"sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable person to believe the evidence is what it purports to be.\" <i>Garcia,</i> 452 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>While Diaz objected to the documents at trial on authenticity grounds, he did not specifically raise an objection to the lack of an English translation.<sup>[10]</sup> We therefore review the district court's decision to admit the documents without translation for plain error only. <i>United States v. Morales-Madera,</i> 352 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2003). As we have said before, \"[i]t is clear, to the point of perfect transparency, that federal court proceedings must be conducted in English. . . . [P]arties are required to translate all foreign documents into English.\" <i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1, 5, 7 n. 4 (1st Cir. 2002). The submission of foreign language documents unaccompanied by English translations is error and in ordinary circumstances would bar those documents from consideration by the court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Contreras Palacios,</i> 492 F.3d 39, 43 n. 7 (1st Cir.2007). Here, however, the documents were admitted for a limited purpose, and their evidentiary significance was facially apparent in that it comprised Diaz's photo (on both documents), the use of his alias (on both documents) and his signature and birth date <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> (on the passport). <i>Cf. id.</i> Thus it cannot be said that a \"miscarriage of justice\" resulted from the district court's decision to admit the documents without translation. <i>Morales-Madera,</i> 352 F.3d at 10.</p>\n<p>1. Alien</p>\n<p>In addition to the admissibility issues discussed above, Diaz advances several objections to the evidence submitted by the government to prove his alienage. He takes issue with the government's reliance on warrants and orders of removal and deportation, which he argues do not prove alienage beyond a reasonable doubt because of the different burden of proof applicable to civil deportation proceedings. Diaz also claims that the entry into evidence of the purportedly unauthenticated and untranslated Dominican Republic passport and travel document, and of the deportation/removal orders without any limiting instructions, in tandem with the government's heavy emphasis on those documents in its opening and closing statements, denied him a fair trial and due process of law in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p>We find the totality of the evidence sufficient to permit a rational jury to find Diaz to be an alien beyond a reasonable doubt, let alone meet the lower bar posed by plain error review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Martin,</i> 228 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2000)(\"[J]uries need not evaluate pieces of evidence in isolation, but may draw conclusions from the sum of an evidentiary presentation.\"). The government presented, <i>inter alia,</i> fingerprint and photographic evidence linking Diaz to his various aliases and to a DHS Alien Registration file showing that he had been ordered removed from the country twice before. That the warrants and orders of deportation/removal stem from civil rather than criminal proceedings is not fatal to their inclusion into the total calculus of evidence here, where other evidence strongly supports the inference of alienage. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Contreras Palacios,</i> 492 F.3d at 43-44 (evidence, which included warrant of deportation, sufficient to prove defendant was an alien).</p>\n<p>Because Diaz failed to raise his constitutional arguments at trial, we review his Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims for plain error only. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir. 2003). As noted above, the Dominican Republic passport and travel document were admissible for the limited purpose delineated by the district court. If the government unreasonably harped on these documents in its opening and closing statementsan objection which again, Diaz did not raise at trialdoing so nevertheless did not result in a \"clear and gross injustice.\" <i>See id.</i> at 105 (\"Where, as here, the defendant made no objection to the government's closing argument at trial, the standard of review is plain error. . . . [Defendant] faces a high hurdle because it is established that plain error review is ordinarily limited to blockbusters. . . .\" (internal quotations omitted)). Diaz cannot clear this hurdle, especially considering defense counsel's repeated assertions during his own closing argument that the government had adduced sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Diaz was an illegal alien. Finally, at trial Diaz never requested a limiting instruction with regard to the warrants and orders of deportation/removal, and thus \"he is not entitled to argue here that the district court's failure to provide a limiting instruction constitutes reversible error.\" <i>United States v. Walter,</i> 434 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>2. Unlawfully present</p>\n<p>Diaz asserts that the government did not sufficiently prove he was unlawfully <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> present in the United States because it did not check both of the Alien Registration numbers associated with his aliases and did not produce a Certificate of Nonexistence of Record for the name \"Tony Diaz.\" However, as discussed above, the government provided the jury with a veritable cornucopia of evidence from DHS, on the basis of which it was clearly not plain error for the jury to conclude that the Tony Diaz on trial and the Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo Romero, a/k/a Santo R. Romero, named on the Certificate of Nonexistence of Record entered into evidence were the same person. This court has held that such a certificate can be used to establish unlawful presence in the United States. <i>See Scantleberry-Frank,</i> 158 F.3d at 616 n. 1. Furthermore, Sassone adequately explained why only one Alien Registration number was checked, when she testified that the government ran one number because as of 1992 the two numbers had been consolidated into one file.</p>\n<p>3. Possession of the firearm and ammunition</p>\n<p>To sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(5)(A), the government must present at trial sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm and ammunition in or affecting interstate commerce. Diaz does not quibble with the interstate commerce portion of the charge, but does contend that the government did not sufficiently prove possession. Knowing possession of a firearm may be \"either actual or constructive.\" <i>United States v. Wight,</i> 968 F.2d 1393, 1397 (1st Cir.1992). \"In order to show constructive possession, the government must prove that the defendant 'had dominion and control over the area where the contraband was found.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> 890 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p>We find that the government proffered sufficient evidence to meet its burden. The jury heard evidence that the loaded firearm was discovered under the passenger seat, within the lunge area of the driver's seat, in the car Diaz was driving moments after police ordered Diaz to exit the vehicle, and that Diaz was the only occupant of the vehicle. The jury also heard Detective Burokas and Officer Ayala, the Spanish-speaking police officer who Mirandized Diaz, testify that during booking Diaz stated he had bought the gun on the street for $300.</p>\n<p>Diaz, on the other hand, argues that there was no evidence that he owned the car in which the gun was found and that his fingerprints were not on the gun, ammunition, or clip. In addition, he attempts to cast aspersions on the testimony of Detective Burokas and Officer Ayala, merely because they did not video or audio-tape Diaz's statement regarding his purchase of the gun. We are mindful, however, that as the reviewing court \"we may neither evaluate the credibility of the witnesses nor weigh the relative merit of theories of innocence postulated by the defendant.\" <i>United States v. Maldonado-Garcia,</i> 446 F.3d 227, 231 (1st Cir.2006)(citing <i>United States v. Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir.1998)). Rather, we are tasked with upholding \"any verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of the record.\" <i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> 385 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir.2004)(internal quotations omitted). Even under the more permissive standard for a preserved sufficiency challenge, to say nothing of the plain error standard that applies in this case, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Diaz possessed the firearm and ammunition.</p>\n<p><i>C. Sentencing Enhancement</i></p>\n<p>Diaz also protests the ACCA sentencing enhancement applied by the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> court, arguing that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the enhancement was based on prior convictions that were never presented to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Constitutional challenges to ACCA enhancements are subject to de novo review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Duval,</i> 496 F.3d 64, 80 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>We hold, as we have held before, that this argument is foreclosed by <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)(holding that fact of prior conviction for sentencing purposes need not be proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt). <i>See </i><i>United States v. Earle</i> 488 F.3d 537, 549 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d at 74-75. Diaz notes that Justice Thomas, in a recent concurrence, cast doubts on the continuing viability of <i>Almendarez-Torres. See </i><i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 27-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)(Thomas, J., concurring). Diaz relies on a line of Supreme Court cases from <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), through <i>Shepard</i> and <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to buttress his argument. This court has rejected nearly identical arguments in the past, however, observing that \"[t]he <i>Shepard</i> majority noted the possibility that <i>Apprendi</i> may eventually be extended to require proof of prior convictions to a jury, but cautioned that this `is up to the future to show.' . . . [B]oth <i>Blakely</i> and <i>Booker</i> recognized the continued viability of the <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> exception.\" <i>Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d at 75 (quoting <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 26 n. 5, 125 S.Ct. 1254). Unless and until a majority of the Supreme Court decides otherwise, <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> continues to be binding precedent upon this court. <i>See </i><i>Earle,</i> 488 F.3d at 549 (affirming that we remain bound by <i>Almendarez-Torres</i>).</p>\n<p>Diaz lobs one final argument into the mix, contending that because he was acquitted of the felon-in-possession charge, that prior felony conviction cannot be used as the basis for an upward adjustment of his base offense level, nor for the ACCA sentencing enhancement.<sup>[11]</sup> We give \"due deference\" to a district court's findings of fact at sentencing, and will reverse only for clear error. <i>United States v. Woodward,</i> 277 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Here, Diaz does what he earlier accused the prosecution of doing, and confounds different findings arrived at during different proceedings with different burdens of proof. Diaz argues that the jury \"necessarily found by its verdict that [he] was not a felon under the conviction presented to them.\" That is not correct. The acquittal on the felon-in-possession charge means merely that the jury could not agree that the government had proved that charge beyond a reasonable doubt. A sentencing judge, however, need only find prior convictions by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See id.</i> (\"The government has the burden of proving the facts central to upward adjustments in offense levels by preponderance of the evidence, not by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\")(citing <i>United States v. Aymelek,</i> 926 F.2d 64, 67 (1st Cir.1991)). On that basis, we see no clear error here: as the judge below ruled, a preponderance of the evidence adduced at sentencing supports the conclusion that Diaz and the Tony Diaz/Santo Romero convicted in April 1998 on drug trafficking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> charges are the same person. The conviction thus serves as a proper basis for the sentencing enhancements, regardless of the jury verdict.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, the defendant's conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  At the suppression hearing, Officer Caraballo testified that before opening the door, he looked through the car window and discerned the gun in plain view on the floorboard in front of the passenger seat. The district court did not find this testimony credible, noting that Detective Burokas testified that Caraballo was leaning into the car when he announced that he had found a gun and that the police report indicated that the gun was found under the passenger seat during a protective sweep of the vehicle. Officer Nigohisian's and Sergeant Carroll's testimony, however, buttressed Caraballo's version of events, and the evidence indicates that Detective Burokas arrived at the scene slightly later than the first wave of officers and thus may not have been present when Caraballo initially approached the BMW. We do not consider this to be a particularly important evidentiary point to resolve. As discussed below, whether Caraballo espied the gun in plain view or discovered it in the course of a protective sweep, Diaz's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p>[2]  Diaz conceded that there were sufficient grounds for the police to conduct a <i>Terry</i> stop of the vehicle. <i>See United States v. Diaz,</i> No. CRIM.A.04-10274, 2005 WL 1027437, at *2 (D.Mass. Apr. 29, 2005).</p>\n<p>[3]  At trial, the parties stipulated that (1) a person named Tony Diaz, also known as Santo Romero, was convicted of a felony for which the punishment exceeded one year in Middlesex Superior Court on April 27, 1998; (2) the person convicted of that felony had a birth date of April 7, 1965; and (3) that the Lawrence police had sufficient grounds to conduct a <i>Terry</i> stop of the vehicle driven by Diaz on July 14, 2004.</p>\n<p>[4]  The following pieces of evidence are also at issue in this appeal: Warrant of Deportation for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo Romero, dated March 6, 1992 (Exhibit 4); Warrant of Removal/Deportation for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo R. Romero, a/k/a Jose Rivera Morales, a/k/a Jose Antonio Morales, dated April 7, 1997 (Exhibit 5); Immigration Detainer Notice for Santo Romero Villar, dated July 14, 2004 (Exhibit 9); Record of Deportable Alien for Santo Rodolfo Romero Villar, dated April 22, 1991 (Exhibit 11); and Certificate of Nonexistence of Record for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo Romero, a/k/a Santo R. Romero, attesting that a search of all computer indices and alien files in relation to A29710069 showed that there was no record of that person seeking permission to reenter the United States after deportation (Exhibit 19).\n</p>\n<p>The government also introduced a Form I-700 Application for Temporary Worker Status for Santo R. Romero dated November 7, 1988, which listed Bani, Dominican Republic, as the applicant's birthplace (Exhibit 20); a fingerprint card under the name Santo Romero submitted in support of the Form I-700 application (Exhibit 21); a Form I-693 Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status also submitted in support of the Form I-700 application under the name Santo Romero, with a photo attached and a date of birth of April 7, 1965 (Exhibit 14); and a temporary residency card issued to Santo R. Romero, DOB 4/7/65, birthplace listed as Dominican Republic, with a fingerprint (Exhibit 24).</p>\n<p>All of the above documents were introduced during Sassone's testimony and were contained in alien file A90567004.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") lists at least six separate, drug-related convictions for a Tony Diaz or other known aliases, including Santo Romero. At the sentencing hearing, the government presented evidence, including photographs and fingerprints, linking the convictions to the Tony Diaz on trial. Diaz objected that the evidence was insufficient to prove that each of the convictions was attributable to him.</p>\n<p>[6]  Section 924(e)(1) states, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both . . . such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years. . . .</p>\n<p>[7]  Furthermore, the Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Thornton</i> was carefully limited to the question whether police may search a suspect's vehicle incident to arrest when an officer's first contact with the suspect occurs after the suspect has exited the vehicle. 541 U.S. at 617, 124 S.Ct. 2127. The Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in a case where petitioners seek an answer to the question more pertinent to the argument Diaz is attempting to make herethat is, whether a warrantless search incident to arrest is permissible when there is no demonstrable threat to officer safety or need to preserve evidence. <i>Arizona v. Gant,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1443, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2008 WL 482034 (Feb. 25, 2008). Neither <i>Thornton</i> nor the Court's forthcoming opinion in <i>Gant</i> can control in this instance, however, where the disputed search was conducted incident to a <i>Terry</i> stop by officers who had reason to believe Diaz was armed and dangerous. Diaz suggests that the concurring and dissenting opinions in <i>Thornton</i> call into question the officer safety rationale for permitting a search of a passenger compartment when police have secured the occupant in handcuffs outside the vehicle. Even if this were correct (and we take no position on that point), we reiterate that <i>Thornton</i> does not control here; <i>Long</i> does. We are mindful of the Supreme Court's admonition that, \"if a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\" <i>Agostini v. Felton,</i> 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997)(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>[8]  At the conclusion of the government's case-in-chief, Diaz moved for judgment of acquittal on Count I of the indictment only. In fact, as to the first two elements of Count II, the count for which he was convicted and which he now seeks to overturn on appeal, Diaz may well have not only failed to preserve a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, but waived it entirely. During his closing argument, defense counsel proclaimed to the jury, \"[i]s there any question in your mind . . . that this man right here is an illegal alien? They've proven that beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and later reiterated, \"[t]hey've proven beyond a reasonable doubt that [Diaz is] an illegal alien.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (describing waiver as the \"intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right\" (internal quotations omitted)); <i>United States v. Jimenez,</i> 512 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2007)(\"A waiver is unlike a forfeiture, for the consequence of a waiver is that the objection in question is unreviewable.\"). Nonetheless, we will assume for the sake of argument that all of Diaz's sufficiency of the evidence claims merit a plain error review.</p>\n<p>[9]  At trial, Diaz also appeared to put forward a hearsay objection, which is mentioned in his brief on appeal but not argued. Accordingly, we consider it waived and do not address it. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>[10]  Diaz did not request translations of the passport or travel document at trial, but the district judge noted with concern that the documents were untranslated, and the government correctly concedes that it was \"remiss\" in not providing translations.</p>\n<p>[11]  Diaz describes the conviction in question as \"the case listed on page 9 of the [PSR].\" That case is the April 27, 1998, conviction of one Tony Diaz, also known as Santo Romero, on drug felony charges in Middlesex Superior Court.</p>\n<p>[12]  It should be noted that Diaz would likely qualify for the ACCA enhancement even if the disputed April 1998 conviction were not considered. ACCA requires only \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). At the sentencing hearing, the judge made a finding attributing only three of the six separate convictions listed in the PSR to Diaz, saying, \"I'm not even making an effort to go through the other [convictions].\" A preponderance of the evidence in the record as we read it, however, suggests that at least one, if not all, of the other three convictions, each of which qualifies as a separate ACCA predicate offense, could also be attributed to Diaz.</p>\n\n</div>",

He was sentenced to 262 months in prison followed by 60 months of supervised release. Diaz appeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence, his conviction, and the sentencing enhancement imposed pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). After considering Diaz's various arguments on appeal, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>On July 14, 2004, at approximately 12:30 a.m., shots were fired at Edison Gonzalez and his brother Henry while they were sitting in their car in a restaurant parking lot in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The Gonzalez brothers immediately called 911 and informed the police that they had been shot at by a drunk man driving a blue BMW, license plate number 3703ZE. The brothers then drove to the Lawrence police station where they met with Detective Brian Burokas and Sergeant Charles Carroll. Edison told the detectives that he could identify the shooter and that he knew where the shooter lived, though he did not know the shooter's name. Edison accompanied the detectives to the apartment that he believed to be the residence of the shooter, but the shooter was not there.</p>\n<p>After the police received the call from the Gonzalez brothers, the BMW's description and license plate number were broadcast over the dispatch, along with a warning that the shooter might be drunk. Sometime thereafter, Officer Kevin Nigohisian, who was on patrol in a marked police cruiser, spotted a blue BMW with license plate 3703ZE. Officer Nigohisian followed the BMW in his patrol car and called for back-up. Once back-up arrived, Nigohisian activated his lights and signaled the BMW to pull over. By that time, several other police cars had arrived at the scene. Four of the officers exited their cars with guns drawn and ordered the driver out of the vehicle. Two of the officers patted down the driver and placed him in handcuffs. Shortly afterwards, Officer Thomas Caraballo, who had approached the BMW to ascertain whether there were any other occupants, opened the passenger-side door and leaned into the car. Caraballo then spotted the handle of a gun protruding from beneath the passenger seat and called out to alert the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> other officers.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Almost contemporaneously, Detective Burokas and Sergeant Carroll arrived at the scene with Edison Gonzalez still in tow. From the backseat of Carroll's car, Edison identified the driver of the BMW as the alleged shooter. Responding to Officer Caraballo's discovery of a gun, Detective Burokas approached the BMW, donned latex gloves, and removed a .45 caliber handgun from underneath the front passenger seat. He unloaded the weapon and found three rounds of live ammunition in the clip. The driver was then arrested and taken into custody by the police.</p>\n<p>At booking, the driver gave the name \"Jose Rivera\" along with a date of birth. He was advised of his Miranda rights in Spanish, both orally and in written form, and indicated that he understood his rights. An officer asked \"Rivera\" in Spanish whether he had a license to carry the gun, to which he answered that he had no permit and that he had purchased the gun on the street for $300. After the officers fingerprinted him, his Social Security number was run and two names  Jose A. Rivera, Jr., and Tony Diaz  were returned.</p>\n<p>On September 8, 2004, a federal grand jury indicted Diaz on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count I) and one count of possession of a firearm and ammunition by an unlawful alien in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(5)(A) (Count II). Diaz moved to suppress the evidence seized by police during the search of the BMW, arguing that the \"protective sweep\" of the car after he was handcuffed was a violation of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.<sup>[2]</sup> The district court denied Diaz's motion to suppress, concluding that the sweep of the defendant's vehicle did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it was not unreasonable for police \"to conduct a protective search after putting a suspect in handcuffs during a <i>Terry</i> stop so that the suspect may be released from handcuffs as soon as police safety is assured.\" <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> No. CRIM.A. 04-10274, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1027437</span></span>, at *3 (D.Mass. Apr. 29, 2005).</p>\n<p>A three-day jury trial began on November 7, 2005.<sup>[3]</sup> On the second day of the trial, Joann Sassone, a Records and Information Services Officer for the Boston District <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), testified that the Alien Registration number for Diaz was A90567004, but that previously he had been associated also with another Alien Registration number, A29710069. Sassone explained that the Alien Registration files for the two numbers were consolidated under file number A90567004 in March of 1992, when it was determined that both files documented the same individual. Sassone identified a number of immigration records contained in the consolidated file that were allowed into evidence, including fingerprint cards. The evidence indicated that the alien documented in the file had been deported from the United States to the Dominican Republic in 1992, re-entered in 1993, and was deported again in 2001. Sassone testified that the consolidated alien file had been searched and yielded no evidence of permission to reenter, adjustment of status, or any other authorization to be in the United States. Later that same day, FBI forensics expert Allison Larson testified that the fingerprints on the cards in the alien file discussed by Sassone matched the prints taken from Diaz at the Lawrence police station after his arrest on July 14, 2004.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel unsuccessfully objected to the admission of several of the documents in the alien file. Specifically, defense counsel objected to Exhibit 6, a Warning to Alien Ordered Removed or Deported for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo R. Romero, a/k/a Jose Rivera Morales, a/k/a Jose Antonio Morales, dated April 10, 1997, on hearsay and relevance grounds. The trial judge allowed the document into evidence on the condition that the government link the names referenced in the document to Diaz. In addition, defense counsel objected to Exhibit 10, a Dominican Republic passport issued to Santo Rodolfo Romero Villar, date of birth April 7, 1965, on hearsay and authentication grounds. Finding that the passport had not been formally authenticated, the trial judge refused to allow the document in as an authentic passport, but admitted it as a business record of DHS. Defense counsel also objected to Exhibit 12, a Dominican Republic travel authorization granting the United States permission to deport Santo Romero, date of birth April 7, 1965, to the Dominican Republic, as unauthenticated and hearsay, but the trial judge allowed the document into evidence as a business record of DHS.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> The jury found Diaz not guilty on Count I, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, but guilty on Count II, possession of a firearm and ammunition by an unlawful alien. Based on Diaz's prior convictions,<sup>[5]</sup> his sentence was enhanced pursuant to ACCA, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).<sup>[6]</sup> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Diaz challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from the BMW, the sufficiency of evidence to convict him of being an unlawful alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and the enhancement applied to his sentence as a result of previous convictions.</p>\n<p><i>A.

In <i>Terry,</i> the Supreme Court also held that an officer may pat-down a suspect for weapons when conducting a brief investigatory stop if \"he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual. . . .\" 392 U.S. at 27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We first determine whether there was objectively reasonable suspicion to justify the stop at its inception. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Golab,</i> 325 F.3d at 66. Here, the stop is not at issue; the parties stipulated that the police had sufficient reason to initiate the <i>Terry</i> stop of the vehicle Diaz was driving on the night in question.</p>\n<p>Under the second part of the test, \"we ask whether the ensuing search was 'reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the officers' initial interference.'\" <i>Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d at 72 (quoting <i>United States v. Nee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199564\"><a href=\"/opinion/199564/united-states-v-nee/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.2001)). Traditionally, \"frisking\" an individual who police have reason to believe is in possession of a weapon is considered \"reasonably related in scope\" to stopping an individual who is suspected of being involved in past or present criminal activity. <i>See id.</i> However, in recognition of the significant hazards associated with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> roadside encounters, the Supreme Court has held that police may also \"frisk\" the passenger compartment of a vehicle for weapons during a roadside <i>Terry</i> stop, if \"the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on `specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant' the officers in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.\" <i>Michigan v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1868</span></a></span>). The second prong \"imposes a dual requirement for a permissible warrantless search for weapons: (1) the officers must have actually harbored a suspicion that the suspect was armed; and (2) that suspicion must have been reasonable under the circumstances.\" <i>Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d at 72 (discussing <i>United States v. Lott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520294\"><a href=\"/opinion/520294/united-states-v-george-e-lott-and-edward-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 783-784 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p>There was ample evidence in this case that the officers actually suspected that Diaz was armed and dangerous and that such suspicion was reasonable in light of the circumstances. Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the district court was correct not to credit Officer Caraballo's testimony that he saw a gun in plain view through the car window before entering the car, the government presented credible evidence indicating that the blue BMW that Diaz was driving matched the description of the vehicle, in make and license plate number, driven by the shooter who fired at the Gonzalez brothers earlier that night. These \"specific and articulable\" facts created a reasonable suspicion under <i>Terry</i> and <i>Long</i> that Diaz had access to a weapon and posed an actual danger to the officers. Conducting a protective sweep of the passenger compartment for the weapon was therefore permissible, even though Diaz was outside the vehicle and under police control. <i>See </i><i>Long,</i> 463 U.S. at 1051-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111020\"><a href=\"/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This limited search of the vehicle for weapons was permitted even though the occupants had been secured and taken to the rear of [the car].\").</p>\n<p>Though Diaz concedes that <i>Long</i> authorizes police officers to conduct a protective sweep of the passenger compartment of a vehicle during a roadside <i>Terry</i> stop, he attempts to distinguish his situation from <i>Long.</i> Diaz argues that he was handcuffed and thus no longer a danger to police when his car was searched. He discusses <i>Thornton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134746\"><a href=\"/opinion/134746/thornton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134746\"><a href=\"/opinion/134746/thornton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span> (2004), in which the Supreme Court found that a search of a suspect's vehicle after the suspect was arrested, handcuffed, and placed in the back of a patrol car was a permissible search incident to arrest. <i>Id.</i> at 622-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134746\"><a href=\"/opinion/134746/thornton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2127</span></a></span>. Because Diaz was not formally arrested at the time police searched his vehicle, he contends that <i>Thornton</i> does not apply and that the search was therefore impermissible.</p>\n<p>We refuse to pursue the red herring of <i>Thornton</i> dangled by Diaz. The Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Thornton,</i> regarding the lawfulness of vehicular searches incident to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> arrest, does nothing to abrogate the limited vehicular \"frisk\" permitted during a <i>Terry</i> stop by <i>Long</i> and its progeny.<sup>[7]</sup> Indeed, the majority's reasoning in <i>Thornton</i> only strengthens the rationale for the type of search conducted in this case. If officer safety concerns justify the search of a vehicle's passenger compartment where the vehicle's occupant had exited the vehicle before being confronted by police and was arrested, handcuffed, and secured in the backseat of a police car, surely safety concerns justify the same search where the vehicle's occupant was only temporarily detained under <i>Terry</i> and may imminently regain control of the vehicle and its contents. Thus, the district court properly denied Diaz's motion to suppress the firearm and ammunition found in the vehicle.</p>\n<p><i>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n<p>Diaz argues on appeal that the government failed to prove that he was (1) an alien (2) unlawfully present in the United States and (3) in possession of a firearm. Ordinarily, we would review this sufficiency of the evidence claim by determining whether a rational factfinder could have found each of those elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v.

But because Diaz did not ask the district court for a judgment of acquittal on the count for which he was eventually convicted, we review only for plain error and \"reverse only if the conviction would result in a `clear and gross injustice.'\" <i>United States v. Pratt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202884\"><a href=\"/opinion/202884/united-states-v-pratt/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 127 (1st Cir.2007)(quoting <i>United States v. Bello-Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593168\"><a href=\"/opinion/593168/united-states-v-andres-gabriel-bello-perez-aka-garby/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 668 (1st Cir.1992)).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> As a preliminary matter, Diaz argues that two documents offered by the government to prove alienagethe Dominican Republic passport and travel documentwere erroneously admitted into evidence; he contends that neither was properly authenticated or fully translated from Spanish into English.<sup>[9]</sup> Because we believe that a determination that Diaz is an alien would not be plainly erroneous even if those two documents were excluded from consideration, resolving Diaz's objections as to the admissibility of those documents is not critical to our discussion of Diaz's sufficiency claims. Nevertheless, we will review the district court's decision to admit the documents for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Holmquist,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195622\"><a href=\"/opinion/195622/united-states-v-holmquist/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 167 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>The Federal Rules of Evidence require, \"as a condition precedent to admissibility[,] . . . evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\" Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). The district court admitted the documents as business records of DHS, for the very limited purpose of showing \"that [DHS] deported a man to the Dominican Republic whose name was Santo Romero and had that picture,\" <i>i.e.,</i> to connect Diaz to his alias and prior removal from the country. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Pluta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763758\"><a href=\"/opinion/763758/united-states-v-witold-pluta/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 50 (2d Cir.1999). We see no abuse of discretion on the part of the court in admitting the documents for that limited purpose, given that both of the challenged documents included Diaz's photo, the passport also included his date of birth, and both were produced by DHS officials and came from the Alien Registration file associated with Diaz's known aliases. Under those circumstances, the trial court permissibly found that there was \"sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable person to believe the evidence is what it purports to be.\" <i>Garcia,</i> 452 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>While Diaz objected to the documents at trial on authenticity grounds, he did not specifically raise an objection to the lack of an English translation.<sup>[10]</sup> We therefore review the district court's decision to admit the documents without translation for plain error only. <i>United States v. Morales-Madera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200057\"><a href=\"/opinion/200057/united-states-v-rivera-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2003). As we have said before, \"[i]t is clear, to the point of perfect transparency, that federal court proceedings must be conducted in English. . . . [P]arties are required to translate all foreign documents into English.\" <i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5, 7 n. 4 (1st Cir. 2002). The submission of foreign language documents unaccompanied by English translations is error and in ordinary circumstances would bar those documents from consideration by the court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Contreras Palacios,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202818\"><a href=\"/opinion/202818/united-states-v-contreras-palacios/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 43 n. 7 (1st Cir.2007). Here, however, the documents were admitted for a limited purpose, and their evidentiary significance was facially apparent in that it comprised Diaz's photo (on both documents), the use of his alias (on both documents) and his signature and birth date <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> (on the passport). <i>Cf. id.</i> Thus it cannot be said that a \"miscarriage of justice\" resulted from the district court's decision to admit the documents without translation. <i>Morales-Madera,</i> 352 F.3d at 10.</p>\n<p>1. Alien</p>\n<p>In addition to the admissibility issues discussed above, Diaz advances several objections to the evidence submitted by the government to prove his alienage. He takes issue with the government's reliance on warrants and orders of removal and deportation, which he argues do not prove alienage beyond a reasonable doubt because of the different burden of proof applicable to civil deportation proceedings. Diaz also claims that the entry into evidence of the purportedly unauthenticated and untranslated Dominican Republic passport and travel document, and of the deportation/removal orders without any limiting instructions, in tandem with the government's heavy emphasis on those documents in its opening and closing statements, denied him a fair trial and due process of law in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p>We find the totality of the evidence sufficient to permit a rational jury to find Diaz to be an alien beyond a reasonable doubt, let alone meet the lower bar posed by plain error review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199098\"><a href=\"/opinion/199098/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2000)(\"[J]uries need not evaluate pieces of evidence in isolation, but may draw conclusions from the sum of an evidentiary presentation.\"). The government presented, <i>inter alia,</i> fingerprint and photographic evidence linking Diaz to his various aliases and to a DHS Alien Registration file showing that he had been ordered removed from the country twice before. That the warrants and orders of deportation/removal stem from civil rather than criminal proceedings is not fatal to their inclusion into the total calculus of evidence here, where other evidence strongly supports the inference of alienage. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Contreras Palacios,</i> 492 F.3d at 43-44 (evidence, which included warrant of deportation, sufficient to prove defendant was an alien).</p>\n<p>Because Diaz failed to raise his constitutional arguments at trial, we review his Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims for plain error only. <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200345\"><a href=\"/opinion/200345/united-states-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir. 2003). As noted above, the Dominican Republic passport and travel document were admissible for the limited purpose delineated by the district court. If the government unreasonably harped on these documents in its opening and closing statementsan objection which again, Diaz did not raise at trialdoing so nevertheless did not result in a \"clear and gross injustice.\" <i>See id.</i> at 105 (\"Where, as here, the defendant made no objection to the government's closing argument at trial, the standard of review is plain error. . . . [Defendant] faces a high hurdle because it is established that plain error review is ordinarily limited to blockbusters. . . .\" (internal quotations omitted)). Diaz cannot clear this hurdle, especially considering defense counsel's repeated assertions during his own closing argument that the government had adduced sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Diaz was an illegal alien. Finally, at trial Diaz never requested a limiting instruction with regard to the warrants and orders of deportation/removal, and thus \"he is not entitled to argue here that the district court's failure to provide a limiting instruction constitutes reversible error.\" <i>United States v. Walter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202006\"><a href=\"/opinion/202006/united-states-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>2. Unlawfully present</p>\n<p>Diaz asserts that the government did not sufficiently prove he was unlawfully <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> present in the United States because it did not check both of the Alien Registration numbers associated with his aliases and did not produce a Certificate of Nonexistence of Record for the name \"Tony Diaz.\" However, as discussed above, the government provided the jury with a veritable cornucopia of evidence from DHS, on the basis of which it was clearly not plain error for the jury to conclude that the Tony Diaz on trial and the Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo Romero, a/k/a Santo R. Romero, named on the Certificate of Nonexistence of Record entered into evidence were the same person. This court has held that such a certificate can be used to establish unlawful presence in the United States. <i>See Scantleberry-Frank,</i> 158 F.3d at 616 n. 1. Furthermore, Sassone adequately explained why only one Alien Registration number was checked, when she testified that the government ran one number because as of 1992 the two numbers had been consolidated into one file.</p>\n<p>3. Possession of the firearm and ammunition</p>\n<p>To sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(5)(A), the government must present at trial sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm and ammunition in or affecting interstate commerce. Diaz does not quibble with the interstate commerce portion of the charge, but does contend that the government did not sufficiently prove possession. Knowing possession of a firearm may be \"either actual or constructive.\" <i>United States v. Wight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586812\"><a href=\"/opinion/586812/united-states-v-phillip-a-wight/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1393</span></a></span>, 1397 (1st Cir.1992). \"In order to show constructive possession, the government must prove that the defendant 'had dominion and control over the area where the contraband was found.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532754\"><a href=\"/opinion/532754/united-states-v-alfreda-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 549 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p>We find that the government proffered sufficient evidence to meet its burden. The jury heard evidence that the loaded firearm was discovered under the passenger seat, within the lunge area of the driver's seat, in the car Diaz was driving moments after police ordered Diaz to exit the vehicle, and that Diaz was the only occupant of the vehicle. The jury also heard Detective Burokas and Officer Ayala, the Spanish-speaking police officer who Mirandized Diaz, testify that during booking Diaz stated he had bought the gun on the street for $300.</p>\n<p>Diaz, on the other hand, argues that there was no evidence that he owned the car in which the gun was found and that his fingerprints were not on the gun, ammunition, or clip. In addition, he attempts to cast aspersions on the testimony of Detective Burokas and Officer Ayala, merely because they did not video or audio-tape Diaz's statement regarding his purchase of the gun. We are mindful, however, that as the reviewing court \"we may neither evaluate the credibility of the witnesses nor weigh the relative merit of theories of innocence postulated by the defendant.\" <i>United States v. Maldonado-Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202192\"><a href=\"/opinion/202192/united-states-v-maldonado-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 231 (1st Cir.2006)(citing <i>United States v.

Even under the more permissive standard for a preserved sufficiency challenge, to say nothing of the plain error standard that applies in this case, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Diaz possessed the firearm and ammunition.</p>\n<p><i>C. Sentencing Enhancement</i></p>\n<p>Diaz also protests the ACCA sentencing enhancement applied by the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> court, arguing that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the enhancement was based on prior convictions that were never presented to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Constitutional challenges to ACCA enhancements are subject to de novo review. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

This court has rejected nearly identical arguments in the past, however, observing that \"[t]he <i>Shepard</i> majority noted the possibility that <i>Apprendi</i> may eventually be extended to require proof of prior convictions to a jury, but cautioned that this `is up to the future to show.' . . . [B]oth <i>Blakely</i> and <i>Booker</i> recognized the continued viability of the <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> exception.\" <i>Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d at 75 (quoting <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 26 n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span>). Unless and until a majority of the Supreme Court decides otherwise, <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> continues to be binding precedent upon this court. <i>See </i><i>Earle,</i> 488 F.3d at 549 (affirming that we remain bound by <i>Almendarez-Torres</i>).</p>\n<p>Diaz lobs one final argument into the mix, contending that because he was acquitted of the felon-in-possession charge, that prior felony conviction cannot be used as the basis for an upward adjustment of his base offense level, nor for the ACCA sentencing enhancement.<sup>[11]</sup> We give \"due deference\" to a district court's findings of fact at sentencing, and will reverse only for clear error. <i>United States v. Woodward,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776187\"><a href=\"/opinion/776187/united-states-v-donald-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 91 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Here, Diaz does what he earlier accused the prosecution of doing, and confounds different findings arrived at during different proceedings with different burdens of proof. Diaz argues that the jury \"necessarily found by its verdict that [he] was not a felon under the conviction presented to them.\" That is not correct. The acquittal on the felon-in-possession charge means merely that the jury could not agree that the government had proved that charge beyond a reasonable doubt. A sentencing judge, however, need only find prior convictions by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See id.</i> (\"The government has the burden of proving the facts central to upward adjustments in offense levels by preponderance of the evidence, not by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\")(citing <i>United States v. Aymelek,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556393\"><a href=\"/opinion/556393/united-states-v-kaya-aymelek/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.1991)). On that basis, we see no clear error here: as the judge below ruled, a preponderance of the evidence adduced at sentencing supports the conclusion that Diaz and the Tony Diaz/Santo Romero convicted in April 1998 on drug trafficking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> charges are the same person. The conviction thus serves as a proper basis for the sentencing enhancements, regardless of the jury verdict.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, the defendant's conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  At the suppression hearing, Officer Caraballo testified that before opening the door, he looked through the car window and discerned the gun in plain view on the floorboard in front of the passenger seat. The district court did not find this testimony credible, noting that Detective Burokas testified that Caraballo was leaning into the car when he announced that he had found a gun and that the police report indicated that the gun was found under the passenger seat during a protective sweep of the vehicle. Officer Nigohisian's and Sergeant Carroll's testimony, however, buttressed Caraballo's version of events, and the evidence indicates that Detective Burokas arrived at the scene slightly later than the first wave of officers and thus may not have been present when Caraballo initially approached the BMW. We do not consider this to be a particularly important evidentiary point to resolve. As discussed below, whether Caraballo espied the gun in plain view or discovered it in the course of a protective sweep, Diaz's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p>[2]  Diaz conceded that there were sufficient grounds for the police to conduct a <i>Terry</i> stop of the vehicle. <i>See United States v. Diaz,</i> No. CRIM.A.04-10274, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1027437</span></span>, at *2 (D.Mass. Apr. 29, 2005).</p>\n<p>[3]  At trial, the parties stipulated that (1) a person named Tony Diaz, also known as Santo Romero, was convicted of a felony for which the punishment exceeded one year in Middlesex Superior Court on April 27, 1998; (2) the person convicted of that felony had a birth date of April 7, 1965; and (3) that the Lawrence police had sufficient grounds to conduct a <i>Terry</i> stop of the vehicle driven by Diaz on July 14, 2004.</p>\n<p>[4]  The following pieces of evidence are also at issue in this appeal: Warrant of Deportation for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo Romero, dated March 6, 1992 (Exhibit 4); Warrant of Removal/Deportation for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo R. Romero, a/k/a Jose Rivera Morales, a/k/a Jose Antonio Morales, dated April 7, 1997 (Exhibit 5); Immigration Detainer Notice for Santo Romero Villar, dated July 14, 2004 (Exhibit 9); Record of Deportable Alien for Santo Rodolfo Romero Villar, dated April 22, 1991 (Exhibit 11); and Certificate of Nonexistence of Record for Santo Rodolfo Romero-Villar, a/k/a Santo Romero, a/k/a Santo R. Romero, attesting that a search of all computer indices and alien files in relation to A29710069 showed that there was no record of that person seeking permission to reenter the United States after deportation (Exhibit 19).\n</p>\n<p>The government also introduced a Form I-700 Application for Temporary Worker Status for Santo R. Romero dated November 7, 1988, which listed Bani, Dominican Republic, as the applicant's birthplace (Exhibit 20); a fingerprint card under the name Santo Romero submitted in support of the Form I-700 application (Exhibit 21); a Form I-693 Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status also submitted in support of the Form I-700 application under the name Santo Romero, with a photo attached and a date of birth of April 7, 1965 (Exhibit 14); and a temporary residency card issued to Santo R. Romero, DOB 4/7/65, birthplace listed as Dominican Republic, with a fingerprint (Exhibit 24).</p>\n<p>All of the above documents were introduced during Sassone's testimony and were contained in alien file A90567004.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") lists at least six separate, drug-related convictions for a Tony Diaz or other known aliases, including Santo Romero. At the sentencing hearing, the government presented evidence, including photographs and fingerprints, linking the convictions to the Tony Diaz on trial. Diaz objected that the evidence was insufficient to prove that each of the convictions was attributable to him.</p>\n<p>[6]  Section 924(e)(1) states, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both . . . such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years. . . .</p>\n<p>[7]  Furthermore, the Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Thornton</i> was carefully limited to the question whether police may search a suspect's vehicle incident to arrest when an officer's first contact with the suspect occurs after the suspect has exited the vehicle. 541 U.S. at 617, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134746\"><a href=\"/opinion/134746/thornton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2127</span></a></span>. The Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in a case where petitioners seek an answer to the question more pertinent to the argument Diaz is attempting to make herethat is, whether a warrantless search incident to arrest is permissible when there is no demonstrable threat to officer safety or need to preserve evidence. <i>Arizona v. Gant,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1443</span></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">482034</span></span> (Feb. 25, 2008). Neither <i>Thornton</i> nor the Court's forthcoming opinion in <i>Gant</i> can control in this instance, however, where the disputed search was conducted incident to a <i>Terry</i> stop by officers who had reason to believe Diaz was armed and dangerous. Diaz suggests that the concurring and dissenting opinions in <i>Thornton</i> call into question the officer safety rationale for permitting a search of a passenger compartment when police have secured the occupant in handcuffs outside the vehicle. Even if this were correct (and we take no position on that point), we reiterate that <i>Thornton</i> does not control here; <i>Long</i> does. We are mindful of the Supreme Court's admonition that, \"if a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\" <i>Agostini v.

In fact, as to the first two elements of Count II, the count for which he was convicted and which he now seeks to overturn on appeal, Diaz may well have not only failed to preserve a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, but waived it entirely. During his closing argument, defense counsel proclaimed to the jury, \"[i]s there any question in your mind . . . that this man right here is an illegal alien? They've proven that beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and later reiterated, \"[t]hey've proven beyond a reasonable doubt that [Diaz is] an illegal alien.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Nonetheless, we will assume for the sake of argument that all of Diaz's sufficiency of the evidence claims merit a plain error review.</p>\n<p>[9]  At trial, Diaz also appeared to put forward a hearsay objection, which is mentioned in his brief on appeal but not argued. Accordingly, we consider it waived and do not address it. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>[10]  Diaz did not request translations of the passport or travel document at trial, but the district judge noted with concern that the documents were untranslated, and the government correctly concedes that it was \"remiss\" in not providing translations.</p>\n<p>[11]  Diaz describes the conviction in question as \"the case listed on page 9 of the [PSR].\" That case is the April 27, 1998, conviction of one Tony Diaz, also known as Santo Romero, on drug felony charges in Middlesex Superior Court.</p>\n<p>[12]  It should be noted that Diaz would likely qualify for the ACCA enhancement even if the disputed April 1998 conviction were not considered. ACCA requires only \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). At the sentencing hearing, the judge made a finding attributing only three of the six separate convictions listed in the PSR to Diaz, saying, \"I'm not even making an effort to go through the other [convictions].\" A preponderance of the evidence in the record as we read it, however, suggests that at least one, if not all, of the other three convictions, each of which qualifies as a separate ACCA predicate offense, could also be attributed to Diaz.</p>\n\n</div>",
