R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-2382\n\n                          DOROTHY LAFORTUNE,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                    CITY OF BIDDEFORD, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n           [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Dorothy Lafortune on brief pro se.\n     Keith R. Jacques, Aaron P. Burns and Smith Elliott Smith &\nGarmey, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             July 22, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam. Dorothy Lafortune brought this action against\n\nthe City of Biddeford, Maine, and its former mayor, Donna Dion,\n\nclaiming First Amendment and due process violations arising from\n\ntwo City Council orders (Order #2001.80 and Order #2001.94) which\n\nprohibited the rebroadcast of her television program on Biddeford's\n\npublic access cable television channel and suspended her right to\n\nuse the Biddeford public access television facilities.               She also\n\nclaimed that City Council Order #2001.94 constituted an unlawful\n\nbill of attainder and sought direct review of Order #2001.80 under\n\nRule 80B of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n            In December 2002, the district court dismissed the action\n\nas moot after the City imposed a moratorium on public access\n\nprogramming.      Lafortune appealed that ruling and we remanded for\n\nfurther   proceedings     in    the   district   court,    concluding    that\n\ndefendants had failed to make a showing sufficient to meet their\n\nburden of demonstrating that the challenged conduct would not\n\nrecur. The district court subsequently granted summary judgment to\n\nLafortune    on   her   prior   restraint   claim,   and   granted    summary\n\njudgment to defendants on the bill of attainder and due process\n\nclaims.     The Rule 80B claim was dismissed as moot after the City\n\nCouncil rescinded the order in issue.\n\n            Lafortune now appeals the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment to defendants and its dismissal of her Rule 80B\n\nclaim.    She also challenges the district court's denial of her\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fpost-remand request to amend her complaint.     Substantially for the\n\nreasons relied upon by the district court, we affirm.\n\n          Lafortune devotes much of her appellate brief to the\n\nmerits of the claims she sought to add to her complaint after\n\nremand.   Since the district court denied leave to amend the\n\ncomplaint, the merits of those additional claims are not properly\n\nbefore us and we decline to address them now.    Further, we conclude\n\nthat the district court did not err in denying Lafortune's request\n\nto amend her complaint.   See Watson IV v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp.,\n\n298 F.3d 102, 109 (1st Cir. 2002) (where dispositive motion is\n\npending and party seeks leave to amend the complaint, \"the proposed\n\namendment must be not only theoretically viable but also solidly\n\ngrounded in the record [and] . . . supported by substantial\n\nevidence.\") (citing Hatch v. Dept. for Children, Youth and Their\n\nFamilies, 274 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2001)).       Lafortune fails to\n\noffer substantial evidence that the additional claims she would\n\nhave inserted in the amended complaint have merit, and they are\n\nbased on an entirely new set of facts and legal theories.         In\n\naddition, Lafortune indicated that she wished to seek damages\n\nalthough the operative complaint had requested only injunctive\n\nrelief. Thus, the district court in its discretion could properly\n\ndeny her request to amend.\n\n          With respect to the issues raised on summary judgment, we\n\nagree that the City Council's rescission of Order #2001.80 rendered\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fLafortune's Rule 80B appeal moot.           See Steir v. Girl Scouts of the\n\nUSA, 383 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir. 2004); Tenoco Oil Co. v. Department\n\nof Consumer Affairs, 876 F.2d 1013, 1019-20 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nFurther, to the extent Lafortune challenges the district court's\n\ndetermination that City Council Order #2001.94 did not constitute\n\na bill of attainder, we also agree that Lafortune failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the order was equivalent to a legislative act.\n\nAccordingly, defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the\n\nclaim.   See    Little v. City of N.          Miami, 805 F.2d 962, 966-67\n\n(11th Cir. 1986).\n\n          In    addition,    we   conclude      that   the   district   court\n\ncorrectly found that Lafortune's procedural due process claim is\n\nbarred by the Parratt-Hudson doctrine, which \"shields a public\n\nentity from a federal due process claim where the denial of process\n\nwas caused by the random and unauthorized conduct of government\n\nofficials and where the state has provided adequate postdeprivation\n\nremedies to correct the official's random and unauthorized acts.\"\n\nHadfield v. McDonough, 407 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2005).                    The\n\nessence of Lafortune's due process claim is that the City Council\n\nproceeding in issue was undertaken without authority and that\n\ndefendants     failed   to   follow     the    procedure     established    in\n\nBiddeford's Cable Television Ordinance.            Accordingly, it appears\n\nthat the acts complained of fit the definition of \"random and\n\nunauthorized.\" See O'Neill v. Baker, 210 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f2000).   Lafortune also failed to show that postdeprivation review\n\nunder Me. R. Civ. P. 80B was inadequate or unavailable.\n\n           With regard to Lafortune's substantive due process claim,\n\nwe agree that the challenged conduct did not meet the threshold for\n\nestablishing the requisite abuse of government power.     See Nestor\n\nColon Medina & Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st\n\nCir. 1992); Chiplin Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Lebanon, 712 F.2d\n\n1524, 1528 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n           We have considered Lafortune's remaining arguments and\n\nfind them to be lacking in merit.     Finally, we note that Lafortune\n\nhas submitted a \"Motion for Suspension of Rules,\" in which she\n\nrequests leave to remove an action pending in the Maine state court\n\ndirectly to this court.     We lack jurisdiction to grant such a\n\nrequest.   See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292.     The motion is denied and\n\nthe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
