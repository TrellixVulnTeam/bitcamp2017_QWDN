Murphy, on brief for petitioner.\n     Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Terri J.\nScadron, Assistant Director, and Siu Wong, Attorney, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, U.S. Department of Justice, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n\n                          November 22, 2006\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.          In 1995, Hong Mei Zhang, a\n\nnative and citizen of the People’s Republic of China, overstayed\n\nher visa, was placed in deportation proceedings, and filed an\n\napplication for asylum based on her contention that she had been\n\npersecuted    as   an   active   participant   in   China’s     pro-democracy\n\nstudent    groups.       Finding   her     testimony      uncreditworthy,   an\n\nimmigration judge (IJ) denied the asylum application, and granted\n\nher voluntary departure effective August 21, 1996.              In April 1997,\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed.\n\n           In May 2002, Zhang filed an untimely motion with the BIA\n\nto reopen her      deportation case sua sponte.              See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.2(a).     Zhang noted that, following her previous deportation\n\nhearing,     Congress    changed   immigration      law    to   make   “forced\n\nabortion/sterilization” a potential form of “persecution” under the\n\nasylum statute, and she asserted that the Chinese government had\n\nforced her to undergo an abortion in 1991.          Zhang claimed that she\n\ndid not mention this abortion in her 1995 asylum application\n\nbecause her attorney recommended against doing so, and because she\n\ncould not face a resumption of the psychological trauma which that\n\nmemory triggered.       The BIA exercised its sua sponte discretion to\n\nreopen the Zhang case, and remanded it to an IJ for decision.\n\n           At a hearing in July 2004, the IJ asserted that she found\n\nit suspicious that Zhang had failed to mention the coerced abortion\n\nin her 1995 asylum petition, and warned Zhang and her counsel\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fregarding the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum petition.\n\nThe IJ recessed to permit Zhang to consult with her attorney.          When\n\ncourt reconvened, Zhang withdrew her asylum application and sought\n\nvoluntary departure.     The IJ fixed January 29, 2005, as the date\n\nfor voluntary departure.\n\n          On   January   28,    2005,   one   day   before   her   scheduled\n\nvoluntary departure, Zhang submitted a second untimely motion, this\n\ntime with the IJ, requesting the reopening of her deportation case\n\nsua sponte.    Zhang contended that she involuntarily withdrew her\n\nasylum petition at the July 2004 hearing because she misunderstood\n\nher attorney’s advice, and did not comprehend that her acceptance\n\nof voluntary departure would waive the asylum claim based on her\n\nforced abortion. Relying on the fact that the court had adequately\n\ninformed Zhang of her rights at the July 2004 hearing, and that\n\nZhang was represented by counsel and provided with a Chinese\n\ninterpreter, the IJ declined to exercise her discretion to reopen\n\nZhang’s case sua sponte.       After the BIA affirmed the denial, Zhang\n\nsubmitted this petition for review, reiterating the same arguments\n\nraised in her second motion to reopen.\n\n           We lack jurisdiction to entertain the Zhang petition for\n\nreview.   Her second motion to reopen, suspiciously filed only one\n\nday prior to her voluntary departure date, was untimely.               See,\n\ne.g., 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (providing that motions to reopen\n\nnormally must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative\n\ndecision in the case).         Thus, the BIA and the IJ had plenary\n\n                                    -3-\n\fdiscretion to determine whether to grant the Zhang motion to reopen\n\nsua sponte, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a) (defining BIA’s authority to\n\nreopen); 1003.23(b) (defining IJ’s authority); see, e.g., Prado v.\n\nReno, 198 F.3d 286, 292 (1st Cir. 1999) (observing that “‘the\n\ndecision of the BIA whether to invoke its sua sponte authority [to\n\ngrant an untimely motion to reopen] is committed to its unfettered\n\ndiscretion’ . . . and is simply not justiciable”) (quoting Luis v.\n\nINS, 196 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 1999)).             Thus, the BIA and the IJ\n\ncould deny the motion even if the Zhang motion to reopen stated a\n\nprima facie case for relief, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a); 1003.23(b)(3);\n\nsee Luis, 196 F.3d at 41 (“There are no guidelines or standards\n\nwhich dictate how and when the BIA should invoke its sua sponte\n\npower       under   [section   1003.2(a)].”).1       By   its   very   nature,\n\ntherefore, denial of such discretionary relief is unreviewable.\n\n              The   petition   for   review   is   dismissed    for    want   of\n\nappellate jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      Even if we had jurisdiction (which we plainly do not), the IJ\narguably gave several plausible grounds for denying the Zhang\nmotion: Zhang, who was represented by counsel and was provided\nwith a Mandarin interpreter at the July 2004 hearing, never\ninformed the IJ that she had trouble understanding her interpreter,\nand told the IJ that she understood his explanation as to the\nconsequences of the voluntary departure order. In addition, the\nBIA notified Zhang in July 2005 that transcripts are not prepared\nfor appeals from an IJ’s decision denying a motion to reopen, and\nthat if she wanted a transcript prepared, she must make an express\nrequest in her brief to the BIA. As she made no such request, the\nrecord contains no transcripts, and we would have no reliable basis\nfor reviewing the IJ’s stated grounds for denying the Zhang motion.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
