Kenneth P. Neiman, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge, and\n                 Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Mark A.

This appeal requires us to mull\n\nthe circumstances in which a union, having successfully arbitrated\n\na grievance, may leverage the award to bypass procedures prescribed\n\nby a collective bargaining agreement and obtain direct federal\n\ncourt   relief    for   subsequent      episodes     of    alleged    employer\n\nmisconduct.     In the case at hand, the district court thwarted the\n\nunion's attempt to short-circuit the grievance process, finding too\n\ngreat   a   disparity   between   the      facts   underlying   the   initial\n\ncomplaints and those giving rise to the subsequent complaints.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n                               Background\n\n            North Adams Regional Hospital (the Hospital) employs\n\nnurses represented by the Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA).\n\nThis dispute arises out of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)\n\nbetween the two organizations.       Article 18.07 of the CBA contains\n\na   provision    entitled   \"Standards      of   Nursing   Practice,\"   which\n\nrequires the Hospital to \"only keep and admit the number of\n\npatients that registered nurses can safely care for\" and to \"take\n\nmeasures such as adding nurses [and] stopping admissions . . . to\n\nensure that this occurs.\" The CBA further provides a stereotypical\n\ngrievance procedure, culminating in binding arbitration, to resolve\n\ncovered disputes.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            In    2002,      nurses   employed     by    the    Hospital    filed\n\napproximately     nine      reports   alleging   inadequate      staffing   on   a\n\nparticular floor (Three North) in violation of Article 18.07.                 The\n\nMNA converted these complaints into formal grievances. Arbitration\n\nhearings took place in 2003 and 2004.             On February 21, 2005, the\n\narbitrator, Michael Stutz, found that the Hospital had transgressed\n\nthe CBA and issued a remedial order.             We need not recount all the\n\nparticulars      of   the     arbitrator's    entire      decision   and    order\n\n(collectively, the Stutz Award); for now, it suffices to repeat the\n\norder alone:\n\n            a) The Hospital shall cease and desist\n            violating Article 18.07 of the Agreement;\n\n            b) The Hospital shall pay the MNA an amount of\n            money equal to the pay of one RN for each of\n            the nine shifts grieved; and\n\n            c) The Hospital shall pay the RN's working the\n            nine shifts time and one half for those nine\n            shifts, i.e. the difference between time and\n            one half pay and what they actually were paid.\n\n            In the spring of 2005 — some three years after the events\n\nthat gave rise to the initial grievances — nurses at the Hospital\n\nreported what they believed to be additional violations of Article\n\n18.07.    While at least one of these reports dealt with an event on\n\nThree North, the vast majority of them involved events occurring in\n\nother    areas   of   the    Hospital.       Rather     than   converting   these\n\ncomplaints into one or more formal grievances, the MNA attempted a\n\nshort-cut; it filed a direct action in the federal district court,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fseeking enforcement of the cease-and-desist portion of the Stutz\n\nAward.1   That action rested on section 301 of the Labor-Management\n\nRelations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185, which authorizes federal district\n\ncourts to enforce collective bargaining pacts and, thus, to enforce\n\nlabor arbitration awards issued pursuant to such pacts.2                    See\n\nTextile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 451 (1957).               This\n\nmeans that where, as here, a collective bargaining agreement\n\ncontains an arbitration clause, an arbitral award is akin to a\n\ncontractual obligation that can be enforced through a civil action\n\nunder section 301.     See Local 2322, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v.\n\nVerizon New Engl., Inc., ___F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2006) [No. 06-\n\n1169, slip op. at 5].\n\n             The Hospital answered the complaint.           It then moved for\n\njudgment on the pleadings, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), arguing that\n\nthe   2005   reports   arose   out   of    a   variegated    set   of   factual\n\npredicates materially different from the factual predicate on which\n\nthe earlier grievances reposed and that, therefore, enforcement\n\nconstituted an inappropriate avenue for relief.              The MNA opposed\n\nthe motion.    By consent of the parties, the matter was entrusted to\n\na magistrate judge for decision.          See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c); Fed. R.\n\n\n      1\n      The MNA also sought to adjudge the Hospital in violation of\nanother portion of the Stutz Award.       That dispute has been\nresolved.\n      2\n      The parties speak, interchangeably, of both \"confirming\" and\n\"enforcing\" the Stutz Award. Because enforcement seems more apt in\nthe context of this case, we use that terminology.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fCiv. P. 73.    After a comprehensive analysis of the Stutz Award and\n\nthe   applicable   law,   the   judge      agreed     with      the   Hospital's\n\ncharacterization    and   allowed    the    motion.      This    timely   appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n                                Analysis\n\n            Both parties rely heavily on our prior pronouncements\n\nregarding the enforcement of arbitral awards.                Consequently, we\n\nstart there.\n\n            In previous cases, we have recognized that, at least\n\nsince the Supreme Court decided the so-called Steelworkers trilogy,\n\nsee United Steelworkers v. Am. Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564 (1960);\n\nUnited Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Navig. Co., 363 U.S. 574\n\n(1960); United Steelworkers v. Enter. Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S.\n\n593 (1960), the federal courts are to play a narrowly circumscribed\n\nrole in the administration of labor arbitration. See, e.g., Boston\n\nShipping Ass'n, Inc. v. Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n, 659 F.2d 1, 3\n\n(1st Cir. 1981).      We have been particularly loath to take too\n\nexpansive a view of the precedential effect of arbitration awards,\n\nemphasizing that this phenomenon is primarily a matter for the\n\narbitrator, not for a court.        See Courier-Citizen Co. v. Boston\n\nElectrotypers Union No. 11, 702 F.2d 273, 280 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\nThis does not denote, however, that unions invariably must be\n\nconsigned   to   Sisyphean   labors,      forced    to   arbitrate     the   same\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fgrievance again and again.          See Locals 2222, 2320-2327, Int'l Bhd.\n\nof Elec. Workers v. New Engl. Tel. & Tel. Co., 628 F.2d 644, 649\n\n(1st Cir. 1980).       In appropriate circumstances, a court may order\n\nthe   enforcement      of   a   prior    arbitration     award    as     a    means   of\n\nresolving a subsequent labor dispute.            See, e.g., Boston Shipping,\n\n659 F.2d at 4.\n\n           The trick, of course, is discerning what circumstances\n\nare   sufficient       to   warrant       bypassing     the   normal         grievance\n\nprocedures. Even though we enforced the original arbitral award in\n\nBoston Shipping, we made clear that this result was the exception\n\nrather than the rule; such an anodyne is available only if \"it is\n\nbeyond argument that there is no material factual difference\n\nbetween   the    new    dispute     and    the   one    decided     in       the   prior\n\narbitration.\" Id. We fleshed out that commentary two years later,\n\nstating that:\n\n           Only where an arbitral award is both clearly\n           intended to have a prospective effect and\n           there is no colorable basis for denying the\n           applicability of the existing award to a\n           dispute at hand, will a court order compliance\n           with the award rather than require the parties\n           to proceed anew through the contract grievance\n           procedure.\n\nDerwin v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 719 F.2d 484, 491 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n           Read carefully, these two decisions illustrate the proper\n\napplication of the standard.            In the former case, the new dispute\n\nwas identical to the original dispute except for the intervening\n\nrenewal   of    the    collective       bargaining     agreement;      accordingly,\n\n                                          -6-\n\fenforcement was an available remedy.        Boston Shipping, 659 F.2d at\n\n4.   In the latter case, we refused to follow that course because\n\nthe union had failed to show a new and identical dispute.                See\n\nDerwin, 719 F.2d at 491 (warning that this court would not \"put its\n\nimprimatur upon an arbitral award in a vacuum\").              This cautious\n\napproach toward the hopscotch enforcement of arbitration awards\n\nvis-á-vis new grievances is solidly within the mainstream of labor\n\nlaw as elucidated by other courts of appeals.              See, e.g., Local\n\n1545, United Mine Workers v. Inland Steel Coal Co., 876 F.2d 1288,\n\n1295-97 (7th Cir. 1989) (requiring that facts underlying prior\n\naward and those underlying subsequent violation be \"substantially\n\nidentical\" in order to warrant enforcement); United Mine Workers,\n\nDist. 5 v. Consol. Coal Co., 666 F.2d 806, 811 (3d Cir. 1981)\n\n(explaining that enforcement of a prior award requires a court to\n\nsay with \"positive assurance\" that the award was intended to cover\n\nthe new dispute); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int'l Union v. Ethyl\n\nCorp.,   644   F.2d   1044,   1050   (5th   Cir.   1981)    (delineating   a\n\nsubstantial similarity standard).\n\n           Mindful    of   this   well-manicured   legal    landscape,   our\n\nprimary task here is to determine whether the Stutz Award was\n\nintended to have a prospective effect, and if so, whether there is\n\nany colorable basis for denying its applicability to the new\n\nincidents.     We turn now to that task.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           To its credit, the MNA attempts to meet the Hospital's\n\nchallenge head-on.      It does not question the applicability of\n\nDerwin and Boston Shipping but, rather, contends that the current\n\ndispute qualifies for enforcement under our historic standard. Its\n\nthesis is that because the prior and current disputes share a\n\ncommon factual nucleus — all of them involve alleged violations of\n\nArticle 18.07 — there is no material factual difference and,\n\ntherefore, enforcement is appropriate. To justify this result, the\n\nMNA notes that the first page of the Stutz Award — the three-\n\nparagraph remedial order quoted above — contains no specific\n\nreference to Three North.       Building on that foundation, it argues\n\nthat the Stutz Award applies hospital-wide.         Its fallback position\n\nis that it should at least have been allowed to proceed in the\n\ndistrict court with the alleged violations that occurred on Three\n\nNorth.\n\n           The Hospital counters that context is crucial and that,\n\ntaking context into account, there is at least an arguable basis\n\nfor   rejecting   the   claim   that   the   new   dispute   is   materially\n\nindistinguishable from the old dispute (and, thus, for rejecting\n\nthe applicability of the Stutz Award).         In mounting this counter-\n\nargument, the Hospital goes beyond the remedial order and points to\n\nthe arbitrator's statement, in the body of the decision, that \"the\n\nmost important goal of remedy in this case is [to] assure that\n\nthere is no repetition of the circumstances that prevailed on at\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fleast       nine   occasions    in   May   and   June    2002   on    Three   North\"\n\n(emphasis supplied).           It also adverts to the arbitrator's singular\n\nfocus on Three North in his descriptions of staffing violations.\n\nFinally, it directs our attention to facts properly before us\n\nevidencing that it has made significant staffing changes, on Three\n\nNorth and elsewhere throughout the institution, since the emergence\n\nof the grievances that spawned the original arbitration.                          In\n\nconclusion,        the   Hospital     posits     that,    given      these    changed\n\ncircumstances, the new complaints cannot conceivably be thought to\n\nmimic the grievances that formed the basis for the Stutz Award.\n\n               The district court resolved the MNA's enforcement action\n\non a Rule 12(c) motion.           The guidelines applicable to judgment on\n\nthe pleadings require the court to accept all the well-pleaded\n\nfacts as true, draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nnonmovant (here, the MNA), and grant the motion only if it appears\n\nthat the nonmovant could prove no set of facts that would entitle\n\nit to relief.         See Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).         As the CBA, the Stutz Award, and four of the new\n\nincident reports were annexed to the pleadings,3 so the court could\n\nconsider them in conducting its tamisage.                 See Centro Medico del\n\nTurabo, Inc., v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n        3\n      While the remaining reports were not so annexed, the parties\nhave made persistent references to them during the course of this\nappeal.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f2005); In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n          In hewing to this protocol, the district court chose to\n\nlook beyond the isthmian confines of the remedial order to the body\n\nof the arbitrator's decision and the facts contained therein.     In\n\nthe end, it concluded that material factual differences marked the\n\ntwo disputes.   Accordingly, it granted the Hospital's motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings.\n\n          We review the district court's entry of judgment on the\n\npleadings de novo, subject to the same ground rules that were\n\napplicable in the lower court.    See Gulf Coast Bank & Trust Co. v.\n\nReder, 355 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 2004); Feliciano v. Rhode Island,\n\n160 F.3d 780, 788 (1st Cir. 1998).      Even when scrutinized through\n\nthe prism of this plaintiff-friendly standard of review, the MNA's\n\nargument falters.\n\n          To be sure, the MNA fulfills the first prong of the\n\nDerwin test: the Stutz Award plainly satisfies Derwin's requirement\n\nthat the original award be prospective. Indeed, the very nature of\n\ncease-and-desist orders is to provide prospective relief. See P.R.\n\nMar. Shipping Auth. v. Fed. Mar. Comm'n, 75 F.3d 63, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n          The MNA does less well with Derwin's second prong.       On\n\nits side of the decisional scales is the fact that here, unlike in\n\nDerwin, the complaint alleges specific new violations and does not\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fask us to place our imprimatur upon the earlier arbitral award in\n\na vacuum.    Yet the allegations of the complaint do not show, as\n\nDerwin demands, that it is \"beyond argument that there is no\n\nmaterial factual difference between the new dispute and the one\n\ndecided in the prior arbitration.\" Derwin, 719 F.2d at 491 (citing\n\nBoston Shipping, 659 F.2d at 4).\n\n            The Stutz Award is annexed to and therefore incorporated\n\nby reference in the complaint. Accordingly, the district court had\n\nthe obligation to go behind the bare bones of the remedial order\n\nand look at the whole of the Stutz Award.       See Boston Shipping, 659\n\nF.2d at 4 (relying upon supporting rationale of arbitrator in\n\naffirming enforcement of award).        Taking into account the tenor of\n\nthe arbitrator's decision and the available descriptions of the\n\nvarious incidents (new and old), it is perfectly plain that, even\n\nif all of the new disputes had taken place on Three North — and the\n\nbulk of them did not — that spatial coincidence, standing alone,\n\nwould be insufficient to show the requisite similitude.                   The\n\nadditional fact that all the complaints invoked Article 18.07 of\n\nthe CBA does not suffice to remedy this shortcoming.4              On these\n\nfacts, the intervening passage of time and the changed nature of\n\nhospital    staffing   patterns   and   practices   combine   to   form   an\n\n\n\n     4\n      It appears that at least one of the new complaints may not\nimplicate Article 18.07 at all. For our purposes, nothing turns on\nthis fact; accordingly we assume, favorably to the MNA, that all\nthe new complaints implicate Article 18.07.\n\n                                   -11-\n\finsurmountable barrier to the applicability of the earlier award.\n\nWe explain briefly.\n\n           The MNA's complaint makes no meaningful effort to show\n\nthe requisite similitude beyond the fact that several of the\n\nincidents transpired on Three North and came under the aegis of\n\nArticle 18.07.    Its argument does not fairly suggest identicality:\n\nas the Stutz Award and the incident reports reflect, staffing at\n\nthe Hospital — like hospital staffing generally — is not a matter\n\nof simple arithmetic. To the contrary, it requires a sophisticated\n\nalgorithm with many variables.\n\n           The   nature    of   this   complex   endeavor   is   such     that\n\nreasonable minds may differ as to the most salutary ratios in\n\nparticular circumstances.       See generally Julie Marie Bessette, An\n\nAnalysis   in    Support   of   Minimum    Nurse-to-Patient      Ratios    in\n\nMassachusetts, 9 Quinnipiac Health L.J. 173, 207 (2006) (noting the\n\nview that staffing involves \"much more than arbitrary numbers,\n\nincluding judgment and critical thinking by nurse administrators\n\nand consideration of the patient's needs\").         As documented in the\n\nStutz Award, staffing at the Hospital involves variables such as\n\npatient acuity and nurses' skill sets.       Common sense suggests that\n\na host of other variables (say, case mix, volume, availability of\n\npara-professional aides, overtime policies) will influence nurse-\n\nstaffing needs.    See generally Kyndaron Reinier et al., Measuring\n\nthe Nursing Workforce, 62 Med. Care Res. & Rev. 741, 743 (2005)\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f(listing numerous \"hospital-level factors\" that affect the need for\n\nnurses).      In   such   a   dynamic     environment,   it   is   surpassingly\n\ndifficult to imagine a situation in which no material factual\n\ndifferences would exist between staffing inadequacies arising in\n\n2002 and kindred incidents occurring nearly three years later.\n\n             The proof of the pudding can be found in the text of the\n\nStutz Award.       There, the arbitrator — conscious of the time lag\n\nbetween the occurrence of the underlying incidents and the date of\n\ndecision — acknowledged that the violations he had found might not\n\nbe ongoing.        He noted that, even then, the Hospital had begun\n\naddressing staffing concerns by raising patient care hours, adding\n\nnursing hours on Three North, and instituting a formal system for\n\nassessing patient acuity. These particular systemic changes, along\n\nwith   the   ordinary     changes    in   personnel   and   patient   mix   that\n\ninevitably occur over time in any acute-care hospital, present a\n\nmore than colorable basis for concluding that the original award,\n\nissued to remedy conditions existing in a particular area of the\n\nHospital three years earlier, rested on a factual predicate that is\n\n(or, at least, may be) materially different from the factual\n\npredicate underlying the MNA's latest litany of complaints.\n\n                                      III.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n             We need go no further. The upshot is that the district\n\ncourt did not err in refusing woodenly to apply and enforce the\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fprior arbitral award to the MNA's subsequent misgivings with the\n\nHospital.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\f",

This appeal requires us to mull\n\nthe circumstances in which a union, having successfully arbitrated\n\na grievance, may leverage the award to bypass procedures prescribed\n\nby a collective bargaining agreement and obtain direct federal\n\ncourt   relief    for   subsequent      episodes     of    alleged    employer\n\nmisconduct.     In the case at hand, the district court thwarted the\n\nunion's attempt to short-circuit the grievance process, finding too\n\ngreat   a   disparity   between   the      facts   underlying   the   initial\n\ncomplaints and those giving rise to the subsequent complaints.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n                               Background\n\n            North Adams Regional Hospital (the Hospital) employs\n\nnurses represented by the Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA).\n\nThis dispute arises out of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)\n\nbetween the two organizations.       Article 18.07 of the CBA contains\n\na   provision    entitled   \"Standards      of   Nursing   Practice,\"   which\n\nrequires the Hospital to \"only keep and admit the number of\n\npatients that registered nurses can safely care for\" and to \"take\n\nmeasures such as adding nurses [and] stopping admissions . . . to\n\nensure that this occurs.\" The CBA further provides a stereotypical\n\ngrievance procedure, culminating in binding arbitration, to resolve\n\ncovered disputes.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            In    2002,      nurses   employed     by    the    Hospital    filed\n\napproximately     nine      reports   alleging   inadequate      staffing   on   a\n\nparticular floor (Three North) in violation of Article 18.07.                 The\n\nMNA converted these complaints into formal grievances. Arbitration\n\nhearings took place in 2003 and 2004.             On February 21, 2005, the\n\narbitrator, Michael Stutz, found that the Hospital had transgressed\n\nthe CBA and issued a remedial order.             We need not recount all the\n\nparticulars      of   the     arbitrator's    entire      decision   and    order\n\n(collectively, the Stutz Award); for now, it suffices to repeat the\n\norder alone:\n\n            a) The Hospital shall cease and desist\n            violating Article 18.07 of the Agreement;\n\n            b) The Hospital shall pay the MNA an amount of\n            money equal to the pay of one RN for each of\n            the nine shifts grieved; and\n\n            c) The Hospital shall pay the RN's working the\n            nine shifts time and one half for those nine\n            shifts, i.e. the difference between time and\n            one half pay and what they actually were paid.\n\n            In the spring of 2005 — some three years after the events\n\nthat gave rise to the initial grievances — nurses at the Hospital\n\nreported what they believed to be additional violations of Article\n\n18.07.    While at least one of these reports dealt with an event on\n\nThree North, the vast majority of them involved events occurring in\n\nother    areas   of   the    Hospital.       Rather     than   converting   these\n\ncomplaints into one or more formal grievances, the MNA attempted a\n\nshort-cut; it filed a direct action in the federal district court,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fseeking enforcement of the cease-and-desist portion of the Stutz\n\nAward.1   That action rested on section 301 of the Labor-Management\n\nRelations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185, which authorizes federal district\n\ncourts to enforce collective bargaining pacts and, thus, to enforce\n\nlabor arbitration awards issued pursuant to such pacts.2                    See\n\nTextile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105511\"><a href=\"/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 451 (1957).               This\n\nmeans that where, as here, a collective bargaining agreement\n\ncontains an arbitration clause, an arbitral award is akin to a\n\ncontractual obligation that can be enforced through a civil action\n\nunder section 301.     See Local 2322, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v.\n\nVerizon New Engl., Inc., ___F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2006) [No. 06-\n\n1169, slip op. at 5].\n\n             The Hospital answered the complaint.           It then moved for\n\njudgment on the pleadings, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), arguing that\n\nthe   2005   reports   arose   out   of    a   variegated    set   of   factual\n\npredicates materially different from the factual predicate on which\n\nthe earlier grievances reposed and that, therefore, enforcement\n\nconstituted an inappropriate avenue for relief.              The MNA opposed\n\nthe motion.    By consent of the parties, the matter was entrusted to\n\na magistrate judge for decision.          See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c); Fed. R.\n\n\n      1\n      The MNA also sought to adjudge the Hospital in violation of\nanother portion of the Stutz Award.       That dispute has been\nresolved.\n      2\n      The parties speak, interchangeably, of both \"confirming\" and\n\"enforcing\" the Stutz Award. Because enforcement seems more apt in\nthe context of this case, we use that terminology.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fCiv. P. 73.    After a comprehensive analysis of the Stutz Award and\n\nthe   applicable   law,   the   judge      agreed     with      the   Hospital's\n\ncharacterization    and   allowed    the    motion.      This    timely   appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n                                Analysis\n\n            Both parties rely heavily on our prior pronouncements\n\nregarding the enforcement of arbitral awards.

In appropriate circumstances, a court may order\n\nthe   enforcement      of   a   prior    arbitration     award    as     a    means   of\n\nresolving a subsequent labor dispute.            See, e.g., Boston Shipping,\n\n659 F.2d at 4.\n\n           The trick, of course, is discerning what circumstances\n\nare   sufficient       to   warrant       bypassing     the   normal         grievance\n\nprocedures. Even though we enforced the original arbitral award in\n\nBoston Shipping, we made clear that this result was the exception\n\nrather than the rule; such an anodyne is available only if \"it is\n\nbeyond argument that there is no material factual difference\n\nbetween   the    new    dispute     and    the   one    decided     in       the   prior\n\narbitration.\" Id.

In the former case, the new dispute\n\nwas identical to the original dispute except for the intervening\n\nrenewal   of    the    collective       bargaining     agreement;      accordingly,\n\n                                          -6-\n\fenforcement was an available remedy.        Boston Shipping, 659 F.2d at\n\n4.   In the latter case, we refused to follow that course because\n\nthe union had failed to show a new and identical dispute.                See\n\nDerwin, 719 F.2d at 491 (warning that this court would not \"put its\n\nimprimatur upon an arbitral award in a vacuum\").              This cautious\n\napproach toward the hopscotch enforcement of arbitration awards\n\nvis-á-vis new grievances is solidly within the mainstream of labor\n\nlaw as elucidated by other courts of appeals.

We turn now to that task.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           To its credit, the MNA attempts to meet the Hospital's\n\nchallenge head-on.      It does not question the applicability of\n\nDerwin and Boston Shipping but, rather, contends that the current\n\ndispute qualifies for enforcement under our historic standard. Its\n\nthesis is that because the prior and current disputes share a\n\ncommon factual nucleus — all of them involve alleged violations of\n\nArticle 18.07 — there is no material factual difference and,\n\ntherefore, enforcement is appropriate. To justify this result, the\n\nMNA notes that the first page of the Stutz Award — the three-\n\nparagraph remedial order quoted above — contains no specific\n\nreference to Three North.       Building on that foundation, it argues\n\nthat the Stutz Award applies hospital-wide.         Its fallback position\n\nis that it should at least have been allowed to proceed in the\n\ndistrict court with the alleged violations that occurred on Three\n\nNorth.\n\n           The Hospital counters that context is crucial and that,\n\ntaking context into account, there is at least an arguable basis\n\nfor   rejecting   the   claim   that   the   new   dispute   is   materially\n\nindistinguishable from the old dispute (and, thus, for rejecting\n\nthe applicability of the Stutz Award).         In mounting this counter-\n\nargument, the Hospital goes beyond the remedial order and points to\n\nthe arbitrator's statement, in the body of the decision, that \"the\n\nmost important goal of remedy in this case is [to] assure that\n\nthere is no repetition of the circumstances that prevailed on at\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fleast       nine   occasions    in   May   and   June    2002   on    Three   North\"\n\n(emphasis supplied).           It also adverts to the arbitrator's singular\n\nfocus on Three North in his descriptions of staffing violations.\n\nFinally, it directs our attention to facts properly before us\n\nevidencing that it has made significant staffing changes, on Three\n\nNorth and elsewhere throughout the institution, since the emergence\n\nof the grievances that spawned the original arbitration.                          In\n\nconclusion,        the   Hospital     posits     that,    given      these    changed\n\ncircumstances, the new complaints cannot conceivably be thought to\n\nmimic the grievances that formed the basis for the Stutz Award.\n\n               The district court resolved the MNA's enforcement action\n\non a Rule 12(c) motion.           The guidelines applicable to judgment on\n\nthe pleadings require the court to accept all the well-pleaded\n\nfacts as true, draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nnonmovant (here, the MNA), and grant the motion only if it appears\n\nthat the nonmovant could prove no set of facts that would entitle\n\nit to relief.

Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196558\"><a href=\"/opinion/196558/puerto-rico-maritime-v-federal-maritime-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n          The MNA does less well with Derwin's second prong.       On\n\nits side of the decisional scales is the fact that here, unlike in\n\nDerwin, the complaint alleges specific new violations and does not\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fask us to place our imprimatur upon the earlier arbitral award in\n\na vacuum.    Yet the allegations of the complaint do not show, as\n\nDerwin demands, that it is \"beyond argument that there is no\n\nmaterial factual difference between the new dispute and the one\n\ndecided in the prior arbitration.\" Derwin, 719 F.2d at 491 (citing\n\nBoston Shipping, 659 F.2d at 4).\n\n            The Stutz Award is annexed to and therefore incorporated\n\nby reference in the complaint. Accordingly, the district court had\n\nthe obligation to go behind the bare bones of the remedial order\n\nand look at the whole of the Stutz Award.       See Boston Shipping, 659\n\nF.2d at 4 (relying upon supporting rationale of arbitrator in\n\naffirming enforcement of award).        Taking into account the tenor of\n\nthe arbitrator's decision and the available descriptions of the\n\nvarious incidents (new and old), it is perfectly plain that, even\n\nif all of the new disputes had taken place on Three North — and the\n\nbulk of them did not — that spatial coincidence, standing alone,\n\nwould be insufficient to show the requisite similitude.                   The\n\nadditional fact that all the complaints invoked Article 18.07 of\n\nthe CBA does not suffice to remedy this shortcoming.4              On these\n\nfacts, the intervening passage of time and the changed nature of\n\nhospital    staffing   patterns   and   practices   combine   to   form   an\n\n\n\n     4\n      It appears that at least one of the new complaints may not\nimplicate Article 18.07 at all. For our purposes, nothing turns on\nthis fact; accordingly we assume, favorably to the MNA, that all\nthe new complaints implicate Article 18.07.\n\n                                   -11-\n\finsurmountable barrier to the applicability of the earlier award.\n\nWe explain briefly.\n\n           The MNA's complaint makes no meaningful effort to show\n\nthe requisite similitude beyond the fact that several of the\n\nincidents transpired on Three North and came under the aegis of\n\nArticle 18.07.    Its argument does not fairly suggest identicality:\n\nas the Stutz Award and the incident reports reflect, staffing at\n\nthe Hospital — like hospital staffing generally — is not a matter\n\nof simple arithmetic. To the contrary, it requires a sophisticated\n\nalgorithm with many variables.\n\n           The   nature    of   this   complex   endeavor   is   such     that\n\nreasonable minds may differ as to the most salutary ratios in\n\nparticular circumstances.       See generally Julie Marie Bessette, An\n\nAnalysis   in    Support   of   Minimum    Nurse-to-Patient      Ratios    in\n\nMassachusetts, 9 Quinnipiac Health L.J. 173, 207 (2006) (noting the\n\nview that staffing involves \"much more than arbitrary numbers,\n\nincluding judgment and critical thinking by nurse administrators\n\nand consideration of the patient's needs\").         As documented in the\n\nStutz Award, staffing at the Hospital involves variables such as\n\npatient acuity and nurses' skill sets.       Common sense suggests that\n\na host of other variables (say, case mix, volume, availability of\n\npara-professional aides, overtime policies) will influence nurse-\n\nstaffing needs.    See generally Kyndaron Reinier et al., Measuring\n\nthe Nursing Workforce, 62 Med. Care Res. & Rev. 741, 743 (2005)\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f(listing numerous \"hospital-level factors\" that affect the need for\n\nnurses).      In   such   a   dynamic     environment,   it   is   surpassingly\n\ndifficult to imagine a situation in which no material factual\n\ndifferences would exist between staffing inadequacies arising in\n\n2002 and kindred incidents occurring nearly three years later.\n\n             The proof of the pudding can be found in the text of the\n\nStutz Award.       There, the arbitrator — conscious of the time lag\n\nbetween the occurrence of the underlying incidents and the date of\n\ndecision — acknowledged that the violations he had found might not\n\nbe ongoing.        He noted that, even then, the Hospital had begun\n\naddressing staffing concerns by raising patient care hours, adding\n\nnursing hours on Three North, and instituting a formal system for\n\nassessing patient acuity. These particular systemic changes, along\n\nwith   the   ordinary     changes    in   personnel   and   patient   mix   that\n\ninevitably occur over time in any acute-care hospital, present a\n\nmore than colorable basis for concluding that the original award,\n\nissued to remedy conditions existing in a particular area of the\n\nHospital three years earlier, rested on a factual predicate that is\n\n(or, at least, may be) materially different from the factual\n\npredicate underlying the MNA's latest litany of complaints.\n\n                                      III.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n             We need go no further. The upshot is that the district\n\ncourt did not err in refusing woodenly to apply and enforce the\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fprior arbitral award to the MNA's subsequent misgivings with the\n\nHospital.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\f</pre>",
