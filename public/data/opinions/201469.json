Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                       Howard, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Santiago R. Palmer on brief for appellee Instituto de\nEducacion Universal, Inc.\n     Angel Ruiz Rivera on brief pro se.\n     Pedro R. Pierluisi and O'Neill & Borges on brief for appellee\nStudent Loan Marketing Association.\n     Jose G. Fagot Diaz on brief for appellee Great Lakes Higher\nEducation Guaranty Corporation.\n\n\n\n                                March 3, 2005\n\f            Per   Curiam.   Appellants   Instituto   de   Educacion\n\nUniversal Corp. (IEU) and Angel Ruiz-Rivera appeal from the\n\ndecisions of the district court (1) granting the motion for\n\nsummary judgment filed by Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty\n\nCorp. (Great Lakes) and (2) granting the motion to dismiss\n\nfiled by the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae).\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the parties' briefs and the record,\n\nwe affirm the judgments of the district court for essentially\n\nthe reasons stated in that court's Opinion and Order, dated\n\nAugust 28, 2001 (docket # 99), and the Opinion and Order, dated\n\nSeptember 28, 2001 (docket # 108).       We add only the following\n\ncomments.\n\n            1. Ruiz-Rivera. In regard to Ruiz-Rivera, he failed\n\nto file an opposition to Sallie Mae's motion to dismiss, and he\n\nignored the district court's order to show cause concerning\n\nthis default.     The district court therefore dismissed Ruiz-\n\nRivera's claims against Sallie Mae and denied Ruiz-Rivera's\n\nmotion for reconsideration.      Given that the court had warned\n\nRuiz-Rivera that dismissal was a possible sanction, we can see\n\nno abuse of discretion here.     See HMG Property Investors, Inc.\n\nv. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 918 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (\"the law is well established in this circuit that where\n\na noncompliant litigant has manifested a disregard for orders\n\nof the court and been suitably forewarned of the consequences\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fof continued intransigence, a trial judge need not first\n\nexhaust milder sanctions before resorting to dismissal\").\n\n           Ruiz-Rivera similarly neglected to file an opposition\n\nto the motion of Great Lakes for summary judgment.            He also has\n\nfailed to offer any arguments in his opening brief on appeal\n\nconcerning why summary judgment against him should not have\n\nbeen granted.     Ruiz-Rivera therefore has forfeited his claims\n\nagainst Great Lakes.        See Andresen v. Diorio, 349 F.3d 8, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (arguments presented for the first time in a\n\nparty's reply brief have been forfeited).\n\n           2.     IEU.    IEU has decided to forego any appellate\n\nargument concerning the district court's determination that\n\nSallie    Mae's   stop     payment    order   was   not   a   defamatory\n\ncommunication regarding IEU's eligibility to participate in the\n\nstudent loan programs.       As a result, we will not consider the\n\ndefamation issue.        This leaves IEU's negligence and contract\n\nclaims.\n\n           As for the negligence claim, the only reference to\n\nSallie Mae in IEU's amended complaint is that Sallie Mae had\n\nacted in concert with Great Lakes to place the stop payment\n\norders and that Sallie Mae therefore was responsible for the\n\nresulting damages.         In regard to the contract claim, the\n\namended complaint does not refer to the existence of any\n\ncontract to which Sallie Mae was a party, and the opposition to\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe motion to dismiss stated only that Sallie Mae was liable\n\nfor breach of contract.\n\n             Based on the foregoing, it is plain that IEU simply\n\nhas failed to point to any \"well-pleaded factual allegations\"\n\n--   other   than   the    existence     of   the    stop     payment   orders\n\nthemselves -- in support of the argument that Sallie Mae's\n\nactions in this regard were negligent or in breach of any\n\ncontract.    Citibank v. Grupo Cupey, Inc., 382 F.3d 29, 31 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (in reviewing a district court's grant of a motion\n\nto   dismiss,    this     court   need    only      \"accept    as    true   the\n\nwell-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint\").                    Rather,\n\nIEU has only put forth \"bald assertions [and] unsupportable\n\nconclusions\" concerning Sallie Mae's liability.                      See In re\n\nColonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (\"[w]e are not bound . . . to credit bald assertions,\n\nunsupportable conclusions, and opprobrious epithets woven into\n\nthe fabric of the complaint\") (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted). The district court therefore did not err in\n\ndismissing IEU's claims against Sallie Mae.\n\n             This leaves IEU's claims against Great Lakes.                   As\n\nwith Sallie Mae, IEU states, on appeal, that it will not\n\naddress its defamation claim against Great Lakes.                   Thus, there\n\nare no arguments concerning this claim in IEU's opening brief.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fThe issue, then, has been forfeited. See Andresen, 349 F.3d at\n\n13.\n\n           IEU also has forfeited its contract claim against\n\nGreat Lakes by failing to raise the claim in its opposition to\n\nthe summary judgment motion.            See Landrau-Romero v. Banco\n\nPopular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(where appellant failed to raise an argument in his opposition\n\nto the appellee's motion for summary judgment, the issue has\n\nbeen waived).      In any event, IEU does not make any developed\n\narguments in its opening brief in regard to the contract claim.\n\nIndeed, aside from a quote from a case concerning the general\n\nobligations of contracting parties, IEU states only (1) that\n\nthe   relationship    between    Sallie   Mae    and    Great   Lakes   is\n\ncontractual and (2) that Great Lakes has a contract with DOE.\n\nAs we have held, \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are\n\ndeemed waived.\"     United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n           IEU's     arguments   regarding      its    negligence   claim\n\nagainst Great Lakes, while more developed, nonetheless fail to\n\npersuade us that summary judgment was in error.                 IEU first\n\ncontends that, although the Department of Education (DOE) had\n\nfaxed to Great Lakes a memorandum, dated February 19, 1997,\n\nstating that IEU was ineligible to participate in the federal\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fstudent   loan   programs,   Great   Lakes's   reliance   on   this\n\nmemorandum was negligent.     In particular, IEU contends that\n\nGreat Lakes should have known, from the cover sheet to the fax,\n\nthat since IEU was appealing the administrative law judge's\n\n(ALJ) decision so finding, IEU remained an eligible institution\n\npending this appeal.    Second, IEU contends that Great Lakes\n\nnegligently ignored the information, provided to it by IEU's\n\nDirector of Financial Aid, Ms. Gloria M. Oyola, that, despite\n\nthe ALJ's decision, IEU still was eligible.\n\n          The actual facts, as presented by IEU, do not support\n\neither of these arguments. First, Ms. Oyola, in her affidavit,\n\ndoes not state that, after February 19, 1997, she informed\n\nGreat Lakes that IEU remained eligible to participate in the\n\nstudent loan program.    Rather, Ms. Oyola avers that she told\n\nGreat Lakes that IEU was still operating its college division.\n\nAffidavit, ¶ 12.   Given that Great Lakes already had received\n\nthe February 19, 1997 memorandum from DOE stating that IEU was\n\nineligible, Ms. Oyola's statement did not necessarily negate\n\nanything in the memorandum.    That is, the college division may\n\nstill have been functioning, even though IEU's ability to\n\naccept students with federal loans had been terminated.\n\n          Similarly, the fax cover sheet to DOE's February 19,\n\n1997 memorandum does not indicate, as IEU represents, that the\n\nALJ's decision was, in fact, being appealed. Rather, the cover\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fsheet, which is a transmittal form, just stated that the\n\nparties were planning to appeal.   Significantly, the form did\n\nnot state that IEU had appealed, and IEU does not aver that it\n\never informed Great Lakes when the appeal actually was filed.\n\nGiven this, and given the unequivocal declaration in the\n\nFebruary 19, 1997 memorandum that DOE had terminated IEU's\n\nstudent loan eligibility, Great Lakes was entitled to summary\n\njudgment on IEU's negligence claim.\n\n          Summarily Affirmed.   See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                             -7-\n\f",
