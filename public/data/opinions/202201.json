This is an appeal from the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of a law suit brought on behalf of technicians\n\nworking for the Property Registry of Puerto Rico.        The Property\n\nRegistry is attached to the Puerto Rico Department of Justice (\"the\n\nDepartment\"), and the defendants in the law suit were officials of\n\nthe Department.     The pertinent events can be quickly summarized.\n\n          In 2000, the Puerto Rico legislature passed Law No. 363\n\n(\"Law 363\"), giving the technicians a 100 percent salary increase\n\neffective July 1, 2001.     The governor sought repeal, and on June\n\n25, 2001, as the governor's request was being debated, some 300 of\n\nthe technicians went to the legislature to lobby against repeal.\n\nThe technicians claim to have filed leave forms, charging time off\n\nas vacation or other permitted leave, but after the repeal effort\n\nwas defeated, disciplinary action was taken.\n\n          Eventually, 47 technicians were docked one day of pay and\n\nsuspended for three days (and an additional number of technicians\n\nwere threatened with the same sanctions) after the Department\n\ndetermined that they did not have proper authorization to support\n\ntheir absences.     The plaintiffs--an association of technicians and\n\ntwo of its officers--brought suit against a number of officials of\n\nthe   Department,    claiming   retaliation   in   violation   of   the\n\ntechnicians' first amendment and due process rights relating both\n\nto the discipline and a separate claim of withheld benefits (yet to\n\nbe described).\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           Cross-motions were filed and referred to a magistrate\n\njudge, who recommended that a defense motion for summary judgment\n\non the disciplinary claims be granted in part and denied in part.\n\nAs to the separate claim for withheld benefits, the magistrate\n\njudge   construed   this    as   one    made    under    Puerto    Rico    law--\n\nspecifically, Law 363 itself--and recommended that the claim be\n\ndismissed as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.            Both sides sought\n\nreview of the magistrate judge's report and recommendation.\n\n           Then, in August 2002, the Department sent a letter to the\n\naffected technicians, notifying them that all existing and proposed\n\ndisciplinary    sanctions     would      be    lifted.      The        Department\n\nnevertheless asserted that the technicians had acted improperly and\n\nsaid that it retained authority to sanction anyone who took leave\n\nwithout proper authorization.         The 47 technicians who had already\n\nbeen disciplined appear to have been repaid any docked wages, while\n\nthose technicians threatened with disciplinary action were informed\n\nthat no sanctions would be imposed.\n\n           After additional briefing, the district court dismissed\n\nthe main claims on grounds of mootness, Mendez Soto v. Rodriguez,\n\n306 F. Supp. 2d 120, 125 (D.P.R. 2004) (\"Mendez-Soto I\"), and\n\ndenied reconsideration, 334 F. Supp. 2d 62, 72 (D.P.R. 2004)\n\n(\"Mendez-Soto II\"). As to what it understood as the separate claim\n\nfor withheld benefits under Puerto Rico law, the district court\n\ndeclined   to   exercise    supplemental       jurisdiction,      28    U.S.C.   §\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f1367(c)(3) (2000).      Mendez-Soto I, 306 F. Supp. 2d at 125.                  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n           On appeal, the technicians say that the case was not\n\nmoot, a claim we review de novo.              Ramírez v. Sanchez Ramos, 438\n\nF.3d 92, 96-97 (1st Cir. 2006).           Their main argument is that the\n\nDepartment's conduct may be expected to recur; the technicians\n\npoint out that the Department continues to defend its conduct and\n\nits authority to discipline for unauthorized absences.\n\n           Because    the     alleged    mootness      was   brought     about      by\n\nvoluntary action of the Department, it has the \"formidable\" burden\n\nto show that the challenged conduct \"could not reasonably be\n\nexpected to recur.\"     Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.\n\nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 190 (2000); Adams v. Bowater\n\nInc., 313 F.3d 611, 613 (1st Cir. 2002).              The circumstances of the\n\nmass   lobbying     effort,    however,       are    peculiar,   and     a    direct\n\nrepetition of these events is hardly to be expected.\n\n           A principal reason for deciding a case where compensation\n\nand coercive remedies (that is, damages and injunctive relief) have\n\nno role is to provide guidance for the future.               See Step-Saver Data\n\nSys., Inc. v. Wyse Tech., 912 F.2d 643, 649 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"The\n\nidea behind the [Declaratory Judgment] Act was to clarify legal\n\nrelationships so that plaintiffs (and possibly defendants) could\n\nmake responsible decisions about the future.”). That discipline or\n\nretaliation   may    occur    in   different        circumstances   is       thus   no\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fargument against mootness.       Furthermore, even if the case were not\n\nmoot, affording purely declaratory relief would still be a matter\n\nof equitable discretion.         Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. R.I. Pub.\n\nTransit Auth., 233 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Conservation Law Foundation v. Evans, 360 F.3d 21 (1st\n\nCir.   2004),    relied   upon     by        the    technicians,      is    easily\n\ndistinguished.    There, a rule promulgated by the use of a disputed\n\nprocedure expired and was re-promulgated through different means.\n\nId. at 23-24, 26.    However, the agency continued to maintain that\n\nthe disputed procedure was valid, creating a reasonable likelihood\n\nof recurrence.      Id. at 26-27.            The agency's use of the same\n\nprocedure in the future, which was fairly predictable, would bring\n\nup the identical question, whereas the peculiar circumstances here\n\nare unlikely to recur.\n\n            The technicians also say in passing that their harms were\n\nnot sufficiently compensated by repayment of any lost wages, but\n\nthey never seriously develop such an argument, and it is thus\n\nforfeit.    Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142\n\nF.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).          We add that the suggestion of non-\n\nmonetary loss--emotional damages–-is unimpressive in the context of\n\nan economic or labor dispute, although in some contexts such\n\ndamages may be recoverable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                 Chemerinsky,\n\nFederal    Jurisdiction   §   8.11,     at    580   &   n.14   (4th   ed.   2003)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            A    variant,     which    might   have   served    the    technicians\n\nbetter, would have been to argue that a claim for punitive damages\n\nremained alive, but no such claim is pressed on the appeal.                     Once\n\nagain, the claim is hardly promising: the Department offered\n\ninformal    hearings     before    disciplinary       action   was    imposed    and\n\ndistinguished between those who it thought had authorization for\n\ntheir absence and those who did not.                  This would hardly be a\n\nstraightforward case for punitive damages.\n\n            The more interesting question on this appeal concerns the\n\nsecondary       claim   for    withheld    benefits.          According   to     the\n\ntechnicians, Law 363 assigned $10.6 million to the Department to be\n\ndisbursed to the technicians in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 (with\n\nthe fiscal year running from July 1 onward); the technicians allege\n\nthat starting in August 2001, the Department disbursed only $5\n\nmillion of this allocation in these years, withholding potential\n\nextra payments such as bonuses, differentials, and merit increases.\n\n            Thereafter,       on   October     17,    2002,    the    Puerto    Rico\n\nlegislature reassigned to other uses the surplus Law 363 funds from\n\nfiscal years 2001 and 2002.           It thus appears that the Department no\n\nlonger has the funds originally available to pay for bonuses and\n\nother extra-base salary payments.              The technicians say that the\n\noriginal failure to pay was itself retaliation by the Department\n\nwarranting damages from the individual defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f               This claim does not appear to be moot, but the attempt to\n\nassert it as a federal claim comes too late in the day.                       Fairly\n\nread, the technicians' complaint put forward the claim based on the\n\nwithholding of benefits as one invoking the district court's\n\n\"supplemental jurisdiction\"--that is, one arising under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.1       The district court, in its original decision dismissing the\n\nmain retaliation claims as moot, declined to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction.       Mendez-Soto I, 306 F. Supp. 2d at 125.\n\n               On reconsideration in the district court, the technicians\n\nreferred to the legislative repeal, but the district court appeared\n\nto   regard      this   as    a    separate      attack   on    the    legislature's\n\nreassignment of funds, over which the defendants had no control.\n\nMendez-Soto       II,   334   F.   Supp.    2d    at   68-69.     On    appeal,    the\n\ntechnicians offer little more than a cursory response to this\n\ncharacterization,        along     with    an    opaque   passage      referring   us\n\n(unhelpfully) to Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).\n\n               Whatever interesting questions would be raised by a\n\nfederal claim based on the withheld benefits, the technicians\n\ncannot now convert their original withheld benefits claim under\n\nPuerto Rico law into an independent federal claim under the first\n\n\n\n        1\n      The magistrate judge found: \"A review of both plaintiffs'\ncomplaint and amended complaint indicates that the claim for merit,\nseniority, bonuses and other benefits as a salary increase is a\nclaim against state officials brought under state law.        It is\nbrought under Law 363. The amended complaint cannot be clearer in\nrequesting the exercise of pendent jurisdiction over that claim.\"\n\n                                           -8-\n\famendment.   The magistrate judge and the district judge both\n\nreasonably construed the complaint as asserting a claim under\n\nPuerto Rico law, which was then properly dismissed when the main\n\nfederal claim became moot.   28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

According to the technicians, Law 363 assigned $10.6 million to the Department to be disbursed to the technicians in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 (with the fiscal year running from July 1 onward); the technicians allege that starting in August 2001, the Department disbursed only $5 million of this allocation in these years, withholding potential extra payments such as bonuses, differentials, and merit increases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on October 17, 2002, the Puerto Rico legislature reassigned to other uses the surplus Law 363 funds from fiscal years 2001 and 2002. It thus appears that the Department no longer has the funds originally available to pay for bonuses and other extra-base salary payments. The technicians say that the original failure to pay was itself retaliation by the Department warranting damages from the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim does not appear to be moot, but the attempt to assert it as a <i>federal</i> claim comes too late in the day. Fairly read, the technicians' complaint put forward the claim based on the withholding of benefits as one invoking the district court's \"supplemental jurisdiction\"&#8212;that is, one arising under Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court, in its original decision dismissing the main retaliation claims as moot, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. <i>Mendez-Soto I,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 125.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On reconsideration in the district court, the technicians referred to the legislative repeal, but the district court appeared to regard this as a separate attack on the legislature's reassignment of funds, over which the defendants had no control. <i>Mendez-Soto II,</i> 334 F.Supp.2d at 68-69. On appeal, the technicians offer little more than a cursory response to this characterization, along with an opaque passage referring us (unhelpfully) to <i>Ex Parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever interesting questions would be raised by a federal claim based on the withheld benefits, the technicians cannot now convert their original withheld benefits claim under Puerto Rico law into an independent federal claim under the first amendment. The magistrate judge and the district judge both reasonably construed the complaint as asserting a claim under Puerto Rico law, which was then properly dismissed when the main federal claim became moot. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The magistrate judge found: \"A review of both plaintiffs' complaint and amended complaint indicates that the claim for merit, seniority, bonuses and other benefits as a salary increase is a claim against state officials brought under state law.

The Property Registry is attached to the Puerto Rico Department of Justice (\"the Department\"), and the defendants in the law suit were officials of the Department. The pertinent events can be quickly summarized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, the Puerto Rico legislature passed Law No. 363 (\"Law 363\"), giving the technicians a 100 percent salary increase effective July 1, 2001. The governor sought repeal, and on June 25, 2001, as the governor's request was being debated, some 300 of the technicians went to the legislature to lobby against repeal. The technicians claim to have filed leave forms, charging time off as vacation or other permitted leave, but after the repeal effort was defeated, disciplinary action was taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, 47 technicians were docked one day of pay and suspended for three days (and an additional number of technicians were threatened with the same sanctions) after the Department determined that they did not have proper authorization to support their absences. The plaintiffs &#8212;an association of technicians and two of its officers&#8212;brought suit against a number of officials of the Department, claiming retaliation in violation of the technicians' first amendment and due process rights relating both to the discipline and a separate claim of withheld benefits (yet to be described).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cross-motions were filed and referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that a defense motion for summary judgment on the disciplinary claims be granted in part and denied in part. As to the separate claim for withheld benefits, the magistrate judge construed this as one made under Puerto Rico law&#8212;specifically, Law 363 itself&#8212;and recommended that the claim be dismissed as barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Both sides sought review of the magistrate judge's report and recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, in August 2002, the Department sent a letter to the affected technicians, notifying them that all existing and proposed disciplinary sanctions would be lifted. The Department nevertheless asserted that the technicians had acted improperly and said that it retained authority to sanction anyone who took leave without proper authorization. The 47 technicians who had already been disciplined appear to have been repaid any docked wages, while those technicians threatened with disciplinary action were informed that no sanctions would be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After additional briefing, the district court dismissed the main claims on grounds of mootness, <i>Mendez Soto v.

As to what it understood as the separate claim for withheld benefits under Puerto Rico law, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3) (2000). <i>Mendez-Soto I,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 125.

Their main argument is that the Department's conduct may be expected to recur; the technicians point out that the Department continues to defend its conduct and its authority to discipline for unauthorized absences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the alleged mootness was brought about by voluntary action of the Department, it has the \"formidable\" burden to show that the challenged conduct \"could not reasonably be expected to recur.\" <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

The circumstances of the mass lobbying effort, however, are peculiar, and a direct repetition of these events is hardly to be expected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A principal reason for deciding a case where compensation and coercive remedies (that is, damages and injunctive relief) have no role is to provide guidance for the future. <i>See Step-Saver Data Sys., Inc. v. Wyse Tech.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547215\"><a href=\"/opinion/547215/step-saver-data-systems-inc-v-wyse-technology-the-software-link-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span>, 649 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"The idea behind the [Declaratory Judgment] Act was to clarify legal relationships so that plaintiffs (and possibly defendants) could make responsible decisions about the future.\"). That discipline or retaliation may occur in <i>different</i> circumstances is thus no argument against mootness. Furthermore, even if the case were not moot, affording purely declaratory relief would still be a matter of equitable discretion. <i>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. R.I. Pub. Transit Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199171\"><a href=\"/opinion/199171/hartford-fire-v-ri-public-transit/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Conservation Law Foundation v.

There, a rule promulgated by the use of a disputed procedure expired and was re-promulgated through different means. <i>Id.</i> at 23-24, 26. However, the agency continued to maintain that the disputed procedure was valid, creating a reasonable likelihood of recurrence. <i>Id.</i> at 26-27. The agency's use of the same procedure in the future, which was fairly predictable, would bring up the identical question, whereas the peculiar circumstances here are unlikely to recur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The technicians also say in passing that their harms were not sufficiently compensated by repayment of any lost wages, but they never seriously develop such an argument, and it is thus forfeit. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1998). We add that the suggestion of non-monetary loss&#8212;emotional damages&#8212;is unimpressive in the context of an economic or labor dispute, although in some contexts such damages may be recoverable under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> &#167; 8.11, at 580 &amp; n. 14 (4th ed.2003) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variant, which might have served the technicians better, would have been to argue that a claim for punitive damages remained alive, but no such claim is pressed on the appeal. Once again, the claim is hardly promising: the Department offered informal hearings before disciplinary action was imposed and distinguished between those who it thought had authorization for their absence and those who did not. This would hardly be a straightforward case for punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more interesting question on this appeal concerns the secondary claim for withheld benefits.
