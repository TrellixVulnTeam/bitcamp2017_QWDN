This immigration case presents\n\nlegal issues overlapping with those resolved by Succar v. Ashcroft,\n\nNo. 03-2445, released this same day.           The petitioner is the wife of\n\nan American citizen and is also an arriving alien who was paroled\n\nand then placed in removal proceedings.              Pursuant to a regulation,\n\n8   C.F.R.   §    1245.1(c)(8),      saying    arriving     aliens   in     removal\n\nproceedings could not apply for adjustment of status, she was\n\ndenied an opportunity (in her case, a second opportunity) to apply\n\nfor adjustment of status.\n\n             Succar held 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(c)(8)1 to be invalid as\n\ninconsistent with the relevant statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, to the\n\nextent    that    the   regulation    barred    paroled     aliens    in    removal\n\nproceedings from applying for adjustment of status.                  Succar held\n\nthat the Attorney General's discretion as to whether to grant\n\nadjustment       of   status   did   not   include    the   power    to    redefine\n\neligibility to apply for adjustment of status for paroled aliens\n\nwho were statutorily granted eligibility pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1255(a).     We now remand this case to the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) for consideration in light of our holding in Succar.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(c)(8) is identical to 8 C.F.R. §\n245.1(c)(8), which is the provision cited in the parties' briefs.\n§ 245.1(c)(8) applies to the immigration agencies in the Department\nof Homeland Security.    § 1245.1(c)(8) applies to the Executive\nOffice for Immigration Review in the Department of Justice, which\nincludes the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration\nAppeals.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f                                I.\n\n          Santa Rodriguez de Rivera, a native and citizen of the\n\nDominican Republic, entered the United States without inspection in\n\n1990 and lived here illegally. She married a United States citizen\n\nin 1993 and first applied for adjustment of status, with the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Services's (INS)2 District Director,\n\non September 26, 1996, after her husband had filed an I-130\n\nPetition for Alien Relative that had been approved by the INS.\n\nRivera was eligible to apply for adjustment of status under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(i) (the Life Act amendments).\n\n          While the decision on her 1996 application for adjustment\n\nof status was pending, Rivera left the United States to travel to\n\nthe Dominican Republic.   She claims that she was granted advance\n\nparole by the INS before leaving, but the government denies this;\n\nshe has, at any rate, not produced evidence of the advance parole.3\n\n\n     2\n      In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security and reorganized\ninto the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We refer\nto the immigration agency throughout as the INS. Mukamusoni v.\nAshcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 113 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n     3\n      Advance parole is pre-authorization to enter the country. See\n8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f). It can be granted, as here, to an alien who\nis currently in the United States, but who wants assurance that,\nwhen she leaves the country, she will be able to return. Samirah\nv. O'Connell, 335 F.3d 545, 548 (7th Cir. 2003).\n     At oral argument, Rivera produced an INS processing sheet\nwritten up before she left the country (dated January 2, 1997),\nduring an interview dealing with her first adjustment of status\napplication. This sheet had a notation stating: \"I-512 -- warned.\"\nI-512 is the advance parole form.      8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f).      In\nresponse to a request from this court, the government produced a\n\n                               -3-\n\fRivera returned to the United States on January 17, 1998, via New\n\nYork City, and was paroled at that time for deferred inspection in\n\nBoston on February 26, 1998.          Rivera reported for inspection in\n\nBoston on February 26 and on March 12, 1998, but no inspector was\n\navailable on either date.        Finally, she was inspected and paroled\n\non April 10, 1998.        Her parole at that time had an indefinite\n\nexpiration    and   was   for   the   purposes   of   pursuing   her   initial\n\nadjustment of status application.\n\n            Her first adjustment of status application -- the one\n\nfiled prior to her departure and reentry -- was denied on October\n\n23, 2000.     The INS District Director cited \"lack of prosecution\n\n(abandonment)\" as the reason, elaborating that two forms had been\n\nsent to Rivera after her adjustment interview and that she had not\n\nresponded to these forms with \"extensive, material documentation.\"\n\nIncomplete responses were sent on the first form, and nothing at\n\nall on the second. Nonetheless, the notice denying her application\n\nconcluded that \"[Rivera] may renew [her] application for status as\n\na permanent resident in any deportation proceeding.\"\n\n             On the same date as the issuance of the denial of her\n\nadjustment of status application, the INS sent Rivera a Notice to\n\n\n\nsworn affidavit from the interviewer who wrote the notation. He\nstated that the notation merely reflected his standard practice of\nwarning Rivera that she could not leave the country while her\nadjustment of status application was pending without receiving\nadvance parole and that there was no evidence in the administrative\nfile that Rivera ever asked for or received advance parole.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fAppear ordering her to appear at removal proceedings in front of an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) in Boston.           The Notice charged her as\n\nsubject to removal.    It said nothing about her parole status.\n\n            In removal proceedings before the IJ, Rivera moved to\n\nterminate,     administratively    close,    or   continue      the   removal\n\nproceedings so that she could again apply for adjustment of status\n\nbefore the District Director.      She also sought to have the IJ hear\n\nher   adjustment   application    during    the   course   of   the   removal\n\nproceedings.     All of these motions were denied by the IJ in his\n\noral decision of June 18, 2002.          The IJ noted that she \"has no\n\njurisdiction to hear the adjustment case\" because Rivera \"is an\n\narriving alien.\"    8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(c)(8).       The IJ also refused to\n\nterminate the case, given that the INS opposed the motion.             Rivera\n\nalso contested removability, but the IJ found that removability was\n\nproven by clear and convincing evidence and ordered Rivera removed\n\nto the Dominican Republic. The IJ concluded that Rivera would have\n\nto apply for a permanent resident visa from abroad rather than\n\nadjust her status from inside the United States.4\n\n             Rivera filed a timely appeal with the BIA on July 11,\n\n2002.     The BIA affirmed all rulings.       The BIA held that the IJ\n\n\n      4\n     Rivera points out that if she were forced to leave the country\nand apply for a permanent resident visa from abroad, she would be\nbarred from reentering the United States for ten years because she\nhad accrued more than one year of unlawful presence in the United\nStates. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). Waiver of this bar is in the\nabsolute discretion of the Attorney General.           8 U.S.C. §\n1182(a)(9)(B)(v).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fcorrectly determined that Rivera was an arriving alien and that by\n\nregulation, arriving aliens in removal proceedings are ineligible\n\nto apply for adjustment of status anywhere.       The BIA cited 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1245.1(c)(8), the exact regulation invalidated by this court in\n\nSuccar.   The BIA also noted that the \"narrow exception\" from §\n\n1245.1(c)(8) for some arriving aliens who received advance parole\n\nwas inapplicable because Rivera \"has not offered any evidence\" that\n\nshe received advance parole before leaving the United States and\n\ntraveling to the Dominican Republic.       Finally, the BIA noted that\n\nthe IJ correctly refused to terminate or administratively close the\n\nremoval   proceedings   because   \"once   the   [agency]   has   initiated\n\nremoval proceedings, neither we nor the [IJ] has the authority to\n\nterminate proceedings unless the [agency] fails to establish that\n\nthe alien is removable as charged.\"5\n\n           Rivera timely appealed the BIA's decision to this court.\n\nShe does not contest removability, but only appeals the BIA's\n\ndetermination that the IJ could not hear Rivera's application for\n\n\n\n     5\n      The BIA also cited In re Castro-Padron, 21 I&N Dec. 379, 380\n(BIA 1996), for the proposition that \"[t]he [agency] may review and\nact   on   [Rivera's]   application   for  adjustment   of   status\nindependently.\" We are puzzled by this statement, which amounts to\na misunderstanding of the relevant regulations and was misleading\nto Rivera.      As we explained in Succar, under 8 C.F.R. §\n1245.1(c)(8), once an arriving alien had been placed in removal\nproceedings, neither the IJ nor the district director of the\nimmigration agency could act on any application for adjustment of\nstatus; the alien thus had no venue in which to apply for\nadjustment in the United States. In re Castro-Padron was a 1996\ncase; 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(c)(8) was promulgated in 1997.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fadjustment of status and that the IJ could not have terminated,\n\nadministratively closed, or continued the removal proceedings so\n\nthat Rivera could file her application for adjustment of status\n\nwith the District Director.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          The IJ and BIA both denied Rivera's motions to hear the\n\nadjustment application within the removal proceeding, or in the\n\nalternative, to terminate, administratively close, or continue the\n\nremoval hearing so that adjustment could be pursued in some other\n\nforum, on the sole basis of 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(c)(8), the regulation\n\npreventing an \"arriving alien\" in removal proceedings from applying\n\nfor adjustment of status.    In addition, the government's brief to\n\nthis court focused only on the validity of the regulation.\n\n          Since   the   agency   action,   under   Succar,   cannot   be\n\nsustained on the stated grounds, the appropriate remedy is to\n\nremand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with the\n\nholding in Succar.   We do not address any other issues.     See INS v.\n\nVentura, 537 U.S. 12, 16-17 (2002) (per curiam); SEC v. Chenery\n\nCorp., 318 U.S. 80, 95 (1943) (remanding case to agency for further\n\nconsideration after determining that \"the grounds upon which the\n\nagency acted in exercising its powers were not those upon which its\n\naction can be sustained\").\n\n          We do not, for example, address the issue of whether\n\nRivera's application for adjustment of status is somehow number-\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fbarred because she already filed one earlier application, which was\n\ndenied.   None of the IJ, the BIA, or the government in its brief to\n\nthis court have suggested that any such number bar exists. Indeed,\n\nthe District Director's notice of denial to Rivera indicated that\n\nthe agency is normally willing to accept a second application for\n\nadjustment of status in the course of removal proceedings, absent\n\nthe effect of 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(c)(8).6\n\n           Similarly, we do not address Rivera's arguments aimed at\n\nfinding a way around 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(c)(8).     She argues that she\n\nis not an \"arriving alien\" for purposes of that regulation because\n\nof the type of parole she received, and she argues that adjustment\n\nof status under 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (as opposed to adjustment under\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1255(a)) is not barred by the regulation.\n\n           We vacate the removal order and remand the case to the\n\nBIA for further proceedings consistent with Succar v. Ashcroft, No.\n\n03-2445, released this same day.    So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n     Similarly, there has been no holding from the IJ or BIA or\nargument from the government that Rivera is ineligible under the\nstatutory requirements to apply for adjustment of status under both\nof the two possible routes, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) and 8 U.S.C. §\n1255(i).\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

The petitioner is the wife of an American citizen and is also an arriving alien who was paroled and then placed in removal proceedings. Pursuant to a regulation, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1245.1(c)(8), saying arriving aliens in removal proceedings could not apply for adjustment of status, she was denied an opportunity (in her case, a second opportunity) to apply for adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Succar</i> held 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1245.1(c)(8)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to be invalid as inconsistent with the relevant statute, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255, to the extent that the regulation barred paroled aliens in removal proceedings from applying for adjustment of status. <i>Succar</i> held that the Attorney General's discretion as to whether to grant adjustment of status did not include the power to redefine eligibility to apply for adjustment of status for paroled aliens who were statutorily granted eligibility pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a). We now remand this case to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) for consideration in light of our holding in <i>Succar.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Santa Rodriguez de Rivera, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, entered the United States without inspection in 1990 and lived here illegally. She married a United States citizen in 1993 and first applied for adjustment of status, with the Immigration and Naturalization Services's (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> District Director, on September 26, 1996, after her husband had filed an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative that had been approved by the INS. Rivera was eligible to apply for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i) (the Life Act amendments).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the decision on her 1996 application for adjustment of status was pending, Rivera left the United States to travel to the Dominican Republic. She claims that she was granted advance parole by the INS before leaving, but the government denies this; she has, at any rate, not produced evidence of the advance parole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Rivera returned to the United States on January 17, 1998, via New York City, and was paroled at that time for deferred inspection in Boston on February 26, 1998. Rivera reported for inspection in Boston on February 26 and on March 12, 1998, but no inspector was available on either date. Finally, she was inspected and paroled on April 10, 1998. Her parole at that time had an indefinite expiration and was for the purposes of pursuing her initial adjustment of status application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her first adjustment of status application &#8212; the one filed prior to her departure and reentry &#8212; was denied on October 23, 2000. The INS District Director cited \"lack of prosecution (abandonment)\" as the reason, elaborating that two forms had been sent to Rivera after her adjustment interview and that she had not responded to these forms with \"extensive, material documentation.\" Incomplete responses were sent on the first form, and nothing at all on the second. Nonetheless, the notice denying her application concluded that \"[Rivera] may renew [her] application for status as a permanent resident in any deportation proceeding.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same date as the issuance of the denial of her adjustment of status application, the INS sent Rivera a Notice to Appear ordering her to appear at removal proceedings in front of an Immigration Judge (IJ) in Boston. The Notice charged her as subject to removal. It said nothing about her parole status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In removal proceedings before the IJ, Rivera moved to terminate, administratively close, or continue the removal proceedings so that she could again apply for adjustment of status before the District Director. She also sought to have the IJ hear her adjustment application during the course of the removal proceedings. All of these motions were denied by the IJ in his oral decision of June 18, 2002. The IJ noted that she \"has no jurisdiction to hear the adjustment case\" because Rivera \"is an arriving alien.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1245.1(c)(8). The IJ also refused to terminate the case, given that the INS opposed the motion. Rivera also contested removability, but the IJ found that removability was proven by clear and convincing evidence and ordered Rivera removed to the Dominican Republic. The IJ concluded that Rivera would have to apply for a permanent resident visa from abroad rather than adjust her status from inside the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera filed a timely appeal with the BIA on July 11, 2002. The BIA affirmed all rulings. The BIA held that the IJ correctly determined that Rivera was an arriving alien and that by regulation, arriving aliens in removal proceedings are ineligible to apply for adjustment of status anywhere. The BIA cited 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1245.1(c)(8), the exact regulation invalidated by this court in <i>Succar.</i> The BIA also noted that the \"narrow exception\" from &#167; 1245.1(c)(8) for some arriving aliens who received advance parole was inapplicable because Rivera \"has not offered any evidence\" that she received advance parole before leaving the United States and traveling to the Dominican Republic. Finally, the BIA noted that the IJ correctly refused to terminate or administratively close the removal proceedings because \"once the [agency] has initiated removal proceedings, neither we nor the [IJ] has the authority to terminate proceedings unless the [agency] fails to establish that the alien is removable as charged.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera timely appealed the BIA's decision to this court. She does not contest removability, but only appeals the BIA's determination that the IJ could not hear Rivera's application for adjustment of status and that the IJ could not have terminated, administratively closed, or continued the removal proceedings so that Rivera could file her application for adjustment of status with the District Director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ and BIA both denied Rivera's motions to hear the adjustment application within the removal proceeding, or in the alternative, to terminate, administratively close, or continue the removal hearing so that adjustment could be pursued in some other forum, on the sole basis of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1245.1(c)(8), the regulation preventing an \"arriving alien\" in removal proceedings from applying for adjustment of status. In addition, the government's brief to this court focused only on the validity of the regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the agency action, under <i>Succar,</i> cannot be sustained on the stated grounds, the appropriate remedy is to remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with the holding in <i>Succar.</i> We do not address any other issues. <i>See INS v.
