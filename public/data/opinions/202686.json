Paul J. Barbadoro,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Edmond J.

On this appeal, state family law\n\nintersects with the federal bankruptcy statute.    On May 14, 2003,\n\nDonna Skorich (\"Skorich\") filed a petition for divorce from J.\n\nGregory Skorich (\"the debtor\") with the Portsmouth, New Hampshire,\n\nFamily Court.   Pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 458:16-b (2000),\n\nthe Family Court issued an order restraining each party from\n\ndisposing of any property belonging to either of them (subject to\n\nnarrow exceptions).      Under state law, this granted Skorich an\n\nequitable interest in the marital property subject to its later\n\ndivision by the court.   Bursey v. Town of Hudson, 719 A.2d 577, 579\n\n(N.H. 1998); N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 458:16-a (2000).1\n\n          Among the property subject to allocation was jointly\n\nowned real estate in Rangeley, Maine.   On June 24, 2004, the Family\n\nCourt became aware of a pending sale of the Rangeley property, and\n\nit directed that the proceeds (approximately $300,000) be placed in\n\nan escrow account under the joint control of Skorich's and the\n\ndebtor's respective divorce counsel. Apparently the court aimed to\n\nprotect Skorich's potential interest in the property, given that\n\n(in the Family Court's words) the debtor had \"violated almost every\n\norder that this Court has made\" and had \"concealed assets and\n\n\n     1\n      The bankruptcy trustee says that Bursey holds only that a\nspouse has standing to protect legal title to marital property.\nBut the New Hampshire Supreme Court described a spouse as having an\n\"equitable interest\" and a \"legally protectable property interest\"\nin marital property. Bursey, 719 A.2d at 579. She has standing to\nprotect legal title because she has an equitable interest in the\nproperty.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdiverted assets, and taken title to assets in the names of third\n\nparties.\"\n\n              Shortly thereafter, on July 9, 2004, the debtor filed a\n\nChapter   7    bankruptcy   petition.         On   September   8,   2004,    the\n\nbankruptcy court granted Skorich relief from the automatic stay to\n\nallow her \"to obtain a final divorce decree from the Family Court,\n\nwhich may include allocation of the couple's marital assets\"                but\n\nnot their distribution unless approved by the bankruptcy court. On\n\nMarch 29, 2005, the Family Court issued its final decree which\n\nawarded Skorich the entire amount in the escrow account, and\n\nSkorich filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to obtain the\n\nescrowed funds awarded to her in the divorce.\n\n              The   bankruptcy     trustee    (\"the    trustee\")     objected,\n\ncontending that the debtor's share of the escrow funds was property\n\nof the debtor's estate subject to administration by the trustee.\n\nOn October 19, 2005, the bankruptcy court issued a decision holding\n\nthat under state law the debtor was divested of all legal title to\n\nthe funds when they were placed in escrow, prior to his filing for\n\nbankruptcy, retaining only a contingent equitable interest in them\n\nsubject   to    the   Family     Court's    ultimate   division     of   marital\n\nproperty.      In re Skorich, 332 B.R. 77, 87 (Bankr. D.N.H. 2005)\n\n(\"Skorich I\").\n\n              Based on this decision, Skorich filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment with the bankruptcy court seeking a hand-over of\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe escrowed funds.     The trustee filed a cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment, on the ground that the transfer of the debtor's legal\n\ntitle to the escrow agents was a preferential transfer avoidable\n\nunder section 547 of the Code, 11 U.S.C. § 547 (2000).       Avoidance\n\nof the transfer would bring legal title to the sale proceeds back\n\ninto   the   debtor's   estate,   and--according   to   Skorich   I--the\n\ntrustee's status as a hypothetical judicial lien creditor, 11\n\nU.S.C. § 544(a), would enable him (based on state law) to cut off\n\nSkorich's contingent equitable interest in the debtor's share of\n\nthe proceeds.     Skorich I, 332 B.R. at 84.\n\n             The bankruptcy court ruled that the transfer to the\n\nescrow agent had not been for Skorich's benefit as \"a creditor\" nor\n\nwas it on account of \"an antecedent debt,\" two preconditions of\n\nsection 547(b).    Thus, the trustee could not avoid the transfer of\n\nlegal title to the funds out of the debtor's estate; and, as the\n\nFamily Court decree gave full title to the escrow account to\n\nSkorich, the funds belonged to her.      Ford v. Skorich, 337 B.R. 441,\n\n447 (Bankr. D.N.H. 2006) (\"Skorich II\").           The district court\n\naffirmed, 2006 WL 2482694 (D.N.H. 2006).\n\n             The trustee now appeals to contest the ruling under\n\nsection 547--an issue of law that we review de novo.         Ganett v.\n\nCarp (In re Carp), 340 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2003).      The Bankruptcy\n\nCode's treatment of equitable interests relating to property is a\n\nsubject of great difficulty, and by coincidence another such case\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fis also before us, Abboud v. The Ground Round, Inc. (In re Ground\n\nRound), No. 06-9002 (1st Cir.), and is decided today.                The process\n\nof unraveling the Bankruptcy Code's obscurities in regard to such\n\ninterests is far from over.\n\n            The Bankruptcy Code transfers to the estate any interest\n\nin property--whether legal or equitable--held by the filer at the\n\ntime of bankruptcy (subject to narrow exceptions not pertinent\n\nhere).     11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1).            Once the divorce petition was\n\nfiled, the debtor and Skorich each held shared legal title and\n\n(because    of    the   divorce     petition)    an    individual    contingent\n\nequitable interest in all of the proceeds from the house sale.               The\n\nescrowing divested both parties of legal title to the funds, but\n\nnot their equitable interests.\n\n            The trustee inherited the debtor's contingent equitable\n\ninterest    but    that    contingency       never    matured;   instead,    the\n\ncontingency vanished when (after the lifting of the automatic stay)\n\nthe Family Court awarded all of the escrowed funds to Skorich.                If\n\nthis were the end of the matter, Skorich would arguably have clean\n\ntitle to the fund--full equitable ownership and a right to title\n\nfrom the escrow agents--and third parties holding claims against\n\nthe debtor would have to look to other assets.\n\n            However,      section   547   allows     the   trustee   to   \"avoid\"\n\npreferential transfers.        If this provision applied to the transfer\n\nof legal title from the debtor and Skorich to the escrow agents,\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fSkorich's claim to the proceeds--more precisely, to the debtor's\n\npresumptive half share--might begin to unravel. True, Skorich (and\n\nthe debtor) would each retain a contingent equitable interest in\n\nthe whole and only Skorich's interest would have matured.              But\n\nunder section 544, the strong-arm power of the trustee could\n\narguably be used to cut off Skorich's equitable interest in the\n\ndebtor's presumptive share of the proceeds.2\n\n           This brings us to section 547, which allows the trustee\n\nto avoid a transfer of a debtor's interest in property made within\n\n90 days before the filing of the bankruptcy petition if, among\n\nother things, the transfer was \"to or for the benefit of a\n\ncreditor\" and \"for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the\n\ndebtor   before   such   transfer   was   made.\"   11   U.S.C.   §   547(b)\n\n(emphasis added).        In the ordinary sense, Skorich was not a\n\ncreditor of her husband as to the property: they owned it together,\n\n\n     2\n      Courts disagree as to whether section 541(d) protects a third\nparty against having her equitable interest in property cut off by\nthe trustee's strong-arm power when the debtor holds only bare\nlegal title to the property.      Compare In re Quality Holstein\nLeasing, 752 F.2d 1009, 1013 (5th Cir. 1985), with Belisle v.\nPlunkett, 877 F.2d 512, 515 (7th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom, 493\nU.S. 893 (1989); see also 11 U.S.C. § 541(d). We assume arguendo\nthat section 544(a) does, where state law so provides, clothe the\ntrustee with the power to extinguish the equitable interest.\n     Whether New Hampshire law would allow a hypothetical judgment\nlien creditor to take ahead of Skorich could be debated, but the\nBankruptcy Court held that a judgment lien creditor would indeed\ntake ahead of Skorich. Skorich I,332 B.R. at 84. Such a a result\nis at least colorable, cf. Charter Fin. Inc. v. Aurora Graphics,\nInc. (In re Jasper-O'Neil), 816 A.2d 989, 991 (N.H. 2003); Rodman\nv. Young, 679 A.2d 1150, 1152 (N.H. 1996), and Skorich has not\ncontested it.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fsubject to the Family Court's power to allocate it in a divorce\n\nproceeding.\n\n           Nevertheless, the Bankruptcy Code has its own technical\n\ndefinitions.    A \"creditor\" is any \"entity that has a claim against\n\nthe debtor\" that arose before the bankruptcy petition was filed, 11\n\nU.S.C. § 101(10); a \"debt means liability on a claim,\" id. §\n\n101(12); and a \"claim\" is a:\n\n           (A) right to payment, whether or not such\n           right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,\n           unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,\n           unmatured,   disputed,   undisputed, legal,\n           equitable, secured, or unsecured; or\n\n           (B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of\n           performance if such breach gives rise to a\n           right to payment, whether or not such right to\n           an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,\n           fixed,    contingent,   matured,    unmatured,\n           disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.\n\nId. § 101(5).\n\n           Skorich says that she had no \"claim\" as to the debtor's\n\npresumptive share of the proceeds for two reasons.             The first is\n\nthat at the time of the bankruptcy filing--normally the critical\n\ndate for identifying claims by creditors in bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 101(10)--no division of property had yet occurred; the second is\n\nthat her equitable interest in the debtor's share was not in any\n\nevent a \"claim\" under either part of section 101(5)'s definition.\n\n           If the equitable interest otherwise constituted a claim\n\nwithin   the   meaning   of   the   definition,   the   fact   that   it   was\n\ncontingent and unmatured at the time of the bankruptcy petition\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwould not be a bar to treating it as a claim.         Both halves of\n\nsection 101(5)'s definition explicitly say that it does not matter\n\nif a claim is contingent and unmatured.    Although a few cases lean\n\nin Skorich's direction, our own precedent is in the trustee's favor\n\non this issue.3\n\n          Skorich's    better   argument--and   the   basis   for   the\n\ndecisions by the bankruptcy and district courts below--is that her\n\nequitable interest in marital property is not a \"claim\" at all\n\nunder section 101(5), because it is neither a \"right to payment\"\n\n(subsection (A)) nor a \"right to an equitable remedy for breach of\n\nperformance\" (subsection (B)). See In re Compagnone, 239 B.R. 841,\n\n845 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1999); In re Perry, 131 B.R. 763, 766-67\n\n(Bankr. D. Mass. 1991).\n\n          We start with subsection (A).    Just prior to the escrow\n\ntransfer, Skorich had shared legal title to the proceeds and a\n\ncontingent equitable interest in the whole fund, but this was not\n\na contingent right to payment from the debtor, whether out of his\n\nproperty share or otherwise; rather, it was an interest in property\n\nobtained upon the filing of the divorce petition by virtue of her\n\nstatus as spouse.   Bursey, 719 A.2d at 579.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Compare Woburn    Assocs. v. Kahn (In re Hemingway Transp.,\nInc.), 954 F.2d 1, 8   (1st Cir. 1992), with Avellino & Bienes v. M.\nFrenville Co. (In re   M. Frenville Co.), 744 F.2d 332, 337 (3d Cir.\n1984), cert. denied,   469 U.S. 1160 (1985).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f              The trustee cites numerous cases purporting to establish\n\nthat a spouse's interest relating to marital property is inevitably\n\na   \"claim\"    under   section   101(5);   but   in   reality,    courts   take\n\ndifferent views on this issue, seemingly affected in part by how\n\ndifferent state laws treat marital interests.4            Nor does the fact\n\nthat the Rangeley property was liquidated change the analysis. Cf.\n\nIn re Brown, 168 B.R. 331, 334-35 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1994).\n\n              The trustee also says that the divorce court could have\n\nawarded Skorich a monetary sum payable by the debtor in place of\n\nany interest in the real property or sale proceeds; that would\n\narguably be a right to payment under subsection (A).                See In re\n\nEmelity, 251 B.R. 151, 154 (Bankr. S.D. Cal. 2000).              But here, the\n\ndivorce court did not award Skorich a right to payment in lieu of\n\nan equitable division of property; instead, the divorce court\n\nmatured Skorich's equitable interest in the marital property.\n\n              Subsection (B) is even more clearly inapplicable.             How\n\nthat subsection should be read is the subject of much controversy,\n\nbut by its terms it applies only to equitable remedies \"for breach\n\nof performance\" where money is a substitute remedy.                   Even if\n\n\n\n      4\n      Compare, e.g., In re White, 212 B.R. 979, 982-83 (10th Cir.\nBAP 1997) (equitable interest vests when divorce petition is\nfiled); In re Roberge, 188 B.R. 366, 369 (E.D. Va. 1995) (same),\nwith, e.g., Ara v. Anjum (In re Anjum), 288 B.R. 72, 76 (Bankr.\nS.D.N.Y. 2003) (no interest until divorce award); In re Polliard,\n152 B.R. 51, 53-54 (W.D. Pa. 1993); Perlow v. Perlow, 128 B.R. 412,\n415 (E.D.N.C. 1991); In re Palmer, 78 B.R. 402, 406 (Bankr.\nE.D.N.Y. 1987).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fdivision of marital property were regarded as an equitable remedy,\n\nno breach of performance--for example, for failure to perform a\n\ncontract--is involved in the present case and only equitable\n\nremedies for breach of performance are potentially claims under\n\nsection 101(5).   See In re Perry, 131 B.R. at 767.\n\n           The trustee also invokes section 102(2) which provides–as\n\na rule of construction--that \"'claim against the debtor' [the\n\nsubject of section 101(5)] includes claim against property of the\n\ndebtor.\"   11 U.S.C. § 102(2).   The trustee reads this provision as\n\nif it made all claims to third party property in the hands of the\n\ndebtor \"claims\" against the estate.     But this would virtually wipe\n\nout section 101(5)(B)'s limitations and is contrary to the limited\n\nrole that Congress intended for its \"rule of construction.\"\n\n           As its legislative history makes plain, section 102(2)\n\ndoes nothing more than clarify that claims to money payable out of\n\nthe debtor's property are to be treated no differently than claims\n\nto money enforceable against the debtor personally.      Thus, under\n\nthis provision a non-recourse loan, being a claim for money, is a\n\nclaim against the estate even though \"the creditor's only rights\n\nare against property of the debtor.\"      S. Rep. No. 95-989, at 28\n\n(1978); see Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U.S. 78, 84 (1991).\n\nSkorich has no such money claim against the debtor; her only\n\ninterest is an equitable interest to the fund.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            The trustee also says that our decision in Davis v. Cox,\n\n356 F.3d 76 (1st Cir. 2004), assumed that an equitable interest in\n\nmarital property constituted a \"claim\" under section 101(5). Davis\n\nheld that Maine law would recognize a constructive trust on the\n\nwife's part in an IRA nominally owned by her debtor husband, id. at\n\n89, and that certain funds held in escrow were not property of the\n\nestate under section 541 and were permissibly awarded to the wife,\n\nid. at 93-94.\n\n            Thus, if anything, Davis is generally helpful to Skorich\n\non several points and the issue that principally worried the court\n\nin Davis--just what equitable interest Maine courts would recognize\n\nin marital property--is resolved by New Hampshire case law in\n\nSkorich's favor.              See Bursey, 719 A.2d at 579.             Although the\n\nbankruptcy court in Davis proceeded on the assumption that the\n\ntrustee attributes to us, our decision adopted no such holding, see\n\nid. at 83 n.5, and did not even mention section 101(5).\n\n            Lastly, the trustee says that allowing Skorich to claim\n\nthe   escrow    fund         undercuts    the   section    547   policies    of   equal\n\ntreatment      of       creditors     and   of     defeating     preferences.        By\n\nrecognizing         a    property     interest     of     non-debtor   spouses      not\n\ndischargeable in bankruptcy, the trustee says we will encourage a\n\ndebtor   spouse         to    favor   a   non-debtor      spouse   over     bankruptcy\n\ncreditors, in order to satisfy a nondischargeable obligation that\n\nmight otherwise remain unsatisfied.\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\f          This litigation is far from section 547's heartland: it\n\nis certainly not a case of the debtor smuggling out property to\n\nprefer one creditor to another. Further, equal treatment is hardly\n\nthe only interest reflected in the Code's many compromises as to\n\nsecured interests, priorities, and preference avoidance provisions.\n\nNothing in the outcome in this case is an assault on the main\n\nthrust of section 547.\n\n          No single case can sort out--let alone answer--the array\n\nof adjacent questions posed where divorce and bankruptcy overlap or\n\nsmooth out the many wrinkles in the precedents.      Modesty counsels\n\na focus upon specific provisions and individual facts.            Having\n\nsought to trace the respective interests, we conclude that Skorich\n\ndoes not have a \"claim\" against the debtor as a \"creditor\"; nor was\n\nthe transfer of legal title to the escrow agents \"on account of\n\nantecedent   debt.\"   Section   547   therefore   does   not   treat   the\n\ntransfer as an avoidable preference.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

On May 14, 2003, Donna Skorich (\"Skorich\") filed a petition for divorce from J. Gregory Skorich (\"the debtor\") with the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Family Court. Pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 458:16-b (2000), the Family Court issued an order restraining each party from disposing of any property belonging to either of them (subject to narrow exceptions). Under state law, this granted Skorich an equitable interest in the marital property subject to its later division by the court. <i>Bursey v. Town of Hudson,</i> 143 N.H. 42, 719 A.2d 577, 579 (1998); N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 458:16-a (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the property subject to allocation was jointly owned real estate in Rangeley, Maine. On June 24, 2004, the Family Court became aware of a pending sale of the Rangeley property, and it directed that the proceeds (approximately $300,000) be placed in an escrow account under the joint control of Skorich's and the debtor's respective divorce counsel. Apparently the court aimed to protect Skorich's potential interest in the property, given that (in the Family Court's words) the debtor had \"violated almost every order that this Court has made\" and had \"concealed assets and diverted assets, and taken title to assets in the names of third parties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, on July 9, 2004, the debtor filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. On September 8, 2004, the bankruptcy court granted Skorich relief from the automatic stay to allow her \"to obtain a final divorce decree from the Family Court, which may include allocation of the couple's marital assets\" but not their distribution unless approved by the bankruptcy court. On March 29, 2005, the Family Court issued its final decree which awarded Skorich the entire amount in the escrow account, and Skorich filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to obtain the escrowed funds awarded to her in the divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy trustee (\"the trustee\") objected, contending that the debtor's share of the escrow funds was property of the debtor's estate subject to administration by the trustee. On October 19, 2005, the bankruptcy court issued a decision holding that under state law the debtor was divested of all legal title to the funds when they were placed in escrow, prior to his filing for bankruptcy, retaining only a contingent equitable interest in them subject to the Family Court's ultimate division of marital property. <i>In re Skorich,</i> 332 B.R. 77, 87 (Bankr.D.N.H.2005) (\"<i>Skorich I</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this decision, Skorich filed a motion for summary judgment with the bankruptcy court seeking a hand-over of the escrowed funds. The trustee filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, on the ground that the transfer of the debtor's legal title to the escrow agents was a preferential transfer avoidable under section 547 of the Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547 (2000). Avoidance of the transfer would bring legal title to the sale proceeds back into the debtor's estate, and&#8212;according to <i>Skorich I</i>&#8212;the trustee's status as a hypothetical judicial lien creditor, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 544(a), would enable him (based on state law) to cut off Skorich's contingent equitable interest in the debtor's share of the proceeds. <i>Skorich I,</i> 332 B.R. at 84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court ruled that the transfer to the escrow agent had not been for Skorich's benefit as \"a creditor\" nor was it on account of \"an antecedent debt,\" two preconditions of section 547(b). Thus, the trustee could not avoid the transfer of legal title to the funds out of the debtor's estate; and, as the Family Court decree gave full title to the escrow account to Skorich, the funds belonged to her. <i>Ford v. Skorich,</i> 337 B.R. 441, 447 (Bankr. D.N.H.2006) (\"<i>Skorich II</i>\"). The district court affirmed, 2006 WL 2482694 (D.N.H. 2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee now appeals to contest the ruling under section 547&#8212;an issue of law that we review <i>de novo. Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp),</i> 340 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.2003). The Bankruptcy Code's treatment of equitable interests relating to property is a subject of great difficulty, and by coincidence another such case is also before us, <i>Abboud v. The Ground Round, Inc. (In re Ground Round),</i> 482 F.3d 15 (1st Cir.2007), and is decided today. The process of unraveling the Bankruptcy Code's obscurities in regard to such interests is far from over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Code transfers to the estate any interest in property&#8212;whether legal or equitable&#8212;held by the filer at the time of bankruptcy (subject to narrow exceptions not pertinent here). 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1). Once the divorce petition was filed, the debtor and Skorich each held shared legal title and (because of the divorce petition) an individual contingent equitable interest in all of the proceeds from the house sale. The escrowing divested both parties of legal title to the funds, but not their equitable interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee inherited the debtor's contingent equitable interest but that contingency never matured; instead, the contingency vanished when (after the lifting of the automatic stay) the Family Court awarded all of the escrowed funds to Skorich. If this were the end of the matter, Skorich would arguably have clean title to the fund&#8212;full equitable ownership and a right to title from the escrow agents&#8212;and third parties holding claims against the debtor would have to look to other assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, section 547 allows the trustee to \"avoid\" preferential transfers. If this provision applied to the transfer of legal title from the debtor and Skorich to the escrow agents, Skorich's claim to the proceeds&#8212;more precisely, to the debtor's presumptive half share&#8212;might begin to unravel. True, Skorich (and the debtor) would each retain a contingent equitable interest in the whole and only Skorich's interest would have matured. But under section 544, the strong-arm power of the trustee could arguably be used to cut off Skorich's equitable interest in the debtor's presumptive share of the proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to section 547, which allows the trustee to avoid a transfer of a debtor's interest in property made within 90 days before the filing of the bankruptcy petition if, among other things, the transfer was \"to or for the benefit of a <i>creditor</i>\" and \"for or on account of an <i>antecedent debt</i> owed by the debtor before such transfer was made.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(b) (emphasis added). In the ordinary sense, Skorich was not a creditor of her husband as to the property: they owned it together, subject to the Family Court's power to allocate it in a divorce proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Bankruptcy Code has its own technical definitions. A \"creditor\" is any \"entity that has a claim against the debtor\" that arose before the bankruptcy petition was filed, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(10); a \"debt means liability on a claim,\" id. &#167; 101(12); and a \"claim\" is a:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 101(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Skorich says that she had no \"claim\" as to the debtor's presumptive share of the proceeds for two reasons. The first is that at the time of the bankruptcy filing&#8212;normally the critical date for identifying claims by creditors in bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(10)&#8212;no division of property had yet occurred; the second is that her equitable interest in the debtor's share was not in any event a \"claim\" under either part of section 101(5)'s definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the equitable interest otherwise constituted a claim within the meaning of the definition, the fact that it was contingent and unmatured at the time of the bankruptcy petition would not be a bar to treating it as a claim. Both halves of section 101(5)'s definition explicitly say that it does not matter if a claim is contingent and unmatured. Although a few cases lean in Skorich's direction, our own precedent is in the trustee's favor on this issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Skorich's better argument&#8212;and the basis for the decisions by the bankruptcy and district courts below&#8212;is that her equitable interest in marital property is not a \"claim\" at all under section 101(5), because it is neither a \"right to payment\" (subsection (A)) nor a \"right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance\" (subsection (B)). <i>See In re Compagnone,</i> 239 B.R. 841, 845 (Bankr.D.Mass.1999); <i>In re Perry,</i> 131 B.R. 763, 766-67 (Bankr.D.Mass. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with subsection (A). Just prior to the escrow transfer, Skorich had shared legal title to the proceeds and a contingent equitable interest in the whole fund, but this was not a contingent <i>right to payment</i> from the debtor, whether out of his property share or otherwise; rather, it was an interest in property obtained upon the filing of the divorce petition by virtue of her status as spouse. <i>Bursey,</i> 719 A.2d at 579.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee cites numerous cases purporting to establish that a spouse's interest relating to marital property is inevitably a \"claim\" under section 101(5); but in reality, courts take different views on this issue, seemingly affected in part by how different state laws treat marital interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Nor does the fact that the Rangeley property was liquidated change the analysis. <i>Cf. In re Brown,</i> 168 B.R. 331, 334-35 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also says that the divorce court <i>could</i> have awarded Skorich a monetary sum payable by the debtor in place of any interest in the real property or sale proceeds; that would arguably be a right to payment under subsection (A). <i>See In re Emelity,</i> 251 B.R. 151, 154 (Bankr. S.D.Cal.2000). But here, the divorce court did <i>not</i> award Skorich a right to payment in lieu of an equitable division of property; instead, the divorce court matured Skorich's equitable interest in the marital property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection (B) is even more clearly inapplicable. How that subsection should be read is the subject of much controversy, but by its terms it applies only to equitable remedies \"for breach of performance\" where money is a substitute remedy. Even if division of marital property were regarded as an equitable <i>remedy,</i> no breach of performance&#8212;for example, for failure to perform a contract&#8212;is involved in the present case and only equitable remedies for breach of performance are potentially claims under section 101(5). <i>See In re Perry,</i> 131 B.R. at 767.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also invokes section 102(2) which provides &#8212; as a rule of construction &#8212; that \"`claim against the debtor' [the subject of section 101(5)] includes claim against property of the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 102(2). The trustee reads this provision as if it made all claims to third party property in the hands of the debtor \"claims\" against the estate. But this would virtually wipe out section 101(5)(B)'s limitations and is contrary to the limited role that Congress intended for its \"rule of construction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its legislative history makes plain, section 102(2) does nothing more than clarify that <i>claims to money</i> payable out of the debtor's property are to be treated no differently than claims to money enforceable against the debtor personally. Thus, under this provision a non-recourse loan, being a claim for money, is a claim against the estate even though \"the creditor's only rights are against property of the debtor.\" S.Rep. No. 95-989, at 28 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 5787, 5814; <i>see Johnson v. Home State Bank,</i> 501 U.S. 78, 84, 111 S.Ct. 2150, 115 L.Ed.2d 66 (1991). Skorich has no such money claim against the debtor; her <i>only</i> interest is an equitable interest to the fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also says that our decision in <i>Davis v. Cox,</i> 356 F.3d 76 (1st Cir.2004), assumed that an equitable interest in marital property constituted a \"claim\" under section 101(5). <i>Davis</i> held that Maine law would recognize a constructive trust on the wife's part in an IRA nominally owned by her debtor husband, <i>id.</i> at 89, and that certain funds held in escrow were not property of the estate under section 541 and were permissibly awarded to the wife, <i>id.</i> at 93-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if anything, <i>Davis</i> is generally helpful to Skorich on several points and the issue that principally worried the court in <i>Davis</i>&#8212;just what equitable interest Maine courts would recognize in marital property&#8212;is resolved by New Hampshire case law in Skorich's favor. <i>See Bursey,</i> 719 A.2d at 579. Although the bankruptcy court in <i>Davis</i> proceeded on the assumption that the trustee attributes to us, our decision adopted no such holding, <i>see id.</i> at 83 n. 5, and did not even mention section 101(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the trustee says that allowing Skorich to claim the escrow fund undercuts the section 547 policies of equal treatment of creditors and of defeating preferences. By recognizing a property interest of non-debtor spouses not dischargeable in bankruptcy, the trustee says we will encourage a debtor spouse to favor a non-debtor spouse over bankruptcy creditors, in order to satisfy a nondischargeable obligation that might otherwise remain unsatisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This litigation is far from section 547's heartland: it is certainly not a case of the debtor smuggling out property to prefer one creditor to another. Further, equal treatment is hardly the only interest reflected in the Code's many compromises as to secured interests, priorities, and preference avoidance provisions. Nothing in the outcome in this case is an assault on the main thrust of section 547.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No single case can sort out&#8212;let alone answer&#8212;the array of adjacent questions posed where divorce and bankruptcy overlap or smooth out the many wrinkles in the precedents. Modesty counsels a focus upon specific provisions and individual facts. Having sought to trace the respective interests, we conclude that Skorich does not have a \"claim\" against the debtor as a \"creditor\"; nor was the transfer of legal title to the escrow agents \"on account of antecedent debt.\" Section 547 therefore does not treat the transfer as an avoidable preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The bankruptcy trustee says that<i>Bursey</i> holds only that a spouse has standing to protect legal title to marital property. But the New Hampshire Supreme Court described a spouse as having an \"equitable interest\" and a \"legally protectable property interest\" in marital property. <i>Bursey,</i> 719 A.2d at 579.

On May 14, 2003, Donna Skorich (\"Skorich\") filed a petition for divorce from J. Gregory Skorich (\"the debtor\") with the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Family Court. Pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 458:16-b (2000), the Family Court issued an order restraining each party from disposing of any property belonging to either of them (subject to narrow exceptions). Under state law, this granted Skorich an equitable interest in the marital property subject to its later division by the court. <i>Bursey v.

On June 24, 2004, the Family Court became aware of a pending sale of the Rangeley property, and it directed that the proceeds (approximately $300,000) be placed in an escrow account under the joint control of Skorich's and the debtor's respective divorce counsel. Apparently the court aimed to protect Skorich's potential interest in the property, given that (in the Family Court's words) the debtor had \"violated almost every order that this Court has made\" and had \"concealed assets and diverted assets, and taken title to assets in the names of third parties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, on July 9, 2004, the debtor filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. On September 8, 2004, the bankruptcy court granted Skorich relief from the automatic stay to allow her \"to obtain a final divorce decree from the Family Court, which may include allocation of the couple's marital assets\" but not their distribution unless approved by the bankruptcy court. On March 29, 2005, the Family Court issued its final decree which awarded Skorich the entire amount in the escrow account, and Skorich filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to obtain the escrowed funds awarded to her in the divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy trustee (\"the trustee\") objected, contending that the debtor's share of the escrow funds was property of the debtor's estate subject to administration by the trustee. On October 19, 2005, the bankruptcy court issued a decision holding that under state law the debtor was divested of all legal title to the funds when they were placed in escrow, prior to his filing for bankruptcy, retaining only a contingent equitable interest in them subject to the Family Court's ultimate division of marital property. <i>In re Skorich,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1913381\"><a href=\"/opinion/1913381/in-re-skorich/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 87 (Bankr.D.N.H.2005) (\"<i>Skorich I</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this decision, Skorich filed a motion for summary judgment with the bankruptcy court seeking a hand-over of the escrowed funds. The trustee filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, on the ground that the transfer of the debtor's legal title to the escrow agents was a preferential transfer avoidable under section 547 of the Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547 (2000). Avoidance of the transfer would bring legal title to the sale proceeds back into the debtor's estate, and&#8212;according to <i>Skorich I</i>&#8212;the trustee's status as a hypothetical judicial lien creditor, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 544(a), would enable him (based on state law) to cut off Skorich's contingent equitable interest in the debtor's share of the proceeds. <i>Skorich I,</i> 332 B.R. at 84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court ruled that the transfer to the escrow agent had not been for Skorich's benefit as \"a creditor\" nor was it on account of \"an antecedent debt,\" two preconditions of section 547(b). Thus, the trustee could not avoid the transfer of legal title to the funds out of the debtor's estate; and, as the Family Court decree gave full title to the escrow account to Skorich, the funds belonged to her. <i>Ford v.

The Bankruptcy Code's treatment of equitable interests relating to property is a subject of great difficulty, and by coincidence another such case is also before us, <i>Abboud v.

The process of unraveling the Bankruptcy Code's obscurities in regard to such interests is far from over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Code transfers to the estate any interest in property&#8212;whether legal or equitable&#8212;held by the filer at the time of bankruptcy (subject to narrow exceptions not pertinent here). 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1). Once the divorce petition was filed, the debtor and Skorich each held shared legal title and (because of the divorce petition) an individual contingent equitable interest in all of the proceeds from the house sale. The escrowing divested both parties of legal title to the funds, but not their equitable interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee inherited the debtor's contingent equitable interest but that contingency never matured; instead, the contingency vanished when (after the lifting of the automatic stay) the Family Court awarded all of the escrowed funds to Skorich. If this were the end of the matter, Skorich would arguably have clean title to the fund&#8212;full equitable ownership and a right to title from the escrow agents&#8212;and third parties holding claims against the debtor would have to look to other assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, section 547 allows the trustee to \"avoid\" preferential transfers. If this provision applied to the transfer of legal title from the debtor and Skorich to the escrow agents, Skorich's claim to the proceeds&#8212;more precisely, to the debtor's presumptive half share&#8212;might begin to unravel. True, Skorich (and the debtor) would each retain a contingent equitable interest in the whole and only Skorich's interest would have matured. But under section 544, the strong-arm power of the trustee could arguably be used to cut off Skorich's equitable interest in the debtor's presumptive share of the proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to section 547, which allows the trustee to avoid a transfer of a debtor's interest in property made within 90 days before the filing of the bankruptcy petition if, among other things, the transfer was \"to or for the benefit of a <i>creditor</i>\" and \"for or on account of an <i>antecedent debt</i> owed by the debtor before such transfer was made.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(b) (emphasis added). In the ordinary sense, Skorich was not a creditor of her husband as to the property: they owned it together, subject to the Family Court's power to allocate it in a divorce proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Bankruptcy Code has its own technical definitions. A \"creditor\" is any \"entity that has a claim against the debtor\" that arose before the bankruptcy petition was filed, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(10); a \"debt means liability on a claim,\" id. &#167; 101(12); and a \"claim\" is a:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 101(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Skorich says that she had no \"claim\" as to the debtor's presumptive share of the proceeds for two reasons. The first is that at the time of the bankruptcy filing&#8212;normally the critical date for identifying claims by creditors in bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(10)&#8212;no division of property had yet occurred; the second is that her equitable interest in the debtor's share was not in any event a \"claim\" under either part of section 101(5)'s definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the equitable interest otherwise constituted a claim within the meaning of the definition, the fact that it was contingent and unmatured at the time of the bankruptcy petition would not be a bar to treating it as a claim. Both halves of section 101(5)'s definition explicitly say that it does not matter if a claim is contingent and unmatured. Although a few cases lean in Skorich's direction, our own precedent is in the trustee's favor on this issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Skorich's better argument&#8212;and the basis for the decisions by the bankruptcy and district courts below&#8212;is that her equitable interest in marital property is not a \"claim\" at all under section 101(5), because it is neither a \"right to payment\" (subsection (A)) nor a \"right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance\" (subsection (B)). <i>See In re Compagnone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552362\"><a href=\"/opinion/1552362/in-re-compagnone/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span>, 845 (Bankr.D.Mass.1999); <i>In re Perry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2001766\"><a href=\"/opinion/2001766/in-re-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 766-67 (Bankr.D.Mass. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with subsection (A). Just prior to the escrow transfer, Skorich had shared legal title to the proceeds and a contingent equitable interest in the whole fund, but this was not a contingent <i>right to payment</i> from the debtor, whether out of his property share or otherwise; rather, it was an interest in property obtained upon the filing of the divorce petition by virtue of her status as spouse. <i>Bursey,</i> 719 A.2d at 579.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee cites numerous cases purporting to establish that a spouse's interest relating to marital property is inevitably a \"claim\" under section 101(5); but in reality, courts take different views on this issue, seemingly affected in part by how different state laws treat marital interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Nor does the fact that the Rangeley property was liquidated change the analysis. <i>Cf. In re Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2013573\"><a href=\"/opinion/2013573/in-re-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span>, 334-35 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also says that the divorce court <i>could</i> have awarded Skorich a monetary sum payable by the debtor in place of any interest in the real property or sale proceeds; that would arguably be a right to payment under subsection (A). <i>See In re Emelity,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1534649\"><a href=\"/opinion/1534649/in-re-emelity/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 154 (Bankr. S.D.Cal.2000). But here, the divorce court did <i>not</i> award Skorich a right to payment in lieu of an equitable division of property; instead, the divorce court matured Skorich's equitable interest in the marital property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection (B) is even more clearly inapplicable. How that subsection should be read is the subject of much controversy, but by its terms it applies only to equitable remedies \"for breach of performance\" where money is a substitute remedy. Even if division of marital property were regarded as an equitable <i>remedy,</i> no breach of performance&#8212;for example, for failure to perform a contract&#8212;is involved in the present case and only equitable remedies for breach of performance are potentially claims under section 101(5). <i>See In re Perry,</i> 131 B.R. at 767.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also invokes section 102(2) which provides &#8212; as a rule of construction &#8212; that \"`claim against the debtor' [the subject of section 101(5)] includes claim against property of the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 102(2). The trustee reads this provision as if it made all claims to third party property in the hands of the debtor \"claims\" against the estate. But this would virtually wipe out section 101(5)(B)'s limitations and is contrary to the limited role that Congress intended for its \"rule of construction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its legislative history makes plain, section 102(2) does nothing more than clarify that <i>claims to money</i> payable out of the debtor's property are to be treated no differently than claims to money enforceable against the debtor personally. Thus, under this provision a non-recourse loan, being a claim for money, is a claim against the estate even though \"the creditor's only rights are against property of the debtor.\" S.Rep.

Skorich has no such money claim against the debtor; her <i>only</i> interest is an equitable interest to the fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also says that our decision in <i>Davis v. Cox,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200813\"><a href=\"/opinion/200813/davis-v-cox/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), assumed that an equitable interest in marital property constituted a \"claim\" under section 101(5). <i>Davis</i> held that Maine law would recognize a constructive trust on the wife's part in an IRA nominally owned by her debtor husband, <i>id.</i> at 89, and that certain funds held in escrow were not property of the estate under section 541 and were permissibly awarded to the wife, <i>id.</i> at 93-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if anything, <i>Davis</i> is generally helpful to Skorich on several points and the issue that principally worried the court in <i>Davis</i>&#8212;just what equitable interest Maine courts would recognize in marital property&#8212;is resolved by New Hampshire case law in Skorich's favor. <i>See Bursey,</i> 719 A.2d at 579. Although the bankruptcy court in <i>Davis</i> proceeded on the assumption that the trustee attributes to us, our decision adopted no such holding, <i>see id.</i> at 83 n. 5, and did not even mention section 101(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the trustee says that allowing Skorich to claim the escrow fund undercuts the section 547 policies of equal treatment of creditors and of defeating preferences. By recognizing a property interest of non-debtor spouses not dischargeable in bankruptcy, the trustee says we will encourage a debtor spouse to favor a non-debtor spouse over bankruptcy creditors, in order to satisfy a nondischargeable obligation that might otherwise remain unsatisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This litigation is far from section 547's heartland: it is certainly not a case of the debtor smuggling out property to prefer one creditor to another. Further, equal treatment is hardly the only interest reflected in the Code's many compromises as to secured interests, priorities, and preference avoidance provisions. Nothing in the outcome in this case is an assault on the main thrust of section 547.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No single case can sort out&#8212;let alone answer&#8212;the array of adjacent questions posed where divorce and bankruptcy overlap or smooth out the many wrinkles in the precedents. Modesty counsels a focus upon specific provisions and individual facts. Having sought to trace the respective interests, we conclude that Skorich does not have a \"claim\" against the debtor as a \"creditor\"; nor was the transfer of legal title to the escrow agents \"on account of antecedent debt.\" Section 547 therefore does not treat the transfer as an avoidable preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The bankruptcy trustee says that<i>Bursey</i> holds only that a spouse has standing to protect legal title to marital property.
