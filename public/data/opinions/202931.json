Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\")\n\nserved petitioner Josué Urizar, a Guatemalan national, with a\n\nnotice to appear on July 31, 2001.           Urizar then filed applications\n\nfor special rule cancellation of removal under the Nicaraguan\n\nAdjustment and Central American Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 105-100,\n\n§   203,   111   Stat.    2160,    2196-99    (1997)   (\"NACARA\"),   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (\"CAT\").     On May 23, 2005, an immigration judge (\"IJ\")\n\nrejected Urizar's applications and, in addition, denied Urizar's\n\nrequest for voluntary departure.         Urizar appealed to the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which affirmed the IJ's decision\n\nwithout further opinion.          Urizar now petitions for review of the\n\nBIA's denial of his appeal.         After careful consideration, we deny\n\nthe petition.\n\n                                   Discussion\n\n            Ordinarily, we review the BIA's opinion; however, when\n\nthe BIA summarily affirms a decision by an IJ, we review the IJ's\n\ndecision as if it were the decision of the BIA.           Jean v. Gonzáles,\n\n461 F.3d 87, 89 (1st Cir. 2006).                An IJ's findings of fact,\n\nincluding his credibility determinations, will be affirmed if they\n\nare supported by substantial evidence. See Mewengkang v. Gonzáles,\n\n486 F.3d 737, 740 (1st Cir. 2007).           Legal conclusions are reviewed\n\nde novo, but with appropriate deference to BIA interpretations of\n\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act.

This argument is\n\nclearly without merit.            Nothing in the INA requires that a hearing\n\nofficer    first        process    an     asylum       application,        and     8    C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.14(a) makes it clear that \"an immigration judge may grant or\n\ndeny asylum in the exercise of discretion to an applicant who\n\nqualifies as a refugee under section 101(a)(42) of the Act.\"\n\n            Urizar's second argument is that he is an \"ABC Class\n\nMember,\"1 and that thus, he is entitled to relief under NACARA.\n\nNACARA provides that nationals of certain countries, including\n\nGuatemala,      may      seek     special       rule      cancellation        of       removal.\n\n§    203(a)(1).         In   order      to   qualify        for   NACARA    special       rule\n\ncancellation, an alien must have arrived in the United States prior\n\nto    October     1,    1990,     and    must      have     either    filed        an   asylum\n\napplication prior to April 1, 1990, or have registered as an ABC\n\nClass Member prior to December 31, 1991.                           Id.     The burden of\n\nproving    these       prerequisites         falls     on    the     alien.         8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 1240.64(a).          The IJ found that Urizar was not credible and that\n\n\n\n\n1\n  This refers to the class of Salvadoran and Guatemalan nationals\ncovered by a settlement agreement with the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service (ICE's predecessor agency) with regard to\nthe processing of asylum applications.      See American Baptist\nChurches (\"ABC\") v. Thornburgh, 760 F. Supp. 796 (C.D. Cal. 1991).\n\n                                             -3-\n\fhe arrived in the United States after October 1, 1990.2                 We\n\nconclude that these findings are supported by substantial evidence.\n\n            Regarding    Urizar's   credibility,   the   IJ   noted   that\n\nUrizar's testimony regarding his date of arrival was contrary to a\n\nsigned statement he had given earlier to an immigration officer,\n\nindicating that Urizar arrived in 1994.3       Moreover, the evidence of\n\nUnited States residency that Urizar presented all dated from 1994,\n\nthe date that Urizar had initially given the immigration officer.\n\nFurthermore, although Urizar testified that he registered as an ABC\n\nclass member, he was able to offer few details other than that he\n\nconsulted   with   a    lawyer   named   \"Luis.\"   Finally,   there   were\n\ninconsistencies in various other aspects of Urizar's stories,\n\nincluding his supposed \"voluntary\" child support payments (which\n\n\n\n2\n   The IJ also determined that Urizar had not registered as an ABC\nClass Member.    Urizar argues that the IJ applied the incorrect\nstandard for determining whether he registered as an ABC Class\nMember. Because we conclude that Urizar is ineligible for relief\nunder NACARA based on the IJ's other finding -- that Urizar arrived\nin the United States after October 1, 1990 -- we need not reach\nthis argument. For the same reason, we also do not reach Urizar's\ncontention that the Government failed to offer sufficient proof\nthat he was ineligible for NACARA relief because of a prior\nconviction for domestic violence.\n3\n   Urizar argues that the statement is inaccurate and that it was\nnot explained to him in his native language, Spanish. However, the\nonly evidence that Urizar offers to prove this is his own\ndiscredited testimony coupled with the fact that the immigration\nofficer who took the statement did not have a Hispanic surname.\nThe IJ was entitled to find as a matter of common sense that\nimmigration officers with non-Hispanic surnames are capable of\nexplaining and translating English-language statements into\nSpanish.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fevidence submitted by Urizar showed not to be voluntary) and the\n\ncircumstances under which he was detained by the ICE.4       These\n\ninconsistencies in Urizar's testimony adequately support the IJ's\n\nfinding that Urizar was not credible.5    See Pan v. Gonzáles, 489\n\nF.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"The IJ did not deal in broad\n\ngeneralizations but relied on a specific and well-articulated\n\nlitany of identified inconsistencies in the petitioner's story.\n\nThose inconsistencies involve matters important to the petitioner's\n\nclaims for relief.\").\n\n           As for his date of arrival in the United States, Urizar\n\nwas able to offer only two pieces of evidence: an unsworn statement\n\nfrom his girlfriend's mother and his own testimony that he had\n\narrived in 1990.   Urizar's testimony was discredited by the IJ's\n\nadverse credibility finding. The remaining evidence -- the unsworn\n\nstatement by Urizar's girlfriend's mother -- was contradicted by\n\nUrizar's earlier statement to immigration officers and provided\n\nlittle detail regarding the circumstances under which Urizar's\n\ngirlfriend's mother came to know him when he arrived in the United\n\nStates.   Given the scant and largely incredible evidence submitted\n\n\n\n4\n   Urizar claimed that ICE officials had not been specifically\nlooking for him when he was detained.      However, the Notice to\nAppear with which Urizar was personally served was addressed to him\npersonally.\n5\n   These facts are not \"minor inconsistencies,\" as Urizar claims,\nbut rather, mostly go to the heart of Urizar's claim, i.e., the\ndate of his arrival in the United States.\n\n                                -5-\n\fby Urizar, we conclude that the IJ's finding that Urizar had not\n\nmet his burden of proving that he had entered the United States\n\nbefore October 1, 1990 is supported by substantial evidence. Thus,\n\nwe affirm the IJ's ruling that Urizar is ineligible for relief\n\nunder NACARA.\n\n             Finally, Urizar contends that the IJ's decisions to\n\nreject his asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims are\n\nerroneous.       Urizar states, however, that the IJ has failed to\n\nsufficiently explain his reasoning for these decisions, and as\n\nsuch, he is unable to formulate arguments responding to them.               We\n\ndo not agree. The IJ's reasoning explicitly addresses the failings\n\nof each of Urizar's claims.            The IJ explained that Urizar had\n\nfailed to provide any evidence beyond his own testimony to support\n\nhis    claims,   and     that   Urizar's   testimony   had   been   found   not\n\ncredible.     As such, the IJ explained, Urizar did not sustain his\n\nburden of demonstrating past or future persecution for the purposes\n\nof his claims of asylum, see Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzáles, 460 F.3d\n\n163,   167   (1st    Cir.   2006)   (noting   standard   for   asylum),     and\n\nwithholding, Stroni v. Gonzáles, 454 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(discussing withholding standard), or of demonstrating a likelihood\n\nof future state-sanctioned torture for the purposes of his CAT\n\nclaim, id. at 89-90 (explaining standard for CAT claims). See also\n\nPan, 489 F.3d at 86 (\"[E]vidence that the factfinder supportably\n\ncharacterizes       as    incredible   may    be   either    disregarded     or\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdiscounted.     Accordingly, an adverse credibility determination can\n\nprove   fatal   to   a   claim   for   either   asylum   or   withholding   of\n\nremoval.\").     Accordingly, we affirm the IJ's decision on these\n\nclaims as supported by substantial evidence.\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we deny Urizar's petition.\n\n           Petition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f",

Urizar states, however, that the IJ has failed to\n\nsufficiently explain his reasoning for these decisions, and as\n\nsuch, he is unable to formulate arguments responding to them.               We\n\ndo not agree. The IJ's reasoning explicitly addresses the failings\n\nof each of Urizar's claims.            The IJ explained that Urizar had\n\nfailed to provide any evidence beyond his own testimony to support\n\nhis    claims,   and     that   Urizar's   testimony   had   been   found   not\n\ncredible.     As such, the IJ explained, Urizar did not sustain his\n\nburden of demonstrating past or future persecution for the purposes\n\nof his claims of asylum, see Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202382\"><a href=\"/opinion/202382/berrio-barrera-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   167   (1st    Cir.   2006)   (noting   standard   for   asylum),     and\n\nwithholding, Stroni v.
