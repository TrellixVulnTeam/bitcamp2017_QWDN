Ricardo Velásquez, Susana D.\n\nGranados-Urizar, and Eluvia Rosalina Granados-Urizar (collectively\n\n\"petitioners\")     seek     review   of        a   decision    by   the    Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"Board\" or \"BIA\") denying their application\n\nfor asylum and withholding of deportation.                  We affirm the Board's\n\ndecision.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            Petitioners, a father and his two adult daughters, are\n\nnatives and citizens of Guatemala.1                All three entered the United\n\nStates without inspection in September 1989.                  The Immigration and\n\nNaturalization     Service    (\"INS\")      charged        petitioners     with   being\n\nremovable as aliens present in the United States without being\n\nadmitted    or   paroled.     See    8    U.S.C.      §   1182(a)(6)(A)(i).        On\n\nAugust 18, 1999, petitioners, represented by counsel, appeared\n\nbefore an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), conceded removability, and\n\nindicated that they would seek relief from removal in the form of\n\nasylum and withholding of deportation.2               The IJ found petitioners\n\nremovable as charged and denied their applications for relief. The\n\n\n1\n   The three applications for asylum were consolidated, and on\nJune 18, 2001, this Court granted petitioners' request to similarly\nconsolidate their cases before us.\n2\n   We review only the denial of asylum claim. Since the standard\nfor withholding deportation is more stringent than that for asylum,\n\"a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard fails, a\nfortiori, to satisfy the former.\" Álvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 1990); accord Aguilar-Solís v. INS, 168 F.3d 565,\n569 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that \"withholding of deportation\nrequires a clear probability of persecution\" (citations omitted)).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fBoard, noting the changed conditions in Guatemala and petitioners'\n\nfailure to prove persecution, affirmed the IJ's decision and\n\ndismissed the appeal.\n\n           The evidence presented before the IJ and adopted by the\n\nBoard confirms that petitioners were witnesses to various acts of\n\nguerrilla violence that plagued Guatemala in the early 1980s.\n\nSpecifically, Velásquez's sister and brother-in-law were killed by\n\nguerrillas in September 1981, after refusing to give them money and\n\nassistance.   Following these murders, Velásquez, himself, received\n\ntwo death threats, allegedly because his family was wealthier than\n\naverage Guatemalans. After receiving the threats, petitioners fled\n\nto another part of Guatemala, and, subsequently, their home and\n\nstore were burned down.\n\n           Petitioners spent the next eight years in Guatemala\n\nwithout incident. During this time, Velásquez served in the Army's\n\nCivilian Defense Patrols for approximately three years, fighting\n\nthe guerrillas.     Following his stint in the army, Velásquez moved\n\nhis family to another area of Guatemala where the guerrillas were\n\nnot as active.     During these years, Velásquez worked in the fields\n\nand sent his children to school without incident.\n\n           In 1989, petitioners came to the United States, leaving\n\nseveral   family   members   behind,   including   Velásquez's   longtime\n\ncompanion, two of his children, and Granados-Urizar's daughter.\n\nThough petitioners eventually lost contact with these relatives,\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe record indicates that no harm has befallen them.          In fact, it\n\nappears that Velásquez's companion is gainfully and safely employed\n\nin Guatemala.\n\n            The IJ denied the applications for asylum, concluding\n\nthat petitioners did not meet their burden of establishing either\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The\n\nIJ did, however, grant petitioners voluntary departure.            The Board\n\ndismissed petitioners' appeal, while re-instating the grant of\n\nvoluntary departure.     This appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            It is well settled that findings of fact by the Board are\n\nto   be   reviewed   under   the   deferential    \"substantial     evidence\"\n\nstandard.       Álvarez-Flores,     909    F.2d   at   3.    The     Board's\n\ndetermination that petitioners were not eligible for asylum \"must\n\nbe upheld if 'supported by reasonable, substantial and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.'\"             INS v. Elías-\n\nZacharias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1105(A)\n\n(4)).     We will not reverse simply because we disagree with the\n\nBoard's evaluation of the facts.          Álvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d at 3.\n\nIndeed, the Board's decision can be reversed only if the evidence\n\npresented by petitioners was so conclusive that any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.            8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4) (B) (2000); see also Elías-Zacharias, 502 U.S. at 481.\n\nThe evidence presented by petitioners falls short of that mark.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f           In the initial proceedings, the alien bears the burden of\n\nestablishing      eligibility    for    asylum     by      proving    either    past\n\npersecution     or   a   well-founded    fear    of     persecution.      8    C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(b).\n\n           A.     Past Persecution\n\n           The IJ determined that petitioners could not succeed in\n\ntheir claim of past persecution.             To prove past persecution, an\n\napplicant must demonstrate that he or she has suffered persecution\n\non account of one of the five enumerated grounds: race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.   Id. § 208.13(b)(1).         The IJ found, and the Board agreed,\n\nthat petitioners failed to provide conclusive evidence that they\n\nwere targeted by the guerrillas based on any of the protected\n\ngrounds.\n\n           Petitioners bear the burden of establishing that they\n\nfall within one of five enumerated grounds.                8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a);\n\nsee also Álvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d at 3 (\"Petitioner bears the\n\nburden of proving eligibility for asylum. . . .\").                   In an attempt\n\nto satisfy this burden, petitioners contend that their social\n\nstatus and political beliefs \"singled them out\" as targets for the\n\nguerrillas.     The IJ rejected that position and, instead, relied\n\nupon   evidence      showing   that    thousands      of    politically       neutral\n\nGuatemalans met with the same fate, concluding that petitioners\n\nwere not persecuted on an individual basis.                Indeed, the record as\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fa whole bespeaks of general harm attributable to the widespread\n\ncivil strife that plagued Guatemala during that time.                    Congress,\n\nhowever, has not \"generally opened the doors to those merely\n\nfleeing from civil war.\"          Velásquez-Valencia v. INS, 244 F.3d 48,\n\n51 (1st Cir. 2001).          Furthermore, the IJ looked at the fact that\n\npetitioners spent eight years in Guatemala after the alleged\n\npersecution. There is no indication that petitioners changed their\n\npolitical opinion or their social class during that time; in fact,\n\npetitioners were able to live and work without interference from\n\nthe guerrillas.           The evidence clearly supports the IJ's finding\n\nthat   petitioners         suffered    no   more   than    thousands     of   other\n\nGuatemalans during this period of civil unrest.               Consequently, the\n\nevidence does not compel us to reverse the Board's finding that\n\npetitioners were not targeted on any individual basis, much less on\n\none of the five enumerated grounds.\n\n               B.    Well-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n               The   IJ    similarly   found   that     petitioners    failed    to\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of persecution. Petitioners have two\n\nroutes    by    which     they   can   establish    a     well-founded    fear   of\n\npersecution: (1) they can offer specific proof, Álvarez-Flores, 909\n\nF.2d at 5, or (2) they can claim the benefit of a regulatory\n\npresumption based on proof of past persecution, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13\n\n(b)(1).    As discussed above, petitioners have failed to establish\n\npast persecution.          Therefore, because they are not entitled to a\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fpresumption, they must point to specific proof to justify a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.      Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 264 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n            To demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\nby direct evidence, a petitioner must satisfy both an objective and\n\nsubjective test.        Álvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d at 5.              Under the\n\nsubjective requirement, a petitioner must prove that his fear is\n\ngenuine, id., while the objective component requires showing by\n\n\"credible,     direct   and   specific    evidence\"   that   this    fear   is\n\nreasonable.     Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(internal quotations and citation omitted).           Generally, \"the BIA\n\nrequires that an applicant show that a reasonable person in his\n\ncircumstances would fear persecution.\" Álvarez-Flores, 909 F.2d at\n\n3 (internal quotations and citation omitted).\n\n             Petitioners only point to evidence of past acts.          The IJ\n\nfound that there was no evidence on the record to indicate that\n\npetitioners would suffer any harm should they be returned to their\n\nhomeland.      Rather, the evidence indicates that petitioners could\n\nlive peacefully and prosperously in Guatemala.          As noted by the IJ\n\nand the Board, numerous relatives of the petitioners have lived,\n\nundisturbed, in Guatemala for the past twenty years.          See Aguilar-\n\nSolís, 168 F.3d at 573 (\"[T]he fact that close relatives continue\n\nto live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's\n\nclaim   that    persecution    awaits     his   return.\").    Furthermore,\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fpetitioners    presented   no    evidence    that   the   guerrillas   sought\n\nretribution     against    any   of    the   remaining     family   members.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that petitioners have not demonstrated by\n\n\"credible, direct and specific evidence\" a reasonable fear of\n\npersecution.     As such, substantial evidence supports the IJ's\n\nfinding that petitioners will not be targets upon their return to\n\nGuatemala.\n\n          In sum, we see no need to disturb the findings below.\n\nThe IJ and the Board, after carefully considering a great deal of\n\nevidence, concluded that petitioners had not met their burden in\n\nestablishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.     Since there exists no compelling evidence to the\n\ncontrary, we defer to this conclusion.\n\n                                      III.\n\n             Petitioners also ask that, in the alternative, we grant\n\nthem humanitarian asylum.          However, because this Court lacks\n\njurisdiction to review claims raised for the first time in a\n\npetition for review, we cannot decide whether they qualify for such\n\nrelief.   Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1999); see also\n\nBernal v. Vallejo, 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                      IV.\n\n          Finally, the government's argument that this court lacks\n\njurisdiction to reinstate voluntary departure fails. See Khalil v.\n\nAshcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2003) (reinstating voluntary\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdeparture under permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform\n\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\")). We therefore\n\nreinstate the voluntary departure period granted by the Board.\n\n                               V.\n\n          For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the order of\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals, and the voluntary departure\n\nperiod is reinstated.\n\n\n\n\n              \"Concurrence and Dissenting follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f            McAuliffe,   District    Judge    (Concurring       in   part     and\n\nDissenting in part).         Except in one respect, I am in complete\n\nagreement with the panel opinion.          Because I believe an amendment\n\nto   the   Immigration   and   Nationality    Act   made   by    the   Illegal\n\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and\n\ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), probably eliminated this\n\ncourt’s jurisdiction to reinstate a lapsed period of voluntary\n\ndeparture in conjunction with our adjudication of a petition for\n\nreview,4 and because I do not believe we are bound by any contrary\n\npanel precedent in this circuit, I would not simply reinstate the\n\nlapsed period of voluntary departure.\n\n            Since we granted Respondent's petition for rehearing in\n\nthis case, and because what precedent exists in this circuit\n\nneither    addresses   nor   resolves   the   specific     issue     raised    by\n\nRespondent in that petition, I would address and resolve on its\n\nmerits the question of this court’s jurisdiction to reinstate a\n\nlapsed period of voluntary departure.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  See, e.g., Zazueta-Carrillo v. Ashcroft, 322 F.3d 1166 (9th Cir.\n2003). See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(f) (providing that no court shall\nhave jurisdiction to \"order a stay of an alien’s removal pending\nconsideration of any claim with respect to voluntary departure\"\nand, at least implicitly, suggesting that no court shall have\njurisdiction to reinstate a lapsed period of voluntary departure);\n8 C.F.R. §§ 240.26(f) and (h) (discussing the authority to grant\nextensions of time within which to voluntarily depart and the\nauthority to reinstate a lapsed period of voluntary departure).\n\n                                    -10-\n\f",

The evidence presented by petitioners falls short of that mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the initial proceedings, the alien bears the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum by proving either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Past Persecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ determined that petitioners could not succeed in their claim of past persecution. To prove past persecution, an applicant must demonstrate that he or she has suffered persecution on account of one of the five enumerated grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 208.13(b)(1). The IJ found, and the Board agreed, that petitioners failed to provide conclusive evidence that they were targeted by the guerrillas based on any of the protected grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners bear the burden of establishing that they fall within one of five enumerated grounds. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a); <i>see also Alvarez-Flores,</i> 909 F.2d at 3 (\"Petitioner bears the burden of proving eligibility for asylum....\"). In an attempt to satisfy this burden, petitioners contend that their social status and political beliefs \"singled them out\" as targets for the guerrillas. The IJ rejected that position and, instead, relied upon evidence showing that thousands of politically neutral Guatemalans met with the same fate, concluding that petitioners were not persecuted on an individual basis. Indeed, the record as a whole bespeaks of general harm attributable to the widespread civil strife that plagued Guatemala during that time. Congress, however, has not \"generally opened the doors to those merely fleeing from civil war.\" <i>Vel&#225;squez-Valencia v. INS,</i> 244 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir.2001). Furthermore, the IJ looked at the fact that petitioners spent eight years in Guatemala after the alleged persecution. There is no indication that petitioners changed their political opinion or their social class during that time; in fact, petitioners were able to live and work without interference from the guerrillas. The evidence clearly supports the IJ's finding that petitioners suffered no more than thousands of other Guatemalans during this period of civil unrest. Consequently, the evidence does not compel us to reverse the Board's finding that petitioners were not targeted on any individual basis, much less on one of the five enumerated grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Well-Founded Fear of Persecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ similarly found that petitioners failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. Petitioners have two routes by which they can establish a well-founded fear of persecution: (1) they can offer specific proof, <i>Alvarez-Flores,</i> 909 F.2d at 5, or (2) they can claim the benefit of a regulatory presumption based on proof of past persecution, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1). As discussed above, petitioners have failed to establish past persecution. Therefore, because they are not entitled to a presumption, they must point to specific proof to justify a well-founded fear of persecution. <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 264 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution by direct evidence, a petitioner must satisfy both an objective and subjective test. <i>Alvarez-Flores,</i> 909 F.2d at 5. Under the subjective requirement, a petitioner must prove that his fear is genuine, <i>id.,</i> while the objective component requires showing by \"credible, direct and specific evidence\" that this fear is reasonable. <i>Ravindran v. INS,</i> 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir.1992) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Generally, \"the BIA requires that an applicant show that a reasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution.\" <i>Alvarez-Flores,</i> 909 F.2d at 3 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners only point to evidence of past acts. The IJ found that there was no evidence on the record to indicate that petitioners would suffer any harm should they be returned to their homeland. Rather, the evidence indicates that petitioners could live peacefully and prosperously in Guatemala. As noted by the IJ and the Board, numerous relatives of the petitioners have lived, undisturbed, in Guatemala for the past twenty years. <i>See Aguilar-Sol&#237;s,</i> 168 F.3d at 573 (\"[T]he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\"). Furthermore, petitioners presented no evidence that the guerrillas sought retribution against any of the remaining family members. Therefore, it is clear that petitioners have not demonstrated by \"credible, direct and specific evidence\" a reasonable fear of persecution. As such, substantial evidence supports the IJ's finding that petitioners will not be targets upon their return to Guatemala.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we see no need to disturb the findings below. The IJ and the Board, after carefully considering a great deal of evidence, concluded that petitioners had not met their burden in establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Since there exists no compelling evidence to the contrary, we defer to this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners also ask that, in the alternative, we grant them humanitarian asylum. However, because this Court lacks jurisdiction to review claims raised for the first time in a petition for review, we cannot decide whether they qualify for such relief. <i>Mendes v. INS,</i> 197 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also Bernal-Vallejo v. INS,</i> 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in the event that the Board's decision is affirmed, petitioners ask this Court to reinstate the previous grant of voluntary departure, protecting them from summary deportation. The INS opposes this request on the ground that its regulations specifically invest the power to grant any extension of voluntary departure in the District Director alone. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 240.26(f) and (h); <i>see also Umanzor-Alvarado v. INS,</i> 896 F.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir.1990). Section 242(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(A)(2)(B)(i), bars judicial review of the grant or denial of discretionary relief, including the grant of voluntary departure. <i>See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,</i> 525 U.S. 471, 486, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) (\"[M]any provisions of the IIRIRA are aimed at protecting the Executive's discretion from the courts....\"). Therefore, we agree with the INS that we lack the power to reinstate the grant of voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals, and petitioners' request for reinstatement of voluntary departure is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The three applications for asylum were consolidated, and on June 18, 2001, this Court granted petitioners' request to similarly consolidate their cases before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We review only the denial of asylum claim.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") charged petitioners with being removable as aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). On August 18, 1999, petitioners, represented by counsel, appeared before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), conceded removability, and indicated that they would seek relief from removal in the form of asylum and withholding of deportation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The IJ found petitioners removable as charged and denied their applications for relief. The Board, noting the changed conditions in Guatemala and petitioners' failure to prove persecution, affirmed the IJ's decision and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented before the IJ and adopted by the Board confirms that petitioners were witnesses to various acts of guerrilla violence that plagued Guatemala in the early 1980s. Specifically, Vel&#225;squez's sister and brother-in-law were killed by guerrillas in September 1981, after refusing to give them money and assistance. Following these murders, Vel&#225;squez, himself, received two death threats, allegedly because his family was wealthier than average Guatemalans. After receiving the threats, petitioners fled to another part of Guatemala, and, subsequently, their home and store were burned down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners spent the next eight years in Guatemala without incident. During this time, Vel&#225;squez served in the Army's Civilian Defense Patrols for approximately three years, fighting the guerrillas. Following his stint in the army, Vel&#225;squez moved his family to another area of Guatemala where the guerrillas were not as active. During these years, Vel&#225;squez's worked in the fields and sent his children to school without incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, petitioners came to the United States, leaving several family members behind, including Vel&#225;squez's longtime companion, two of his children, and Granados-Urizar's daughter. Though petitioners eventually lost contact with these relatives, the record indicates that no harm has befallen them. In fact, it appears that Vel&#225;squez's companion is gainfully and safely employed in Guatemala.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ denied the applications for asylum, concluding that petitioners did not meet their burden of establishing either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ did, however, grant petitioners voluntary departure. The Board dismissed petitioners' appeal, while re-instating the grant of voluntary departure.
