Theodore\nMerritt, Assistant United States Attorney, were on consolidated\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        January 29, 2007\n\f                BOUDIN, Chief Judge. Before us are appeals by two Boston\n\npolice officers, Joseph LeMoure and Joseph Polito, from convictions\n\nfor   a    set       of    related       crimes      based    on    attempts     to    derail\n\ninvestigations            into    LeMoure's         beating    of    a     civilian.      The\n\nbackground events are readily summarized, taking a balanced view of\n\nthe facts consistent with record support.\n\n                Early on June 24, 2000, LeMoure pursued and pulled over\n\na car driven by Stephen Duong and accused a passenger–-Peter\n\nFratus--of       making      an     insulting        gesture       directed    to   LeMoure.\n\nLeMoure dragged Fratus from the car, threw him to the ground,\n\npunched him and kneed him in the head (whether LeMoure also hit him\n\nin the head with a flashlight was disputed at trial).                                  Fratus\n\nthereafter filed a complaint with the Boston Police Department,\n\nwhich     was    investigated            by   the    Department's        Internal     Affairs\n\nDivision (\"IAD\").\n\n                In   early       2001,    Polito--a     friend       and    subordinate    of\n\nLeMoure's--approached              his    close      friends   Dante       Tordiglione    and\n\nBiagio DeLuca and asked them to give false statements to the IAD\n\nsupporting LeMoure.                When they agreed, Polito instructed them\n\nconcerning the content of those statements.                              LeMoure asked his\n\nclose friend Joseph Weddleton to help him secure a \"witness\" to the\n\nincident.        Weddleton approached Ralph DeRota, a mutual friend who\n\nlived near the location of the incident, to request that he give a\n\nfalse statement to the IAD.\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f          Despite the statements given by Tordiglione, DeLuca, and\n\nDeRota, LeMoure was suspended.      Fratus then filed a civil suit\n\nagainst LeMoure.   In the summer of 2002, prior to a deposition in\n\nthe civil case, Weddleton met with DeRota at LeMoure's suggestion\n\nto refresh DeRota's memory of his false IAD testimony, which DeRota\n\nthen repeated in the deposition.       When DeLuca and Tordiglione\n\nhesitated to lie at their own depositions, LeMoure and Polito\n\npressed them to stand fast. Polito provided DeLuca and Tordiglione\n\nwith copies of their false statements to the IAD in order to\n\nprepare them for their depositions.    LeMoure also offered to pay\n\nTordiglione $10,000 for his trouble.\n\n          DeLuca   repeated   his   false   IAD   testimony   in   his\n\ndeposition; Tordiglione claimed not to remember the incident, but\n\nstated that his IAD testimony was true and based on his memory.\n\nLeMoure, who was also deposed, testified that he did not strike\n\nFratus or pull him out of the car, and that he had not met DeRota,\n\nDeLuca, or Tordiglione prior to their coming forward as witnesses.\n\nThe civil suit settled, but a grand jury investigation of the\n\nincident had begun.\n\n          When DeLuca was subpoenaed by the grand jury, LeMoure\n\nurged him to stick with his story, and Polito gave him $7,000 for\n\nhis attorney's fees, stating that the money came from LeMoure.\n\nPolito also met with Tordiglione and DeLuca concerning DeLuca's\n\nsubpoena; in response to Tordiglione's expression of concern,\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fPolito urged the two not to waver.    In the end, Tordiglione and\n\nDeRota testified truthfully to the grand jury in exchange for\n\nimmunity, and DeLuca did so in exchange for a plea agreement\n\nincluding a government recommendation of probation.   In July 2003,\n\nPolito and LeMoure were indicted for a succession of offenses\n\nrelating to their obstructive conduct.\n\n          After a jury trial, Polito and LeMoure were convicted on\n\nthe counts listed in the margin, including conspiracy, witness\n\ntampering, perjury and subornation, and obstruction of justice.1\n\nThereafter, they were sentenced to terms of 36 and 48 months,\n\nrespectively.   They now appeal; most of the claims raise issues of\n\nlaw which we review de novo, United States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96,\n\n100 (1st Cir. 2006); issues of fact and judgment calls are reviewed\n\nwith more deference.   Id.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Both were convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice, 18\nU.S.C. § 371 (2000) (Count Two); witness tampering, id. § 1512(b),\nin connection with Tordiglione's deposition (Count Five), DeLuca's\ndeposition (Count Six), and DeLuca's grand jury testimony (Count\nTwelve); subornation of perjury, id. § 1622, in connection with\nDeLuca's deposition (Count Eight); and obstruction of justice, id.\n§ 1503, for fabricating witness testimony in the civil case (Count\nNine) and for attempting to persuade DeLuca and Tordiglione to give\nfalse testimony to the grand jury (Count Ten). Polito was also\nconvicted of witness tampering in connection with Tordiglione's\ngrand jury testimony (Count Eleven) and LeMoure of witness\ntampering and subornation of perjury in connection with DeRota's\ndeposition (Counts Four and Seven, respectively) and perjury, id.\n§ 1623, for his own deposition statements (Counts Thirteen and\nFourteen).\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f           We begin with Polito's arguments, starting with his claim\n\nthat the district court should have dismissed the obstruction of\n\njustice counts (Counts Nine and Ten) because section 1503, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1503, does not embrace witness tampering.            He points out\n\nthat   Congress   in   1982   amended   section   1503   to   eliminate   any\n\nexplicit reference to \"witnesses\" and enacted in its place the\n\nwitness tampering statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1512.             Victim and Witness\n\nProtection Act, Pub. L. No. 97-291 (1982).\n\n           The government responds that although section 1503 was\n\namended to remove any explicit reference to witnesses, its omnibus\n\n\"due administration of justice\" clause continues to cover witness\n\ntampering.   Pertinently, section 1503 makes it unlawful to\n\n             corruptly . . . endeavor[] to influence . . .\n             any grand or petit juror, or officer in or of\n             any court of the United States . . . or\n             corruptly . . . influence[], obstruct[], or\n             impede[],   or   endeavor[]   to   influence,\n             obstruct, or impede, the due administration\n             of justice.\n\nSection 1512(b)(1) focuses on witnesses (as well as victims and\n\ninformants), and makes it unlawful to:\n\n           knowingly use[] intimidation, threaten[], or\n           corruptly   persuade[]  another   person,  or\n           attempt[] to do so, or engage[] in misleading\n           conduct toward another person, with intent\n           to--(1) influence, delay, or prevent the\n           testimony of any person in an official\n           proceeding.\n\n           Admittedly, Polito is supported by the canon, instructive\n\nrather than mandatory, that a specific treatment prevails over a\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fmore general provision, United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 198\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 979 (1999); the canon has added\n\nforce where, as here, the term \"witness\" was deleted from the\n\nbroader statute at the same time the new, more specific statute was\n\nadopted.          The Second Circuit has taken this restrictive view, but\n\nthe other circuits that have spoken on this issue are all opposed,2\n\nand with good reason.\n\n                  Section 1503 was enacted with two objectives: to protect\n\nwitnesses,          jurors,   and     court   officers,   and     to   \"prevent   a\n\nmiscarriage of Justice by corrupt methods.\"                     United States v.\n\nLester, 749 F.2d 1288, 1292 (9th Cir. 1984).                The term \"witness\"\n\nwas indeed deleted in 1982 from the first clause of section 1503;\n\nbut Congress left intact the omnibus clause forbidding efforts to\n\nobstruct the due administration of justice, which had previously\n\nbeen       read    by   courts   to   encompass   the   corrupt    persuasion     of\n\nwitnesses.3\n\n\n       2\n      Compare United States v. Masterpol, 940 F.2d 760, 762-63 (2d\nCir. 1991), with United States v. Ladum, 141 F.3d 1328, 1337-38\n(9th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1021 (1998); United States v.\nTackett, 113 F.3d 603, 609-11 (6th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522\nU.S. 1089 (1998); United States v. Maloney, 71 F.3d 645, 658-59\n(7th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 927 (1996); United States\nv. Kenny, 973 F.2d 339, 342-43 (4th Cir. 1992); United States v.\nMoody, 977 F.2d 1420, 1423-24 (11th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507\nU.S. 944 (1993); and United States v. Williams, 874 F.2d 968, 977\nn.25 (5th Cir. 1989).\n       3\n      E.g., United States             v. Nicosia, 638 F.2d 970, 974-75 (7th\nCir. 1980), cert. denied,             452 U.S. 961 (1981); United States v.\nJohnson, 605 F.2d 729, 730            (4th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S.\n1020 (1980); cf. Haili v.             United States, 260 F.2d 744, 746 (9th\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            Further, when section 1512 was initially enacted in 1982,\n\nit dealt only with the use or threat of force against a witness;\n\nthe ban on corrupt persuasion was added only later in 1988.                      Anti-\n\nDrug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, § 7029(c) (1988).                       It is\n\nimprobable that, in 1982, Congress meant to adopt (in section 1512)\n\na   specific    ban    against   forcible          intimidation   while    impliedly\n\nnarrowing      (in    section    1503)    the       omnibus    clause     so   as   to\n\ndecriminalize corrupt but non-forcible interference with witnesses.\n\n            Thus, over and above the general presumption against\n\nrepeals merely by implication, United States v. United Cont'l Tuna\n\nCorp., 425 U.S. 164, 168 (1976), this implied repeal would mean\n\nthat Congress had meant in 1982 to reduce the protection afforded\n\nagainst soft witness tampering at the very time that it was trying\n\nto expand protection of witnesses.                 Yet the statute's purpose was\n\n\"to enhance and protect the necessary role of . . . witnesses in\n\nthe   criminal       justice   process   .     .    .   .\"    Victim    and    Witness\n\nProtection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-291, § 2(b)(1)-(2).\n\n            Although we reach this result without any reliance on\n\npost-1982 legislative history, it completes the story to note\n\nSenator Biden's statement in 1988 when Congress amended section\n\n1512 to cover non-coercive witness tampering.                     In reporting the\n\nbill out of committee, Senator Biden explained the amendment as\n\n\n\n\nCir. 1958).\n\n                                         -8-\n\f            intended . . . merely to include in section 1512\n            the same protection of witnesses from non-\n            coercive influence that was (and is) found in\n            section 1503.   It would permit prosecution of\n            such conduct in the Second Circuit, where it is\n            not now permitted, and would allow such\n            prosecutions in other circuits to be brought\n            under section 1512 rather than under the catch-\n            all provision of section 1503.\n\n134 Cong. Rec. S17,369 (1988) (statement of Sen. Biden) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n            Polito's next argument concerns the phrase \"misleading\n\nconduct\" in the witness tampering statute, section 1512(b)(1).\n\nThat statute makes unlawful \"misleading conduct toward another\n\nperson\" in order \"to influence the testimony of any person\" and\n\nefforts   to    \"corruptly   persuade\"   another    person   in   order   to\n\ninfluence      his   testimony.   The    evidence   easily   supported    a\n\nconviction on this latter theory.         But, Polito argues, the jury\n\nmight have relied instead on the \"misleading conduct\" phrase,\n\nthinking it sufficient that he had merely asked a witness to engage\n\nin misleading conduct.\n\n            The jury was told (twice) that the defendant had to\n\n\"engag[e] in misleading conduct\" toward another person with the\n\nintent to influence, delay or prevent \"the testimony of a person\"\n\nin the proceeding.       Moreover, the evidence of corrupt persuasion\n\nwas overwhelming; it is highly improbable that the jury would\n\ninstead have convicted on a less salient misleading-the-tribunal\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ftheory, even assuming that the instructions did not adequately\n\nnegate it.\n\n          Polito   makes   two   other     related   attacks   on   the\n\ninstructions as to section 1512(b)(1).      First, he says, the court\n\ndid not sufficiently explain that, under the statute, the corrupt\n\npersuasion must be done \"knowingly\"--a term that Arthur Andersen,\n\nLLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 705-07 (2005), later held to\n\nrequire \"consciousness of wrongdoing,\" id. at 706.      At trial, both\n\nPolito and the government had focused on \"corrupt\" rather than on\n\n\"knowingly\" as the key to scienter.\n\n          In our case the term \"knowingly\" was included in the\n\ninstructions but not with the gloss (\"consciousness of wrongdoing\")\n\nlater supplied by Arthur Andersen.       The government says that the\n\njudge's instruction on the meaning of \"corruptly\"--that the jury\n\nmust find that the defendant acted \"with an improper purpose\"--\n\nnecessarily entails consciousness of wrongdoing.       An instructing\n\njudge who took Arthur Andersen for all it could be worth might find\n\nthis equation debatable.\n\n          But the situation in Arthur Andersen was dramatically\n\ndifferent than the one here.      At issue there was the arguable\n\nmisuse of an otherwise legitimate document destruction policy, and\n\nthe trial court had instructed the jury that it could convict \"even\n\nif [the defendant] honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct\n\nwas lawful . . . .\"   544 U.S. at 706.      Neither defendant in this\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcase could conceivably have thought that urging witnesses to lie in\n\nofficial proceedings was lawful.\n\n          Polito makes a second effort to mine Arthur Andersen.\n\nThe Court said that the instructions there had failed to convey the\n\nnecessary nexus between the corrupt persuasion and the intent to\n\naffect a particular official proceeding.   See id. at 707; see also\n\nUnited States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 583, 598-600 (1995).     On the\n\nfacts of Arthur Andersen, the concern was legitimate; in our case,\n\nthe persuasion was largely aimed at official proceedings and the\n\ninstructions were adequate.\n\n          Specifically, the jury was told as to section 1512(b)(1)\n\nthat the defendant had to have a specific intent to influence\n\n\"testimony of a person in an official proceeding\"; the civil\n\ndepositions and the grand jury inquiry were so identified in the\n\ninstructions; and the indictment identified the official proceeding\n\nof concern in each count under section 1512(b)(1).   This was not a\n\ncase of mere lies to investigators disconnected from proceedings.4\n\n          Boilerplate instructions as to section 1512 given after\n\nArthur Andersen are likely to be different than those used in cases\n\nlike this one, tried before Arthur Andersen.    But neither of the\n\n\n     4\n      Polito makes the same nexus claim as to the section 1503\ncounts, but the jury was instructed that, as to those counts, it\nneeded to find that an official proceeding was pending, that the\ndefendants \"knew of the pending proceeding,\" that they acted\ncorruptly to influence it, and that their acts had \"the natural and\nprobable effect of interfering with the due administration of\njustice.\"\n\n                               -11-\n\fconcerns   that    legitimately     troubled   the    Supreme   Court    were\n\npresented by the facts in this case.         Failure to anticipate post-\n\ntrial changes in the law can pose troubling issues, but in this\n\ncase, the understandable failure to anticipate future precedent had\n\nno ill effects.\n\n           Polito's next set of claims are that certain of the\n\ncounts are duplicative in violation of double jeopardy principles.\n\nThese claims were not raised in the district court, so we review\n\nfor plain error.        United States v. Patel, 370 F.3d 108, 114 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).      Since there was no error at all, the claims fail at\n\nthe first step of the Olano plain error analysis.                  See United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993).\n\n           Polito says that his convictions for violating section\n\n1512(b)(1) and section 1503 must be vacated because they constitute\n\nmultiple punishments for the same offense.            Multiple punishments\n\nfor the same offense, unlike multiple trials, are permissible if\n\nthe legislature so intended. Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 365\n\n(1983).    Here, no showing of legislative intent is necessary\n\nbecause the offenses are different under the default analysis\n\nprescribed by      Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304\n\n(1932).\n\n           In two of the section 1512(b)(1) counts (Counts Five and\n\nSix),   Polito    was    charged   with   tampering   with   two    different\n\nwitnesses concerning their depositions in the civil case; in a\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fsection 1503 count (Count Nine), he was charged with obstructing\n\njustice   by   fabricating     witness   testimony   in   the    civil   case.\n\nParallel counts were charged concerning the grand jury testimony.\n\nIn Count Ten, Polito was charged with obstructing the grand jury by\n\nfabricating witness testimony; Counts Eleven and Twelve charged him\n\nwith tampering with specific grand jury witnesses. But under the\n\nBlockburger test, whether two offenses are the same depends on the\n\nelements of the crimes and not the similarity of underlying facts.\n\n284 U.S. at 304.\n\n           Here,    contrary    to   Polito's   argument,       each   offense\n\nrequires one or more elements not required for the other offense.\n\nSection 1512(b)(1) requires proof that one intend to \"influence,\n\ndelay, or prevent . . . testimony of any person\" (emphasis added);\n\nsection 1503 does not require such an element. Conversely, section\n\n1503 as read by the Supreme Court requires an attempt to obstruct\n\na pending judicial proceeding, Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 599 (citing\n\nPettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 206 (1893) (construing\n\npredecessor statute)); no such requirement of a pending proceeding\n\nexists in section 1512.      See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(f).\n\n           Polito also claims that Count Six, charging him with\n\nwitness tampering as to DeLuca's civil deposition testimony, is\n\nmerely a lesser included offense of Count Eight, which charged\n\nsubornation of perjury as to DeLuca's civil deposition testimony.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1622.    Again, the answer is the same: witness tampering\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\funder section 1512(b)(1) and subornation of perjury under section\n\n1622 each require an element that the other does not, so neither\n\ncan be a lesser included offense as to the other.\n\n          Section 1622 requires proof of actual perjury, while\n\nsection 1512(b)(1) does not; the latter is directed at specified\n\nacts of tampering.    Conversely, section 1512(b)(1) requires proof\n\nof a nexus with \"an official proceeding\"; by contrast, section 1622\n\ncan be satisfied by procuring a person to lie materially in \"any\n\ndeclaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty\n\nof perjury,\" 18 U.S.C. § 1621, without any nexus to an official\n\nproceeding.\n\n          We    now   turn   to   LeMoure's    arguments.        As   to   his\n\nconviction, LeMoure says that the district court erred concerning\n\na single piece of testimony. During the trial, Weddleton testified\n\nthat he had talked with LeMoure shortly before he (Weddleton) was\n\nto appear before the grand jury, and that LeMoure had raised the\n\npossibility    that   Weddleton   might   plead    his   Fifth    Amendment\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination.         LeMoure's trial counsel did\n\nnot object or request a cautionary instruction.\n\n          LeMoure now says that it was plain error for the judge to\n\nfail to caution the jury that this mention of the Fifth Amendment\n\ndid not constitute witness tampering.           We will assume arguendo\n\nthat, had LeMoure requested a cautionary instruction, the court's\n\nfailure to give one would have been error.        Whether the failure to\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fgive the instruction sua sponte can be regarded as error at all is\n\na quite different question.\n\n                  If a judge misstates the law in an instruction, this is\n\nerror.       But if counsel has not objected to evidence or asked for a\n\ncautionary instruction, it does not necessarily follow that the\n\njudge       has    erred   by   tolerating   the   evidence   or   withholding   a\n\ncaution.          Lawyers sometimes think that \"objectionable\" testimony\n\nfrom an adverse witness helps more than it hurts or that a\n\ncautionary instruction will underscore testimony best ignored.\n\n                  The district court is not required to \"act sua sponte to\n\noverride seemingly plausible strategic choices on the part of\n\ncounselled defendants.\" United States v. De La Cruz, 902 F.2d 121,\n\n124 (1st Cir. 1990).            Although one could describe such choices as\n\nwaivers of claims of error, United States v. Yu-Leung, 51 F.3d\n\n1116, 1121-22 (2d Cir. 1995), others might say that there is no\n\nerror at all when counsel is content and forgoes an optional\n\nobjection.         United States v. Smith, 459 F.3d 1276, 1299-1304 (11th\n\nCir. 2006) (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring).5\n\n                  In all events, the claim of plain error fails here\n\nbecause there is no indication that the Fifth Amendment reference\n\nor the lack of a cautionary instruction probably altered the\n\n\n        5\n      Of course, in a criminal case, counsel's choices may fall\nbelow the requisite standard of care and open the way to a claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel, but no such charge is made in\nthis case (nor, as we will see, could prejudice be established if\nit were made).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fresult.     United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 82\n\n(2004).    The government never charged LeMoure with tampering with\n\nWeddleton's testimony and never argued to the jury that the Fifth\n\nAmendment suggestion betrayed some improper motive bearing on\n\ncounts    involving   other   witnesses      with   whom   LeMoure    clearly\n\ntampered.    Given the ample evidence of the latter, nothing in the\n\nWeddleton episode carried much weight.\n\n            LeMoure's last argument concerns his sentencing.                The\n\nguideline    calculations     were   complicated      partly    because     the\n\nguidelines required separate calculations for one group of offenses\n\nrelated to the civil case and another to the grand jury proceeding.\n\nThe calculation followed by the district court is set forth in the\n\nappendix to this decision; but the dispute in this case relates\n\nonly to one decision: a cross-reference required at one stage in\n\nthe calculation process.\n\n            Where an offense involves obstructing the investigation\n\nor prosecution of a criminal offense, the guidelines instruct that\n\nthe base offense level should be that of an accessory after the\n\nfact for the underlying crime if that level is greater than the\n\noffense level for obstruction itself. U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2(c)(1). An\n\naccessory after the fact is assigned an offense level 6 levels\n\nbelow that prescribed for the underlying offense.              Id. § 2X3.1.\n\n            The   pre-sentence   report     (\"PSR\")   determined     that   the\n\nunderlying offense under investigation by the grand jury was a\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fviolation of federal civil rights, 18 U.S.C. § 242--of which\n\nLeMoure was charged, but on which the jury deadlocked--but that\n\nguideline    directs      the   use   of   the   guideline      for   the   conduct\n\nunderlying the civil rights offense, if the latter's offense level\n\nis higher than level 10.         U.S.S.G. § 2H1.1(a)(1), (3)(A).            The PSR\n\nconcluded that the offense conduct underlying the section 242\n\ncharge was aggravated assault, with a base offense level of 14.\n\n            Aggravated assault is assault that involved \"a dangerous\n\nweapon with intent to cause bodily injury.\"               Id. § 2A2.2 app. n.1.\n\nIn   this   case,   the    dangerous       weapon   was   the    flashlight    that\n\n(according to Fratus) LeMoure used to beat Fratus.                    The PSR then\n\nadded four levels for use of a dangerous weapon, three more for\n\nbodily injury, six levels because LeMoure was a public official,\n\nand two more because of LeMoure's managerial role.                          See id.\n\n§§ 2A2.2(b)(2)(B), 2A2.2(b)(3)(A), 2H1.1(b)(1), 3B1.1(c).\n\n            Other adjustments, not themselves in dispute, led to a\n\ncombined offense level of 24 and, after factoring in criminal\n\nhistory, a guideline range of 51 to 63 months.                  After considering\n\nthe factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553, the court imposed a\n\nsentence of 48 months. But for the decision to cross-reference the\n\naggravated assault guideline, the ultimate offense level would have\n\nbeen lower and the sentence might have been lower as well.\n\n            LeMoure objects that the grand jury did not charge him\n\nwith using a flashlight to beat Fratus.               Instead, the indictment\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fmerely alleged that he \"willfully assault[ed Fratus] by forcibly\n\nremoving him from the . . . car, throwing him to the ground, and\n\nstriking and kneeing him in the head.\"            LeMoure also says that\n\ngrand jury testimony by a doctor raises doubts about the use of a\n\nflashlight and that, at the very least, he is entitled to an\n\nevidentiary hearing on whether he used a flashlight.\n\n           The cross-reference looks to what the grand jury was\n\ninvestigating, not what indictment was returned or what crime\n\nactually occurred. United States v. Conley, 186 F.3d 7, 23-24 (1st\n\nCir.   1999),   cert.   denied,   529   U.S.   1017   (2000).   Otherwise,\n\n\"obstructors of justice would benefit from . . . obstruction that\n\nsuccessfully persuaded a grand jury not to return an indictment.\"\n\nId. at 25.      Nor is LeMoure's knowledge of the specific offenses\n\nunder investigation relevant.       Id.\n\n           In this case, the district court found that the grand\n\njury was investigating the beating as an aggravated assault, given\n\nFratus' allegations that LeMoure had used a flashlight as a weapon.\n\nThis factual determination was not clearly erroneous.             Whether\n\nLeMoure did in fact use his flashlight to beat Fratus is not\n\ncontrolling. For the same reason, an evidentiary hearing as to the\n\nuse of the flashlight was properly denied.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f                                 APPENDIX\n\n\n            The PSR, which the district court adopted, began by\n\ndividing the counts into two groups.         U.S.S.G. § 3D1.1 (2004).\n\nGroup 1 contained the counts relating to the civil case; Group 2\n\ncontained the counts relating to the grand jury investigation.\n\n            Generally, the guidelines prescribe a base offense level\n\nof 14 for obstruction of justice.      U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2.   This offense\n\nlevel was adjusted upward by 4 levels to reflect LeMoure's role as\n\nan organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or\n\nmore participants, yielding an offense level of 18.        This offense\n\nlevel applied to Group 1.        However, the guidelines provide that,\n\n\"if   the   offense   involved    obstructing   the   investigation   or\n\nprosecution of a criminal offense\"--a condition that applied to\n\nGroup 2 but not Group 1--then the sentencing court should apply\n\nsection 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) if the resulting offense\n\nlevel would be greater.    U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2(c)(1).\n\n            Section 2X3.1, in turn, provides for an offense level 6\n\nlevels lower than the underlying offense.       In this case, the PSR\n\ndetermined that the underlying offense was the violation of section\n\n242 charged in Count One; the guideline applicable to that offense\n\nis section 2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights).              In\n\npertinent part, section 2H1.1 prescribes a base offense level that\n\nis the greater of 10, U.S.S.G. § 2H1.1(a)(3)(A), or \"the offense\n\nlevel from the offense guideline applicable to any underlying\n\n                                   -19-\n\foffense.\"       U.S.S.G. § 2H1.1(a)(1).        The PSR determined that the\n\noffense underlying the section 242 charge was aggravated assault,\n\ndefined as an assault that involved \"a dangerous weapon with intent\n\nto cause bodily injury.\"          U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2 app. n.1.               The PSR\n\nidentified the flashlight allegedly used to beat Fratus as the\n\ndangerous weapon.\n\n            The guideline for aggravated assault, U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2,\n\nprovides for a base offense level of 14, to which the PSR added 4\n\nlevels for use of a dangerous weapon, U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2(b)(2)(B),\n\nand 3 levels for bodily injury, U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2(b)(3)(A), for an\n\noffense level of 21.       The PSR then returned to the section 2H1.1,\n\nand increased the offense level of the cross-referenced aggravated\n\nassault    an   additional   6   levels    because     LeMoure   was   a    public\n\nofficial at the time of the offense, U.S.S.G. § 2H1.1(b)(1),\n\nyielding an offense level of 27.          Referring back to section 2X3.1,\n\nthe PSR subtracted 6 levels for a base offense level of 21, and\n\nadjusted    that   level   upward   by    2   levels   because   of    LeMoure's\n\nmanagerial role, U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c), for a total Group 2 offense\n\nlevel of 23.\n\n            As directed by section 3D1.3, the PSR applied the Group\n\n2 offense level of 23 because it was higher than the Group 1\n\noffense level of 18.       To account for Group 1, it added one level,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3D1.4, for a combined offense level of 24.                        Given\n\nLeMoure's criminal history, that offense level yielded a range of\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f51 to 63 months.   After considering the section 3553 factors, the\n\ncourt imposed a sentence of 48 months.\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

The background events are readily summarized, taking a balanced view of the facts consistent with record support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early on June 24, 2000, LeMoure pursued and pulled over a car driven by Stephen Duong and accused a passenger &#8212; Peter Fratus &#8212; of making an insulting gesture directed to LeMoure. LeMoure dragged Fratus from the car, threw him to the ground, punched him and kneed him in the head (whether LeMoure also hit him in the head with a flashlight was disputed at trial). Fratus thereafter filed a complaint with the Boston Police Department, which was investigated by the Department's Internal Affairs Division (\"IAD\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2001, Polito &#8212; a friend and subordinate of LeMoure's &#8212; approached his close friends Dante Tordiglione and Biagio DeLuca and asked them to give false statements to the IAD supporting LeMoure. When they agreed, Polito instructed them concerning the content of those statements. LeMoure asked his close friend Joseph Weddleton to help him secure a \"witness\" to the incident. Weddleton approached Ralph DeRota, a mutual friend who lived near the location of the incident, to request that he give a false statement to the IAD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the statements given by Tordiglione, DeLuca, and DeRota, LeMoure was suspended. Fratus then filed a civil suit against LeMoure. In the summer of 2002, prior to a deposition in the civil case, Weddleton met with DeRota at LeMoure's suggestion to refresh DeRota's memory of his false IAD testimony, which DeRota then repeated in the deposition. When DeLuca and Tordiglione hesitated to lie at their own depositions, LeMoure and Polito pressed them to stand fast. Polito provided DeLuca and Tordiglione with copies of their false statements to the IAD in order to prepare them for their depositions. LeMoure also offered to pay Tordiglione $10,000 for his trouble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeLuca repeated his false IAD testimony in his deposition; Tordiglione claimed not to remember the incident, but stated that his IAD testimony was true and based on his memory. LeMoure, who was also deposed, testified that he did not strike Fratus or pull him out of the car, and that he had not met DeRota, DeLuca, or Tordiglione prior to their coming forward as witnesses. The civil suit settled, but a grand jury investigation of the incident had begun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When DeLuca was subpoenaed by the grand jury, LeMoure urged him to stick with his story, and Polito gave him $7,000 for his attorney's fees, stating that the money came from LeMoure. Polito also met with Tordiglione and DeLuca concerning DeLuca's subpoena; in response to Tordiglione's expression of concern, Polito urged the two not to waver. In the end, Tordiglione and DeRota testified truthfully to the grand jury in exchange for immunity, and DeLuca did so in exchange for a plea agreement including a government recommendation of probation. In July 2003, Polito and LeMoure were indicted for a succession of offenses relating to their obstructive conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury trial, Polito and LeMoure were convicted on the counts listed in the margin, including conspiracy, witness tampering, perjury and subornation, and obstruction of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thereafter, they were sentenced to terms of 36 and 48 months, respectively. They now appeal; most of the claims raise issues of law which we review <i>de novo, United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2006); issues of fact and judgment calls are reviewed with more deference. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Polito's arguments, starting with his claim that the district court should have dismissed the obstruction of justice counts (Counts Nine and Ten) because section 1503, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1503, does not embrace witness tampering. He points out that Congress in 1982 amended section 1503 to eliminate any explicit reference to \"witnesses\" and enacted in its place the witness tampering statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512. Victim and Witness Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 97-291 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that although section 1503 was amended to remove any explicit reference to witnesses, its omnibus \"due administration of justice\" clause continues to cover witness tampering. Pertinently, section 1503 makes it unlawful to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">corruptly . . . endeavor[] to influence . . . any grand or petit juror, or officer in or of any court of the United States . . . or corruptly . . . influence[], obstruct[], or impede[], or endeavor[] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1512(b)(1) focuses on witnesses (as well as victims and informants), and makes it unlawful to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">knowingly use[] intimidation, threaten[], or corruptly persuade[] another person, or attempt[] to do so, or engage[] in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to &#8212; (1) influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, Polito is supported by the canon, instructive rather than mandatory, that a specific treatment prevails over a more general provision, <i>United States v. Lara,</i> 181 F.3d 183, 198 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 528 U.S. 979, 120 S.Ct. 432, 145 L.Ed.2d 338 (1999); the canon has added force where, as here, the term \"witness\" was deleted from the broader statute at the same time the new, more specific statute was adopted. The Second Circuit has taken this restrictive view, but the other circuits that have spoken on this issue are all opposed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and with good reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1503 was enacted with two objectives: to protect witnesses, jurors, and court officers, <i>and</i> to \"prevent a miscarriage of Justice by corrupt methods.\" <i>United States v. Lester,</i> 749 F.2d 1288, 1292 (9th Cir.1984). The term \"witness\" was indeed deleted in 1982 from the first clause of section 1503; but Congress left intact the omnibus clause forbidding efforts to obstruct the due administration of justice, which had previously been read by courts to encompass the corrupt persuasion of witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, when section 1512 was initially enacted in 1982, it dealt only with the use or threat of force against a witness; the ban on corrupt persuasion was added only later in 1988. Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub.L. 100-690, &#167; 7029(c) (1988). It is improbable that, in 1982, Congress meant to adopt (in section 1512) a specific ban against forcible intimidation while impliedly narrowing (in section 1503) the omnibus clause so as to decriminalize corrupt but non-forcible interference with witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, over and above the general presumption against repeals merely by implication, <i>United States v. United Cont'l Tuna Corp.,</i> 425 U.S. 164, 168, 96 S.Ct. 1319, 47 L.Ed.2d 653 (1976), <i>this</i> implied repeal would mean that Congress had meant in 1982 to <i>reduce</i> the protection afforded against soft witness tampering at the very time that it was trying to <i>expand</i> protection of witnesses. Yet the statute's purpose was \"to enhance and protect the necessary role of . . . witnesses in the criminal justice process . . . .\" Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-291, &#167; 2(b)(1)-(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we reach this result without any reliance on post-1982 legislative history, it completes the story to note Senator Biden's statement in 1988 when Congress amended section 1512 to cover non-coercive witness tampering. In reporting the bill out of committee, Senator Biden explained the amendment as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">intended . . . merely to include in section 1512 the same protection of witnesses from non-coercive influence that <i>was (and is)</i> found in section 1503. It would permit prosecution of such conduct in the Second Circuit, where it is not now permitted, and would <i>allow</i> such prosecutions in other circuits to be brought under section 1512 rather than under the catch-all provision of section 1503.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">134 Cong. Rec. S17,369 (1988) (statement of Sen. Biden) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito's next argument concerns the phrase \"misleading conduct\" in the witness tampering statute, section 1512(b)(1). That statute makes unlawful \"misleading conduct toward another person\" in order \"to influence the testimony of any person\" <i>and</i> efforts to \"corruptly persuade\" another person in order to influence his testimony. The evidence easily supported a conviction on this latter theory. But, Polito argues, the jury might have relied instead on the \"misleading conduct\" phrase, thinking it sufficient that he had merely asked a <i>witness</i> to engage in misleading conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was told (twice) that the <i>defendant</i> had to \"engag[e] in misleading conduct\" toward another person with the intent to influence, delay or prevent \"the testimony of a person\" in the proceeding. Moreover, the evidence of corrupt persuasion was overwhelming; it is highly improbable that the jury would instead have convicted on a less salient misleading-the-tribunal theory, even assuming that the instructions did not adequately negate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito makes two other related attacks on the instructions as to section 1512(b)(1). First, he says, the court did not sufficiently explain that, under the statute, the corrupt persuasion must be done \"knowingly\" &#8212; a term that <i>Arthur Andersen, LLP v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 696, 705-07, 125 S.Ct. 2129, 161 L.Ed.2d 1008 (2005), later held to require \"consciousness of wrongdoing,\" <i>id.</i> at 706, 125 S.Ct. 2129. At trial, both Polito and the government had focused on \"corrupt\" rather than on \"knowingly\" as the key to scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our case the term \"knowingly\" was included in the instructions but not with the gloss (\"consciousness of wrongdoing\") later supplied by <i>Arthur Andersen.</i> The government says that the judge's instruction on the meaning of \"corruptly\" &#8212; that the jury must find that the defendant acted \"with an improper purpose\" &#8212; necessarily entails consciousness of wrongdoing. An instructing judge who took <i>Arthur Andersen</i> for all it could be worth might find this equation debatable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the situation in <i>Arthur Andersen</i> was dramatically different than the one here. At issue there was the arguable misuse of an otherwise legitimate document destruction policy, and the trial court had instructed the jury that it could convict \"even if [the defendant] honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful. . . .\" 544 U.S. at 706, 125 S.Ct. 2129. Neither defendant in this case could conceivably have thought that urging witnesses to lie in official proceedings was lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito makes a second effort to mine <i>Arthur Andersen.</i> The Court said that the instructions there had failed to convey the necessary nexus between the corrupt persuasion and the intent to affect a <i>particular</i> official proceeding. <i>See id.</i> at 707, 125 S.Ct. 2129; <i>see also United States v. Aguilar,</i> 515 U.S. 593, 598-600, 115 S.Ct. 2357, 132 L.Ed.2d 520 (1995). On the facts of <i>Arthur Andersen,</i> the concern was legitimate; in our case, the persuasion was largely aimed at official proceedings and the instructions were adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the jury was told as to section 1512(b)(1) that the defendant had to have a specific intent to influence \"testimony of a person in an official proceeding\"; the civil depositions and the grand jury inquiry were so identified in the instructions; and the indictment identified the official proceeding of concern in each count under section 1512(b)(1). This was not a case of mere lies to investigators disconnected from proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boilerplate instructions as to section 1512 given after <i>Arthur Andersen</i> are likely to be different than those used in cases like this one, tried before <i>Arthur Andersen.</i> But neither of the concerns that legitimately troubled the Supreme Court were presented by the facts in this case. Failure to anticipate post-trial changes in the law can pose troubling issues, but in this case, the understandable failure to anticipate future precedent had no ill effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito's next set of claims are that certain of the counts are duplicative in violation of double jeopardy principles. These claims were not raised in the district court, so we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Patel,</i> 370 F.3d 108, 114 (1st Cir.2004). Since there was no error at all, the claims fail at the first step of the <i>Olano</i> plain error analysis. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito says that his convictions for violating section 1512(b)(1) and section 1503 must be vacated because they constitute multiple punishments for the same offense. Multiple punishments for the same offense, unlike multiple trials, are permissible if the legislature so intended. <i>Missouri v. Hunter,</i> 459 U.S. 359, 365, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). Here, no showing of legislative intent is necessary because the offenses are different under the default analysis prescribed by <i>Blockburger v. United States,</i> 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In two of the section 1512(b)(1) counts (Counts Five and Six), Polito was charged with tampering with two different witnesses concerning their depositions in the civil case; in a section 1503 count (Count Nine), he was charged with obstructing justice by fabricating witness testimony in the civil case. Parallel counts were charged concerning the grand jury testimony. In Count Ten, Polito was charged with obstructing the grand jury by fabricating witness testimony; Counts Eleven and Twelve charged him with tampering with specific grand jury witnesses. But under the <i>Blockburger</i> test, whether two offenses are the same depends on the elements of the crimes and not the similarity of underlying facts. 284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. 180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, contrary to Polito's argument, each offense requires one or more elements not required for the other offense. Section 1512(b)(1) requires proof that one intend to \"influence, delay, or prevent . . . testimony of any person\" (emphasis added); section 1503 does not require such an element. Conversely, section 1503 as read by the Supreme Court requires an attempt to obstruct a pending judicial proceeding, <i>Aguilar,</i> 515 U.S. at 599, 115 S.Ct. 2357 (citing <i>Pettibone v. United States,</i> 148 U.S. 197, 206, 13 S.Ct. 542, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893) (construing predecessor statute)); no such requirement of a pending proceeding exists in section 1512. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito also claims that Count Six, charging him with witness tampering as to DeLuca's civil deposition testimony, is merely a lesser included offense of Count Eight, which charged subornation of perjury as to DeLuca's civil deposition testimony. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1622. Again, the answer is the same: witness tampering under section 1512(b)(1) and subornation of perjury under section 1622 each require an element that the other does not, so neither can be a lesser included offense as to the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1622 requires proof of actual perjury, while section 1512(b)(1) does not; the latter is directed at specified acts of tampering. Conversely, section 1512(b)(1) requires proof of a nexus with \"an official proceeding\"; by contrast, section 1622 can be satisfied by procuring a person to lie materially in \"any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1621, without any nexus to an official proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to LeMoure's arguments. As to his conviction, LeMoure says that the district court erred concerning a single piece of testimony. During the trial, Weddleton testified that he had talked with LeMoure shortly before he (Weddleton) was to appear before the grand jury, and that LeMoure had raised the possibility that Weddleton might plead his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. LeMoure's trial counsel did not object or request a cautionary instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeMoure now says that it was plain error for the judge to fail to caution the jury that this mention of the Fifth Amendment did not constitute witness tampering. We will assume <i>arguendo</i> that, had LeMoure requested a cautionary instruction, the court's failure to give one would have been error. Whether the failure to give the instruction sua sponte can be regarded as error at all is a quite different question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a judge misstates the law in an instruction, this is error. But if counsel has not objected to evidence or asked for a cautionary instruction, it does not necessarily follow that the judge has erred by tolerating the evidence or withholding a caution. Lawyers sometimes think that \"objectionable\" testimony from an adverse witness helps more than it hurts or that a cautionary instruction will underscore testimony best ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court is not required to \"act <i>sua sponte</i> to override seemingly plausible strategic choices on the part of counseled defendants.\" <i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> 902 F.2d 121, 124 (1st Cir.1990). Although one could describe such choices as waivers of claims of error, <i>United States v. Yu-Leung,</i> 51 F.3d 1116, 1121-22 (2d Cir.1995), others might say that there is no error at all when counsel is content and foregoes an optional objection. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 459 F.3d 1276, 1299-1304 (11th Cir.2006) (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the claim of plain error fails here because there is no indication that the Fifth Amendment reference or the lack of a cautionary instruction probably altered the result. <i>United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. 74, 82, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). The government never charged LeMoure with tampering with Weddleton's testimony and never argued to the jury that the Fifth Amendment suggestion betrayed some improper motive bearing on counts involving other witnesses with whom LeMoure clearly tampered. Given the ample evidence of the latter, nothing in the Weddleton episode carried much weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeMoure's last argument concerns his sentencing. The guideline calculations were complicated partly because the guidelines required separate calculations for one group of offenses related to the civil case and another to the grand jury proceeding. The calculation followed by the district court is set forth in the appendix to this decision; but the dispute in this case relates only to one decision: a cross-reference required at one stage in the calculation process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an offense involves obstructing the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, the guidelines instruct that the base offense level should be that of an accessory after the fact for the underlying crime if that level is greater than the offense level for obstruction itself. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2(c)(1). An accessory after the fact is assigned an offense level 6 levels below that prescribed for the underlying offense. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2X3.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-sentence report (\"PSR\") determined that the underlying offense under investigation by the grand jury was a violation of federal civil rights, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242-of which LeMoure was charged, but on which the jury deadlocked-but that guideline directs the use of the guideline for the conduct underlying the civil rights offense, if the latter's offense level is higher than level 10. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(a)(1), (3)(A). The PSR concluded that the offense conduct underlying the section 242 charge was aggravated assault, with a base offense level of 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aggravated assault is assault that involved \"a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2A2.2 app. n.1. In this case, the dangerous weapon was the flashlight that (according to Fratus) LeMoure used to beat Fratus. The PSR then added four levels for use of a dangerous weapon, three more for bodily injury, six levels because LeMoure was a public official, and two more because of LeMoure's managerial role. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 2A2.2(b)(2)(B), 2A2.2(b)(3)(A), 2H1.1(b)(1), 3B1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other adjustments, not themselves in dispute, led to a combined offense level of 24 and, after factoring in criminal history, a guideline range of 51 to 63 months. After considering the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553, the court imposed a sentence of 48 months. But for the decision to cross-reference the aggravated assault guideline, the ultimate offense level would have been lower and the sentence might have been lower as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeMoure objects that the grand jury did not charge him with using a flashlight to beat Fratus. Instead, the indictment merely alleged that he \"willfully assault[ed Fratus] by forcibly removing him from the . . . car, throwing him to the ground, and striking and kneeing him in the head.\" LeMoure also says that grand jury testimony by a doctor raises doubts about the use of a flashlight and that, at the very least, he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on whether he used a flashlight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross-reference looks to what the grand jury was investigating, not what indictment was returned or what crime actually occurred. <i>United States v. Conley,</i> 186 F.3d 7, 23-24 (1st Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> 529 U.S. 1017, 120 S.Ct. 1417, 146 L.Ed.2d 310 (2000). Otherwise, \"obstructors of justice would benefit from . . . obstruction that successfully persuaded a grand jury not to return an indictment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25. Nor is LeMoure's knowledge of the specific offenses under investigation relevant. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court found that the grand jury was investigating the beating as an aggravated assault, given Fratus' allegations that LeMoure had used a flashlight as a weapon. This factual determination was not clearly erroneous. Whether LeMoure did in fact use his flashlight to beat Fratus is not controlling. For the same reason, an evidentiary hearing as to the use of the flashlight was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR, which the district court adopted, began by dividing the counts into two groups. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.1 (2004). Group 1 contained the counts relating to the civil case; Group 2 contained the counts relating to the grand jury investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, the guidelines prescribe a base offense level of 14 for obstruction of justice. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2. This offense level was adjusted upward by 4 levels to reflect LeMoure's role as an organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants, yielding an offense level of 18. This offense level applied to Group 1. However, the guidelines provide that, \"if the offense involved obstructing the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense\" &#8212; a condition that applied to Group 2 but not Group 1 &#8212; then the sentencing court should apply section 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) if the resulting offense level would be greater. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2X3.1, in turn, provides for an offense level 6 levels lower than the underlying offense. In this case, the PSR determined that the underlying offense was the violation of section 242 charged in Count One; the guideline applicable to that offense is section 2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights). In pertinent part, section 2H1.1 prescribes a base offense level that is the greater of 10, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(a)(3)(A), or \"the offense level from the offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(a)(1). The PSR determined that the offense underlying the section 242 charge was aggravated assault, defined as an assault that involved \"a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 app. n.1. The PSR identified the flashlight allegedly used to beat Fratus as the dangerous weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guideline for aggravated assault, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, provides for a base offense level of 14, to which the PSR added 4 levels for use of a dangerous weapon, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(2)(B), and 3 levels for bodily injury, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(A), for an offense level of 21. The PSR then returned to the section 2H1.1, and increased the offense level of the cross-referenced aggravated assault an additional 6 levels because LeMoure was a public official at the time of the offense, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(b)(1), yielding an offense level of 27. Referring back to section 2X3.1, the PSR subtracted 6 levels for a base offense level of 21, and adjusted that level upward by 2 levels because of LeMoure's managerial role, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), for a total Group 2 offense level of 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As directed by section 3D1.3, the PSR applied the Group 2 offense level of 23 because it was higher than the Group 1 offense level of 18. To account for Group 1, it added one level, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4, for a combined offense level of 24. Given LeMoure's criminal history, that offense level yielded a range of 51 to 63 months. After considering the section 3553 factors, the court imposed a sentence of 48 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Both were convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (2000) (Count Two); witness tampering,<i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(b), in connection with Tordiglione's deposition (Count Five), DeLuca's deposition (Count Six), and DeLuca's grand jury testimony (Count Twelve); subornation of perjury, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1622, in connection with DeLuca's deposition (Count Eight); and obstruction of justice, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1503, for fabricating witness testimony in the civil case (Count Nine) and for attempting to persuade DeLuca and Tordiglione to give false testimony to the grand jury (Count Ten).

The background events are readily summarized, taking a balanced view of the facts consistent with record support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early on June 24, 2000, LeMoure pursued and pulled over a car driven by Stephen Duong and accused a passenger &#8212; Peter Fratus &#8212; of making an insulting gesture directed to LeMoure. LeMoure dragged Fratus from the car, threw him to the ground, punched him and kneed him in the head (whether LeMoure also hit him in the head with a flashlight was disputed at trial). Fratus thereafter filed a complaint with the Boston Police Department, which was investigated by the Department's Internal Affairs Division (\"IAD\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2001, Polito &#8212; a friend and subordinate of LeMoure's &#8212; approached his close friends Dante Tordiglione and Biagio DeLuca and asked them to give false statements to the IAD supporting LeMoure. When they agreed, Polito instructed them concerning the content of those statements. LeMoure asked his close friend Joseph Weddleton to help him secure a \"witness\" to the incident. Weddleton approached Ralph DeRota, a mutual friend who lived near the location of the incident, to request that he give a false statement to the IAD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the statements given by Tordiglione, DeLuca, and DeRota, LeMoure was suspended. Fratus then filed a civil suit against LeMoure. In the summer of 2002, prior to a deposition in the civil case, Weddleton met with DeRota at LeMoure's suggestion to refresh DeRota's memory of his false IAD testimony, which DeRota then repeated in the deposition. When DeLuca and Tordiglione hesitated to lie at their own depositions, LeMoure and Polito pressed them to stand fast. Polito provided DeLuca and Tordiglione with copies of their false statements to the IAD in order to prepare them for their depositions. LeMoure also offered to pay Tordiglione $10,000 for his trouble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeLuca repeated his false IAD testimony in his deposition; Tordiglione claimed not to remember the incident, but stated that his IAD testimony was true and based on his memory. LeMoure, who was also deposed, testified that he did not strike Fratus or pull him out of the car, and that he had not met DeRota, DeLuca, or Tordiglione prior to their coming forward as witnesses. The civil suit settled, but a grand jury investigation of the incident had begun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When DeLuca was subpoenaed by the grand jury, LeMoure urged him to stick with his story, and Polito gave him $7,000 for his attorney's fees, stating that the money came from LeMoure. Polito also met with Tordiglione and DeLuca concerning DeLuca's subpoena; in response to Tordiglione's expression of concern, Polito urged the two not to waver. In the end, Tordiglione and DeRota testified truthfully to the grand jury in exchange for immunity, and DeLuca did so in exchange for a plea agreement including a government recommendation of probation. In July 2003, Polito and LeMoure were indicted for a succession of offenses relating to their obstructive conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury trial, Polito and LeMoure were convicted on the counts listed in the margin, including conspiracy, witness tampering, perjury and subornation, and obstruction of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thereafter, they were sentenced to terms of 36 and 48 months, respectively. They now appeal; most of the claims raise issues of law which we review <i>de novo, United States v.

He points out that Congress in 1982 amended section 1503 to eliminate any explicit reference to \"witnesses\" and enacted in its place the witness tampering statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512. Victim and Witness Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 97-291 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that although section 1503 was amended to remove any explicit reference to witnesses, its omnibus \"due administration of justice\" clause continues to cover witness tampering. Pertinently, section 1503 makes it unlawful to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">corruptly . . . endeavor[] to influence . . . any grand or petit juror, or officer in or of any court of the United States . . . or corruptly . . . influence[], obstruct[], or impede[], or endeavor[] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1512(b)(1) focuses on witnesses (as well as victims and informants), and makes it unlawful to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">knowingly use[] intimidation, threaten[], or corruptly persuade[] another person, or attempt[] to do so, or engage[] in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to &#8212; (1) influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, Polito is supported by the canon, instructive rather than mandatory, that a specific treatment prevails over a more general provision, <i>United States v. Lara,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764882\"><a href=\"/opinion/764882/united-states-v-giovanni-lara-appellantno-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 198 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></span> (1999); the canon has added force where, as here, the term \"witness\" was deleted from the broader statute at the same time the new, more specific statute was adopted. The Second Circuit has taken this restrictive view, but the other circuits that have spoken on this issue are all opposed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and with good reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1503 was enacted with two objectives: to protect witnesses, jurors, and court officers, <i>and</i> to \"prevent a miscarriage of Justice by corrupt methods.\" <i>United States v. Lester,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445280\"><a href=\"/opinion/445280/united-states-v-gary-lester-united-states-of-america-v-leroy-obie/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1288</span></a></span>, 1292 (9th Cir.1984). The term \"witness\" was indeed deleted in 1982 from the first clause of section 1503; but Congress left intact the omnibus clause forbidding efforts to obstruct the due administration of justice, which had previously been read by courts to encompass the corrupt persuasion of witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, when section 1512 was initially enacted in 1982, it dealt only with the use or threat of force against a witness; the ban on corrupt persuasion was added only later in 1988. Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub.L. 100-690, &#167; 7029(c) (1988). It is improbable that, in 1982, Congress meant to adopt (in section 1512) a specific ban against forcible intimidation while impliedly narrowing (in section 1503) the omnibus clause so as to decriminalize corrupt but non-forcible interference with witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, over and above the general presumption against repeals merely by implication, <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span> (1976), <i>this</i> implied repeal would mean that Congress had meant in 1982 to <i>reduce</i> the protection afforded against soft witness tampering at the very time that it was trying to <i>expand</i> protection of witnesses. Yet the statute's purpose was \"to enhance and protect the necessary role of . . . witnesses in the criminal justice process . . . .\" Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-291, &#167; 2(b)(1)-(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we reach this result without any reliance on post-1982 legislative history, it completes the story to note Senator Biden's statement in 1988 when Congress amended section 1512 to cover non-coercive witness tampering. In reporting the bill out of committee, Senator Biden explained the amendment as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">intended . . . merely to include in section 1512 the same protection of witnesses from non-coercive influence that <i>was (and is)</i> found in section 1503. It would permit prosecution of such conduct in the Second Circuit, where it is not now permitted, and would <i>allow</i> such prosecutions in other circuits to be brought under section 1512 rather than under the catch-all provision of section 1503.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">134 Cong. Rec. S17,369 (1988) (statement of Sen. Biden) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito's next argument concerns the phrase \"misleading conduct\" in the witness tampering statute, section 1512(b)(1). That statute makes unlawful \"misleading conduct toward another person\" in order \"to influence the testimony of any person\" <i>and</i> efforts to \"corruptly persuade\" another person in order to influence his testimony. The evidence easily supported a conviction on this latter theory. But, Polito argues, the jury might have relied instead on the \"misleading conduct\" phrase, thinking it sufficient that he had merely asked a <i>witness</i> to engage in misleading conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was told (twice) that the <i>defendant</i> had to \"engag[e] in misleading conduct\" toward another person with the intent to influence, delay or prevent \"the testimony of a person\" in the proceeding. Moreover, the evidence of corrupt persuasion was overwhelming; it is highly improbable that the jury would instead have convicted on a less salient misleading-the-tribunal theory, even assuming that the instructions did not adequately negate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito makes two other related attacks on the instructions as to section 1512(b)(1). First, he says, the court did not sufficiently explain that, under the statute, the corrupt persuasion must be done \"knowingly\" &#8212; a term that <i>Arthur Andersen, LLP v.

At trial, both Polito and the government had focused on \"corrupt\" rather than on \"knowingly\" as the key to scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our case the term \"knowingly\" was included in the instructions but not with the gloss (\"consciousness of wrongdoing\") later supplied by <i>Arthur Andersen.</i> The government says that the judge's instruction on the meaning of \"corruptly\" &#8212; that the jury must find that the defendant acted \"with an improper purpose\" &#8212; necessarily entails consciousness of wrongdoing. An instructing judge who took <i>Arthur Andersen</i> for all it could be worth might find this equation debatable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the situation in <i>Arthur Andersen</i> was dramatically different than the one here.

This was not a case of mere lies to investigators disconnected from proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boilerplate instructions as to section 1512 given after <i>Arthur Andersen</i> are likely to be different than those used in cases like this one, tried before <i>Arthur Andersen.</i> But neither of the concerns that legitimately troubled the Supreme Court were presented by the facts in this case. Failure to anticipate post-trial changes in the law can pose troubling issues, but in this case, the understandable failure to anticipate future precedent had no ill effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polito's next set of claims are that certain of the counts are duplicative in violation of double jeopardy principles.

Parallel counts were charged concerning the grand jury testimony. In Count Ten, Polito was charged with obstructing the grand jury by fabricating witness testimony; Counts Eleven and Twelve charged him with tampering with specific grand jury witnesses. But under the <i>Blockburger</i> test, whether two offenses are the same depends on the elements of the crimes and not the similarity of underlying facts. 284 U.S. at 304, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Again, the answer is the same: witness tampering under section 1512(b)(1) and subornation of perjury under section 1622 each require an element that the other does not, so neither can be a lesser included offense as to the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1622 requires proof of actual perjury, while section 1512(b)(1) does not; the latter is directed at specified acts of tampering. Conversely, section 1512(b)(1) requires proof of a nexus with \"an official proceeding\"; by contrast, section 1622 can be satisfied by procuring a person to lie materially in \"any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1621, without any nexus to an official proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to LeMoure's arguments. As to his conviction, LeMoure says that the district court erred concerning a single piece of testimony. During the trial, Weddleton testified that he had talked with LeMoure shortly before he (Weddleton) was to appear before the grand jury, and that LeMoure had raised the possibility that Weddleton might plead his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. LeMoure's trial counsel did not object or request a cautionary instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeMoure now says that it was plain error for the judge to fail to caution the jury that this mention of the Fifth Amendment did not constitute witness tampering. We will assume <i>arguendo</i> that, had LeMoure requested a cautionary instruction, the court's failure to give one would have been error. Whether the failure to give the instruction sua sponte can be regarded as error at all is a quite different question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a judge misstates the law in an instruction, this is error. But if counsel has not objected to evidence or asked for a cautionary instruction, it does not necessarily follow that the judge has erred by tolerating the evidence or withholding a caution. Lawyers sometimes think that \"objectionable\" testimony from an adverse witness helps more than it hurts or that a cautionary instruction will underscore testimony best ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court is not required to \"act <i>sua sponte</i> to override seemingly plausible strategic choices on the part of counseled defendants.\" <i>United States v.

The government never charged LeMoure with tampering with Weddleton's testimony and never argued to the jury that the Fifth Amendment suggestion betrayed some improper motive bearing on counts involving other witnesses with whom LeMoure clearly tampered. Given the ample evidence of the latter, nothing in the Weddleton episode carried much weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeMoure's last argument concerns his sentencing. The guideline calculations were complicated partly because the guidelines required separate calculations for one group of offenses related to the civil case and another to the grand jury proceeding. The calculation followed by the district court is set forth in the appendix to this decision; but the dispute in this case relates only to one decision: a cross-reference required at one stage in the calculation process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an offense involves obstructing the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, the guidelines instruct that the base offense level should be that of an accessory after the fact for the underlying crime if that level is greater than the offense level for obstruction itself. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2(c)(1). An accessory after the fact is assigned an offense level 6 levels below that prescribed for the underlying offense. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2X3.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-sentence report (\"PSR\") determined that the underlying offense under investigation by the grand jury was a violation of federal civil rights, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242-of which LeMoure was charged, but on which the jury deadlocked-but that guideline directs the use of the guideline for the conduct underlying the civil rights offense, if the latter's offense level is higher than level 10. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(a)(1), (3)(A). The PSR concluded that the offense conduct underlying the section 242 charge was aggravated assault, with a base offense level of 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aggravated assault is assault that involved \"a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2A2.2 app. n.1. In this case, the dangerous weapon was the flashlight that (according to Fratus) LeMoure used to beat Fratus. The PSR then added four levels for use of a dangerous weapon, three more for bodily injury, six levels because LeMoure was a public official, and two more because of LeMoure's managerial role. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 2A2.2(b)(2)(B), 2A2.2(b)(3)(A), 2H1.1(b)(1), 3B1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other adjustments, not themselves in dispute, led to a combined offense level of 24 and, after factoring in criminal history, a guideline range of 51 to 63 months. After considering the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553, the court imposed a sentence of 48 months. But for the decision to cross-reference the aggravated assault guideline, the ultimate offense level would have been lower and the sentence might have been lower as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeMoure objects that the grand jury did not charge him with using a flashlight to beat Fratus. Instead, the indictment merely alleged that he \"willfully assault[ed Fratus] by forcibly removing him from the . . . car, throwing him to the ground, and striking and kneeing him in the head.\" LeMoure also says that grand jury testimony by a doctor raises doubts about the use of a flashlight and that, at the very least, he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on whether he used a flashlight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross-reference looks to what the grand jury was investigating, not what indictment was returned or what crime actually occurred. <i>United States v.

This factual determination was not clearly erroneous. Whether LeMoure did in fact use his flashlight to beat Fratus is not controlling. For the same reason, an evidentiary hearing as to the use of the flashlight was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR, which the district court adopted, began by dividing the counts into two groups. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.1 (2004). Group 1 contained the counts relating to the civil case; Group 2 contained the counts relating to the grand jury investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, the guidelines prescribe a base offense level of 14 for obstruction of justice. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2. This offense level was adjusted upward by 4 levels to reflect LeMoure's role as an organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants, yielding an offense level of 18. This offense level applied to Group 1. However, the guidelines provide that, \"if the offense involved obstructing the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense\" &#8212; a condition that applied to Group 2 but not Group 1 &#8212; then the sentencing court should apply section 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) if the resulting offense level would be greater. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.2(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2X3.1, in turn, provides for an offense level 6 levels lower than the underlying offense. In this case, the PSR determined that the underlying offense was the violation of section 242 charged in Count One; the guideline applicable to that offense is section 2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights). In pertinent part, section 2H1.1 prescribes a base offense level that is the greater of 10, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(a)(3)(A), or \"the offense level from the offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(a)(1). The PSR determined that the offense underlying the section 242 charge was aggravated assault, defined as an assault that involved \"a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2 app. n.1. The PSR identified the flashlight allegedly used to beat Fratus as the dangerous weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guideline for aggravated assault, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, provides for a base offense level of 14, to which the PSR added 4 levels for use of a dangerous weapon, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(2)(B), and 3 levels for bodily injury, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(A), for an offense level of 21. The PSR then returned to the section 2H1.1, and increased the offense level of the cross-referenced aggravated assault an additional 6 levels because LeMoure was a public official at the time of the offense, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2H1.1(b)(1), yielding an offense level of 27. Referring back to section 2X3.1, the PSR subtracted 6 levels for a base offense level of 21, and adjusted that level upward by 2 levels because of LeMoure's managerial role, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), for a total Group 2 offense level of 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As directed by section 3D1.3, the PSR applied the Group 2 offense level of 23 because it was higher than the Group 1 offense level of 18. To account for Group 1, it added one level, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4, for a combined offense level of 24. Given LeMoure's criminal history, that offense level yielded a range of 51 to 63 months. After considering the section 3553 factors, the court imposed a sentence of 48 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Both were convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (2000) (Count Two); witness tampering,<i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(b), in connection with Tordiglione's deposition (Count Five), DeLuca's deposition (Count Six), and DeLuca's grand jury testimony (Count Twelve); subornation of perjury, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1622, in connection with DeLuca's deposition (Count Eight); and obstruction of justice, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1503, for fabricating witness testimony in the civil case (Count Nine) and for attempting to persuade DeLuca and Tordiglione to give false testimony to the grand jury (Count Ten).
