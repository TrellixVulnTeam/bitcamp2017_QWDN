Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Irma R. Valldejuli for appellants.\n     Mónica I. De Jesús Santana, with whom Fiddler González &\nRodríguez. PSC, was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           March 1, 2010\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge. This case calls on us to navigate\n\nthe turbulent waters of Colorado River abstention.                   That doctrine,\n\nestablished in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United\n\nStates, 424 U.S. 800 (1976), allows federal courts in limited\n\ninstances      to    stay   or    dismiss    proceedings      that    overlap    with\n\nconcurrent litigation in state court.\n\n              The plaintiffs here originally sued in federal district\n\ncourt, asserting diversity jurisdiction.                 They later commenced an\n\nidentical action in a Puerto Rico Commonwealth court during what\n\nthey considered to be a burdensomely long pendency of a motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to join an indispensable party.                        The federal\n\ncourt eventually granted the motion to dismiss, leaving the action\n\nin   the    Commonwealth     court    to    proceed      alone.      The    plaintiffs\n\nappealed from the federal dismissal and now ask us to reinstate the\n\ndiversity      suit    to   its    parallel      track    alongside    the     ongoing\n\nCommonwealth litigation.            The defendants argue not only that we\n\nshould affirm the dismissal for lack of an indispensable party, but\n\nalso,      among    other   things,   that       the   Commonwealth-court       action\n\nprovides an alternative ground for disposing of the federal case\n\nunder Colorado River.            We conclude that the narrow conditions for\n\nColorado River abstention are met here.                    We therefore stay the\n\nfederal proceedings pending the outcome of the Commonwealth-court\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fI. Background\n\n          Since the district court did not reach the merits, we\n\nprovide a \"condensed version of the dispute.\"     Tell v. Trs. of\n\nDartmouth Coll., 145 F.3d 417, 418 (1st Cir. 1998).    On December\n\n22, 1998, Manuel Molina-Godinez, the plaintiffs' decedent, sold the\n\ndefendants 100% of the stock in an apartment complex development\n\nknown as Isabela Beach Court.     Molina-Godinez agreed to manage\n\nIsabela Beach Court in exchange for a monthly fee and 18% of the\n\nproceeds after the complex's completion and the sale of all units.\n\nIn addition, before construction began, Molina-Godinez verbally\n\nagreed to buy one of the penthouses in Isabela Beach Court for\n\n$220,000, and the defendants reserved the unit for him.       This\n\nagreement was later confirmed in writing.   For reasons unspecified\n\nat this stage, the defendants dispute the scope and validity of\n\nthese agreements.\n\n          On January 3, 2003, Molina-Godinez died. Construction of\n\nIsabela Beach Court was completed at some point after his death and\n\nall of the units were sold successfully.       On March 27, 2007,\n\nMolina-Godinez's widow, plaintiff Sonia I. Jiménez, commenced an\n\naction in the federal district court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico asserting that she was entitled to half of her late husband's\n\n18% share, which had never been paid.   Additionally, she sought to\n\nexercise his option on the penthouse apartment that had allegedly\n\nbeen reserved for him.   Because Jiménez was a Florida resident and\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fthe defendants were all Puerto Rico residents, she claimed that the\n\ndistrict court had diversity jurisdiction over the matter.\n\n          The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to join an\n\nindispensable party under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.    They argued that the case could not proceed without\n\nMolina-Godinez's three other heirs, two of whom were also Puerto\n\nRico residents.    Because joinder of the Puerto Rico heirs would\n\ndefeat complete diversity, the defendants maintained, dismissal was\n\ncompulsory.\n\n          On August 10, 2007, Jiménez amended the complaint to join\n\nthe one diverse heir while still excluding the non-diverse heirs.\n\nShe also altered her theory of the case, explaining that she was\n\nnow seeking the contractual proceeds on behalf of Molina-Godinez's\n\nestate rather than for herself alone.   She claimed that she could\n\nadequately protect the interests of the non-diverse heirs and that,\n\nas a result, the action did not depend on their joinder.       The\n\namended complaint asked the court to award any judgment to the\n\nestate, where it could be allocated to heirs and creditors by a\n\nPuerto Rico probate court at some later date.\n\n          The addition of the diverse heir as a named plaintiff did\n\nnot, however, affect the substance of the defendants' argument.\n\nThe defendants renewed their motion to dismiss, maintaining that\n\nJiménez was not an adequate representative of the estate and that\n\nan adverse judgment could affect the non-diverse heirs' interests.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fAccording to them, neither the case's new posture nor the joinder\n\nof the one diverse heir would lessen the indispensability of the\n\nnon-diverse heirs.   The plaintiffs filed their response three days\n\nlater.\n\n          Over six months passed without any further action from\n\nthe court.   On March 27, 2008, the plaintiffs sought to learn the\n\nstatus of the pending motion to dismiss, but the docket does not\n\nindicate a response from the court.    On August 29, 2008, after an\n\nadditional five months, the plaintiffs filed a parallel complaint\n\nin the Court of First Instance for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nUnlike the federal action, this second suit joined all of Molina-\n\nGodinez's heirs as parties.\n\n          On December 12, 2008, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss.     Jiménez v. Rodríguez-Pagán, 254\n\nF.R.D. 151 (D.P.R. 2008).     This appeal followed.   Meanwhile, the\n\nCommonwealth action has progressed in due course and is now into\n\nthe discovery stage.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n          The defendants-appellees present three different possible\n\ngrounds to deny appellate relief to the plaintiffs-appellants.\n\nFirst, they argue that this case involves matters that fall within\n\nthe probate exception to diversity jurisdiction and thus cannot be\n\nadjudicated in federal court. Second, they reiterate their Rule 19\n\nclaim that the non-diverse heirs remain indispensable.      Finally,\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthey ask us to abstain under Colorado River and allow the Puerto\n\nRico court to resolve the case.          Though we reject the first of\n\nthese arguments and harbor considerable skepticism as to the\n\nsecond, we ultimately agree that this case warrants Colorado River\n\nabstention.1\n\n                        A. The Probate Exception\n\n             It has been said that \"[t]he probate exception is one of\n\nthe most mysterious and esoteric branches of the law of federal\n\njurisdiction.\"      Dragan v. Miller, 679 F.2d 712, 713 (7th Cir.\n\n1982).     Once more unto the breach.2\n\n             The probate exception is a judge-made doctrine stemming\n\nfrom the original conferral of federal equity jurisdiction in the\n\nJudiciary Act of 1789. The ambit of that jurisdiction, coterminous\n\nwith that exercised by the framers' contemporaries in the English\n\ncourts of chancery, \"did not extend to probate matters.\"       Markham\n\nv. Allen, 326 U.S. 490, 494 (1946).       The Supreme Court accordingly\n\nheld in Markham that federal courts have no authority to \"interfere\n\nwith the probate proceedings or assume general jurisdiction of the\n\n\n     1\n      Under different circumstances, we might proceed directly to\nthe dispositive Colorado River analysis, bypassing the other two\nquestions. In this case, however, a cursory treatment of those\nquestions does not suffice. Were the probate exception to apply\nhere, we would have no subject matter jurisdiction over this\ndispute, and we think it appropriate to determine our own\njurisdiction at the outset. The Rule 19 issue merits its own\nanalysis because it factors into our eventual determination to\nabstain.\n     2\n         See William Shakespeare, King Henry the Fifth, act 3, sc. 1.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fprobate or control of the property in the custody of the state\n\ncourt.\"    Id.\n\n            Yet \"stating the probate exception has proven easier than\n\napplying it.\"      Umsted v. Umsted, 446 F.3d 17, 20 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    After Markham, just what would constitute \"interfere[nce]\n\nwith the probate proceedings\" proved notoriously difficult to pin\n\ndown.     When we last had the opportunity to consider the doctrine\n\nnearly a decade ago, we acknowledged that \"the precise scope of the\n\nprobate exception has not been clearly established.\"            Mangieri v.\n\nMangieri,    226   F.3d   1,   2   (1st   Cir.   2000)   (internal   brackets\n\nomitted).\n\n            Since then, the Supreme Court has revisited the issue and\n\nilluminated matters somewhat.         In Marshall v. Marshall, the Court\n\nexplained that\n\n            the “interference” language in Markham [is]\n            essentially a reiteration of the general\n            principle that, when one court is exercising\n            in rem jurisdiction over a res, a second court\n            will not assume in rem jurisdiction over the\n            same res.      Thus, the probate exception\n            reserves to state probate courts the probate\n            or annulment of a will and the administration\n            of a decedent's estate; it also precludes\n            federal courts from endeavoring to dispose of\n            property that is in the custody of a state\n            probate court.   But it does not bar federal\n            courts from adjudicating matters outside those\n            confines   and    otherwise   within   federal\n            jurisdiction.\n\n547 U.S. 293, 311-12 (2006) (citations omitted).              Marshall made\n\nclear that the scope of the probate exception is \"distinctly\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\flimited.\"    Id. at 296; cf. Mooney v. Mooney, 471 F.3d 246, 248 (1st\n\nCir.   2006)   (noting   that    the   Supreme   Court   in   Marshall   also\n\nemphasized the narrow scope of the domestic relations exception).\n\n            The case before us does not fall within that limited\n\nscope.    \"[W]here exercise of federal jurisdiction will result in a\n\njudgment that does not dispose of property in the custody of a\n\nstate probate court, even though the judgment may be intertwined\n\nwith and binding on those state proceedings, the federal courts\n\nretain their jurisdiction.\"        Lefkowitz v. Bank of N.Y., 528 F.3d\n\n102, 106 (2d Cir. 2007).        The only property at issue in this case\n\nis the proceeds from the sale of the Isabela Beach Court units and\n\nthe penthouse apartment on which Molina-Godinez allegedly held an\n\noption to purchase.      Because neither the money nor the apartment\n\nare yet part of the decedent's estate, neither are yet in the\n\ncustody of a Puerto Rico probate court.           Indeed, the very relief\n\nsought here is enlargement of the decedent's estate through assets\n\nnot currently within it.           While divvying up an estate falls\n\nsquarely within the probate exception, merely increasing it does\n\nnot.     Gustafson v. zumBrunnen, 546 F.3d 398, 400 (7th Cir. 2008)\n\n(finding that the probate exception did not apply because \"the\n\njudgment sought would just add assets to the decedent's estate\"\n\nrather than \"reallocat[ing] the estate's assets among contending\n\nclaimants or otherwise interfer[ing] with the probate court's\n\ncontrol over and administration of the estate\").\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f                               B. Rule 19\n\n          We review a district court's Rule 19 determinations for\n\nabuse of discretion.     Picciotto v. Cont'l Cas. Co., 512 F.3d 9, 14-\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2008).     Because the decision to dismiss for lack of an\n\nindispensable   party     \"involve[s]    the   balancing    of   competing\n\ninterests and must be steeped in pragmatic considerations,\" id. at\n\n14 (internal quotation marks omitted), we will reverse only if \"the\n\ndistrict court makes an error of law or relies significantly on an\n\nimproper factor, omits a significant factor, or makes a clear error\n\nof judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\" Id. at 15 (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n          Rule 19 is designed to protect the interests of parties\n\nwho are not yet involved in ongoing litigation.            To measure how\n\ncritical those interests are, the rule instructs courts to engage\n\nin a two-part analysis.     See Pujol v. Shearson Am. Exp., Inc., 877\n\nF.2d 132, 134 (1st Cir. 1989).          Parties should be joined, when\n\nfeasible, if they are \"necessary\" to the action according to the\n\ncriteria laid out in Rule 19(a).3        If a necessary party cannot be\n\n\n     3\n      The term \"necessary\" is a vestige of a superseded version of\nRule 19 and no longer appears in the text. Rule 19(a) now speaks\nonly of \"Persons Required to be Joined if Feasible.\" Nevertheless,\nmany circuits (including this one) continue to cling to the\ntraditional nomenclature.    See Confederated Tribes of Chehalis\nIndian Reservation v. Lujan, 928 F.2d 1496, 1501 n.1 (9th Cir.\n1991) (O'Scainnlain, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). Lest there be any confusion, the word is used as a term of\nart and signifies desirability rather than actual necessity.\nParties are not truly necessary in the vernacular sense of the word\n\"unless and until they satisfy the terms of Rule 19(b).\" Id.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fjoined in the action without divesting the court of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction,    Rule    19(b)   lays      out   additional   criteria    for\n\ndetermining whether that party is \"indispensable.\"             If the court\n\nfinds that party is anything less than indispensable, the case\n\nproceeds without her.     If, on the other hand, the court finds that\n\nthe litigation cannot proceed in the party's absence, the court\n\nmust dismiss the case.      See B. Fernandez & Hnos, Inc. v. Kellogg\n\nUSA, Inc., 516 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Ultimately, the unsettled state of governing Puerto Rico\n\nlaw hampers our ability to adjudicate this issue definitively.\n\nAssuming for the purposes of argument that the district court\n\nexercised its discretion properly in finding that the non-diverse\n\nheirs were necessary parties under Rule 19(a), we proceed directly\n\nto the indispensability analysis under Rule 19(b).            See Delgado v.\n\nPlaza Las Americas, Inc., 139 F.3d 1, 3 n.2 (1st Cir. 1998) (per\n\ncuriam) (noting that parties cannot be indispensable under Rule\n\n19(b) unless they are first deemed necessary under Rule 19(a)).\n\nThe \"critical question\" in the Rule 19(b) context is \"'whether in\n\nequity   and   good   conscience'   the     action   may   proceed   in   [the\n\nnecessary party]'s absence.\" B. Fernandez, 516 F.3d at 23 (quoting\n\nFed. R. Civ P. 19(b)).    To answer that question, the district court\n\nmust consider four factors specified in the Rule:\n\n           (1)the extent to which a judgment rendered in\n           the person's absence might prejudice that\n           person person or the existing parties; (2) the\n           extent to which any prejudice could be\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          lessened   or  avoided   by   (A)   protective\n          provisions in the judgment; (B) shaping the\n          relief; or (C) other measures; (3) whether a\n          judgment rendered in the person's absence will\n          be adequate; and (4) whether the plaintiff\n          would have an adequate remedy if the action\n          were dismissed for non-joinder.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).\n\n          The    district   court    emphasized   the   first    and   third\n\nfactors, finding that a judgment rendered in the non-diverse heirs'\n\nabsence could potentially prejudice their interests.            It reasoned\n\nthat since each heir possesses a right to part of Molina-Godinez's\n\nestate, any ruling on the sums due to the estate under the alleged\n\ncontract would affect each heir's individual portion.           In order to\n\nadequately protect his or her interest in that portion, each heir\n\nwas therefore entitled to participate in the litigation, even to\n\nthe point of eliminating federal diversity jurisdiction.\n\n          We are not so sure.       In Puerto Rico, the decedent's as-\n\nyet undivided estate is known as a community of property.               See,\n\ne.g., Arias-Rosado v. Gonzalez Tirado, 111 F. Supp. 2d 96, 99\n\n(D.P.R. 2000).    On several occasions, the federal district court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico has interpreted Puerto Rico law to\n\nprovide that an individual participant in a community of property\n\ndoes not impair other participants' interests merely by asserting\n\ncommon legal rights to the property while the other participants\n\nare absent.     \"Any judgment in favor of one or more participants\n\nbenefits all other participants in a community of property whereas\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fan adverse judgment only prejudices the one who filed the judicial\n\naction.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Rodriguez-\n\nRivera v. Rivera Rios, No. 06-1381, 2009 WL 564221, at *3 (D.P.R.\n\nMar. 5, 2009); Ruiz-Hance v. P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth., 596 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 223, 230 (D.P.R. 2009); Cintron v. San Juan Gas, 79 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 16, 19 (D.P.R. 1999).         In Arias-Rosado, a Rule 19\n\nchallenge to a survivorship action, the court went on to hold that\n\n\"a favorable judgment to [the individual heir litigating in federal\n\ncourt] will be dispositive of the survivorship claim and benefit\n\nthe absent heirs.      However, an unfavorable judgment will only\n\nprejudice her and not the absent heirs[,] who still will have\n\navailable the suit filed in state court wherein they asserted the\n\nsurvivorship claim.\"    111 F. Supp. 2d at 99; see also Rodriguez-\n\nRivera, 2009 WL 564221 at *3; Ruiz-Hance, 596 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n229–30; Cintron, F. Supp. 2d at 19.\n\n          Taking these cases at face value, as the plaintiffs urge\n\nus to, it appears that the federal suit here is something of a free\n\nshot for the non-diverse heirs.    Success inures to their benefit\n\nwhile failure is costless.   Surely there can be no impairment when\n\nthey stand to lose nothing.     If the plaintiffs are providing a\n\ncorrect statement of the local law, they would appear to be the\n\nbest of all possible representatives for the absentees' interests:\n\nthe kind that may very well help but cannot hurt.    See Tell, 145\n\nF.3d at 419 (\"If an absent party's interests are the same as those\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fof an existing party, and the existing party will adequately\n\nprotect those interests, this bears on whether the absent party's\n\ninterest will be impaired by its absence from the litigation.\").\n\n          At    this    juncture,   however,   we   cannot     state   this\n\nproposition as anything other than a conditional hypothetical. The\n\nplaintiffs' interpretation of Puerto Rico community property law is\n\nfar from certain.      To begin with, the cases on which the plaintiffs\n\nrely sound exclusively in tort.        Seizing on this, the defendants\n\nhave urged us to limit the applicability of those cases to wrongful\n\ndeath and survivorship actions. When pressed at oral argument, the\n\nplaintiffs could not cite a single authority suggesting that their\n\ninterpretation of the relevant law extends to contract claims.\n\n          This puts us in an awkward position.      On the one hand, we\n\nwould find it somewhat strange if the rule did indeed govern non-\n\ntorts actions yet had failed to produce any reported decisions to\n\nthat effect.    It is hard to say that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion when the ostensible abuse is a matter of unsettled law.\n\nOn the other hand, none of the four cases that the plaintiffs cite\n\nfacially limits itself to tort claims.         Those cases draw their\n\nlogical force not from any idiosyncrasy in Puerto Rico's tort law,\n\nbut from Puerto Rico's community-of-property law.            This may make\n\nthe defendants' argument a good candidate for a distinction without\n\na difference.    Contractual proceeds due to the decedent belong to\n\nthe undivided estate just as much as a wrongful death judgment.\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fAll things considered, we have an insufficient basis to accept\n\neither the plaintiffs' or the defendants' readings of the case law.\n\n          A second difficulty remains. Suppose that the plaintiffs\n\nhere are successful in securing some monetary damages under the\n\ncontract, but not the full amount that they seek.                Does that\n\nconstitute a successful judgment sufficient to bind the non-diverse\n\nheirs under the plaintiffs' theory of the law, or is it instead an\n\nadverse judgment that would leave those heirs free to double down\n\nin the second suit?     The plaintiffs do not attempt to answer this\n\nquestion, and, unaware of any authority one way or the other,\n\nneither can we.\n\n          In sum, we are ill equipped to rule on this question of\n\nPuerto Rico law.     As this question may very well determine the non-\n\ndiverse heirs' indispensability here, we are equally ill equipped\n\nto rule on the ultimate question of joinder.              Under different\n\ncircumstances, we would consider certifying the underlying question\n\nto the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. See Muniz-Olivari v. Stiefel\n\nLabs., Inc., 496 F.3d 29, 39–40 (1st Cir. 2007).               As the next\n\nsection makes clear, though, that consideration is obviated by the\n\nparallel litigation ongoing in the Commonwealth court.\n\n                      C. Colorado River Abstention\n\n          It   has    long   been   established   that   the   presence   of\n\nparallel litigation in state court will not in and of itself merit\n\nabstention in federal court.        See McClellan v. Carland, 217 U.S.\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f268, 282 (1910); Stanton v. Embrey, 93 U.S. 548, 554 (1876).\n\nConcurrent federal-state jurisdiction over the same controversy\n\ndoes not generally lessen the federal courts' \"virtually unflagging\n\nobligation . . . to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\"         Colo.\n\nRiver, 424 U.S. at 817.        At the same time, the Supreme Court in\n\nColorado River acknowledged that this obligation is not infinite.\n\nIn special cases, the pendency of a similar action in state court\n\nmay merit federal abstention based on \"considerations of wise\n\njudicial     administration\"     that     counsel   against   duplicative\n\nlawsuits.4    Id. (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted).\n\nThis \"fourth category\" of abstention has come to be known as the\n\nColorado River doctrine.5      See Fuller Co. v. Ramon I. Gill, Inc.,\n\n782 F.2d 306, 309 n.3 (1st Cir. 1986) (observing that Colorado\n\nRiver created a fourth category of abstention beyond the \"three\n\ntraditional branches\").\n\n\n\n     4\n      As with other forms of abstention, our decision to decline\njurisdiction under Colorado River may be sua sponte. See Bellotti\nv. Baird, 428 U.S. 132, 143 n.10 (1976); Guillemard-Ginorio v.\nContreras-Gomez, 585 F.3d 508, 517–18 (1st Cir. 2009); Currie v.\nGroup Ins. Comm'n, 290 F.3d 1, 9 n.7 (1st Cir. 2002). We therefore\nhave discretion to review the matter on appeal even if it was not\nraised in the court below.\n     5\n      The first three forms of abstention are Pullman-type\n(avoiding a constitutional determination by allowing a state court\nto construe state law), Burford-type (deferring to a state\nregarding difficult questions of state law that involve significant\npolicy considerations), and Younger-type (invoking federal\njurisdiction to restrain criminal proceedings). See Colo. River,\n424 U.S. at 814–17; Villa Marina Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Hatteras\nYachts, 915 F.2d 7, 12 n.8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                   -15-\n\f            The crevice in federal jurisdiction that Colorado River\n\ncarved is a narrow one.       Of all the abstention doctrines, it is to\n\nbe approached with the most caution, with \"[o]nly the clearest of\n\njustifications\" warranting dismissal.             Colo. River, 424 U.S. at\n\n819.   Our authority to find such a clear justification is confined\n\nby an \"exceptional-circumstances test,\"           Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp.\n\nv. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 16 (1983), whose non-exclusive\n\nlist of factors we have drawn from Colorado River and its progeny:\n\n            (1)   whether   either    court   has    assumed\n            jurisdiction    over    a    res;     (2)    the\n            [geographical] inconvenience of the federal\n            forum; (3) the desirability of avoiding\n            piecemeal litigation; (4) the order in which\n            the forums obtained jurisdiction; (5) whether\n            state or federal law controls; (6) the\n            adequacy of the state forum to protect the\n            parties' interests; (7) the       vexatious or\n            contrived nature of the federal claim; and (8)\n            respect for the principles underlying removal\n            jurisdiction.\n\nRio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 71–72 (1st\n\nCir.   2005).    \"No   one    factor    is    necessarily    determinative;     a\n\ncarefully    considered      judgment    taking    into     account   both    the\n\nobligation to exercise jurisdiction and the combination of factors\n\ncounselling against that exercise is required.\"              Colo. River, 424\n\nU.S. at 818–19.    Furthermore, \"the decision whether to dismiss a\n\nfederal action because of parallel state-court litigation does not\n\nrest on a mechanical checklist, but on a careful balancing of the\n\nimportant factors as they apply in a given case, with the balance\n\nheavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.\"                  Moses\n\n                                       -16-\n\fH. Cone, 460 U.S. at 16.      Unsurprisingly, the cases that satisfy\n\nthis test are few and far between.\n\n            Yet those cases, \"though exceptional, do nevertheless\n\nexist.\"   Colo. River, 424 U.S. at 818.       From time to time, we have\n\nexercised our discretion (or affirmed the lower court's exercise of\n\nits own discretion) to decline jurisdiction under Colorado River,\n\nnotwithstanding the presumption in favor of assuming jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., Rivera-Feliciano v. Acevedo-Vila, 438 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Currie v. Group Ins. Comm'n, 290 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Foremost-McKesson, Inc., 751 F.2d 475 (1st\n\nCir. 1985).\n\n            In our view, this is such a case.      Applying the factors,\n\nwe conclude that while some are neutral to our inquiry, the balance\n\nof them strongly favors abstention.           We begin with the neutral\n\nfactors, which may be summarized quickly.         The federal and Puerto\n\nRico forums are equally convenient (second factor); the Puerto Rico\n\nforum is well equipped to protect the parties' interests (sixth\n\nfactor), see United States v. Fairway Capital Corp., 483 F.3d 34,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that the adequacy of the state forum is\n\nrelevant only when it would disfavor abstention); there is nothing\n\nvexatious   or   contrived   about    the   plaintiffs'   federal   lawsuit\n\n(seventh factor); and removal jurisdiction is irrelevant here\n\n(eighth factor).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f          So far, so good.       But the sum of the other four factors\n\nconvinces us that deference to the Commonwealth court is the\n\nappropriate result here.     The first factor, the involvement of a\n\nres, tilts toward abstention due to the plaintiffs' claim for the\n\npenthouse apartment in Isabela Beach Court.        Though the plaintiffs\n\ncharacterize this as a suit over monetary damages, both versions of\n\nthe complaint request the court to enforce the decedent's alleged\n\noption on the apartment. There is therefore a possibility for\n\ninconsistent dispositions of property.6\n\n          The third factor, avoidance of piecemeal litigation, also\n\nfavors abstention, although it requires a bit more explanation.\n\nThe \"piecemeal litigation\" to be avoided is something more than\n\njust the repetitive adjudication that takes place in all cases\n\nimplicating Colorado River doctrine.           Concurrent federal-state\n\n\n\n     6\n      In Levy v. Lewis, the Second Circuit observed that the res\nprong of the Colorado River analysis was more concerned with the\ndisposition of property than the actual exercise of in rem\njurisdiction:\n\n     The principle is often stated as a matter of\n     jurisdiction:   that   a   second   court   cannot   have\n     jurisdiction to proceed in rem if jurisdiction over the\n     res is maintained by another court. Nevertheless, as the\n     Court appeared to recognize, the principle involved is\n     more accurately described as a prudential doctrine in\n     which a second court with concurrent jurisdiction will\n     exercise its discretion to defer to another court for the\n     sake of comprehensive disposition of rights in a\n     particular piece of property or in a fund.\n\n635 F.2d 960,   965–66     (2d    Cir.    1980).   We   agree   with   this\nassessment.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fjurisdiction over the same action will necessarily involve some\n\ndegree of \"routine inefficiency that is the inevitable result of\n\nparallel proceedings.\"   Villa Marina Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Hatteras\n\nYachts, 915 F.2d 7, 16 (1st Cir. 1990).     That inefficiency was not\n\nsignificant to the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado River and\n\nhas not contributed to any of this circuit's subsequent case law.\n\nWere it otherwise, courts could abstain in any diversity action\n\nthat overlapped with a state-court action.       \"Piecemeal litigation\"\n\nmust instead refer to some additional factor that places the case\n\nbeyond the pale of duplicative proceedings.       Put differently, \"[a]\n\nduplication   of   effort,   while   wasteful,   is   not   exceptional.\"\n\nGentron Corp. v. H. C. Johnson Agencies, Inc., 79 F.R.D. 415, 418\n\n(E.D. Wis. 1978).\n\n          We have therefore held that\n\n          [d]ismissal is not warranted simply because\n          related issues otherwise would be decided by\n          different courts, or even because two courts\n          otherwise would be deciding the same issues.\n          Rather, concerns about piecemeal litigation\n          should focus on the implications and practical\n          effects of litigating suits deriving from the\n          same transaction in two separate fora, and\n          weigh in favor of dismissal only if there is\n          some exceptional basis for dismissing one\n          action in favor of the other.\n\nKPS & Assocs., Inc. v. Designs by FMC, Inc., 318 F.3d 1, 10–11 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).          The\n\ncanonical example of such an exceptional basis is a clear federal\n\npolicy in favor of unified proceedings pursuant to a federal\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fstatute that is at issue in the case.              See Colo. River, 424 U.S. at\n\n819–20 (finding abstention appropriate because the federal law at\n\nissue evinced a clear policy against piecemeal adjudication of\n\nriver system water rights); cf. Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 20\n\n(finding abstention inappropriate because the Federal Arbitration\n\nAct requires piecemeal litigation if necessary to give effect to an\n\narbitration agreement).            But there are other reasons why the\n\npiecemeal litigation factor might loom large in a given case.                     On\n\nmultiple   occasions,       we    have   found     an   exceptional      basis   that\n\ncounsels in favor of abstention, even though no particular federal\n\npolicy was in play.         See, e.g., Rivera-Feliciano, 438 F.3d at 50\n\n(holding that \"in light of the many underlying unresolved issues of\n\nPuerto    Rican    law[,]    it    would      be   better   to   avoid    piecemeal\n\nlitigation\"); Currie, 290 F.3d at 10 (finding a risk of piecemeal\n\nlitigation that rises above routine inefficiency where parallel\n\nstate-court case was already on appeal and involved an issue of\n\nstate    law    which   could     moot   or     otherwise   inform    the   federal\n\nlitigation); Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 751 F.2d at 477 (finding an\n\nexceptional basis where there existed a \"real possibility\" that an\n\ninsurance policy might be interpreted differently in each forum,\n\nleaving the insured with insufficient coverage after years of\n\npaying premiums).\n\n               We think the potential implications of proceeding in\n\nfederal court without the non-diverse heirs provides the requisite\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fexceptional basis here. The absence of the additional heirs in the\n\nfederal action means that in all likelihood the district court\n\nwould be unable to resolve the defendants' contractual liability to\n\nthem if the case is allowed to continue.                 The district court could\n\ndetermine the defendants' obligations to the diverse heirs, but the\n\ndefendants     would      need    to   look   to   the    Commonwealth     court    to\n\ndetermine their obligations to the non-diverse heirs under the same\n\ncontract.      The Commonwealth action, by contrast, includes all of\n\nthe    heirs   and     can      therefore     comprehensively      adjudicate      the\n\ndefendants'     liability.          This    disparity     in   inclusiveness    thus\n\ncreates a greater practical risk of piecemeal litigation than the\n\nbaseline inefficiencies of the average exercise of concurrent\n\nfederal-state jurisdiction.            Recognizing this, other circuits have\n\nfound Colorado River abstention more appropriate when non-diverse\n\nparties are joined in the state-court action but not the federal\n\naction.    See Sto Corp. v. Lancaster Homes, Inc., 11 F. App'x 182,\n\n188 (4th Cir. 2001); Federated Rural Elec. Ins. Corp. v. Ark. Elec.\n\nCoops., Inc., 48 F.3d 294, 298 (8th Cir. 1995); Cont'l Cas. Co. v.\n\nRobsac Indus., 947 F.2d 1367, 1373 (9th Cir. 1991), overruled on\n\nother grounds, Gov't Employees Ins. Co. v. Dizol, 133 F.3d 1220\n\n(9th   Cir.    1998).        We   agree.      This   potential     for    fragmented\n\nadjudication,        to    be     distinguished      from      merely    duplicative\n\n\n\n\n                                           -21-\n\fadjudication,      warrants    consideration      in   the    Colorado    River\n\nanalysis.7\n\n             We move next to the fifth factor, whether state or\n\nfederal law controls, which weighs particularly heavily here.                  Not\n\nonly does the dispute here turn entirely on issues of Puerto Rico\n\nlaw, see Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 751 F.2d at 477 (finding it\n\nsignificant that \"no federal issues are raised . . . and no federal\n\ninterest would be served by retaining jurisdiction over the case\"),\n\nbut the issues that would inform our jurisdictional analysis remain\n\nunsettled.     We have previously held that under this part of the\n\nexceptional-circumstances test, abstention may be preferable when\n\nthe   \"parties'    claims     present   particularly    novel,       unusual    or\n\ndifficult questions of legal interpretation.\"            Elmendorf Grafica,\n\nInc. v. D.S. Am. (East), Inc., 48 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\naccord KPS & Assocs., 318 F.3d at 11.          As we described above, the\n\nplaintiffs' ability to maintain complete diversity in this case\n\nhinges on our Rule 19 analysis.         That analysis, in turn, hinges in\n\npart on the question of whether the non-diverse heirs' interests\n\ncould be impaired if they are not joined as parties to the suit.\n\nWe cannot intelligently answer that question without some clear\n\nindication    as   to   whether   Puerto   Rico   courts     would    apply    the\n\n\n\n      7\n      To be sure, it may not weigh as strongly as a clear federal\npolicy of the sort that was considered in Colorado River, but it at\nleast diminishes the presumption in favor of exercising federal\njurisdiction.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fplaintiffs' proposed community-of-property rule to causes of action\n\nother than tort claims.          From our vantage point, we cannot say\n\ndefinitively one way or the other.               The local law that would\n\nunderlie our determination on compulsory joinder would be best left\n\nto the Puerto Rico courts to sort out.8\n\n              The sixth factor, the order in which the courts obtained\n\njurisdiction, similarly points toward abstention.               The label for\n\nthis factor is something of a misnomer, as \"the relative progress\n\nof the suits is more important than the strict order in which the\n\ncourts obtained jurisdiction.\"             Gonzalez v. Cruz, 926 F.2d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).         \"[T]he order in which jurisdiction was taken is\n\nnot a mechanical concept automatically favoring the party who files\n\nfirst, but rather a concept that favors the case that is the more\n\nadvanced at the time the Colorado River balancing is being done.\"\n\nElmendorf, 48 F.3d at 52.            We thus \"measure which action -- the\n\nsuit in the federal court or that in the state court -- is the more\n\nadvanced in a 'pragmatic, flexible manner, with a view to the\n\nrealities of the case at hand.'\" Id. (quoting Moses H. Cone, 460\n\nU.S. at 21).         A quick comparison of the two docket sheets at issue\n\nhere       reveals    that   while   the    federal    action   foundered    on\n\njurisdictional          questions,    leaving   only     this   appeal,     the\n\n\n       8\n      Because the Commonwealth action includes the non-diverse\nheirs, this question is not likely at issue there. Our deferral\ntherefore means that the question will not be resolved until a\nfuture case.    We think this delay is still preferable to our\nattempting to settle a state-law question of first impression here.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fCommonwealth action is already well into the discovery stage.9   The\n\nCommonwealth's head start into the merits lessens the federal\n\ncourt's need to exercise jurisdiction.   See Colo. River, 424 U.S.\n\nat 820 (stating that an absence of any federal proceedings beyond\n\na motion to dismiss favors the surrender of jurisdiction).\n\n          Considering all of these factors, we conclude that this\n\nis one of the rare instances meriting Colorado River abstention.\n\nBecause of the possibility for inconsistent dispositions of a res,\n\nthe heightened potential for piecemeal litigation, the exclusive\n\nreliance on Puerto Rico law, the unsettled nature of aspects of\n\nthat law that would inform our jurisdictional analysis, and the\n\nmore advanced progress of the litigation in the Puerto Rico court\n\nsystem, we are convinced that the wisest judicial administration of\n\nthis case is to defer to the judgment of the Puerto Rico court.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      Neither the parties nor, apparently, the Court of First\nInstance's Spanish-language docket specify how close to trial the\nPuerto Rico case actually is. Yet a significant disparity in favor\nof the Commonwealth court is clear enough. As the Seventh Circuit\nrecently observed in an analogous situation, \"[a]lthough the\nprecise status of discovery is not apparent from the record before\nus, it is clear that various depositions have been taken in the\nstate case.   At the very least, the controversy appears to be\ncloser to a resolution in the state proceedings than in the\nfederal.\" Tyrer v. City of South Beloit, 456 F.3d 744, 755 (7th\nCir. 2006) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). Since\na court engaging in Colorado River analysis should \"look at the\ntotal situation as it stands at the time of appeal,\" Lumen Const.,\nInc. v. Brant Const. Co., Inc., 780 F.2d 691, 697 n.4 (7th Cir.\n1985), we take judicial notice of the progress of the parallel\nCommonwealth litigation.\n\n                               -24-\n\f            Having come to this conclusion, we must next decide\n\nwhether the appropriate disposition is a dismissal or a stay of the\n\nproceedings.      In Moses H. Cone, the Supreme Court committed this\n\nquestion    to    the   discretion    of   the    lower   courts,    finding     \"no\n\noccasion in this case to decide whether a dismissal or a stay\n\nshould ordinarily be the preferred course of action when a district\n\ncourt properly finds that Colorado River counsels in favor of\n\ndeferring    to    a    parallel    state-court    suit.\"     460    U.S.   at    28\n\n(footnote omitted); see also Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of\n\nAriz., 463 U.S. 545, 570 n.21 (1983).                 Most circuits to have\n\nconsidered the issue have held that a stay is always preferable\n\nbecause it may likely produce the same practical result as a\n\ndismissal while still leaving the docket open in case loose ends\n\nremain at the conclusion of the state proceedings.                  See Moorer v.\n\nDemopolis Waterworks & Sewer Bd., 374 F.3d 994, 998 (11th Cir.\n\n2004); Cigna Healthcare of St. Louis, Inc. v. Kaiser, 294 F.3d 849,\n\n851-52 (7th Cir. 2002); Mahaffey v.

Accordingly, we\n\nvacate the district court's dismissal and remand with instructions\n\nto stay all further proceedings.\n\n\n\nIt is so ordered.

They later commenced an\n\nidentical action in a Puerto Rico Commonwealth court during what\n\nthey considered to be a burdensomely long pendency of a motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to join an indispensable party.                        The federal\n\ncourt eventually granted the motion to dismiss, leaving the action\n\nin   the    Commonwealth     court    to    proceed      alone.      The    plaintiffs\n\nappealed from the federal dismissal and now ask us to reinstate the\n\ndiversity      suit    to   its    parallel      track    alongside    the     ongoing\n\nCommonwealth litigation.            The defendants argue not only that we\n\nshould affirm the dismissal for lack of an indispensable party, but\n\nalso,      among    other   things,   that       the   Commonwealth-court       action\n\nprovides an alternative ground for disposing of the federal case\n\nunder Colorado River.            We conclude that the narrow conditions for\n\nColorado River abstention are met here.

Background\n\n          Since the district court did not reach the merits, we\n\nprovide a \"condensed version of the dispute.\"     Tell v. Trs. of\n\nDartmouth Coll., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197979\"><a href=\"/opinion/197979/tell-v-dartmouth-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (1st Cir. 1998).    On December\n\n22, 1998, Manuel Molina-Godinez, the plaintiffs' decedent, sold the\n\ndefendants 100% of the stock in an apartment complex development\n\nknown as Isabela Beach Court.     Molina-Godinez agreed to manage\n\nIsabela Beach Court in exchange for a monthly fee and 18% of the\n\nproceeds after the complex's completion and the sale of all units.\n\nIn addition, before construction began, Molina-Godinez verbally\n\nagreed to buy one of the penthouses in Isabela Beach Court for\n\n$220,000, and the defendants reserved the unit for him.       This\n\nagreement was later confirmed in writing.   For reasons unspecified\n\nat this stage, the defendants dispute the scope and validity of\n\nthese agreements.\n\n          On January 3, 2003, Molina-Godinez died. Construction of\n\nIsabela Beach Court was completed at some point after his death and\n\nall of the units were sold successfully.       On March 27, 2007,\n\nMolina-Godinez's widow, plaintiff Sonia I. Jiménez, commenced an\n\naction in the federal district court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico asserting that she was entitled to half of her late husband's\n\n18% share, which had never been paid.   Additionally, she sought to\n\nexercise his option on the penthouse apartment that had allegedly\n\nbeen reserved for him.   Because Jiménez was a Florida resident and\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fthe defendants were all Puerto Rico residents, she claimed that the\n\ndistrict court had diversity jurisdiction over the matter.\n\n          The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to join an\n\nindispensable party under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.    They argued that the case could not proceed without\n\nMolina-Godinez's three other heirs, two of whom were also Puerto\n\nRico residents.    Because joinder of the Puerto Rico heirs would\n\ndefeat complete diversity, the defendants maintained, dismissal was\n\ncompulsory.\n\n          On August 10, 2007, Jiménez amended the complaint to join\n\nthe one diverse heir while still excluding the non-diverse heirs.\n\nShe also altered her theory of the case, explaining that she was\n\nnow seeking the contractual proceeds on behalf of Molina-Godinez's\n\nestate rather than for herself alone.   She claimed that she could\n\nadequately protect the interests of the non-diverse heirs and that,\n\nas a result, the action did not depend on their joinder.       The\n\namended complaint asked the court to award any judgment to the\n\nestate, where it could be allocated to heirs and creditors by a\n\nPuerto Rico probate court at some later date.\n\n          The addition of the diverse heir as a named plaintiff did\n\nnot, however, affect the substance of the defendants' argument.\n\nThe defendants renewed their motion to dismiss, maintaining that\n\nJiménez was not an adequate representative of the estate and that\n\nan adverse judgment could affect the non-diverse heirs' interests.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fAccording to them, neither the case's new posture nor the joinder\n\nof the one diverse heir would lessen the indispensability of the\n\nnon-diverse heirs.   The plaintiffs filed their response three days\n\nlater.\n\n          Over six months passed without any further action from\n\nthe court.   On March 27, 2008, the plaintiffs sought to learn the\n\nstatus of the pending motion to dismiss, but the docket does not\n\nindicate a response from the court.    On August 29, 2008, after an\n\nadditional five months, the plaintiffs filed a parallel complaint\n\nin the Court of First Instance for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nUnlike the federal action, this second suit joined all of Molina-\n\nGodinez's heirs as parties.\n\n          On December 12, 2008, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss.

This appeal followed.   Meanwhile, the\n\nCommonwealth action has progressed in due course and is now into\n\nthe discovery stage.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n          The defendants-appellees present three different possible\n\ngrounds to deny appellate relief to the plaintiffs-appellants.\n\nFirst, they argue that this case involves matters that fall within\n\nthe probate exception to diversity jurisdiction and thus cannot be\n\nadjudicated in federal court. Second, they reiterate their Rule 19\n\nclaim that the non-diverse heirs remain indispensable.      Finally,\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthey ask us to abstain under Colorado River and allow the Puerto\n\nRico court to resolve the case.          Though we reject the first of\n\nthese arguments and harbor considerable skepticism as to the\n\nsecond, we ultimately agree that this case warrants Colorado River\n\nabstention.1\n\n                        A. The Probate Exception\n\n             It has been said that \"[t]he probate exception is one of\n\nthe most mysterious and esoteric branches of the law of federal\n\njurisdiction.\"      Dragan v.

Once more unto the breach.2\n\n             The probate exception is a judge-made doctrine stemming\n\nfrom the original conferral of federal equity jurisdiction in the\n\nJudiciary Act of 1789.

After Markham, just what would constitute \"interfere[nce]\n\nwith the probate proceedings\" proved notoriously difficult to pin\n\ndown.     When we last had the opportunity to consider the doctrine\n\nnearly a decade ago, we acknowledged that \"the precise scope of the\n\nprobate exception has not been clearly established.\"            Mangieri v.\n\nMangieri,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199076\"><a href=\"/opinion/199076/mangieri-v-mangieri/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   2   (1st   Cir.   2000)   (internal   brackets\n\nomitted).\n\n            Since then, the Supreme Court has revisited the issue and\n\nilluminated matters somewhat.         In Marshall v. Marshall, the Court\n\nexplained that\n\n            the “interference” language in Markham [is]\n            essentially a reiteration of the general\n            principle that, when one court is exercising\n            in rem jurisdiction over a res, a second court\n            will not assume in rem jurisdiction over the\n            same res.      Thus, the probate exception\n            reserves to state probate courts the probate\n            or annulment of a will and the administration\n            of a decedent's estate; it also precludes\n            federal courts from endeavoring to dispose of\n            property that is in the custody of a state\n            probate court.   But it does not bar federal\n            courts from adjudicating matters outside those\n            confines   and    otherwise   within   federal\n            jurisdiction.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145660\"><a href=\"/opinion/145660/marshall-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311-12 (2006) (citations omitted).

The only property at issue in this case\n\nis the proceeds from the sale of the Isabela Beach Court units and\n\nthe penthouse apartment on which Molina-Godinez allegedly held an\n\noption to purchase.      Because neither the money nor the apartment\n\nare yet part of the decedent's estate, neither are yet in the\n\ncustody of a Puerto Rico probate court.           Indeed, the very relief\n\nsought here is enlargement of the decedent's estate through assets\n\nnot currently within it.

To answer that question, the district court\n\nmust consider four factors specified in the Rule:\n\n           (1)the extent to which a judgment rendered in\n           the person's absence might prejudice that\n           person person or the existing parties; (2) the\n           extent to which any prejudice could be\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          lessened   or  avoided   by   (A)   protective\n          provisions in the judgment; (B) shaping the\n          relief; or (C) other measures; (3) whether a\n          judgment rendered in the person's absence will\n          be adequate; and (4) whether the plaintiff\n          would have an adequate remedy if the action\n          were dismissed for non-joinder.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).\n\n          The    district   court    emphasized   the   first    and   third\n\nfactors, finding that a judgment rendered in the non-diverse heirs'\n\nabsence could potentially prejudice their interests.            It reasoned\n\nthat since each heir possesses a right to part of Molina-Godinez's\n\nestate, any ruling on the sums due to the estate under the alleged\n\ncontract would affect each heir's individual portion.           In order to\n\nadequately protect his or her interest in that portion, each heir\n\nwas therefore entitled to participate in the litigation, even to\n\nthe point of eliminating federal diversity jurisdiction.\n\n          We are not so sure.       In Puerto Rico, the decedent's as-\n\nyet undivided estate is known as a community of property.               See,\n\ne.g., Arias-Rosado v.

On several occasions, the federal district court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico has interpreted Puerto Rico law to\n\nprovide that an individual participant in a community of property\n\ndoes not impair other participants' interests merely by asserting\n\ncommon legal rights to the property while the other participants\n\nare absent.     \"Any judgment in favor of one or more participants\n\nbenefits all other participants in a community of property whereas\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fan adverse judgment only prejudices the one who filed the judicial\n\naction.\" Id.

In Arias-Rosado, a Rule 19\n\nchallenge to a survivorship action, the court went on to hold that\n\n\"a favorable judgment to [the individual heir litigating in federal\n\ncourt] will be dispositive of the survivorship claim and benefit\n\nthe absent heirs.      However, an unfavorable judgment will only\n\nprejudice her and not the absent heirs[,] who still will have\n\navailable the suit filed in state court wherein they asserted the\n\nsurvivorship claim.\"    111 F.

Supp. 2d at 19.\n\n          Taking these cases at face value, as the plaintiffs urge\n\nus to, it appears that the federal suit here is something of a free\n\nshot for the non-diverse heirs.    Success inures to their benefit\n\nwhile failure is costless.   Surely there can be no impairment when\n\nthey stand to lose nothing.     If the plaintiffs are providing a\n\ncorrect statement of the local law, they would appear to be the\n\nbest of all possible representatives for the absentees' interests:\n\nthe kind that may very well help but cannot hurt.    See Tell, 145\n\nF.3d at 419 (\"If an absent party's interests are the same as those\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fof an existing party, and the existing party will adequately\n\nprotect those interests, this bears on whether the absent party's\n\ninterest will be impaired by its absence from the litigation.\").\n\n          At    this    juncture,   however,   we   cannot     state   this\n\nproposition as anything other than a conditional hypothetical. The\n\nplaintiffs' interpretation of Puerto Rico community property law is\n\nfar from certain.      To begin with, the cases on which the plaintiffs\n\nrely sound exclusively in tort.        Seizing on this, the defendants\n\nhave urged us to limit the applicability of those cases to wrongful\n\ndeath and survivorship actions. When pressed at oral argument, the\n\nplaintiffs could not cite a single authority suggesting that their\n\ninterpretation of the relevant law extends to contract claims.\n\n          This puts us in an awkward position.      On the one hand, we\n\nwould find it somewhat strange if the rule did indeed govern non-\n\ntorts actions yet had failed to produce any reported decisions to\n\nthat effect.    It is hard to say that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion when the ostensible abuse is a matter of unsettled law.\n\nOn the other hand, none of the four cases that the plaintiffs cite\n\nfacially limits itself to tort claims.         Those cases draw their\n\nlogical force not from any idiosyncrasy in Puerto Rico's tort law,\n\nbut from Puerto Rico's community-of-property law.            This may make\n\nthe defendants' argument a good candidate for a distinction without\n\na difference.    Contractual proceeds due to the decedent belong to\n\nthe undivided estate just as much as a wrongful death judgment.\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fAll things considered, we have an insufficient basis to accept\n\neither the plaintiffs' or the defendants' readings of the case law.\n\n          A second difficulty remains. Suppose that the plaintiffs\n\nhere are successful in securing some monetary damages under the\n\ncontract, but not the full amount that they seek.                Does that\n\nconstitute a successful judgment sufficient to bind the non-diverse\n\nheirs under the plaintiffs' theory of the law, or is it instead an\n\nadverse judgment that would leave those heirs free to double down\n\nin the second suit?     The plaintiffs do not attempt to answer this\n\nquestion, and, unaware of any authority one way or the other,\n\nneither can we.\n\n          In sum, we are ill equipped to rule on this question of\n\nPuerto Rico law.     As this question may very well determine the non-\n\ndiverse heirs' indispensability here, we are equally ill equipped\n\nto rule on the ultimate question of joinder.              Under different\n\ncircumstances, we would consider certifying the underlying question\n\nto the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. See Muniz-Olivari v.

But the sum of the other four factors\n\nconvinces us that deference to the Commonwealth court is the\n\nappropriate result here.     The first factor, the involvement of a\n\nres, tilts toward abstention due to the plaintiffs' claim for the\n\npenthouse apartment in Isabela Beach Court.        Though the plaintiffs\n\ncharacterize this as a suit over monetary damages, both versions of\n\nthe complaint request the court to enforce the decedent's alleged\n\noption on the apartment. There is therefore a possibility for\n\ninconsistent dispositions of property.6\n\n          The third factor, avoidance of piecemeal litigation, also\n\nfavors abstention, although it requires a bit more explanation.\n\nThe \"piecemeal litigation\" to be avoided is something more than\n\njust the repetitive adjudication that takes place in all cases\n\nimplicating Colorado River doctrine.           Concurrent federal-state\n\n\n\n     6\n      In Levy v. Lewis, the Second Circuit observed that the res\nprong of the Colorado River analysis was more concerned with the\ndisposition of property than the actual exercise of in rem\njurisdiction:\n\n     The principle is often stated as a matter of\n     jurisdiction:   that   a   second   court   cannot   have\n     jurisdiction to proceed in rem if jurisdiction over the\n     res is maintained by another court. Nevertheless, as the\n     Court appeared to recognize, the principle involved is\n     more accurately described as a prudential doctrine in\n     which a second court with concurrent jurisdiction will\n     exercise its discretion to defer to another court for the\n     sake of comprehensive disposition of rights in a\n     particular piece of property or in a fund.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384702\"><a href=\"/opinion/384702/harold-j-levy-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   965–66     (2d    Cir.    1980).

The absence of the additional heirs in the\n\nfederal action means that in all likelihood the district court\n\nwould be unable to resolve the defendants' contractual liability to\n\nthem if the case is allowed to continue.                 The district court could\n\ndetermine the defendants' obligations to the diverse heirs, but the\n\ndefendants     would      need    to   look   to   the    Commonwealth     court    to\n\ndetermine their obligations to the non-diverse heirs under the same\n\ncontract.      The Commonwealth action, by contrast, includes all of\n\nthe    heirs   and     can      therefore     comprehensively      adjudicate      the\n\ndefendants'     liability.          This    disparity     in   inclusiveness    thus\n\ncreates a greater practical risk of piecemeal litigation than the\n\nbaseline inefficiencies of the average exercise of concurrent\n\nfederal-state jurisdiction.            Recognizing this, other circuits have\n\nfound Colorado River abstention more appropriate when non-diverse\n\nparties are joined in the state-court action but not the federal\n\naction.

We have previously held that under this part of the\n\nexceptional-circumstances test, abstention may be preferable when\n\nthe   \"parties'    claims     present   particularly    novel,       unusual    or\n\ndifficult questions of legal interpretation.\"            Elmendorf Grafica,\n\nInc. v.

As we described above, the\n\nplaintiffs' ability to maintain complete diversity in this case\n\nhinges on our Rule 19 analysis.         That analysis, in turn, hinges in\n\npart on the question of whether the non-diverse heirs' interests\n\ncould be impaired if they are not joined as parties to the suit.\n\nWe cannot intelligently answer that question without some clear\n\nindication    as   to   whether   Puerto   Rico   courts     would    apply    the\n\n\n\n      7\n      To be sure, it may not weigh as strongly as a clear federal\npolicy of the sort that was considered in Colorado River, but it at\nleast diminishes the presumption in favor of exercising federal\njurisdiction.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fplaintiffs' proposed community-of-property rule to causes of action\n\nother than tort claims.

The local law that would\n\nunderlie our determination on compulsory joinder would be best left\n\nto the Puerto Rico courts to sort out.8\n\n              The sixth factor, the order in which the courts obtained\n\njurisdiction, similarly points toward abstention.               The label for\n\nthis factor is something of a misnomer, as \"the relative progress\n\nof the suits is more important than the strict order in which the\n\ncourts obtained jurisdiction.\"             Gonzalez v.

We thus \"measure which action -- the\n\nsuit in the federal court or that in the state court -- is the more\n\nadvanced in a 'pragmatic, flexible manner, with a view to the\n\nrealities of the case at hand.'\" Id.

A quick comparison of the two docket sheets at issue\n\nhere       reveals    that   while   the    federal    action   foundered    on\n\njurisdictional          questions,    leaving   only     this   appeal,     the\n\n\n       8\n      Because the Commonwealth action includes the non-diverse\nheirs, this question is not likely at issue there. Our deferral\ntherefore means that the question will not be resolved until a\nfuture case.    We think this delay is still preferable to our\nattempting to settle a state-law question of first impression here.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fCommonwealth action is already well into the discovery stage.9   The\n\nCommonwealth's head start into the merits lessens the federal\n\ncourt's need to exercise jurisdiction.   See Colo. River, 424 U.S.\n\nat 820 (stating that an absence of any federal proceedings beyond\n\na motion to dismiss favors the surrender of jurisdiction).\n\n          Considering all of these factors, we conclude that this\n\nis one of the rare instances meriting Colorado River abstention.\n\nBecause of the possibility for inconsistent dispositions of a res,\n\nthe heightened potential for piecemeal litigation, the exclusive\n\nreliance on Puerto Rico law, the unsettled nature of aspects of\n\nthat law that would inform our jurisdictional analysis, and the\n\nmore advanced progress of the litigation in the Puerto Rico court\n\nsystem, we are convinced that the wisest judicial administration of\n\nthis case is to defer to the judgment of the Puerto Rico court.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      Neither the parties nor, apparently, the Court of First\nInstance's Spanish-language docket specify how close to trial the\nPuerto Rico case actually is. Yet a significant disparity in favor\nof the Commonwealth court is clear enough. As the Seventh Circuit\nrecently observed in an analogous situation, \"[a]lthough the\nprecise status of discovery is not apparent from the record before\nus, it is clear that various depositions have been taken in the\nstate case.
