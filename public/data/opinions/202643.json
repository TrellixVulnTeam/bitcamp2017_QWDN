GONZÁLES,\n              ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES,\n\n                           Respondent.\n\n\n\n              ON PETITION FOR REVIEW OF AN ORDER OF\n                 THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stephen A. Lagana and Lagana & Associates, on brief for\npetitioner.\n     John D. Williams, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Civil Division, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, and Douglas E. Ginsburg, Senior Litigation Counsel, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        February 23, 2007\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.           At issue here is whether the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") erred in determining that\n\npetitioner, John Ogobodo Eze (\"Eze\"), was properly served notice of\n\nthe   Department      of   Homeland   Security's    (\"DHS\")   (formerly     the\n\nImmigration     and    Naturalization        Service)   termination   of   his\n\ntemporary resident status.            The regulation governing notice of\n\ntermination of an alien's temporary resident status is codified at\n\n8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(2)(i).           The regulation provides in relevant\n\npart:\n\n           [T]ermination of an alien's temporary resident\n           status . . . will be made . . . only on notice\n           sent to the alien by certified mail directed\n           to his or her last known address, and to his\n           or her representative, if any. The alien must\n           be given an opportunity to offer evidence in\n           opposition   to   the  grounds   alleged   for\n           termination of his or her status. Evidence in\n           opposition must be submitted within thirty\n           (30) days after the service of the Notice of\n           Intent to Terminate.\n\nId.\n\n           The BIA determined that Eze received proper service of\n\nthe DHS's notice through personal delivery of the notice, rather\n\nthan notice by certified mail, as described in the regulations. On\n\nappeal,   Eze   challenges     this    determination,    arguing   that    only\n\nservice by certified mail -- and not by personal delivery --\n\ncomplies with the governing regulation, and that the government's\n\nfailure to comply with the governing regulation in this case\n\nviolated his due process rights.          Because the BIA's determination\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthat Eze received proper notice was based on its interpretation of\n\nimmigration regulations, the issue is a legal one but our review is\n\nsubject to principles of deference, Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d\n\n392, 396 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S.\n\n415, 424-25 (1999)); of course, we review de novo any determination\n\nof the contours of the due process clause, see Albathani v. INS,\n\n318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Under 8 C.F.R. § 103.5a(a)(2), the general regulations\n\nconcerning immigration, personal service includes both \"[d]elivery\n\nof a copy personally\" and \"[m]ailing a copy by certified or\n\nregistered mail.\"   Neither form of service is considered superior.\n\nId.   Indeed, there is little practical difference in the two forms\n\nof service.   Certainly, personal delivery is at least as likely as\n\ndelivery by certified mail to ensure that notice is received.\n\n           Moreover, there is no evidence on record that Eze was\n\nprejudiced by personal delivery of the notice of termination of his\n\ntemporary resident status.     The record indicates that the well\n\nestablished principle of \"notice and opportunity to be heard\" was\n\nfulfilled. See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532,\n\n542 (1985) (stating that notice and an opportunity to be heard\n\ntogether comprise an \"essential principle of due process\"); Oakes\n\nv. United States, 400 F.3d 92, 98 (1st Cir. 2005) (same).    In fact,\n\nEze admits that he received and signed the notice of termination of\n\nhis   temporary   resident   status.    Furthermore,   the    notice\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fspecifically orders the termination of his status, and provides\n\nEze's appeal rights and the requisite appeal form.   This not only\n\nconfirms that Eze received the notice, but that he also had the\n\nopportunity to be heard on appeal.   Clearly, the personal delivery\n\nof the notice adequately notified Eze.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
