This case comes to us on\n\nappeal from a grant of dismissal.         Plaintiff1 brought suit under\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\n\nseq., alleging gender discrimination, sexual harassment, a hostile\n\nwork environment, and retaliation; and under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nalleging violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nof the U.S. Constitution.2      The district court dismissed the Title\n\nVII claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the\n\nSection 1983 claims as time-barred.        We affirm.\n\n               We review de novo a district court's decision to dismiss\n\na case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).       See Ramos-\n\nPinero v. Puerto Rico, 453 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 2006).        In doing\n\nso, we take as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and\n\ndraw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nId.\n\n               Plaintiff Haydee Rivera-Huertas has been an officer with\n\nthe Puerto Rico Police Department since October 1996. According to\n\nher complaint, plaintiff began to be the target of false innuendos\n\nand allegations at the Sabana Hoyos Police Station some time around\n\n2002.       A co-worker of plaintiff, Agent Ramón Hernández-Quiles, had\n\n\n\n        1\n      We assume that co-plaintiff Wanda Rivera-Rivera's claims are\nsimply derivative of those of Rivera-Huertas, Rivera-Rivera's\nmother. Therefore, we will simply refer to \"plaintiff\" throughout.\n      2\n      Plaintiff also brought supplemental claims under Puerto Rico\nlaw, the dismissal of which is not on appeal here.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fasked her for the phone number and address of a female citizen who\n\nhad filed a complaint against the police.           Plaintiff refused to\n\nprovide    the   information,    and    Hernández-Quiles    retaliated     by\n\nspreading rumors around the police station that plaintiff was a\n\nlesbian.\n\n            Plaintiff filed a report complaining about Hernández-\n\nQuiles's conduct with co-defendant Capt. José Díaz, who was then\n\nsubstituting for co-defendant Capt. Rafael Meléndez at the Sabana\n\nHoyos station.    During Capt. Díaz's tenure as officer in charge he\n\ntook no action, and plaintiff again complained to Capt. Meléndez\n\nwhen he returned to work.       In the interim, the documents relating\n\nto her complaint that had been in the possession of Capt. Díaz had\n\nbeen lost, so plaintiff filed a second report, on which Capt.\n\nMeléndez also took no action.\n\n            Because of what plaintiff perceived as a hostile work\n\nenvironment, she repeatedly requested a transfer. Finally, she was\n\ntransferred to the Barceloneta Police Station on April 21, 2004.\n\nOne week later, on April 28, she was reassigned to the Residencial\n\nBrisas de Campo Alegre Police Station in Manatí, Puerto Rico.\n\nPlaintiff    alleges   that     the    later   transfer   was   a   form   of\n\nretaliation, since that station is known for having officers with\n\nblemishes on their records, while plaintiff's record is clean.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f           Subsequently, plaintiff filed a charge with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"),3 which was dismissed on\n\nMarch 22, 2005, as not timely filed.             Plaintiff then instituted\n\nthis action on May 19, 2005, alleging violations of Title VII and\n\nSection 1983, as well as violations of Puerto Rico law.                  The\n\ncomplaint named as defendants the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Justice; Hon. Robert Sánchez-Ramos, in\n\nhis personal and official capacity as Secretary of Justice; the\n\nPuerto   Rico   Police    Department;    Pedro    Tolido-Dávilla,   in   his\n\npersonal and official capacity as Police Superintendent; and Capts.\n\nRafael Meléndez and José Díaz in their personal and official\n\ncapacities.\n\n           On March 17, 2006, the district court granted defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss.       The court dismissed with prejudice the Title\n\nVII claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and the\n\nSection 1983 claims as barred by the statute of limitations, and\n\ndismissed without prejudice the supplemental Puerto Rico claims.\n\nOn March 28, 2006, plaintiff moved for reconsideration, which\n\nmotion was denied.       Plaintiff now appeals from the dismissal and\n\nthe denial of her motion for reconsideration.\n\n           Title VII requires that a charge \"shall be filed [with\n\nthe EEOC] within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged\n\n\n\n     3\n      It is not clear from the record the exact date her charge was\nfiled.\n\n                                   -4-\n\funlawful employment practice occurred,\" or within 300 days if the\n\nperson aggrieved \"initially instituted proceedings with a State or\n\nlocal agency with authority to grant or seek relief from such\n\npractice.\"   42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e).   This requirement was not met,4\n\nand that failure effectively bars the Title VII claims.    See Jorge\n\nv. Rumsfeld, 404 F.3d 556, 564 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Here, in order to save her claim, plaintiff argues that\n\ncontinuing violations should have tolled the time in which she had\n\nto file an EEOC charge.   On its face, plaintiff's argument appears\n\nto mistake the exhaustion requirement of Title VII for a statute of\n\nlimitations, but the argument is not so far off, given that the\n\nexhaustion requirement of Title VII is not a jurisdictional bar,\n\nbut is still subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\n\nZipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982);\n\nMercado v. Ritz-Carlton San Juan Hotel, Spa & Casino, 410 F.3d 41,\n\n46 n.6 (1st Cir. 2005).    Plaintiff argues, in essence, that the\n\nApril 28 transfer to the Manatí station was meant to be just a\n\n\"reconcentration,\" which typically lasts only three to four months,\n\nand that this should have been taken into account.\n\n\n\n     4\n      Because the exact date of filing is not known, we do not know\nfor certain if the EEOC applied the 180-day rule or the 300-day\nrule. Because Puerto Rico is a \"deferral jurisdiction,\" we have\nheld that the 300-day rule applies. See Rivera v. P.R. Aqueduct &\nSewers Auth., 331 F.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir. 2003).       There is no\nargument here that the EEOC misapplied the statute. Plaintiff only\nargues, as discussed infra, that the requirement should be tolled\nbecause of ongoing retaliation.\n\n                                -5-\n\f          Plaintiff's argument is thin, but we do see two possible\n\nways to read this.   First, she could be saying that the failure of\n\nthe police to re-transfer her from the Manatí station after three\n\nor four months was itself an act of retaliation, and if one\n\nincluded this failure, it would bring the charge within the 300-day\n\nstatute of limitations for filing charges with the EEOC.5     However,\n\nplaintiff failed to make this argument before the district court in\n\nher   motion   opposing   dismissal,   and   therefore,   finding     no\n\nextraordinary circumstances to forgive omission, we do not consider\n\nthe argument now.6   See Rocafort v. IBM Corp., 334 F.3d 115, 121-22\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Alternatively,   plaintiff   could   be   arguing   that   the\n\ndistrict court should have used its equity powers to toll the\n\nexhaustion requirement altogether, because the failure by the\n\nPolice Department to transfer her back to Barceloneta after three\n\nor four months precluded her from filing a timely charge.      Even if\n\n\n      5\n      Although we don't know the precise date of the EEOC filing,\n389 days elapsed between plaintiff's transfer on April 28, 2004,\nand the dismissal of her EEOC charge on March 22, 2005, so a three-\nto four-month tolling would possibly have made the charge timely.\n      6\n      In her Opposition to Motion to Dismiss, the closest plaintiff\ngets to this argument is when she says, \"The damages suffered by\nPlaintiff were continuos [sic]. Up to this moment, Plaintiff is\nstill suffering damages because of the hostile environment,\ndiscriminatory acts and retaliation created by Defendants.\"\nAppellant's Appendix at 53. Even reading this in the light most\nfavorable to plaintiff, this is at best an argument about damages,\nnot about ongoing acts.     As such, it is unremarkable; adverse\nemployment actions would be expected to create damages extending\npast the date of the injury.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat were a sufficient reason to invoke equitable tolling where\n\nthere still was sufficient time to file a charge, see Bonilla v.\n\nMuebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275, 279 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"the\n\nfederal   standard    reserves   equitable    tolling   for   exceptional\n\ncases\"), plaintiff similarly never raised the equitable tolling\n\nargument before the district court, and thus is not entitled to\n\nraise it here.     See Jorge, 404 F.3d at 565.\n\n             The same can be said for the Section 1983 claims.           A\n\nSection   1983    action   borrows    the   forum   state's   statute   of\n\nlimitations for personal injury claims. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S.\n\n261, 269 (1985); López-González v. Municipality of Comerío, 404\n\nF.3d 548, 551 (1st Cir. 2005).         In Puerto Rico, the appropriate\n\nstatute of limitations is one year.         Torres v. Superintendent of\n\nPolice of P.R., 893 F.2d 404, 406 (1st Cir. 1990); see 31 L.P.R.A.\n\n§ 5298(2).    Here, the most recent alleged injury occurred on April\n\n28, 2004, more than one year before the Section 1983 action was\n\ninstituted on May 11, 2005, and any arguments that the adverse\n\nactions extended beyond that date were waived, as discussed supra.\n\n             Plaintiff also contends that the Section 1983 statute of\n\nlimitations should be tolled by her filing of the EEOC charge,7 but\n\n\n     7\n      Under Puerto Rico law, the \"[p]rescription of actions is\ninterrupted   by  their   institution   before  the  courts,   by\nextrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by any act of\nacknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\" 31 L.P.R.A. § 5303.\nThe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that an administrative\naction must be essentially \"identical\" to the subsequent court\naction in order for this tolling rule to apply. Cintron v. Estado\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbecause   she   did   not   raise   this   issue   in    her   opposition    to\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss, the issue likewise is waived.                See\n\nRocafort, 334 F.3d at 121-22.         Furthermore, we find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the district judge's refusal to consider the argument\n\non   plaintiff's   motion    to   reconsider.      See   Cochran   v.   Quest\n\nSoftware, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2003) (district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in refusing to reconsider decision where\n\nparty raised new argument on motion to reconsider).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nLibre Asociado de P.R., 127 P.R. Dec. 582 (1990); see Rodríguez-\nGarcia v. Municipality of Caguas, 354 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir. 2004).\nThus, there is question as to whether a Title VII claim is\nsufficiently \"identical\" to a Section 1983 claim such that the\nfiling of an EEOC charge would toll the statute for the Section\n1983 claim. We have not yet addressed this issue and choose not to\ndo so here.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

Plaintiff1 brought suit under\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\n\nseq., alleging gender discrimination, sexual harassment, a hostile\n\nwork environment, and retaliation; and under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nalleging violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nof the U.S. Constitution.2      The district court dismissed the Title\n\nVII claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the\n\nSection 1983 claims as time-barred.

In doing\n\nso, we take as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and\n\ndraw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nId.\n\n               Plaintiff Haydee Rivera-Huertas has been an officer with\n\nthe Puerto Rico Police Department since October 1996. According to\n\nher complaint, plaintiff began to be the target of false innuendos\n\nand allegations at the Sabana Hoyos Police Station some time around\n\n2002.       A co-worker of plaintiff, Agent Ramón Hernández-Quiles, had\n\n\n\n        1\n      We assume that co-plaintiff Wanda Rivera-Rivera's claims are\nsimply derivative of those of Rivera-Huertas, Rivera-Rivera's\nmother. Therefore, we will simply refer to \"plaintiff\" throughout.\n      2\n      Plaintiff also brought supplemental claims under Puerto Rico\nlaw, the dismissal of which is not on appeal here.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fasked her for the phone number and address of a female citizen who\n\nhad filed a complaint against the police.           Plaintiff refused to\n\nprovide    the   information,    and    Hernández-Quiles    retaliated     by\n\nspreading rumors around the police station that plaintiff was a\n\nlesbian.\n\n            Plaintiff filed a report complaining about Hernández-\n\nQuiles's conduct with co-defendant Capt. José Díaz, who was then\n\nsubstituting for co-defendant Capt. Rafael Meléndez at the Sabana\n\nHoyos station.    During Capt. Díaz's tenure as officer in charge he\n\ntook no action, and plaintiff again complained to Capt. Meléndez\n\nwhen he returned to work.       In the interim, the documents relating\n\nto her complaint that had been in the possession of Capt. Díaz had\n\nbeen lost, so plaintiff filed a second report, on which Capt.\n\nMeléndez also took no action.\n\n            Because of what plaintiff perceived as a hostile work\n\nenvironment, she repeatedly requested a transfer. Finally, she was\n\ntransferred to the Barceloneta Police Station on April 21, 2004.\n\nOne week later, on April 28, she was reassigned to the Residencial\n\nBrisas de Campo Alegre Police Station in Manatí, Puerto Rico.\n\nPlaintiff    alleges   that     the    later   transfer   was   a   form   of\n\nretaliation, since that station is known for having officers with\n\nblemishes on their records, while plaintiff's record is clean.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f           Subsequently, plaintiff filed a charge with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"),3 which was dismissed on\n\nMarch 22, 2005, as not timely filed.             Plaintiff then instituted\n\nthis action on May 19, 2005, alleging violations of Title VII and\n\nSection 1983, as well as violations of Puerto Rico law.                  The\n\ncomplaint named as defendants the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Justice; Hon. Robert Sánchez-Ramos, in\n\nhis personal and official capacity as Secretary of Justice; the\n\nPuerto   Rico   Police    Department;    Pedro    Tolido-Dávilla,   in   his\n\npersonal and official capacity as Police Superintendent; and Capts.\n\nRafael Meléndez and José Díaz in their personal and official\n\ncapacities.\n\n           On March 17, 2006, the district court granted defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss.       The court dismissed with prejudice the Title\n\nVII claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and the\n\nSection 1983 claims as barred by the statute of limitations, and\n\ndismissed without prejudice the supplemental Puerto Rico claims.\n\nOn March 28, 2006, plaintiff moved for reconsideration, which\n\nmotion was denied.       Plaintiff now appeals from the dismissal and\n\nthe denial of her motion for reconsideration.\n\n           Title VII requires that a charge \"shall be filed [with\n\nthe EEOC] within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged\n\n\n\n     3\n      It is not clear from the record the exact date her charge was\nfiled.\n\n                                   -4-\n\funlawful employment practice occurred,\" or within 300 days if the\n\nperson aggrieved \"initially instituted proceedings with a State or\n\nlocal agency with authority to grant or seek relief from such\n\npractice.\"   42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e).

Plaintiff argues, in essence, that the\n\nApril 28 transfer to the Manatí station was meant to be just a\n\n\"reconcentration,\" which typically lasts only three to four months,\n\nand that this should have been taken into account.\n\n\n\n     4\n      Because the exact date of filing is not known, we do not know\nfor certain if the EEOC applied the 180-day rule or the 300-day\nrule. Because Puerto Rico is a \"deferral jurisdiction,\" we have\nheld that the 300-day rule applies. See Rivera v. P.R. Aqueduct &\nSewers Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782203\"><a href=\"/opinion/782203/mayra-rosario-rivera-v-puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewers-authority-jose-ivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188 (1st Cir. 2003).       There is no\nargument here that the EEOC misapplied the statute. Plaintiff only\nargues, as discussed infra, that the requirement should be tolled\nbecause of ongoing retaliation.\n\n                                -5-\n\f          Plaintiff's argument is thin, but we do see two possible\n\nways to read this.   First, she could be saying that the failure of\n\nthe police to re-transfer her from the Manatí station after three\n\nor four months was itself an act of retaliation, and if one\n\nincluded this failure, it would bring the charge within the 300-day\n\nstatute of limitations for filing charges with the EEOC.5     However,\n\nplaintiff failed to make this argument before the district court in\n\nher   motion   opposing   dismissal,   and   therefore,   finding     no\n\nextraordinary circumstances to forgive omission, we do not consider\n\nthe argument now.6   See Rocafort v. IBM Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200526\"><a href=\"/opinion/200526/rocafort-v-ibm/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121-22\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Alternatively,   plaintiff   could   be   arguing   that   the\n\ndistrict court should have used its equity powers to toll the\n\nexhaustion requirement altogether, because the failure by the\n\nPolice Department to transfer her back to Barceloneta after three\n\nor four months precluded her from filing a timely charge.      Even if\n\n\n      5\n      Although we don't know the precise date of the EEOC filing,\n389 days elapsed between plaintiff's transfer on April 28, 2004,\nand the dismissal of her EEOC charge on March 22, 2005, so a three-\nto four-month tolling would possibly have made the charge timely.\n      6\n      In her Opposition to Motion to Dismiss, the closest plaintiff\ngets to this argument is when she says, \"The damages suffered by\nPlaintiff were continuos [sic]. Up to this moment, Plaintiff is\nstill suffering damages because of the hostile environment,\ndiscriminatory acts and retaliation created by Defendants.\"\nAppellant's Appendix at 53. Even reading this in the light most\nfavorable to plaintiff, this is at best an argument about damages,\nnot about ongoing acts.     As such, it is unremarkable; adverse\nemployment actions would be expected to create damages extending\npast the date of the injury.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat were a sufficient reason to invoke equitable tolling where\n\nthere still was sufficient time to file a charge, see Bonilla v.\n\nMuebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198699\"><a href=\"/opinion/198699/bonilla-v-muebles/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 279 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"the\n\nfederal   standard    reserves   equitable    tolling   for   exceptional\n\ncases\"), plaintiff similarly never raised the equitable tolling\n\nargument before the district court, and thus is not entitled to\n\nraise it here.     See Jorge, 404 F.3d at 565.\n\n             The same can be said for the Section 1983 claims.           A\n\nSection   1983    action   borrows    the   forum   state's   statute   of\n\nlimitations for personal injury claims. Wilson v.

In Puerto Rico, the appropriate\n\nstatute of limitations is one year.         Torres v.

Here, the most recent alleged injury occurred on April\n\n28, 2004, more than one year before the Section 1983 action was\n\ninstituted on May 11, 2005, and any arguments that the adverse\n\nactions extended beyond that date were waived, as discussed supra.\n\n             Plaintiff also contends that the Section 1983 statute of\n\nlimitations should be tolled by her filing of the EEOC charge,7 but\n\n\n     7\n      Under Puerto Rico law, the \"[p]rescription of actions is\ninterrupted   by  their   institution   before  the  courts,   by\nextrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by any act of\nacknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\" 31 L.P.R.A. § 5303.\nThe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that an administrative\naction must be essentially \"identical\" to the subsequent court\naction in order for this tolling rule to apply. Cintron v. Estado\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbecause   she   did   not   raise   this   issue   in    her   opposition    to\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss, the issue likewise is waived.                See\n\nRocafort, 334 F.3d at 121-22.         Furthermore, we find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the district judge's refusal to consider the argument\n\non   plaintiff's   motion    to   reconsider.      See   Cochran   v.
