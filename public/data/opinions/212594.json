Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                      Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n                   Souter,* Associate Justice,\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     James M.

Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f     Per Curiam.            This appeal is a sequel to an earlier appeal in\n\nwhich we reversed the denial of the defendant's post-trial motion\n\nto set aside his conviction on bank robbery charges and remanded\n\nthe case to the district court to determine whether the conviction\n\nwas tainted by jury bias.              See United States v. Villar, 586 F.3d\n\n76, 79 (1st Cir. 2009).           The background facts and the nature of the\n\njury bias claim are illumined in our earlier opinion.                      See id. at\n\n79-82.\n\n     On remand, the district court assiduously adhered to our\n\nmandate.     It held an evidentiary hearing, interviewed all the\n\njurors,    made    detailed      factual      findings    (including      credibility\n\ndeterminations), and concluded, based on these findings, that the\n\njurors were not biased and that the jury verdict was untainted.\n\nAccordingly,      it    again     refused      to   set   aside   the    judgment    of\n\nconviction.       The defendant appeals for a second time.\n\n     We need not tarry.           The district court's findings of fact are\n\namply supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous.                        See\n\nUnited    States       v.    Romain,    393    F.3d   63,   69    (1st    Cir.   2004)\n\n(explaining that a trial court's choice between conflicting but\n\nplausible     inferences         from    the     evidence    cannot      be   clearly\n\nerroneous); see generally Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902\n\nF.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that a finding is clearly\n\nerroneous only if the reviewing court is left with \"a strong,\n\nunyielding belief that a mistake has been made\").                        The district\n\n\n                                         - 2 -\n\fcourt's   conclusions   about   the   absence   of   jury   bias   follow\n\nrationally from those findings.
