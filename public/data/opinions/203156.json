Misael Acevedo-Aguilar, a native\n\nand   citizen   of   Mexico,    petitions   for   review   of   a   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") order affirming the decision of an\n\nimmigration judge (\"IJ\") that he was ineligible for cancellation of\n\nremoval because he was not continuously present in the United\n\nStates for the requisite 10 years prior to his application, as\n\nrequired by     section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct, 8 U.S.C.    § 1229b.      We deny the petition.\n\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms a portion of\n\nthe IJ's decision, while also providing additional analysis of its\n\nown, we directly review the adopted portions of the IJ decision,\n\nSulaiman v. Gonzalez, 429 F.3d 347, 350 (1st Cir. 2005), as well as\n\nthe BIA's additions,    Stroni v. Gonzales, 454 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   We review the decisions of the IJ and BIA according to a\n\n\"substantial evidence\" standard, under which we will uphold the\n\ndecisions if they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"            Carcamo-\n\nRecinos v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation\n\nand internal quotation omitted).       Under this deferential standard,\n\nwe will reverse only if \"the record evidence would compel a\n\nreasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\"             Stroni,\n\n454 F.3d at 87 (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f               FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n           The petitioner claims to have first entered the United\n\nStates without inspection in August 1992, when he was 16 years old,\n\nby crossing the Mexican border.    In March 2001, he married Kobi\n\nLittlefield, the mother of his then one-year old daughter, and\n\nshortly thereafter filed an I-485 adjustment of status application\n\ncontaining an I-130 immediate relative visa petition, filed by his\n\nwife.   As a result of marital discord which eventually culminated\n\nin divorce, Ms. Littlefield withdrew her I-130 petition, which led\n\nto the denial of Acevedo-Aguilar's I-485 application in November\n\n2001.\n\n           On August 7, 2003, federal immigration authorities issued\n\nAcevedo-Aguilar a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability.\n\nHe eventually conceded removability, but filed an application for\n\ncancellation, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), under which removal\n\nof a deportable alien may be cancelled if, inter alia, he \"has been\n\nphysically present in the United States for a continuous period of\n\n10 years immediately preceding the date of [his] application.\"\n\nSuch \"physical presence time\" stops accruing upon service of a\n\nnotice to appear.   8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1).   In addition, an alien\n\ndeparting the United States for \"any period in excess of 90 days or\n\naggregate periods exceeding 180 days\" is considered to have failed\n\nto \"maintain a continuous physical presence in the United States.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(2).\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           Under   this   construct   for   cancellation   of   removal,\n\nAcevedo-Aguilar's burden was to prove that he was continuously\n\npresent in the United States for the 10 years preceding August 7,\n\n2003.   The dispute in this case centers on a period in 1998 when he\n\nreturned to Mexico to attend his brother's wedding.        He testified\n\nthat he left the United States on March 20, 1998, and submitted\n\ninto evidence an airline ticket receipt bearing that date.        Thus,\n\nhe would have had to return to this country by June 18, 1998, to\n\nfall within the 90 day rule.\n\n           Pinpointing the petitioner's return date, however, is no\n\nsimple task, since he reentered to the United States by illegally\n\ncrossing the border at Nogales, Arizona.      Weighing heavily against\n\nhim was the I-485 application for adjustment he submitted in 2001,\n\nin which he noted that his last entry into the United States was\n\nJuly 9, 1998, 21 days outside the allowable time window.              He\n\ntestified however, that he returned to the United States on June\n\n10, 1998, which would be within the allowable time.        He explained\n\nthat the discrepancy was due to confusion about his departure date,\n\nwhich caused him to put the wrong date on the I-485.       He testified\n\nthat he knew he was away for approximately two months and a few\n\ndays after his brother's April 18 wedding, so when his mother\n\nshowed him the plane ticket with the March departure date, he\n\nrealized that his correct return date was in June, not July.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f           In addition to his own testimony, Petitioner's mother\n\ntestified about his absence from the United States in 1998.          She\n\ndid little to clear up the confusion, however, as she offered three\n\ndifferent accounts of Acevedo-Aguilar's return, testifying first\n\nthat she last saw him in Mexico on May 10, 1998, prior to an\n\nexpected border crossing between May 10 and June 10.          She also\n\ntestified that her son was in her house in Mexico between May 10\n\nand June 10, and later stated that he crossed the border into the\n\nUnited States on June 5.\n\n           In finding that Acevedo-Aguilar had not met his burden of\n\nproving his continuous presence in the United States, the IJ cited\n\nthe   discrepancy   between   petitioner's   testimony   regarding   his\n\nabsence, the plane ticket receipt and his sworn I-485 form.          The\n\nBIA adopted that finding and placed additional reliance on the\n\ninconsistent    testimony     of   petitioner's    mother    regarding\n\npetitioner's whereabouts between March and July 1998.         As these\n\nconclusions are supported by substantial record evidence, the\n\npetition for review is denied.1\n\n\n\n\n1\n Because we resolve this petition on the issue of Acevedo-Aguilar's\n1998 absence from the United States, we do not reach his other\nclaims of error.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
