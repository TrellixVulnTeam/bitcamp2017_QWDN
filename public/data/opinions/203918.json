Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                    Torruella, Stahl and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     José Javier Santos Mimoso on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                             July 17, 2009\n\f           Per Curiam. This appeal arises from a breach of contract\n\naction brought by Ramón Antonio Borrero McCormick against the\n\nUniversity of Health Sciences Antigua School of Medicine, alleging\n\nthat the University breached its contract to provide him with a\n\nmedical   degree    despite      his    completion   of   all    applicable\n\nrequirements, in particular, the required clinical rotations.            By\n\nway of relief, he sought both damages and equitable relief, i.e.,\n\na medical degree.     The district court reserved the propriety of\n\nequitable relief to itself, but the case proceeded to a jury trial\n\non liability and damages.         After Borrero rested his case, the\n\nUniversity moved for entry of judgment in its favor, and the\n\ndistrict court granted the motion.           This is an appeal from that\n\nruling.\n\n           As we recently reiterated, \"[a] trial court confronted\n\nwith a motion for judgment as a matter of law must scrutinize the\n\nevidence and the inferences reasonably extractable therefrom in the\n\nlight   most   hospitable   to   the    nonmovant.   In   conducting   that\n\nperscrutation, . . . the court must not pass upon the credibility\n\nof the witnesses, resolve evidentiary conflicts, or engage in a\n\ncomparative weighing of the proof.           A motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law may be granted only if the evidence, viewed from this\n\nperspective, adumbrates a result as to which reasonable minds could\n\nnot differ.\"    Martínez-Serrano v. Quality Health Servs., Inc., 568\n\nF.3d 278, 285 (1st Cir. 2009) (citations omitted).              Not only is\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthat legal standard inhospitable to such motions, but also, as we\n\nhave repeatedly cautioned, interests of judicial economy counsel\n\nagainst granting such motions, particularly before all the evidence\n\nis in.       Rather, \"in most cases a trial court will be better\n\nadvised to reserve decision on . . . a motion [for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law], passing on the legal question only after submitting\n\nthe case to the jury.     Mid-trial directed verdicts should be the\n\nexception, not the rule.\"    Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731,\n\n735 n.4 (1st Cir. 1994); EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. v. Century\n\nIndem. Co., 452 F.3d 44, 50 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Unitherm Food\n\nSys. Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U.S. 394, 405-06 (2006)).\n\n            Here, the district court purported to apply the above\n\nstandard.    However, in fact, it expressly drew inferences against\n\nBorrero   and   implicitly   found    him   and   one   of   his   witnesses\n\nincredible.     Contrary to the district court's conclusion that \"the\n\nevidence in favor of Defendant is so overwhelming that reasonable\n\npersons could not arrive at a contrary verdict,\" the evidence that\n\nhad been presented when the motion for judgment was granted was\n\nlegally     sufficient--though   conflicting      and   dubious    in   some\n\nrespects--for a reasonable jury to conclude that Borrero had\n\ncompleted the required clinical rotations.\n\n            Specifically, at the outset of the trial, the parties\n\nstipulated that the required rotations were as follows:            internal\n\nmedicine, 12 weeks; surgery, 12 weeks; obstetrics and gynecology,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f8 weeks; pediatrics, 6 weeks; psychiatry, 6 weeks; family medicine,\n\n4 weeks; and electives, 30 weeks.              Near the end of Borrero's case,\n\nthey further stipulated to the accuracy of a chart showing that\n\nBorrero     completed        the   required    number         of   weeks   of    internal\n\nmedicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and family medicine\n\nand    more    than    the    required   number          of   weeks   of     pediatrics,\n\npsychiatry, and electives on particular dates.                         That chart was\n\nconsistent      with      Borrero's    own    testimony        and    with    the   dates\n\nappearing on evaluations signed by the doctors who supervised each\n\nof the rotations.          In addition, two doctors at the hospital where\n\nmost of the rotations were performed certified that Borrero had\n\ncompleted all of the required rotations.\n\n               To be sure, there was conflicting evidence (despite the\n\nabove-referenced stipulation) as to the dates on which some of the\n\nrotations were performed. And, when confronted with that evidence,\n\nthe certifying doctors conceded that their certifications may have\n\nbeen inaccurate in that respect.                Nevertheless, at least one of\n\nthose doctors maintained that even if the dates certified were\n\nincorrect, Borrero had put in the requisite time in each specialty.\n\nDespite       the   University's      efforts       to    impeach     that       witness's\n\ncredibility, the jury could have believed him.\n\n               From the University's opening statement and its argument\n\nin support of its motion for judgment, it appears that its theory\n\nof    the   case    was    that    Borrero    did   not       complete     the    required\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\frotations because some of the rotations admittedly overlapped with\n\nothers.      However, up to the point when the motion for judgment was\n\ngranted, there was no evidence that the University prohibited\n\nmedical students from performing overlapping rotations.                Borrero\n\nhimself and the doctor in charge of the clinical rotation program\n\nat the hospital where Borrero did his rotations testified that they\n\nwere   not    aware    of   any   such   prohibition;   no   such   requirement\n\nappeared in any of the written agreements introduced; and the jury\n\ncould have credited the testimony of one of the doctors that a\n\nstudent could learn about more than one specialty at once because\n\ntreatment of one patient might involve interaction with doctors in\n\nvarious fields; for example, delivery of a baby by Caesarian\n\nsection might involve obstetrics, anaesthesiology, surgery, and\n\npediatrics.       Moreover, because it was stipulated that Borrero\n\nperformed more than the required number of weeks in several areas,\n\nsome overlap would not necessarily mean that he fell short of the\n\nrequired weeks in each area.\n\n              Similarly, at the time the motion was granted, there had\n\nbeen no testimonial or documentary evidence presented as to why the\n\nUniversity did not permit Borrero to graduate.               Borrero testified\n\nthat the University never explained its decision to him and no\n\nrationale appears in any of the documentary evidence that had been\n\nadmitted     up   to   that   point.      In   its   opening   statement,   the\n\nUniversity promised that an explanation would be provided through\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthe testimony of University officials, but that testimony was\n\npretermitted by the granting of the motion.     Although it is true\n\nthat a court should defer to the professional judgment of academic\n\nofficials on such matters, Mangla v. Brown University, 135 F.3d 80,\n\n84 (1st Cir. 1998), here there was no evidence of a judgment to\n\nwhich the court could defer.\n\n          In sum, this is not a case where there was no evidence on\n\nan essential element of the plaintiff's claim, cf. Martínez-Serrano,\n\n568 F.3d at 287, or where the evidence that had been presented at\n\nthe time that the motion was granted was so one-sided that no\n\nrational jury could have found in Borrero's favor, cf. Mangla, 135\n\nF.3d at 84.    Because the district court therefore erred in granting\n\nthe motion at that point, we vacate the judgment.    In doing so, we\n\nrecognize the burden that this places on the district court;\n\nhowever, that burden could have been avoided if that court had\n\nheeded our advice of reserving judgment on a mid-trial motion for\n\njudgment and allowing the case to go to the jury first.\n\n          Vacated and remanded. See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).    No costs\n\nare awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
