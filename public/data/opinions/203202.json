Strippoli, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Jeffrey S. Bucholtz, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nand Mary Jane Candaux, Assistant Director, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                             March 14, 2008\n\n\n\n\n      *\n      Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f      Wallace, Senior Circuit Judge. Petitioner Senada Ndreka seeks\n\nreview of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (Board) denial of her\n\nappeal. Substantial evidence supports the Board’s decision, and we\n\naffirm.   See López de Hincapié v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 218-220\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).\n\n      Ndreka cannot qualify as a refugee unless she was persecuted\n\nbased on a protected ground. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421,\n\n428 (1987); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).            Although Ndreka\n\nargues she was subject to persecution based on her political\n\nopinion, substantial evidence supports the Board’s determination\n\nthat Ndreka was targeted by criminals interested in using her for\n\nsex trafficking and not because of her political opinion.             Thus,\n\nshe is not entitled to asylum relief.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1).\n\nBecause Ndreka failed to show that she was persecuted based on a\n\nprotected ground for asylum eligibility purposes, she likewise\n\nfails in her application for withholding of removal.          See López de\n\nHincapié, 494 F.3d at 220.\n\n      Substantial evidence supports the Board’s determination that\n\nNdreka has not shown it is more likely than not that she would be\n\ntortured by or at the acquiescence of a government official upon\n\nher   return   to   Albania,   and   the   denial   of   relief   under   the\n\nConvention Against Torture was therefore appropriate. See Xue Deng\n\nJiang v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n      Therefore, Ndreka’s petition for review is denied.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f",
