In these consolidated criminal\n\nappeals, defendants Charles Brown, Charles Isler, and Bilal Abdul\n\nRashid challenge their convictions and sentences for participating\n\nin   a   cocaine   base   distribution        conspiracy.     We    affirm   the\n\nconvictions and Brown's sentence, but vacate Isler and Rashid's\n\nsentences.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            We present the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdicts.     See United States v. Boulerice, 325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n            On   the   afternoon   of    June    3,   2003,   Detective     Scott\n\nPartridge of the Providence Police Department was surveilling the\n\nrear of Brown's multi-family house from an adjacent yard.                    The\n\nhouse had previously been the subject of extensive surveillance,\n\nand the Providence police had executed a number of controlled buys\n\nof cocaine base from the first floor apartment.                    As Partridge\n\nwatched, Brown pulled his car into his house's yard, which was\n\nempty except for an old junk car.            Brown exited the car carrying a\n\ncheese puff container and a brown paper bag.             Partridge saw Brown\n\nremove a plastic bag containing a white substance from the paper\n\nbag and place it in the false bottom of the container.              Brown    then\n\nreturned the container to his car and entered the first floor\n\napartment with the bag and its remaining contents.                  No one else\n\nentered or left the house.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            Approximately half an hour later, Partridge and several\n\nother officers executed a search warrant for the apartment. Two of\n\nthe officers covered the front door, and the rest entered through\n\nthe back.    All were clad in black windbreakers bearing the legend\n\n\"Providence Police\" in large, yellow letters.         Partridge's team\n\nproceeded to the rear door of the first floor apartment, announced\n\nits presence, received no response, and then forcibly entered. The\n\nentry took considerable effort: the rear door was heavily fortified\n\nwith steel bars, had no handle, and could be opened (from either\n\nside) only with a key for the heavy deadbolt lock.      Also, a second\n\ninterior door was wedged in tightly inside the fortified exterior\n\ndoor.    Notably, the exterior door contained a four by six inch \"cut\n\nout\" and a large kitchen knife was hidden in the door's interior\n\npanel.\n\n            Brown, Isler, and Rashid were standing near the kitchen\n\ntable when the officers entered through the back entrance, and\n\nattempted to flee through the front door.        But upon hearing the\n\nother officers outside, they reversed field and attempted to force\n\ntheir way past the original entry team. A violent struggle ensued,\n\nand the defendants were subdued.        Brown had $65 upon his person,\n\nRashid had $1078, and Isler had $515.\n\n            The apartment was small and sparsely furnished, except\n\nfor the kitchen. On the kitchen table, surrounded by three chairs,\n\nthe officers found monitors for a sophisticated surveillance system\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fcomprised of several cameras, a motion sensor, an intercom, and a\n\npair of exterior lights -- one red and the other green.              On the\n\nsame table was the paper bag that Brown had carried into the\n\napartment.    Inside the paper bag were two plastic bags containing\n\n142.45 grams of cocaine base.        Also on the table were a digital\n\nscale, plastic bags, plastic bags with their corners snipped off,\n\nscissors, baking soda, a razor, a cooking plate with cocaine base\n\nresidue, $250 in cash, two cell phones, a pager, and Isler's wallet\n\nand keys.    The only key for the deadbolt lock on the fortified rear\n\ndoor hung on a hook near the table.\n\n            The officers also collected 26 small packages containing\n\n6.328 grams of cocaine base from an overflowing toilet in a nearby\n\nbathroom.     A   search   of   Brown's   car   yielded   the   cheese   puff\n\ncontainer, which contained an additional 16.73 grams of cocaine\n\nbase.\n\n            All three defendants were charged with conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base\n\n(Count I), see 21 U.S.C. § 846, and possession with intent to\n\ndistribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base (Count II), see 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & (b)(1)(A).            In addition, based on the\n\nnarcotics found in his car, Brown was charged with possession with\n\nintent to distribute 5 or more grams of cocaine base (Count III),\n\nsee 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & (b)(1)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          At trial, the government called several officers and\n\nforensic specialists, and the government's case included expert\n\ntestimony that the surveillance equipment, barricaded doors, and\n\ncut out1 on the exterior door were indicative of a drug house.\n\nOnly Brown testified for the defense.    He testified that he had\n\nbeen let in by three unidentified men who left moments before the\n\nraid; that he was present only to collect rent from his tenant;\n\nthat there were no drugs in the house or his car; that he had never\n\nseen Rashid or Isler before the raid; that Rashid was there to\n\npurchase his tenant's minivan; that Isler was sitting in a bedroom\n\n(possibly listening to music); that there were at least four cars\n\nin the yard at the time of the raid; that he tried to let the\n\npolice in when they knocked but they ordered him away from the\n\ndoor; that the defendants did not try to flee or resist; and that\n\nthe security and surveillance equipment had been installed by the\n\nprevious owner and/or was typical for homes in the area.\n\n          The jury convicted Brown on all counts.    The jury also\n\nconvicted both Isler and Rashid, but held them responsible for less\n\nthan 5 grams of cocaine base on both counts (and not for the 50 or\n\nmore grams originally charged in the indictment). Isler and Rashid\n\nwere sentenced to 262 and 210 months' imprisonment, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n1\n The cut out was large enough to pass drugs and money through, but\nsmall enough that a drug purchaser could not get a clear look at\nthe seller on the other side of the door.\n\n                               -6-\n\fBrown received a mandatory life sentence because he had two prior\n\nfelony narcotics convictions.        See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                     II.\n\n              The defendants challenge their convictions and sentences\n\non several grounds.       The primary appellate issues are (1) whether\n\nthere   was    sufficient    evidence   to   sustain    Isler   and   Rashid's\n\nconvictions; (2) whether the district court erroneously permitted\n\ndetailed cross-examination concerning Brown's prior convictions;\n\n(3) whether the court abused its discretion when it admitted\n\ntestimony from one of the government's experts; (4) whether the\n\ngovernment's closing argument was inappropriate and prejudicial;\n\n(5) whether the court should have applied the rule of lenity to\n\nsentence Brown to a shorter prison term because the relevant\n\nprovisions of 21 U.S.C. § 841 are ambiguous; and (6) whether the\n\ndefendants are entitled to resentencing under United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).2\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n              Rashid   and   Isler   claim    that     the   district     court\n\nerroneously      denied   their   motions    for   acquittal    because    the\n\ngovernment demonstrated only that they were \"merely present\" at the\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The government maintains that certain of the defendants'\narguments were not preserved for plenary appellate consideration.\nWe shall assume, without deciding, that the issues were properly\npreserved unless we state otherwise.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdrug raid.3    See United States v. Llinas, 373 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)(government must prove more than mere presence to obtain drug\n\nconspiracy conviction).     Isler and Rashid maintain that they did\n\nnot own the house, that the three defendants had never met before\n\nthe raid, that neither Rashid nor Isler was ever in the house\n\nbefore the raid, and that there was no evidence that they possessed\n\nor agreed to possess the narcotics.\n\n          We review the denial of a motion for acquittal de novo.\n\nSee Boulerice, 325 F.3d at 79.       We will affirm if, after reviewing\n\nall the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, we conclude that a\n\nrational jury could find the essential elements of the crime proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.     Id.\n\n          Isler and Rashid argue as though only direct evidence can\n\nsupport their convictions.     But of course, this is not so; indeed\n\nthe government may rely entirely on circumstantial evidence to\n\nprove the charged offense.     See United States v. Soler, 275 F.3d\n\n146, 150 (1st Cir. 2002); see also United States v. Batista-\n\nPolanco, 927 F.2d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1991)(a conspiracy can be\n\ndemonstrated     by   \"a    development     and   a   collocation   of\n\n3\n  Rashid also makes a passing attempt to assign error to the\ndistrict court's failure to provide a limiting instruction that he\nhad requested. But Rashid's argument is undeveloped and therefore\nforfeited. See United States v. Vasquez-Guadalupe, 407 F.3d 492,\n499-500 (1st Cir. 2005).    In any event, there was no abuse of\ndiscretion, as the district court ultimately instructed the jury\nthat Brown's prior convictions could only be considered in\nevaluating Brown's credibility.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcircumstances\")(internal citation and quotation omitted). As we\n\nhave explained:\n\n             The defendant's presence at a place where\n             contraband is found may or may not be purely\n             coincidental.    The attendant circumstances\n             tell the tale – and the culpability of a\n             defendant's presence hinges upon whether the\n             circumstances   fairly   imply   participatory\n             involvement.   In other words, a defendant's\n             \"mere   presence\"   argument   will  fail   in\n             situations where the \"mere\" is lacking.\n\nUnited States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             The facts surrounding Isler and Rashid's arrest permitted\n\nthe   jury   to   find   that   they    were      more   than    merely      present.\n\nDetective Partridge saw Brown bring a substance that proved to be\n\ncocaine base into the house.        When the officers burst through the\n\nheavily fortified back door, Isler, Rashid, and Brown were the only\n\npersons in the apartment and were standing near the kitchen table\n\nwith three chairs.       On the kitchen table were the monitors for an\n\nelaborate     surveillance      system,       a   quantity      of   cocaine     base\n\nsuggestive of narcotics distribution (and not personal use), cash,\n\nIsler's wallet and keys, and various drug packaging paraphernalia.\n\nIn the bathroom, a few feet away, was evidence of a hasty and\n\nunsuccessful attempt to flush more cocaine base down the toilet.\n\nCompare Soler, 275 F.3d at 151; Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678-79;\n\nBatista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 17-19.\n\n             Further,    the    house     was     a   fortress,      with     heavily\n\nreinforced doors and an extensive surveillance system.                      From this\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fevidence, the jury could have inferred that the dealers wished to\n\nconduct their business in absolute secrecy and security, and that\n\nonly the conspiracy's participants would be permitted into the\n\napartment.    See   generally   Llinas,      373    F.3d    at   32   (\"criminal\n\nconspirators do not involve innocent persons at critical stages of\n\na drug deal\"); United States v. Montilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d 1060,\n\n1064 (1st Cir. 1997) (criminals do not welcome innocent bystanders\n\nas witnesses to their crimes); United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d\n\n707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992)(criminals \"rarely seek to perpetrate\n\nfelonies before larger-than-necessary audiences\").\n\n            Finally, the defendants fled from the police, and, when\n\ncornered,    engaged   a   violent   struggle      with    the   officers.      In\n\nappropriate circumstances, flight can be probative of guilt.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Carpenter, 403 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Otero-Mendez, 273 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            In sum, the district court properly concluded that there\n\nwas sufficient evidence to support the convictions.4\n\nB. Prior Convictions\n\n            Brown   contends    that   the   district       court     abused   its\n\ndiscretion and prejudiced his defense by permitting the government\n\nto cross-examine him in detail about his prior convictions before\n\nlater ruling that the evidence was inadmissible.\n\n\n4\n For these same reasons, it was not an abuse of discretion for the\ndistrict court to deny Isler and Rashid's motions for a new trial.\nSee Montilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d at 1064.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f          Brown had three prior felony narcotics convictions, all\n\ninvolving marijuana.   Before trial, the government filed a notice\n\nof intent to introduce the prior convictions for impeachment, see\n\nFed. R. Evid. 609, and as admissible other bad act evidence, see\n\nFed. R. Evid. 404(b), in anticipation of a mere presence defense.\n\nBrown never objected to the notice or filed a motion in limine to\n\nexclude the evidence. On direct examination, Brown testified about\n\nthe basic facts of his prior convictions.5   On cross-examination,\n\nthe government re-elicited these basic facts and then inquired,\n\nunder Rule 404(b), about the historical facts underlying his\n\nrecord.   During the government's rebuttal argument, the prosecutor\n\nmade reference to Brown's testimony about his prior convictions and\n\nBrown objected. After a bench conference, the court ruled that the\n\n404(b) evidence of prior convictions was not allowed and instructed\n\nthe prosecutor to refrain from making additional reference to it.\n\nThe court did not, however, strike the prior testimony concerning\n\nthe details of the prior convictions.    Brown argues that he was\n\nprejudiced by the court's failure to exclude the 404(b) evidence.\n\nThe government contends that there was no abuse of discretion and,\n\nin any event, the challenged testimony was harmless.\n\n5\n  Brown admitted the following convictions and sentences: (1) a\n1992 conviction for possession of marijuana for which he served six\nmonths of a four-year sentence; (2) a 1995 conviction for\npossession of 1-5 kilos of marijuana for which he served three\nyears of a fifteen-year sentence; and (3) a 1995 conviction for\npossession of marijuana with intent to deliver and conspiracy to\ntraffic in marijuana for which he served three years of a ten-year\nsentence.\n\n                               -11-\n\f            We choose to proceed directly to the harmless error\n\ninquiry.   \"[T]he admission of improper testimony is harmless if it\n\nis highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\"\n\nUnited States v. Garcia-Morales, 382 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nA   harmless      error   analysis     is     case    specific,    and   requires\n\nconsideration of such factors as the \"centrality of the tainted\n\nevidence, its uniqueness, its prejudicial impact, the use to which\n\nthe evidence was put, and the relative strengths of the parties'\n\ncases.\"    Id.\n\n            Brown focuses on the admission of three               facts: (1) that\n\nhe did not remember the weight of the marijuana involved in one\n\noffense    (but    the    prosecutor    suggested      ten   pounds);    (2)   his\n\nexculpatory account of his involvement in one offense (essentially\n\nthat Brown threw the marijuana in the trash at someone's behest);\n\nand (3) that he was arrested for one offense with $16,000 on his\n\nperson.    In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that these\n\nfacts did not sway the jury.\n\n            The challenged facts added little to the basic facts of\n\nconvictions, which had been recounted twice on direct and cross-\n\nexamination.         Moreover,   they       were     not   highlighted   in    the\n\nprosecution's argument, and were inconsequential when evaluated\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fagainst the balance of the prosecution's considerable evidence.6\n\nAny error in the admission of this evidence was harmless.\n\nC. A'Vant's Testimony\n\n           Brown       argues   that        the   district    court        abused   its\n\ndiscretion by admitting certain testimony from Officer Angelo\n\nA'Vant, one of the government's expert witnesses, concerning the\n\nfeatures of a drug house.              Brown does not challenge A'Vant's\n\nqualifications as an expert.           Rather, he challenges the relevance\n\nof his testimony to Brown's house.                Specifically, Brown complains\n\nthat   A'Vant    was    permitted      to    testify   that    the    security      and\n\nsurveillance set-up at Brown's house was something that he had\n\nnever previously seen.7         According to Brown, this testimony was\n\nirrelevant      and    highly   prejudicial         because    it    permitted      the\n\nprosecutor      to     argue    that        the   defendants        were     unusually\n\n\"sophisticated\" criminals.          Brown concedes that our review is for\n\n\n6\n  Brown also argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by\nreferring to Brown's prior convictions during cross-examination and\nclosing argument. But as we have explained, it was not apparent\nuntil the government's rebuttal argument that the prior conviction\nevidence was off-limits. After the district court's ruling, the\nprosecutor made no further mention of the convictions. There was\nno misconduct.\n7\n  Brown complains only about two snippets in A'Vant's direct\ntestimony. In the first, A'Vant responded to the question whether\nhe had ever encountered barricaded doors on \"routine\" police calls\n(as distinguished from drug raids) as follows: \"On routine calls,\nI have never seen a similar set-up like this is my career.\" In the\nsecond, in response to the question how many times he had seen a\ngreen light bulb in the hallway of a residence during his years as\na patrol officer, A'Vant stated: \"I don't ever recall seeing a\ngreen light bulb.\"\n\n                                        -13-\n\fplain error only.   A plain error must be \"clear or obvious, affect\n\nsubstantial rights, and seriously affect the fairness, integrity,\n\nor public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Garcia-Morales, 382\n\nF.3d at 18.\n\n          Brown's argument fails for many reasons, the most basic\n\nof which is that he misstates the essence of A'Vant's testimony.\n\nPrior to the challenged testimony, A'Vant had testified at length\n\nthat the barricades and surveillance features on Brown's house were\n\nconsistent with those at other drug houses that he had raided.    The\n\nroutine patrol questions were intended to show that \"normal\" houses\n\nin the area did not have such features.        This testimony was\n\nresponsive to Brown's defense that he was merely present at the\n\ncrime scene, which Brown supported with his testimony that his\n\nhouse was just like any other house in that part of Providence.    In\n\nshort, A'Vant simply did not testify that he was unfamiliar with\n\nthe equipment at Brown's house.        There was no error in the\n\nadmission of A'Vant's testimony, plain or otherwise.8\n\nD. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n          Isler claims that the prosecutor, during her closing\n\nargument, twice improperly shifted the burden of proof to the\n\ndefendants and improperly vouched for the government witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Having dispatched each of Brown's individual assignments of\nprejudicial error, we summarily reject his claim that the alleged\nerrors combined to deprive him of a fair trial.\n\n                                -14-\n\f            In    the   first   challenged    remark,   the   prosecutor   was\n\ndiscussing       Brown's   testimony    regarding   the   house's   security\n\nfeatures:\n\n            Charles Brown would have you believe that this\n            is to protect people from burglary, that this\n            set-up is all over the place. In fact, it's\n            in the other apartment that he owns.     Well,\n            where is the documentary proof of that, ladies\n            and gentlemen? None. You just have Charles\n            Brown's word.\n\nBrown's counsel objected, and the district judge sustained the\n\nobjection and instructed the jury to disregard the remark.\n\n            The second challenged remark concerned Brown's claim that\n\nhe was merely present at the crime scene to collect rent from his\n\ntenant:\n\n            And he tells you that he went in to collect\n            the rent.   Well, if he went to collect the\n            rent, why didn't he take his rent receipt book\n            with him? You know why, ladies and gentlemen.\n            Because there is no rent receipt book, because\n            he wasn't there to collect the rent, because\n            there was no tenant, because again, ladies and\n            gentlemen, other than Charles Brown's word,\n            there is no proof of Anthony Wilson as a\n            tenant. His name is not on the utility bills.\n\nThe district court again sustained defense counsel's objection and\n\ninstructed the jury to disregard the statement.               The prosecutor\n\nthen stated:\n\n            So you have to choose in whom you're going to\n            place your trust, ladies and gentlemen, and\n            you know in whom the defense placed their\n            trust. They embraced the testimony . . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fDefense counsel interrupted the prosecutor with an objection, which\n\nthe court sustained.\n\n               None of these lines of argument was improper.               Isler's\n\n\"burden shifting\" claim disregards the fact that Brown testified at\n\nlength and that all the defendants endorsed Brown's testimony in\n\ntheir closings.          \"[W]hen a defendant puts [his] credibility at\n\nissue     by    testifying,     the   prosecution       can     comment    on    the\n\nimplausibility of [his] testimony or its lack of evidentiary\n\nfoundation.\"       Boulerice, 325 F.3d at 86.            Here, the prosecutor\n\nmerely called attention to the lack of supporting evidence for\n\nBrown's implausible assertions and attempted to highlight the fact\n\nthat rival accounts had been presented to the jury.\n\n               In addition to burden shifting claims, Isler also argues\n\nthat the prosecutor improperly placed her prestige as a government\n\nofficer    behind      the   testimony   of   the   police      officers.        The\n\nchallenged comment came on the heels of suggestions by defense\n\ncounsel that the officers' testimony (in particular Partridge's)\n\ncontained       gaping    inconsistencies       which    were     indicative      of\n\nfabrication.\n\n               The prosecutor began by recounting that the officers all\n\nremembered       the   significant    matters    the    same     way,     that   the\n\ndifferences in recollection were trivial, and that the jury should\n\nbe more concerned if there were not small variations in their\n\ntestimony.       She continued:\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f                   If    Detective    Partridge    was    so\n            frustrated, if they were all so intent on\n            securing    a    conviction    against     these\n            Defendants, wouldn't they have come up with a\n            better story, ladies and gentlemen? Why not\n            put the keys to the doors of the apartment on\n            the key chain of one of the Defendants? Why\n            not put the drugs in the Defendants' pockets?\n            Why not tell you that they observed one of the\n            Defendants run out of the bathroom? Why not\n            tell you that they saw the three Defendants\n            together numerous times prior to June 3rd?\n\n                   Ladies and gentlemen, that is how you\n            evaluate the credibility of that testimony.\n            It has the ring of truth.   Conspiracies are\n            secret. They happen behind locked doors.\n\nDefense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial.         The district\n\ncourt sustained the    objections, instructed the jury to disregard\n\nthe \"ring of truth\" comment, and took the motions for mistrial\n\nunder advisement.9\n\n            \"A prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness when she\n\nplaces the prestige of her office behind the government's case by\n\n. . . imparting her personal belief in a witness's veracity or\n\nimplying that the jury should credit the prosecution's evidence\n\nsimply because the government can be trusted.\"         United States v.\n\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The   challenged   remarks   do   not   constitute   improper\n\nvouching.     First, arguing why a witness should be believed or\n\nasking jurors to use their common sense in assessing witness\n\ntestimony is not vouching.     See Id. at 10; Rodriguez, 215 F.3d at\n\n\n9\n    These motions were later denied.\n\n                                  -17-\n\f123.   Second, the prosecutor did not express her personal views\n\nregarding the officers' accounts or imply that they should be\n\nbelieved because they were government officials.         See Perez-Ruiz,\n\n353 F.3d at 10.   Third, the comments were a logical counter to the\n\ndefense claim of witness fabrication, and we have upheld such\n\nrejoinders.   See United States v. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d            1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2005); United States v. Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d 476, 483-84\n\n(1st. Cir. 2005); Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 10.\n\nE. Ambiguity in Cocaine/Cocaine Base Provisions\n\n          Brown   argues   that   he   should   have   received    a   lower\n\nsentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841 under the rule of lenity.               Brown\n\nbegins with the fact that a certain quantity of \"cocaine base\" will\n\ntrigger a far harsher sentence than the same quantity of \"cocaine,\n\nits salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers.\"\n\nCompare 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) & (B)(ii)(II) with 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) & (B)(iii).      From there he reasons that\n\nbecause \"cocaine base\" and \"cocaine\" are chemically identical and\n\nthe substance \"cocaine base\" falls within the extended definition\n\nof \"cocaine\" (\"cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers,\n\nand salts of isomers\"), the penalty provision in 21 U.S.C. § 841 is\n\nfatally ambiguous because a conviction for possessing \"cocaine\n\nbase\" would appear to be eligible for punishment under both the\n\n\"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" penalty provisions.        Therefore, Brown\n\nposits, because the jury found only that he possessed \"cocaine\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fbase,\" he is entitled to receive the statutory sentence provided\n\nfor distributing more than 50 grams of \"cocaine,\" relying upon\n\nUnited States v. Brisbane, 367 F.3d 910 (D.C. Cir. 2004).10               Brown\n\nagain concedes that our review is for plain error only.\n\n            We readily conclude that there was no plain error.\n\nFirst,   Brown's     claim   that    \"cocaine\"    and    \"cocaine     base\"   are\n\nchemically identical is inaccurate. See United States v. Robinson,\n\n144 F.3d 104, 108-9 (1st Cir. 1998)(noting differing chemical\n\nformulas); United States v. Barnes, 890 F.2d 545, 552 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)(\"the    term    'cocaine      base'    clearly    defines   a   substance\n\ndiffering from other forms of cocaine\").               Second, this court has\n\nconcluded that the term \"cocaine base\" in Section 841(b) includes\n\nall forms of cocaine base (not simply crack).            See United States v.\n\nMedina, __ F.3d __, 2005 WL 2740828, at *3 (1st Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2000); United\n\nStates v. Lopez-Gil, 965 F.2d 1124, 1134 (1st Cir. 1992)(opinion on\n\nrehearing).        See also Barnes, 890 F.2d at 553 (cocaine base\n\nprovision    not    unconstitutionally       vague).      In   this   case,   the\n\ngovernment presented undisputed evidence that the substance seized\n\n\n\n\n10\n  Holding that, in the absence of proof the \"cocaine base\" that\ndefendant possessed was crack or another smokable form of cocaine\nbase(which Congress intended to punish more severely than\n\"cocaine\"), defendant was entitled to be sentenced under \"cocaine\"\npenalty provision. See Brisbane, 367 F.3d at 913-15.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fwas cocaine base, and the jury so found. There was no error in\n\nBrown's sentence.11\n\nF. Booker\n\n            All three defendants argue that they are entitled to a\n\nremand for resentencing under Booker.            They all maintain that the\n\ndistrict judge's comments at sentencing clearly indicate that she\n\nwould have imposed a lower sentence if the guidelines were not\n\nmandatory.       In addition, they contend that drug quantity and the\n\nexistence of their prior convictions are facts that must be found\n\nby a jury.       All three concede that our review is for plain error\n\nonly.\n\n            To establish a plain error under Booker, a defendant must\n\ndemonstrate (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects\n\nsubstantial rights, and (4) that seriously impairs the fairness,\n\nintegrity,   or     public    reputation    of   judicial   proceedings.     See\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThe first two prongs are met if the district court treated the\n\nSentencing Guidelines as mandatory.          Id.    Thus, we must determine\n\nif the defendants satisfy the third and fourth prongs of the test.\n\n            In    the   sui   generis   circumstances       of   assessing   the\n\n\n11\n  As to Brown's reliance on Brisbane, the clear or obvious error\nprong is not satisfied where the district court declined to follow\na case from another circuit that concedes it is expressing a\nminority view and is explicitly at odds with this circuit's\nprecedent. Cf. United States v. D'Amario, 412 F.3d 253, 256-57\n(1st Cir. 2005)(no plain error if circuit courts are split on\nissue).\n\n                                     -20-\n\fappropriateness of a Booker remand under the plain error standard,\n\nour cases have consistently held that a remand is appropriate if\n\nthe district judge has made comments in the sentencing record\n\nindicating a reasonable probability that she would have imposed a\n\nlower sentence if unshackled by the mandatory guidelines.                     See\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 81; United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d\n\n220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005); Wilkerson, 411 F.3d at 10.              As to prongs\n\nthree and four, \"our principal concern in these Booker 'pipeline'\n\ncases is with the likelihood that the defendant would have received\n\na lesser sentence in a post-Booker regime of advisory guidelines.\"\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d at 224; see also Wilkerson, 411 F.3d at 10.\n\n           We    begin   with   Isler   and     Rashid,   both   of   whom   were\n\nsentenced at the bottom of their respective guideline ranges.                 In\n\nboth their sentencing proceedings, the district judge made a host\n\nof comments about her lack of discretion under the guidelines and\n\nthe \"waste\" brought about by the length and extreme harshness of\n\nthe sentences.      Moreover, the district judge stated that the\n\nsentence was \"tragic\" because she was \"not sure that a sentence of\n\nthis length is absolutely necessary\" and that she was not sure\n\nthat, in the absence of the guidelines, she \"would have imposed\n\nthat harsh a penalty.\"      In light of these remarks, which indicate\n\na   reasonable    probability    of     lower    sentences   under     advisory\n\nguidelines, Isler and Rashid are entitled to resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f           Brown is less fortunate for two reasons.         First, Brown\n\nreceived   a   mandatory   statutory   (rather   than   guidelines)   life\n\nsentence based upon the instant convictions and his two prior\n\nnarcotics convictions (the existence of which he admitted). Booker\n\ndoes not apply in such circumstances. See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d\n\nat 75 (\"A mandatory minimum sentence imposed as required by statute\n\nbased on facts found by a jury or admitted by a defendant is not a\n\ncandidate for Booker error\"); United States v. Bermudez, 407 F.3d\n\n536, 545 (1st Cir. 2005)(same).        Second, Brown's contention that\n\nhis criminal history must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt is foreclosed by our recent precedent.       See United States v.\n\nWork, 409 F.3d 484, 491 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005)(\"In the roiled wake of\n\nBooker, it remains the law that previous criminal convictions are\n\nnot 'facts' that must be found by a jury and proved beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"); United States v. Lewis, 406 F.3d 11, 21 n.11\n\n(1st Cir. 2005)(same).12\n\n12\n  Brown also argued in his initial brief that the district court\nerred in determining that his prior convictions were unrelated\nunder the guidelines. However, Brown later conceded that this is\na statutory rather than a guidelines determination. See United\nStates v. De Jesus Mateo, 373 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 2004). In his\nreply brief and at oral argument, Brown made a related argument\nthat the district court erroneously applied the guidelines standard\nrather than the statutory standard in determining whether his prior\nconvictions involved distinct criminal episodes for purposes of 21\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A). This claim is forfeited. See United States\nv. Evans-Garcia, 322 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir. 2003) (arguments not\nraised until reply brief are waived); Gosselin v. Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, 276 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir. 2002) (arguments not\nraised until oral argument are waived).       Moreover, the facts\nregarding the circumstances of the two prior offenses, notably the\nsignificant gap between the offenses and the intervening arrest\n\n                                  -22-\n\f                                      III.\n\n              For   the   reasons   stated   above,    Isler   and    Rashid's\n\nconvictions are affirmed, their sentences are vacated, and their\n\ncases   are    remanded     for   resentencing   in   accordance     with   this\n\nopinion.      Brown's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n              So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n(which Brown conceded below and on appeal), make it clear that the\noffenses were distinct criminal episodes. See generally De Jesus\nMateo, 373 F.3d at 74; Martinez-Medina, 279 F.3d at 123.\n       Brown also argues that Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n523 U.S. 224 (1998) should be overruled. However, he concedes that\nthis is beyond this court's power, and states that he merely\nintends to preserve the issue for possible review before the U.S.\nSupreme Court.\n\n                                      -23-\n\f",

The house had previously been the subject of extensive surveillance, and the Providence police had executed a number of controlled buys of cocaine base from the first floor apartment. As Partridge watched, Brown pulled his car into his house's yard, which was empty except for an old junk car. Brown exited the car carrying a cheese puff container and a brown paper bag. Partridge saw Brown remove a plastic bag containing a white substance from the paper bag and place it in the false bottom of the container. Brown then returned the container to his car and entered the first floor apartment with the bag and its remaining contents. No one else entered or left the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately half an hour later, Partridge and several other officers executed a search warrant for the apartment. Two of the officers covered the front door, and the rest entered through the back. All were clad in black windbreakers bearing the legend \"Providence Police\" in large, yellow letters. Partridge's team proceeded to the rear door of the first floor apartment, announced its presence, received no response, and then forcibly entered. The entry took considerable effort: the rear door was heavily fortified with steel bars, had no handle, and could be opened (from either side) only with a key for the heavy deadbolt lock. Also, a second interior door was wedged in tightly inside the fortified exterior door. Notably, the exterior door contained a four by six inch \"cut out\" and a large kitchen knife was hidden in the door's interior panel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown, Isler, and Rashid were standing near the kitchen table when the officers entered through the back entrance, and attempted to flee through the front door. But upon hearing the other officers outside, they reversed field and attempted to force their way past the original entry team. A violent struggle ensued, and the defendants were subdued. Brown had $65 upon his person, Rashid had $1078, and Isler had $515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The apartment was small and sparsely furnished, except for the kitchen. On the kitchen table, surrounded by three chairs, the officers found monitors for a sophisticated surveillance system comprised of several cameras, a motion sensor, an intercom, and a pair of exterior lights&#8212;one red and the other green. On the same table was the paper bag that Brown had carried into the apartment. Inside the paper bag were two plastic bags containing 142.45 grams of cocaine base. Also on the table were a digital scale, plastic bags, plastic bags with their corners snipped off, scissors, baking soda, a razor, a cooking plate with cocaine base residue, $250 in cash, two cell phones, a pager, and Isler's wallet and keys.

Detective Partridge saw Brown bring a substance that proved to be cocaine base into the house. When the officers burst through the heavily fortified back door, Isler, Rashid, and Brown were the only persons in the apartment and were standing near the kitchen table with three chairs. On the kitchen table were the monitors for an elaborate surveillance system, a quantity of cocaine base suggestive of narcotics distribution (and not personal use), cash, Isler's wallet and keys, and various drug packaging paraphernalia. In the bathroom, a few feet away, was evidence of a hasty and unsuccessful attempt to flush more cocaine base down the toilet. <i>Compare Soler,</i> 275 F.3d at 151; <i>Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678-79; <i>Batista-Polanco,</i> 927 F.2d at 17-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the house was a fortress, with heavily reinforced doors and an extensive surveillance system.

Before trial, the government filed a notice of intent to introduce the prior convictions for impeachment, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 609, and as admissible other bad act evidence, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), in anticipation of a mere presence defense. Brown never objected to the notice or filed a motion in limine to exclude the evidence. On direct examination, Brown testified about the basic facts of his prior convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> On cross-examination, the government re-elicited these basic facts and then inquired, under Rule 404(b), about the historical facts underlying his record. During the government's rebuttal argument, the prosecutor made reference to Brown's testimony about his prior convictions and Brown objected. After a bench conference, the court ruled that the 404(b) evidence of prior convictions was not allowed and instructed the prosecutor to refrain from making additional reference to it. The court did not, however, strike the prior testimony concerning the details of the prior convictions. Brown argues that he was prejudiced by the court's failure to exclude the 404(b) evidence. The government contends that there was no abuse of discretion and, in any event, the challenged testimony was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We choose to proceed directly to the harmless error inquiry. \"[T]he admission of improper testimony is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Garcia-Morales,</i> 382 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2004). A harmless error analysis is case specific, and requires consideration of such factors as the \"centrality of the tainted evidence, its uniqueness, its prejudicial impact, the use to which the evidence was put, and the relative strengths of the parties' cases.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown focuses on the admission of three facts: (1) that he did not remember the weight of the marijuana involved in one offense (but the prosecutor suggested ten pounds); (2) his exculpatory account of his involvement in one offense (essentially that Brown threw the marijuana in the trash at someone's behest); and (3) that he was arrested for one offense with $16,000 on his person. In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that these facts did not sway the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged facts added little to the basic facts of convictions, which had been recounted twice on direct and cross-examination. Moreover, they were not highlighted in the prosecution's argument, and were inconsequential when evaluated against the balance of the prosecution's considerable evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Any error in the admission of this evidence was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C. A'Vant's Testimony</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting certain testimony from Officer Angelo A'Vant, one of the government's expert witnesses, concerning the features of a drug house. Brown does not challenge A'Vant's qualifications as an expert. Rather, he challenges the relevance of his testimony to Brown's house. Specifically, Brown complains that A'Vant was permitted to testify that the security and surveillance set-up at Brown's house was something that he had never previously seen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> According to Brown, this testimony was irrelevant and highly prejudicial because it permitted the prosecutor to argue that the defendants were unusually \"sophisticated\" criminals. Brown concedes that our review is for plain error only. A plain error must be \"clear or obvious, affect substantial rights, and seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Garcia-Morales,</i> 382 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown's argument fails for many reasons, the most basic of which is that he misstates the essence of A'Vant's testimony. Prior to the challenged testimony, A'Vant had testified at length that the barricades and surveillance features on Brown's house were consistent with those at other drug houses that he had raided. The routine patrol questions were intended to show that \"normal\" houses in the area did not have such features. This testimony was responsive to Brown's defense that he was merely present at the crime scene, which Brown supported with his testimony that his house was just like any other house in that part of Providence. In short, A'Vant simply did not testify that he was unfamiliar with the equipment at Brown's house. There was no error in the admission of A'Vant's testimony, plain or otherwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>D.

Well, if he went to collect the rent, why didn't he take his rent receipt book with him? You know why, ladies and gentlemen. Because there is no rent receipt book, because he wasn't there to collect the rent, because there was no tenant, because again, ladies and gentlemen, other than Charles Brown's word, there is no proof of Anthony Wilson as a tenant.

The challenged comment came on the heels of suggestions by defense counsel that the officers' testimony (in particular Partridge's) contained gaping inconsistencies which were indicative of fabrication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor began by recounting that the officers all remembered the significant matters the same way, that the differences in recollection were trivial, and that the jury should be more concerned if there were not small variations in their testimony.

Brown begins with the fact that a certain quantity of \"cocaine base\" will trigger a far harsher sentence than the same quantity of \"cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers.\" <i>Compare</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) &amp; (B)(ii)(II) <i>with</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) &amp; (B)(iii). From there he reasons that because \"cocaine base\" and \"cocaine\" are chemically identical and the substance \"cocaine base\" falls within the extended definition of \"cocaine\" (\"cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers\"), the penalty provision in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 is fatally ambiguous because a conviction for possessing \"cocaine base\" would appear to be eligible for punishment under both the \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" penalty provisions. Therefore, Brown posits, because the jury found only that he possessed \"cocaine base,\" he is entitled to receive the statutory sentence provided for distributing more than 50 grams of \"cocaine,\" relying upon <i>United States v. Brisbane,</i> 367 F.3d 910 (D.C.Cir.2004).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Brown again concedes that our review is for plain error only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We readily conclude that there was no plain error.

Barnes,</i> 890 F.2d 545, 552 (1st Cir.1989)(\"the term `cocaine base' clearly defines a substance differing from other forms of cocaine\"). Second, this court has concluded that the term \"cocaine base\" in Section 841(b) includes all forms of cocaine base (not simply crack). <i>See United States v. Medina,</i> 427 F.3d 88, 92 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v.

In both their sentencing proceedings, the district judge made a host of comments about her lack of discretion under the guidelines and the \"waste\" brought about by the length and extreme harshness of the sentences. Moreover, the district judge stated that the sentence was \"tragic\" because she was \"not sure that a sentence of this length is absolutely necessary\" and that she was not sure that, in the absence of the guidelines, she \"would have imposed that harsh a penalty.\" In light of these remarks, which indicate a reasonable probability of lower sentences under advisory guidelines, Isler and Rashid are entitled to resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown is less fortunate for two reasons. First, Brown received a mandatory statutory (rather than guidelines) life sentence based upon the instant convictions and his two prior narcotics convictions (the existence of which he admitted). <i>Booker</i> does not apply in such circumstances. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75 (\"A mandatory minimum sentence imposed as required by statute based on facts found by a jury or admitted by a defendant is not a candidate for <i>Booker</i> error\"); <i>United States v. Bermudez,</i> 407 F.3d 536, 545 (1st Cir.2005)(same). Second, Brown's contention that his criminal history must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is foreclosed by our recent precedent. <i>See United States v. Work,</i> 409 F.3d 484, 491 n. 1 (1st Cir.2005)(\"In the roiled wake of <i>Booker,</i> it remains the law that previous criminal convictions are not `facts' that must be found by a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"); <i>United States v.

However, Brown later conceded that this is a statutory rather than a guidelines determination<i>See United States v. De Jesus Mateo,</i> 373 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir.2004). In his reply brief and at oral argument, Brown made a related argument that the district court erroneously applied the guidelines standard rather than the statutory standard in determining whether his prior convictions involved distinct criminal episodes for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). This claim is forfeited. <i>See United States v. Evans-Garcia,</i> 322 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir.2003) (arguments not raised until reply brief are waived); <i>Gosselin v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts,</i> 276 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir.2002) (arguments not raised until oral argument are waived). Moreover, the facts regarding the circumstances of the two prior offenses, notably the significant gap between the offenses and the intervening arrest (which Brown conceded below and on appeal), make it clear that the offenses were distinct criminal episodes. <i>See generally De Jesus Mateo,</i> 373 F.3d at 74; <i>Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 123.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Brown also argues that <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) should be overruled.

The house had previously been the subject of extensive surveillance, and the Providence police had executed a number of controlled buys of cocaine base from the first floor apartment. As Partridge watched, Brown pulled his car into his house's yard, which was empty except for an old junk car. Brown exited the car carrying a cheese puff container and a brown paper bag. Partridge saw Brown remove a plastic bag containing a white substance from the paper bag and place it in the false bottom of the container. Brown then returned the container to his car and entered the first floor apartment with the bag and its remaining contents. No one else entered or left the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately half an hour later, Partridge and several other officers executed a search warrant for the apartment. Two of the officers covered the front door, and the rest entered through the back. All were clad in black windbreakers bearing the legend \"Providence Police\" in large, yellow letters. Partridge's team proceeded to the rear door of the first floor apartment, announced its presence, received no response, and then forcibly entered. The entry took considerable effort: the rear door was heavily fortified with steel bars, had no handle, and could be opened (from either side) only with a key for the heavy deadbolt lock. Also, a second interior door was wedged in tightly inside the fortified exterior door. Notably, the exterior door contained a four by six inch \"cut out\" and a large kitchen knife was hidden in the door's interior panel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown, Isler, and Rashid were standing near the kitchen table when the officers entered through the back entrance, and attempted to flee through the front door. But upon hearing the other officers outside, they reversed field and attempted to force their way past the original entry team. A violent struggle ensued, and the defendants were subdued. Brown had $65 upon his person, Rashid had $1078, and Isler had $515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The apartment was small and sparsely furnished, except for the kitchen. On the kitchen table, surrounded by three chairs, the officers found monitors for a sophisticated surveillance system comprised of several cameras, a motion sensor, an intercom, and a pair of exterior lights&#8212;one red and the other green. On the same table was the paper bag that Brown had carried into the apartment. Inside the paper bag were two plastic bags containing 142.45 grams of cocaine base. Also on the table were a digital scale, plastic bags, plastic bags with their corners snipped off, scissors, baking soda, a razor, a cooking plate with cocaine base residue, $250 in cash, two cell phones, a pager, and Isler's wallet and keys. The only key for the deadbolt lock on the fortified rear door hung on a hook near the table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers also collected 26 small packages containing 6.328 grams of cocaine base from an overflowing toilet in a nearby bathroom. A search of Brown's car yielded the cheese puff container, which contained an additional 16.73 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three defendants were charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base (Count I), <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and possession with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base (Count II), <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(A). In addition, based on the narcotics found in his car, Brown was charged with possession with intent to distribute 5 or more grams of cocaine base (Count III), <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government called several officers and forensic specialists, and the government's case included expert testimony that the surveillance equipment, barricaded doors, and cut out<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> on the exterior door were indicative of a drug house. Only Brown testified for the defense. He testified that he had been let in by three unidentified men who left moments before the raid; that he was present only to collect rent from his tenant; that there were no drugs in the house or his car; that he had never seen Rashid or Isler before the raid; that Rashid was there to purchase his tenant's minivan; that Isler was sitting in a bedroom (possibly listening to music); that there were at least four cars in the yard at the time of the raid; that he tried to let the police in when they knocked but they ordered him away from the door; that the defendants did not try to flee or resist; and that the security and surveillance equipment had been installed by the previous owner and/or was typical for homes in the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Brown on all counts. The jury also convicted both Isler and Rashid, but held them responsible for less than 5 grams of cocaine base on both counts (and not for the 50 or more grams originally charged in the indictment). Isler and Rashid were sentenced to 262 and 210 months' imprisonment, respectively. Brown received a mandatory life sentence because he had two prior felony narcotics convictions. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants challenge their convictions and sentences on several grounds.

Detective Partridge saw Brown bring a substance that proved to be cocaine base into the house. When the officers burst through the heavily fortified back door, Isler, Rashid, and Brown were the only persons in the apartment and were standing near the kitchen table with three chairs. On the kitchen table were the monitors for an elaborate surveillance system, a quantity of cocaine base suggestive of narcotics distribution (and not personal use), cash, Isler's wallet and keys, and various drug packaging paraphernalia. In the bathroom, a few feet away, was evidence of a hasty and unsuccessful attempt to flush more cocaine base down the toilet. <i>Compare Soler,</i> 275 F.3d at 151; <i>Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678-79; <i>Batista-Polanco,</i> 927 F.2d at 17-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the house was a fortress, with heavily reinforced doors and an extensive surveillance system. From this evidence, the jury could have inferred that the dealers wished to conduct their business in absolute secrecy and security, and that only the conspiracy's participants would be permitted into the apartment. <i>See generally Llinas,</i> 373 F.3d at 32 (\"criminal conspirators do not involve innocent persons at critical stages of a drug deal\"); <i>United States v.

Before trial, the government filed a notice of intent to introduce the prior convictions for impeachment, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 609, and as admissible other bad act evidence, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), in anticipation of a mere presence defense. Brown never objected to the notice or filed a motion in limine to exclude the evidence. On direct examination, Brown testified about the basic facts of his prior convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> On cross-examination, the government re-elicited these basic facts and then inquired, under Rule 404(b), about the historical facts underlying his record. During the government's rebuttal argument, the prosecutor made reference to Brown's testimony about his prior convictions and Brown objected. After a bench conference, the court ruled that the 404(b) evidence of prior convictions was not allowed and instructed the prosecutor to refrain from making additional reference to it. The court did not, however, strike the prior testimony concerning the details of the prior convictions. Brown argues that he was prejudiced by the court's failure to exclude the 404(b) evidence. The government contends that there was no abuse of discretion and, in any event, the challenged testimony was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We choose to proceed directly to the harmless error inquiry. \"[T]he admission of improper testimony is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v.

Moreover, they were not highlighted in the prosecution's argument, and were inconsequential when evaluated against the balance of the prosecution's considerable evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Any error in the admission of this evidence was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C.

Brown does not challenge A'Vant's qualifications as an expert. Rather, he challenges the relevance of his testimony to Brown's house. Specifically, Brown complains that A'Vant was permitted to testify that the security and surveillance set-up at Brown's house was something that he had never previously seen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> According to Brown, this testimony was irrelevant and highly prejudicial because it permitted the prosecutor to argue that the defendants were unusually \"sophisticated\" criminals. Brown concedes that our review is for plain error only. A plain error must be \"clear or obvious, affect substantial rights, and seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Garcia-Morales,</i> 382 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown's argument fails for many reasons, the most basic of which is that he misstates the essence of A'Vant's testimony. Prior to the challenged testimony, A'Vant had testified at length that the barricades and surveillance features on Brown's house were consistent with those at other drug houses that he had raided. The routine patrol questions were intended to show that \"normal\" houses in the area did not have such features. This testimony was responsive to Brown's defense that he was merely present at the crime scene, which Brown supported with his testimony that his house was just like any other house in that part of Providence. In short, A'Vant simply did not testify that he was unfamiliar with the equipment at Brown's house. There was no error in the admission of A'Vant's testimony, plain or otherwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>D.

Well, if he went to collect the rent, why didn't he take his rent receipt book with him? You know why, ladies and gentlemen.

Isler's \"burden shifting\" claim disregards the fact that Brown testified at length and that all the defendants endorsed Brown's testimony in their closings. \"[W]hen a defendant puts [his] credibility at issue by testifying, the prosecution can comment on the implausibility of [his] testimony or its lack of evidentiary foundation.\" <i>Boulerice,</i> 325 F.3d at 86.

The challenged comment came on the heels of suggestions by defense counsel that the officers' testimony (in particular Partridge's) contained gaping inconsistencies which were indicative of fabrication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor began by recounting that the officers all remembered the significant matters the same way, that the differences in recollection were trivial, and that the jury should be more concerned if there were not small variations in their testimony.

Brown begins with the fact that a certain quantity of \"cocaine base\" will trigger a far harsher sentence than the same quantity of \"cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers.\" <i>Compare</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) &amp; (B)(ii)(II) <i>with</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) &amp; (B)(iii). From there he reasons that because \"cocaine base\" and \"cocaine\" are chemically identical and the substance \"cocaine base\" falls within the extended definition of \"cocaine\" (\"cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers\"), the penalty provision in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 is fatally ambiguous because a conviction for possessing \"cocaine base\" would appear to be eligible for punishment under both the \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" penalty provisions. Therefore, Brown posits, because the jury found only that he possessed \"cocaine base,\" he is entitled to receive the statutory sentence provided for distributing more than 50 grams of \"cocaine,\" relying upon <i>United States v. Brisbane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186206\"><a href=\"/opinion/186206/united-states-v-brisbane-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.2004).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Brown again concedes that our review is for plain error only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We readily conclude that there was no plain error.

Moreover, the district judge stated that the sentence was \"tragic\" because she was \"not sure that a sentence of this length is absolutely necessary\" and that she was not sure that, in the absence of the guidelines, she \"would have imposed that harsh a penalty.\" In light of these remarks, which indicate a reasonable probability of lower sentences under advisory guidelines, Isler and Rashid are entitled to resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown is less fortunate for two reasons.

In any event, there was no abuse of discretion, as the district court ultimately instructed the jury that Brown's prior convictions could only be considered in evaluating Brown's credibility.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For these same reasons, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny Isler and Rashid's motions for a new trial<i>See Montilla-Rivera,</i> 115 F.3d at 1064.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Brown admitted the following convictions and sentences: (1) a 1992 conviction for possession of marijuana for which he served six months of a four-year sentence; (2) a 1995 conviction for possession of 1-5 kilos of marijuana for which he served three years of a fifteen-year sentence; and (3) a 1995 conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and conspiracy to traffic in marijuana for which he served three years of a ten-year sentence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Brown also argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by referring to Brown's prior convictions during cross-examination and closing argument. But as we have explained, it was not apparent until the government's rebuttal argument that the prior conviction evidence was off-limits. After the district court's ruling, the prosecutor made no further mention of the convictions. There was no misconduct</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Brown complains only about two snippets in A'Vant's direct testimony. In the first, A'Vant responded to the question whether he had ever encountered barricaded doors on \"routine\" police calls (as distinguished from drug raids) as follows: \"On routine calls, I have never seen a similar set-up like this is my career.\" In the second, in response to the question how many times he had seen a green light bulb in the hallway of a residence during his years as a patrol officer, A'Vant stated: \"I don't ever recall seeing a green light bulb.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Having dispatched each of Brown's individual assignments of prejudicial error, we summarily reject his claim that the alleged errors combined to deprive him of a fair trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> These motions were later denied</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Holding that, in the absence of proof the \"cocaine base\" that defendant possessed was crack or another smokable form of cocaine base(which Congress intended to punish more severely than \"cocaine\"), defendant was entitled to be sentenced under \"cocaine\" penalty provision<i>See Brisbane,</i> 367 F.3d at 913-15.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> As to Brown's reliance on<i>Brisbane,</i> the clear or obvious error prong is not satisfied where the district court declined to follow a case from another circuit that concedes it is expressing a minority view and is explicitly at odds with this circuit's precedent. <i>Cf. United States v. D'Amario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201651\"><a href=\"/opinion/201651/united-states-v-damario/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 256-57 (1st Cir.2005)(no plain error if circuit courts are split on issue).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Brown also argued in his initial brief that the district court erred in determining that his prior convictions were unrelated under the guidelines. However, Brown later conceded that this is a statutory rather than a guidelines determination<i>See United States v. De Jesus Mateo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201077\"><a href=\"/opinion/201077/united-states-v-de-jesus-mateo/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2004). In his reply brief and at oral argument, Brown made a related argument that the district court erroneously applied the guidelines standard rather than the statutory standard in determining whether his prior convictions involved distinct criminal episodes for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). This claim is forfeited. <i>See United States v. Evans-Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200558\"><a href=\"/opinion/200558/united-states-v-evans-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 114 (1st Cir.2003) (arguments not raised until reply brief are waived); <i>Gosselin v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199766\"><a href=\"/opinion/199766/gosselin-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2002) (arguments not raised until oral argument are waived). Moreover, the facts regarding the circumstances of the two prior offenses, notably the significant gap between the offenses and the intervening arrest (which Brown conceded below and on appeal), make it clear that the offenses were distinct criminal episodes. <i>See generally De Jesus Mateo,</i> 373 F.3d at 74; <i>Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 123.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Brown also argues that <i>Almendarez-Torres v.
