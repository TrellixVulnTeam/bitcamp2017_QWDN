George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Nghia Nguyen on brief pro se.\n     Reneé M. Bunker, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          January 16, 2009\n\f              Per Curiam.     This is an appeal from the district court's\n\ndenial of a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)1 and\n\nthe   recently     amended     guidelines   for    cocaine   base       (\"crack\")\n\noffenses.2 In his pro se brief,3 defendant argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in, first, treating his request for appointment of\n\ncounsel as a request for a reduction of sentence under section\n\n3582(c)(2); second, denying the reduction before the effective date\n\nof the retroactive amendment to the crack guidelines; and, third,\n\ndenying the reduction on the ground that he is a career offender.\n\nIn the course of making those arguments, he also faults the\n\ndistrict court for treating the guidelines as mandatory and failing\n\nto apply the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).                   For the\n\nreasons discussed below, we find those arguments unpersuasive and\n\ntherefore      affirm   the   district   court's    denial   of     a    sentence\n\nreduction in this case.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      That provision creates an exception to the general rule that\na district court \"may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has\nbeen imposed.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). Under section 3582(c)(2), the\ndistrict court may reduce a term of imprisonment previously imposed\n\"in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been\nlowered by the Sentencing Commission.\"\n      2\n      Amendment 706, effective November 1, 2007, reduced the base\noffense levels for crack offenses by two levels. Amendment 713,\neffective March 3, 2008, made amendment 706 retroactive.\n      3\n          Defendant has not requested appointment of counsel on appeal.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          On the face of his request for appointment of counsel, it\n\nis clear that defendant was seeking appointment of counsel for the\n\nsole purpose of representing him in a proceeding for a reduced\n\nsentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and the recently promulgated,\n\nretroactive amendments to the crack guidelines. The district court\n\ntherefore reasonably construed defendant's submission as a request\n\nboth for appointment of counsel to represent him such a proceeding\n\nand to reduce his sentence under those provisions. Anyway, even in\n\nthe absence of a motion by the defendant, the district court had\n\nauthority to initiate proceedings for a reduced sentence \"on its\n\nown motion.\"    18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).   Therefore, any error in\n\nconstruing defendant's submission as such a motion was harmless.\n\nAny error in prematurely denying a reduction was also harmless,\n\nsince it is clear that the result would have been no different if\n\nthe court had waited thirteen additional days to act on defendant's\n\nmotion.   United States v. Ganun, 547 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(per curiam).\n\n          Defendant's argument that the district court erred in\n\nexcluding career offenders from receiving a reduction under the\n\namended guidelines is foreclosed by this court's recent decisions\n\nin United States v. Caraballo, 2008 WL 5274853 (1st Cir. Dec. 22,\n\n2008), and United States v. Ayala-Pizarro, 2008 WL 5338459 (1st\n\nCir. Dec. 23, 2008), both holding that, where, as here, a defendant\n\noriginally was sentenced as a career offender rather than as a\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fcrack cocaine offender, his original sentence was not \"based on a\n\nsentencing     range   that   has   subsequently    been   lowered\"       by   the\n\nretroactive crack cocaine amendment, and he is therefore ineligible\n\nfor a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).              Caraballo,\n\n2008 WL 5274853, at *5; Ayala-Pizarro, 2008 WL 5338459, at * 1.\n\nThis panel is not free to disregard those rulings, United States v.\n\nLewis, 517 F.3d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2008), nor do we see any reason\n\nto do so.\n\n              Defendant's further argument that the district court\n\nerred in treating the guidelines as mandatory and failing to\n\nconsider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) also falls\n\nshort.    Whatever role section 3553(a) and the advisory nature of\n\nthe guidelines may play in the district court's discretionary\n\ndetermination of whether and to what extent to reduce a defendant's\n\nsentence under section 3582(c)(2), where applicable--issues we need\n\nnot decide here--those considerations do not come into play where,\n\nas    here,   a   defendant   is    statutorily    ineligible      even   to    be\n\nconsidered for such a reduction. Caraballo, 2008 WL 5274853, at *5\n\nn.4\n\n              Accordingly,    the   district   court's     order    denying     a\n\nsentence reduction is affirmed.         1st Cir.
