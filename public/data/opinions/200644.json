Laufer, for appellants.\n     Melissa E. Darigan, Lisa M. Martinelli, and Partridge Snow &\nHahn LLP for appellees.\n\n\n\n                       September 12, 2003\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       This appeal presents a narrow\n\nprocedural question -- whether a case properly removed to federal\n\ncourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1446 can be dismissed with prejudice\n\nif the district court subsequently concludes that it lacks subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n           On January 9, 1987, appellants Deborah and Peter Mills\n\nrefinanced the mortgage on their home with defendant Salem Five\n\nCents Savings Bank (\"Salem Bank\"), which in turn assigned the\n\nmortgage to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie\n\nMac\").    The Mills were delinquent in their loan payments on\n\nnumerous occasions, prompting Salem Bank to initiate foreclosure\n\nproceedings in May 1987.    Appellants sought to enjoin foreclosure\n\nin   Rockingham   County   Superior    Court   in   New   Hampshire,   and\n\nthereafter filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in September\n\n1987.    On January 9, 1998, the bankruptcy court granted Salem\n\nBank's motion for relief from the automatic stay of foreclosure\n\nproceedings, and the bank foreclosed on August 12, 1998.          Freddie\n\nMac purchased the property at the foreclosure sale and commenced\n\neviction proceedings against appellants in Plaistow District Court\n\nin New Hampshire. After a year of litigation, Freddie Mac obtained\n\na writ of possession on August 10, 1999.       The Mills unsuccessfully\n\npetitioned the Supreme Court of New Hampshire to quash the writ,\n\nand subsequently returned to the bankruptcy court seeking to\n\ninvalidate the foreclosure by moving to vacate the bank's relief\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\ffrom the automatic stay.   The bankruptcy court denied the motion,\n\nand the Mills appealed the decision first to the United States\n\nDistrict Court in New Hampshire and then to this court, both times\n\nunsuccessfully.\n\n          In July 2001, as that appeal was pending, the Mills filed\n\nthe underlying complaint in this matter in the Middlesex County\n\nSuperior Court in Massachusetts. Appellants alleged that (1) Salem\n\nBank was not the true owner of their mortgage, (2) Salem Bank's\n\nattorneys fraudulently obscured the identity of the true mortgage\n\nowner from the New Hampshire state courts, and (3) consequently,\n\nthe 1998 foreclosure was null and void.    Because the plaintiffs\n\ninter alia sought relief under the federal civil RICO statute, the\n\ndefendants successfully petitioned to remove the case to the United\n\nStates District Court in Massachusetts, citing the court's federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction.\n\n          The district court assigned the case to a Magistrate\n\nJudge, who sua sponte recommended dismissal pursuant to the Rooker-\n\nFeldman doctrine.   The Rooker-Feldman doctrine precludes courts\n\nfrom exercising subject matter jurisdiction1 where the issues\n\npresented in the case are \"inextricably intertwined\" with questions\n\n\n     1\n      Our prior jurisprudence establishes that the Rooker-Feldman\ndoctrine implicates the court's subject matter jurisdiction. As we\nobserved in In re Middlesex Power Equip. & Marine, Inc., 292 F.3d\n61 (1st Cir. 2002): \"The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is jurisdictional\nin nature; if a case is dismissed because the Rooker-Feldman\ndoctrine applies, it means the court has no subject matter\njurisdiction to hear the case.\" Id. at 66 n.1.\n\n                                -3-\n\fpreviously adjudicated by a state court, such that the federal\n\ndistrict court would be in the unseemly position of reviewing a\n\nstate court decision for error.           See Hill v. Town of Conway, 193\n\nF.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that a federal claim is\n\n\"inextricably intertwined\" with a state-court claim \"if the federal\n\nclaim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly\n\ndecided the issues before it.\"); see generally D.C. Ct. App. v.\n\nFeldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., 263 U.S.\n\n413 (1923); Wilson v. Shumway, 264 F.3d 120 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Applying the Rooker-Feldman doctrine to the case at bar,\n\nthe Magistrate Judge concluded that\n\n            the substantive legal issues underlying the\n            plaintiffs' common law and state statutory\n            claims appear to derive from the same nuclei\n            of facts and legal issues presented to, and\n            decided by, the various New Hampshire state\n            courts . . . . In order to adjudicate the\n            allegations of the complaint en toto, the\n            district court would have to exhume the\n            averments presented to the New Hampshire\n            courts and dissect them again.\n\nAlternatively, the Magistrate Judge found in a footnote \"that the\n\nplaintiffs    have     not   properly    plead   the    RICO      count   in   their\n\ncomplaint . . . . Accordingly, in the event that the district court\n\nis   not   persuaded    of   the   applicability       of   the    Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine, the complaint should be dismissed due to its deficiencies\n\nin pleading the RICO claim.\"\n\n            The district court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report\n\nand Recommendation in its totality, agreeing that the Rooker-\n\n                                        -4-\n\fFeldman doctrine divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction,\n\nand further concluding \"that the report and recommendation was\n\ncorrect    in   its   ancillary   determination   that   no   pattern   of\n\nracketeering activity as defined in the RICO statute has been\n\npleaded and that plaintiffs have therefore not stated a claim on\n\nwhich relief may be granted pursuant to the statute.\" Accordingly,\n\nthe district court dismissed the Mills' complaint with prejudice on\n\nall counts.\n\n            On appeal, the Mills do not contest the district court's\n\napplication of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, but claim that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by dismissing the complaint\n\nwith prejudice after determining that it lacked subject matter\n\njurisdiction.     We agree.\n\n            Under the relevant provision of the federal removal\n\nstatute,\n\n            [a] motion to remand the case on the basis of\n            any defect other than lack of subject matter\n            jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after\n            the filing of the notice of removal under\n            section 1446(a). If at any time before final\n            judgment it appears that the district court\n            lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case\n            shall be remanded.    An order remanding the\n            case may require payment of just costs and any\n            actual expenses, including attorney fees,\n            incurred as a result of the removal.         A\n            certified copy of the order of remand shall be\n            mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the State\n            court. The State court may thereupon proceed\n            with such case.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f28 U.S.C. ยง 1447(c) (emphasis added).                   The language of this\n\nprovision unambiguously precludes federal courts from reaching the\n\nmerits of a removed case when it lacks subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover the dispute.         We have historically construed this passage\n\nstrictly:\n\n             We think . . . that the district court erred\n             in departing from the literal words of ยง\n             1447(c), which, on their face, give it no\n             discretion to dismiss rather than remand an\n             action.   And, we are unwilling to read such\n             discretion into the statute here, because we\n             cannot say with absolute certainty that remand\n             would prove futile.\n\nMe. Ass'n of Interdependent Neighborhoods v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of\n\nHuman Serv., 876 F.2d 1051, 1054 (1st Cir. 1989); see Smith v. Wis.\n\nDep't of Agric., Trade, and Consumer Prot., 23 F.3d 1134, 1139 n.\n\n10 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"[T]he point of section 1447(c) is that a\n\nfederal court does not have the authority to dismiss a claim over\n\nwhich it never had jurisdiction in the first instance.                 The merits\n\nof     the   .   .   .    claim    are    therefore      irrelevant     to       this\n\ndetermination.\"); see also Christopher v. Stanley Bostitch, Inc.,\n\n240 F.3d 95, 100 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"When a federal court concludes\n\nthat it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case, it is\n\nprecluded    from    rendering    any    judgments      on   the   merits   of   the\n\ncase.\").\n\n             Appellees gamely attempt to evade this inevitable result,\n\narguing that a district court is entitled to dismiss a removed case\n\nwith    prejudice    if   the     removal      itself   \"is    procedurally      and\n\n                                         -6-\n\fsubstantively proper,\" and the jurisdictional defect is revealed\n\nonly after the removal is perfected. This novel theory contradicts\n\nthe plain directive in 1447(c) that \"[i]f at any time before final\n\njudgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter\n\njurisdiction,   the   case   shall    be   remanded\"   (emphasis   added).\n\nNothing in the language of this provision or the cases construing\n\nit predicates the remand requirement on the nature of the defect in\n\nthe court's subject matter jurisdiction, or the timing of its\n\ndiscovery. The existence of any subject matter jurisdiction defect\n\ndivests the court of authority to dismiss a removed case on its\n\nmerits,2 regardless of whether the jurisdictional flaw results from\n\nan improper removal or arises from some other source, such as the\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine.3      And whether or not section 1447(c)\n\n\n     2\n      While this rule precludes federal courts from considering the\nmerits of a case after identifying a defect in subject matter\njurisdiction, it in no way implies a \"sequencing of jurisdictional\nissues,\" see Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 584-85\n(1999), that obliges courts to resolve subject matter jurisdiction\nbefore investigating other possible bases for disclaiming\njurisdiction (e.g., personal jurisdiction, discretionary abstention\ngrounds). The Supreme Court has expressly declined to adopt any\nwooden rule to the contrary.     See id., cited with approval in\nMiddlesex Power Equip., 292 F.3d at 66 n.1.\n     3\n      Appellees supplement their argument with a lengthy string\ncitation of cases in which the district court dismissed cases \"with\nprejudice\" pursuant to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Our review of\nthose cases indicates that, without exception, they originated in\nfederal court and hence were not subject to the provisions of the\nfederal removal statute. Accordingly, those cases do not counsel\nagainst the outcome we reach here.     Of course, lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction precludes a disposition on the merits even in\na non-removed action.     However, a dismissal on Rooker-Feldman\ngrounds, although \"with prejudice,\" is not intrinsically a\n\n                                     -7-\n\fcontains an implicit exception for a case where a remand could be\n\nsaid \"with absolute certainty\" to be futile, see Interdependent\n\nNeighborhoods, 876 F.2d at 1054, we are unwilling to make such a\n\nfinding here, though we suspect that this case has little future.\n\n           The appellees are understandably frustrated with the\n\nMills' litigiousness:\n\n           The Mills have trampled through no less than\n           six Courts in pursuit of relief as a result of\n           a foreclosure that legally occurred due to\n           their indisputable Mortgage default and have\n           wasted   endless    judicial   resources    by\n           continuing to pursue this frivolous and\n           baseless claim.   Clearly, this is a case of\n           litigants who have a demonstrated history of\n           vexatious litigation that if left unchecked,\n           will continue to spread across a new forum and\n           state.\n\nWhile we are obliged to order the district court to remand this\n\ncase back to the Massachusetts Superior Court, we note that the\n\nMills' foray through the courts may be approaching its terminus.\n\nThe same bedrock principles codified in the Rooker-Feldman doctrine\n\nthat preclude federal district courts from revisiting questions\n\npreviously adjudicated by state courts, see Hill, 193 F.3d at 39,\n\ncompel   state    courts    to    give   \"full   faith   and   credit\"   to   the\n\njudgments issued by other state courts.              \"In a practical sense,\n\nfull faith and credit establishes a rule of evidence requiring\n\nrecognition      of   a   prior   out-of-State    judgment,    giving    it   res\n\njudicata effect and thus avoiding relitigation of issues in one\n\n\ndisposition on the merits.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fState which have already been decided in another.\" Luna v. Dobson,\n\n763   N.E.2d   1146,   1150   (N.Y.   2001)   (internal   quotation   marks\n\nomitted); see U.S. Const. art. IV, ยง 1; Bassett v.

Accordingly, without\n\nin any way presuming to direct the outcome in state court, we\n\nanticipate that application of these principles is very likely to\n\nlead the Massachusetts Superior Court to grant the dismissal with\n\nprejudice that was unavailable to appellees in the federal forum.\n\n           The judgment of the district court is vacated, and this\n\ncase is remanded to the district court with instructions to remand\n\nthe case to the Middlesex County Superior Court.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

The Mills were delinquent in their loan payments on numerous occasions, prompting Salem Bank to initiate foreclosure proceedings in May 1987. Appellants sought to enjoin foreclosure in Rockingham County Superior Court in New Hampshire, and thereafter filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in September 1987. On January 9, 1998, the bankruptcy court granted Salem Bank's motion for relief from the automatic stay of foreclosure proceedings, and the bank foreclosed on August 12, 1998. Freddie Mac purchased the property at the foreclosure sale and commenced eviction proceedings against appellants in Plaistow District Court in New Hampshire. After a year of litigation, Freddie Mac obtained a writ of possession on August 10, 1999. The Mills unsuccessfully petitioned the Supreme Court of New Hampshire to quash the writ, and subsequently returned to the bankruptcy court seeking to invalidate the foreclosure by moving to vacate the bank's relief from the automatic stay. The bankruptcy court denied the motion, and the Mills appealed the decision first to the United States District Court in New Hampshire and then to this court, both times unsuccessfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2001, as that appeal was pending, the Mills filed the underlying complaint in this matter in the Middlesex County Superior Court in Massachusetts. Appellants alleged that (1) Salem Bank was not the true owner of their mortgage, (2) Salem Bank's attorneys fraudulently obscured the identity of the true mortgage owner from the New Hampshire state courts, and (3) consequently, the 1998 foreclosure was null and void. Because the plaintiffs <i>inter alia</i> sought relief under the federal civil RICO statute, the defendants successfully petitioned to remove the case to the United States District Court in Massachusetts, citing the court's federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court assigned the case to a Magistrate Judge, who <i>sua sponte</i> recommended dismissal pursuant to the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine.

Our review of those cases indicates that, without exception, they originated in federal court and hence were not subject to the provisions of the federal removal statute. Accordingly, those cases do not counsel against the outcome we reach here. Of course, lack of subject matter jurisdiction precludes a disposition on the merits even in a non-removed action. However, a dismissal on <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> grounds, although \"with prejudice,\" is not intrinsically a disposition on the merits.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
