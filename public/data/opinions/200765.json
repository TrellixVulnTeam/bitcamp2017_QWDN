Plaintiff-Appellant Templeton\n\nBoard of Sewer Commissioners (\"Templeton\") appeals the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of its third amended complaint (\"complaint\")\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(c) and 12(h)(3).                          The\n\ndistrict     court   concluded        it    did     not     have   subject      matter\n\njurisdiction over Count I of the complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1331,1\n\nand therefore lacked supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining\n\nstate law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.                       After careful\n\nreview, we affirm.\n\n                                 I.   BACKGROUND\n\n            A.   Facts\n\n            The facts related to this appeal are largely undisputed\n\nand are taken from the district court's memorandum and order.\n\nTempleton Bd. of Sewer Comm'rs v. Am. Tissue Mills, No. 96-40140\n\n(NMG) (D. Mass. Dec. 19, 2002).                   In March 1974, the town of\n\nTempleton     entered     into    a    Waste        Management      Contract      with\n\nBaldwinville Products, Inc. (\"Baldwinville\") and its owner, Erving\n\nIndustries, Inc. (\"Erving\"),2 by which Templeton agreed to build a\n\nwastewater    treatment    plant      (\"the       plant\")    and   make   the    plant\n\n\n1\n   \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all\ncivil actions arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of\nthe United States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2000).\n2\n  The Motion to Dismiss was filed by defendant-appellee Nourollah\nElghanayan. Other defendants contested whether they were parties\nto the agreement that gives rise to the dispute, but for the\npurpose of clarity, we do not differentiate between defendants and\naddress only the jurisdictional claim.\n\n                                           -2-\n\favailable   to   Erving     and   Baldwinville   for   treatment    of   their\n\nwastewater. The contract provided, inter alia, that: (1) Templeton\n\n\"shall retain legal title to all wastewater facilities,\" (Waste\n\nManagement Contract, Section XV); (2) Templeton shall pay . . . One\n\nDollar ($1.00) per year consideration for [defendants] to operate\n\nthe [plant]\" (id., Section XVI B.2); (3) Templeton would \"apply for\n\nFederal   and/or    State    construction     grants   for   its   wastewater\n\ntreatment facility.\" (Id., Section VI).          Finally, it provided that\n\n(4) Erving and Baldwinville would pay the net operating costs of\n\nthe plant as well as 95.5% of the net capital costs of the plant.\n\n(Id., Section XVI B.1(a) and (c)).\n\n            Templeton applied to the Environmental Protection Agency\n\n(\"EPA\") for a construction grant.           The agency approved the grant,\n\nand the plant was built and became operational.\n\n            In     1991,    defendant       American   Tissue      Mills   of\n\nMassachusetts, Inc. (\"ATM\"), purchased Baldwinville's operating\n\nassets.     An Assignment and Assumption Agreement was executed,\n\nassigning Baldwinville's rights and liabilities under the Waste\n\nManagement Contract to Northeast Waste Treatment Services, Inc.\n\n(\"Northeast\"), an ATM subsidiary.           From 1991 until April 3, 2002,\n\nATM and Northeast operated the plant.\n\n            In March 1995, the EPA informed Templeton that the Clean\n\nWater Act (\"CWA\"), 33 U.S.C. § 1284(b)(1), required Templeton to\n\nimplement a user charge system whereby each user of the plant must\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fpay a proportionate share of the cost of operating and maintaining\n\nthe entire wastewater treatment system based upon that user's\n\ncontribution to the total waste flow.        The EPA also advised\n\nTempleton that the user charge system specified by the Waste\n\nManagement Contract was inconsistent with the user charge system\n\nrequired by the CWA.     A subsequent EPA memorandum received by\n\nTempleton in September 1995 concluded that the contract user charge\n\nsystem must be revised in order to comply with the EPA's regulatory\n\nscheme.\n\n          B.    Procedural History\n\n          Templeton filed its initial complaint in the district\n\ncourt in June 1996.    Count I sought a declaration of the parties'\n\nrights, specifically whether ATM was required to pay a user charge\n\nwhich included payment for other treatment works pursuant to § 204\n\nof the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1284, and the EPA regulations thereunder.\n\nJurisdiction was premised upon 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as the plaintiff\n\nwas allegedly seeking relief under the CWA, and the remaining state\n\nlaw claims were entertained pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Although\n\nthe complaint was amended three times, Count I did not materially\n\nchange. It stated, in relevant part:\n\n          12.      Under the Agreement, the Town is obligated,\n                   among other things, to:\n                   a.   construct a wastewater treatment plant\n                        (the \"Plant\") with an average daily\n                        flow capacity of approximately three\n                        million gallons and agree to make the\n                        Plant available to The Company for\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f                      treatment of its wastewater. (Sections\n                      II and III);\n                 b.   maintain and operate the Plant and\n                      retain a third party to operate the\n                      Plant with prior approval of The\n                      Company. (Section IV); and\n                 c.   apply   for   federal   and/or   state\n                      construction grants for the Plant.\n                      (Section V).\n          . . . .\n          18.     33 U.S.C. § 1284 states as a condition of\n                  any grant for any project for any treatment\n                  works that the applicant for the grant must\n                  adopt a system of charges such that each\n                  recipient of waste treatment services within\n                  the   applicant's   jurisdiction  pays   its\n                  proportionate share of the cost of operation\n                  and maintenance (including replacement) of\n                  any waste treatment services provided by the\n                  applicant.\n          . . . .\n          23.     The EPA has informed the Commissioners, and\n                  the Commissioners agree, that the Town is\n                  required under the Clean Water Act and the\n                  regulations    promulgated   thereunder   to\n                  implement a user charge system based on\n                  actual use of wastewater treatment services\n                  such that each user, including America [sic]\n                  Tissue, pays its     proportionate share of\n                  operation and maintenance . . . based on\n                  each user's proportionate contribution to\n                  the total waste contributed by all users.\n                  See 40 CFR 35.929-1. . . .\n          24.     . . . It is the Commissioners' and the EPA's\n                  position that the requirements of the Clean\n                  Water   Act   and   regulation   promulgated\n                  thereunder    supersede    the    Agreement.\n                  [Relying on 40 CFR 35.929-2(g)].\n\nThird Amended Compl. at 3-6.\n\n          In 1997, Templeton moved for partial summary judgment on\n\nCount I seeking, inter alia, a declaration that ATM was subject,\n\nunder the contract and federal law, to a user charge system for the\n\nuse of the treatment works in compliance with the CWA and EPA\n\n                               -5-\n\fregulations.     The   district    court   concluded      that    Templeton's\n\ninterpretation of the federal requirements was correct, but denied\n\nthe summary judgment motion because material facts were still in\n\ndispute.   Templeton Bd. of Sewer Comm'rs v. American Tissue Mills,\n\nNo. 96-40140 (NMG) (D. Mass. Dec. 9, 1997).            The district court\n\ndenied the motion for summary judgment because the record failed to\n\nestablish a conflict between the contract and the EPA regulations.3\n\n           On October 17, 2002, defendant-appellee Elghanayan, an\n\nalleged officer, director and shareholder of ATM and Northeast,\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(c) and 12(h)(3),\n\narguing primarily that the district court did not have subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction over Count I because it did not arise under\n\nfederal law.   The district court granted the motion.\n\n                             II.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Appellee Elghanayan argues that the district court had no\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction under § 1331 because the CWA, the\n\nstatute upon which appellant purported to base jurisdiction, does\n\nnot provide a private right of action.           Appellant argues that,\n\nnotwithstanding this lack of a private right of action, Count I\n\ninvolves   a   substantial   question      of   federal    law,    and   thus\n\njurisdiction under § 1331 is proper.\n\n\n3\n  The district court also denied the defendants' cross-motions for\nsummary judgment on other grounds in the December 1997 Memorandum\nand Order.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           We review the district court's dismissal of the complaint\n\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.            Sallen v.\n\nCorinthians Licenciamentos LTDA, 273 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nWe draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Templeton. Aversa v.\n\nUnited States, 99 F.3d 1200, 1210 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           Determining whether \"arising under\" jurisdiction exists\n\nis a particularly difficult task.      We must first determine whether\n\nCount I of the Third Amended Complaint alleges a federal cause of\n\naction.   If not, then we must inquire into whether some element of\n\nthe claim depends on the resolution of a substantial, disputed\n\nquestion of federal law.      If a question of this nature exists,\n\nfederal jurisdiction will lie.      See West 14th Street Commercial\n\nCorp. v. 5 West 14th Owners Corp., 815 F.2d 188, 193 (2d Cir. 1987)\n\n(\"To determine whether the court has federal question jurisdiction\n\nto decide the case, the complaint must contain either a federal\n\ncause of action or a state cause of action embodying a substantial\n\nfederal question.\").\n\n           A.   Private Rights of Action\n\n           The Supreme Court of the United States has established\n\nthat a district court properly exercises jurisdiction under Section\n\n1331 when a plaintiff's complaint is based on a right conferred\n\nunder federal law.     Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414\n\nU.S. 661, 666 (1974).    Whether a claim arises under federal law is\n\ndetermined under the well-pleaded complaint rule.       Franchise Tax\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fBd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 10 (1983); see\n\nalso Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149\n\n(1908).   Under that rule, \"[the jurisdictional question] must be\n\ndetermined    from   what   necessarily    appears   in   the   plaintiff's\n\nstatement of his own claim in the bill or declaration,\" without\n\nreference to any other pleadings.         Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at\n\n10 (internal quotations omitted).          In other words, \"a right or\n\nimmunity created by the Constitution or laws of the United States\n\nmust be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff's cause\n\nof action.\"    Id. at 10-11 (quoting Gully v. First Nat'l Bank, 299\n\nU.S. 109, 112 (1936)).4\n\n          There is no private right of action under the CWA.\n\nMiddlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. Nat'l Sea Clammers Assoc., 453\n\nU.S. 1 (1981).   In National Sea Clammers, the Supreme Court stated\n\nthat \"[i]n view of the[] elaborate enforcement provisions [of the\n\nCWA] it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to authorize by\n\nimplication additional judicial remedies for private citizens suing\n\n\n\n4\n    The present action is a declaratory judgment action.       The\nSupreme Court has stated that a litigant may not defeat the well-\npleaded complaint rule by bringing a declaratory judgment action.\nSee Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 673-74\n(1950).   The underlying coercive action in this complaint is a\nstate breach of contract claim.      Neither party disputes this\nconclusion. Templeton states that this case involves a substantial\ninterpretation of federal law. Therefore, notwithstanding the form\nof the complaint, this court is under an obligation to determine\nwhether the resolution of the breach of contract action involves a\nsubstantial question of federal law which gives rise to subject\nmatter jurisdiction.\n\n                                   -8-\n\funder [the CWA].\"      Id. at 14.     Templeton does not dispute this\n\nconclusion.\n\n            B.   Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals\n\n            If a cause of action is not created under a federal law,\n\n§ 1331 jurisdiction may lie \"'where the vindication of a right\n\nunder state law necessarily turn[s] on some construction of federal\n\nlaw.'\"     Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S.\n\n804, 808-09 (1986) (quoting Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 9).\n\nThis legal quandary is generally referred to as the litigation-\n\nprovoking problem, or the presence of a federal issue in a state-\n\ncreated cause of action.      Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. at 809-10.     In\n\nMerrell Dow, the Supreme Court held that the district court did not\n\nhave jurisdiction under § 1331, where the plaintiff alleged a state\n\ntort claim but pointed to federal law as evidence of the standard\n\nof care.    Given that there was no private right of action under the\n\nfederal law in question, the Court proceeded to examine whether a\n\nsubstantial question of law was implicated.        It held that \"the\n\npresence of the federal issue as an element of the state tort is\n\nnot the kind of adjudication for which jurisdiction would serve\n\ncongressional purposes and the federal system.\"      Id. at 814.   The\n\nCourt then analyzed the plaintiff's arguments regarding the federal\n\ninterest in uniformity and the special circumstances implicated in\n\nthe case.    The Court found both arguments unavailing, and found no\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f             C.    Substantial Question of Federal Law\n\n             The Courts of Appeals, including this Circuit, have\n\nelaborated on the holding announced in Merrell Dow.                  We begin with\n\na review of our post-Merrell Dow cases.5                  Three of our recent\n\ndecisions are relevant to the present controversy.                   PCS 2000 LP v.\n\nRomulus Telecommunications, Inc., 148 F.3d 32 (1st Cir. 1998) dealt\n\nwith the issue of whether the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") alone\n\ncould be a source of subject matter jurisdiction.                      The Supreme\n\nCourt     held    in   Moses    H.   Cone    Memorial    Hospital      v.    Mercury\n\nConstruction Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 25 n.32 (1983), that the FAA\n\ncreated a federal body of law, but not an independent source of\n\nfederal jurisdiction.          Elaborating on that point, we held that the\n\ncomplaint at issue in PCS 2000 LP must be dismissed for lack of\n\nsubject    matter      jurisdiction.        PCS   2000   LP,   148    F.3d   at   34.\n\nSpecifically, we noted the fact that \"th[e] case peripherally\n\n\n5\n   Two cases cited by appellant as relevant to the issue are\nclearly distinguishable. In Arroyo-Torres v. Ponce Federal Bank,\nF.B.S., 918 F.2d 276, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1990), we held that the\nplaintiff had no private right of action under the Currency and\nForeign Transaction Reporting Act. Arroyo-Torres did not analyze\nwhether there was a substantial federal question and affirmed the\ndistrict court's dismissal without reference to Merrell Dow. We\nconcluded that the district court should have dismissed the\ncomplaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted. Arroyo-Torres, 918 F.2d at\n280. The case is therefore not relevant to the question at hand.\nIn Nashoba Communications Ltd. Partnership No. 7 v. Danvers, 893\nF.2d 435 (1st Cir. 1990), we engaged in the § 1331 analysis.\nHowever, that case turned on the issue of whether federal\njurisdiction was based on an anticipatory federal defense. Our\nanalysis centered on that issue, and we held that the plaintiff ran\nafoul of the well-pleaded complaint rule.\n\n                                       -10-\n\finvolve[d] [federal] bidding practices, and that cases sometimes\n\narise under federal law when an interpretation of federal law is\n\noutcome-determinative.\"         Id. at 35 (citing Smith v. Kansas City\n\nTitle & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180, 199 (1921)).                  However, we further\n\nstated that \"section 503(b) of the Communications Act confers no\n\nprivate   right    of    action,     and    the    plaintiffs'     complaint      only\n\nadvances non-federal claims.\"              Id.    We deemed the connection too\n\ntenuous to confer federal jurisdiction. Finally, we observed that,\n\n\"[n]o less an authority than the Supreme Court has made this clear.\n\nUnless a federal statute bestows a private right of action, courts\n\nought to presume that Congress did not intend the statute to confer\n\nfederal jurisdiction.\"         Id.    Therefore, PCS 2000 LP endorses the\n\nview   espoused     by    appellee,        but     recognizes     that     when     the\n\ninterpretation of federal law is outcome-determinative, subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction may be properly exercised.\n\n           We     explored     the    same       issue   in    Almond    v.   Capital\n\nProperties,     Inc.,    212   F.3d   20     (1st    Cir.     2000).     There,     the\n\nplaintiff's action was removed from state court on the ground that\n\nit came within the federal court's subject matter jurisdiction. We\n\nassumed for the purposes of the holding that the cause of action\n\nwas not created under federal law.                  Id. at 23.         We went on to\n\nexplore an alternative basis for obtaining federal jurisdiction --\n\nthat a substantial question of federal law was involved.                      Id.    We\n\ncharacterized the claim as follows: \"[t]he central issue properly\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fpresented . . . is whether [defendant's] promise to the [Federal\n\nRailroad Administration] includes an obligation to obtain the FRA's\n\napproval before implementing the increase in parking charges at\n\nissue    in   this   case.\"        Id.     Because   the   Supreme    Court   has\n\nconsistently held that the rights and obligations of the United\n\nStates and its agencies are governed exclusively by federal law, we\n\nheld subject matter jurisdiction existed.               Id. at 24.       Appellee\n\nargues that this case is inapposite.            To the extent that the rights\n\nand obligations of the United States and its agencies will always\n\nbe a matter of federal law, appellee is correct.                     However, we\n\nbelieve that this case also stands for the proposition that there\n\nis   a   discrete    type     of    case    where    federal   subject     matter\n\njurisdiction will lie notwithstanding the absence of a federal\n\ncause of action.\n\n              The reasoning in Almond relied on Judge Posner's opinion\n\nin Price v. Pierce, 823 F.2d 1114 (7th Cir. 1987).6             Price involved\n\na contract dispute filed by prospective tenants (designated by the\n\ncourt as third-party beneficiaries) against multiple defendants,\n\n\n\n6\n   The parties cite the First Circuit case of Penobscot Nation v.\nGeorgia-Pacific Corp., 254 F.3d 317 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied,\n534 U.S. 1127 (2002). While that case engaged in some analysis of\nthe issue of federal jurisdiction, we held that regardless of the\njurisdictional issue, the district court was bound by the ruling of\nthe Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.      Therefore, the case was\ndecided on issue preclusion grounds, not under § 1331, and is\nirrelevant to the present issue.     In any event, the opinion's\ndiscussion of § 1331 merely reiterates the points made in Almond\nand Price and does not rely on Smith.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fincluding the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"),\n\nchallenging the allocation of lower-income family housing.       The\n\ncontract in question was between private parties.       However, in\n\norder to resolve the dispute the court would have to interpret a\n\ncontract provision approved by a federal agency pursuant to a\n\nfederal statutory scheme.     The Seventh Circuit held that\n\n          [t]he issue is potentially so important to the\n          success   of   the   program--since   on   its\n          resolution may turn the amount of lower-income\n          housing actually provided--that we believe\n          that Congress, had it thought about the\n          matter, would have wanted the question to be\n          decided by federal courts applying a uniform\n          principle.\n\nPrice, 823 F.2d at 1119-20.\n\n          The Seventh Circuit's observation is especially relevant:\n\n\"Section 1437f(b)(2) contemplates that HUD will enter directly or\n\n(as here) indirectly. . .into contractual relations with developers\n\nall over the country. . . .\"     Id. at 1119.   In Templeton's case,\n\nthe EPA has not contracted on its behalf, and therefore Templeton\n\n(or anyone else for that matter), would not have standing to sue\n\nthe agency or its contractors.    However, the contract entered into\n\nin the instant appeal explicitly contemplated the application of\n\nfederal grants, which in turn obligated the parties to abide by the\n\nEPA regulations.   Our opinion in Almond embraces Price \"pending\n\nfurther enlightenment from the Supreme Court.\" Almond, 212 F.3d at\n\n24. A subsequent Seventh Circuit case held that \"a federal rule of\n\ndecision is necessary but not sufficient for federal jurisdiction.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fThere must also be a right of action to enforce that rule.\"\n\nSeinfeld v. Austen, 39 F.3d 761, 764 (7th Cir. 1994) (quoting\n\nDillon v. Combs, 895 F.2d 1175, 1177 (7th Cir. 1990)).                    Seinfeld\n\nfailed to address the discrete class of cases where a substantial\n\nfederal question may confer jurisdiction under § 1331.7\n\n            Other Circuits reviewing the discrete issue of whether\n\nthere is a substantial question of federal law have produced\n\nconfusing (if not conflicting) opinions on the matter.                    In a case\n\nwith facts similar to the instant appeal, the Fourth Circuit found\n\nthat the    Clean   Air   Act    conferred     jurisdiction       under    §   1331,\n\nnotwithstanding the absence of a private right of action under the\n\nfederal act.    Ormet Corp. v. Ohio Power Co., 98 F.3d 799, 807 (4th\n\nCir. 1996). Plaintiff sued several defendants claiming that it was\n\nentitled to emission allowances issued to Ohio Power by the EPA,\n\nand seeking money damages.            The court determined that Section\n\n408(i) of the Clean Air Act did not create a private remedy.\n\nHowever, that did \"not fully resolve the question of whether\n\nOrmet's claim, alleging ownership of emission allowances . . .\n\narises under federal law . . . .\"            Id. at 806.    Whether there was\n\na \"question sufficiently substantial to arise under federal law,\"\n\nwas   another   avenue    for   obtaining      jurisdiction.        Id.        After\n\nreviewing   Merrell   Dow,      the   Fourth   Circuit     held    that    federal\n\n\n7\n   In addition, it is pertinent that Seinfeld relies entirely on\nMerrell Dow, whereas Price engages in the jurisdictional analysis\nwithout mentioning Merrell Dow.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fjurisdiction did exist, because, \"to resolve that dispute, a court\n\nmust interpret both the Act and the contract to decide whether\n\nOrmet is party to a 'life-of-the-unit, firm power contractual\n\narrangement,' as that phrase is defined in the Act.\"                            Id. at 807.\n\nIn addition, the Fourth Circuit considered Congress's explicit\n\nintent that      the    EPA     not     be       burdened   with    \"resolving         private\n\ndisputes over a unit's allowances,\"                   Ormet, 98 F.3d at 805, and the\n\nfact   that    the     system      of      freely     transferable     allowances            was\n\n\"critical to the Acid Rain Program.\"                        Id. at 807 (citing the\n\nlegislative      history      of      the     particular     section       of    the     Act).\n\nFinally, uniformity was considered imperative to the program's\n\nsuccess.   Id.    Therefore, the Fourth Circuit held that there was a\n\nsubstantial federal interest and subject matter jurisdiction was\n\nproper   under    §    1331.          In     doing    so,   the    court    endorsed         the\n\ncontinuing validity of Smith and Franchise Tax Board. Cf. Mulcahey\n\nv. Columbia Organic Chem. Co., 29 F.3d 148 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\n              The district court in this case relied on the Sixth\n\nCircuit case of Board of Trustees of Painesville Township v. City\n\nof   Painesville,      200     F.3d        396    (6th   Cir.     1999).        In    City    of\n\nPainesville, the City, in an effort to expand its wastewater\n\ntreatment facilities, applied to the EPA for a grant. Although the\n\ngrant suggested that the plaintiffs would have access to the new\n\nfacilities, the City refused to provide it.                         Plaintiffs brought\n\nsuit alleging violations of Section 204 of the CWA.                                  The Sixth\n\n\n                                              -15-\n\fCircuit held that because the CWA provided no private right of\n\naction, the district court could not exercise jurisdiction over the\n\nclaims.      Id. at 400.     The court made no mention of Smith or\n\nFranchise Tax Board in its opinion.        The district court reasoned,\n\non the basis of Painesville, that \"Templeton's claim under the CWA\n\nis, therefore, frivolous and insufficiently substantial to warrant\n\nthe exercise of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.\"            The opinion\n\ngoes further still, assuming arguendo that even if Templeton's\n\nclaim required the interpretation of the CWA, it\n\n             would still lack subject-matter jurisdiction\n             over the claim because the congressional\n             determination that there should be no federal\n             remedy for violation of this federal statute\n             [i.e. that there is no private right of\n             action] is tantamount to a congressional\n             conclusion that the presence of a claimed\n             violation of the statute as an element of a\n             state cause of action is insufficiently\n             substantial   to    confer   federal-question\n             jurisdiction.\n\n(quoting    Merrell   Dow,   478   U.S.   at   814   (internal   quotations\n\nomitted)).\n\n            We arrive at the crux of our decision.       We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that under Merrell Dow, the plaintiff's cause of\n\naction cannot give rise to a federal cause of action as this is\n\nclearly foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in National Sea\n\nClammers.     Nor do we think that plaintiff's argument can succeed\n\nunder the Smith/Franchise Tax Board rationale.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f             We do not believe that merely because a court will have\n\nto interpret the federal regulations, it necessarily follows that\n\nfederal jurisdiction exists. We agree with the Fourth Circuit that\n\n\"the determination of whether a federal issue is sufficiently\n\nsubstantial should be informed by a sensitive judgment about\n\nwhether the existence of federal judicial power is both appropriate\n\nand pragmatic\" and that \"at bottom, we must determine whether the\n\ndispute is one that Congress intended federal courts to resolve.\"\n\nOrmet, 98 F.3d at 807.          We see no indication, and appellant has\n\npointed to none, that Congress intended the CWA and its regulations\n\nto confer federal question jurisdiction.          See J.A. Jones Constr.\n\nComp. v. City of New York, 753 F. Supp. 497 (S.D.N.Y. 1990)(holding\n\nthat the incorporation of EPA regulations under the CWA into a\n\ncontract did not give rise to federal question jurisdiction when\n\nsuing for breach of contract).        The complaint before the district\n\ncourt did not present a substantial question of federal law.              We\n\nagree with the district court's conclusion that this action is, at\n\nits core, a breach of contract claim.\n\n             Further, while it may be argued that resolution of Count\n\nI   of    appellant's   third    amended    complaint   may   require   some\n\napplication and interpretation of the Clean Water Act and the EPA\n\nGuidelines, this cannot rise to a substantial question of federal\n\nlaw.     The federal issue, assuming one exists, is tangential to the\n\nparties' contractual rights.         In addition, the EPA's interest in\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\feffective enforcement will not be prejudiced by the absence of a\n\nfederal court's review.            In fact, the EPA delegates these matters\n\nto state agencies as a matter of course.                  The language of the\n\ncomplaint     in    this    case     reflects    the    collateral    nature   of\n\nappellant's claim.         The statute cited, 33 U.S.C. § 1284, requires\n\ncertain parameters to be met when the EPA issues grants.               The grant\n\nwas contemplated by the Waste Management contract entered into by\n\nthe parties. If either party should break with the requirements of\n\n§ 1284 and its accompanying regulations, the EPA may choose to take\n\naction.     However,       the   parties      cannot   create   jurisdiction   by\n\nreference to this section when the dispute arises from their\n\ncontractual        obligations.         The     federal    question    here    is\n\ninsubstantial because it does not define the rights of the parties\n\nor provide them with a remedy.           See Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at\n\n20-21 (stating that \"what is needed is . . . a selective process\n\nwhich picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the\n\nother ones aside.\").        We can discern nothing more in this cause of\n\naction than a state law breach of contract claim over which the\n\ndistrict court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                 III.   CONCLUSION\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of appellant's third amended complaint.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f",

Am. Tissue Mills,</i> No. 96-40140(NMG) (D.Mass. Dec. 19, 2002). In March 1974, the town of Templeton entered into a Waste Management Contract with Baldwinville Products, Inc. (\"Baldwinville\") and its owner, Erving Industries, Inc. (\"Erving\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> by which Templeton agreed to build a wastewater treatment plant (\"the plant\") and make the plant available to Erving and Baldwinville for treatment of their wastewater. The contract provided, inter alia, that: (1) Templeton \"shall retain legal title to all wastewater facilities,\" (Waste Management Contract, Section XV); (2) Templeton shall pay ... One Dollar ($1.00) per year consideration for [defendants] to operate the [plant] (<i>id.,</i> Section XVI B.2); (3) Templeton would \"apply for Federal and/or State construction grants for its wastewater treatment facility.\" (<i>Id.,</i> Section VI). Finally, it provided that (4) Erving and Baldwinville would pay the net operating costs of the plant as well as 95.5% of the net capital costs of the plant. (<i>Id.,</i> Section XVI B.1(a) and (c)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Templeton applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") for a construction grant.

An Assignment and Assumption Agreement was executed, assigning Baldwinville's rights and liabilities under the Waste Management Contract to Northeast Waste Treatment Services, Inc. (\"Northeast\"), an ATM subsidiary.

The EPA also advised Templeton that the user charge system specified by the Waste Management Contract was inconsistent with the user charge system required by the CWA. A subsequent EPA memorandum received by Templeton in September 1995 concluded that the contract user charge system must be revised in order to comply with the EPA's regulatory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Templeton filed its initial complaint in the district court in June 1996.

Jurisdiction was premised upon 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, as the plaintiff was allegedly seeking relief under the CWA, and the remaining state law claims were entertained pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367. Although the complaint was amended three times, Count I did not materially change.

The district court concluded that Templeton's interpretation of the federal requirements was correct, but denied the summary judgment motion because material facts were still in dispute. <i>Templeton Bd. of Sewer Comm'rs v. American Tissue Mills,</i> No. 96-40140(NMG) (D.Mass. Dec. 9, 1997).

Corinthians Licenciamentos LTDA</i> 273 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir.2001). We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Templeton. <i>Aversa v. United States,</i> 99 F.3d 1200, 1210 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining whether \"arising under\" jurisdiction exists is a particularly difficult task. We must first determine whether Count I of the Third Amended Complaint alleges a federal cause of action. If not, then we must inquire into whether some element of the claim depends on the resolution of a substantial, disputed question of federal law. If a question of this nature exists, federal jurisdiction will lie. <i>See West 14th Street Commercial Corp. v. 5 West 14th Owners Corp.,</i> 815 F.2d 188, 193 (2d Cir.1987) (\"To determine whether the court has federal question jurisdiction to decide the case, the complaint must contain either a federal cause of action or a state cause of action embodying a substantial federal question.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Private Rights of Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of the United States has established that a district court properly exercises jurisdiction under Section 1331 when a plaintiff's complaint is based on a right conferred under federal law. <i>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida,</i> 414 U.S. 661, 666, 94 S.Ct. 772, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974). Whether a claim arises under federal law is determined under the well-pleaded complaint rule. <i>Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust,</i> 463 U.S. 1, 10, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983); <i>see also Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co. v. Mottley,</i> 211 U.S. 149, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908). Under that rule, \"[the jurisdictional question] must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration,\" without reference to any other pleadings. <i>Franchise Tax Bd.,</i> 463 U.S. at 10, 103 S.Ct. 2841 (internal quotations omitted). In other words, \"a right or immunity created by the Constitution or laws of the United States must be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff's cause of action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10-11, 103 S.Ct. 2841 (quoting <i>Gully v. First Nat'l Bank,</i> 299 U.S. 109, 112, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no private right of action under the CWA. <i>Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. Nat'l Sea Clammers Assoc.,</i> 453 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981). In <i>National Sea Clammers,</i> the Supreme Court stated that \"[i]n view of the[] elaborate enforcement provisions [of the CWA] it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to authorize by implication additional judicial remedies for private citizens: suing under [the CWA].\" <i>Id.</i> at 14, 101 S.Ct. 2615. Templeton does not dispute this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a cause of action is not created under a federal law, &#167; 1331 jurisdiction may lie \"`where the vindication of a right under state law necessarily turn[s] on some construction of federal law.\"' <i>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson,</i> 478 U.S. 804, 808-09, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986) (quoting <i>Franchise Tax Bd.,</i> 463 U.S. at 9, 103 S.Ct. 2841). This legal quandary is generally referred to as the litigation-provoking problem, or the presence of a federal issue in a state-created cause of action. <i>Merrell Dow,</i> 478 U.S. at 809-10, 106 S.Ct. 3229. In <i>Merrell Dow,</i> the Supreme Court held that the district court did not have jurisdiction under &#167; 1331, where the plaintiff alleged a state tort claim but pointed to federal law as evidence of the standard of care. Given that there was no private right of action under the federal law in question, the Court proceeded to examine whether a substantial question of law was implicated. It held that \"the presence of the federal issue as an element of the state tort is not the kind of adjudication for which jurisdiction would serve congressional purposes and the federal system.\" <i>Id.</i> at 814, 106 S.Ct. 3229. The Court then analyzed the plaintiff's arguments regarding the federal interest in uniformity and the special circumstances implicated in the case. The Court found both arguments unavailing, and found no subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Substantial Question of Federal Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Courts of Appeals, including this Circuit, have elaborated on the holding announced in <i>Merrell Dow.</i> We begin with a review of our post-<i>Merrell Dow</i> cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Three of our recent decisions are relevant to the present controversy. <i>PCS 2000 LP v. Romulus Telecommunications, Inc.,</i> 148 F.3d 32 (1st Cir.1998) dealt with the issue of whether the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") alone could be a source of subject matter jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held in <i>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 25 n. 32, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983), that the FAA created a federal body of law, but not an independent source of federal jurisdiction. Elaborating on that point, we held that the complaint at issue in <i>PCS 2000 LP</i> must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>PCS 2000 LP,</i> 148 F.3d at 34. Specifically, we noted the fact that \"th[e] case peripherally involve[d] [federal] bidding practices, and that cases sometimes arise under federal law when an interpretation of federal law is outcome-determinative.\" <i>Id.</i> at 35 (citing <i>Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 255 U.S. 180, 199, 41 S.Ct. 243, 65 L.Ed. 577 (1921)). However, we further stated that \"section 503(b) of the Communications Act confers no private right of action, and the plaintiffs' complaint only advances non-federal claims.\" <i>Id.</i> We deemed the connection too tenuous to confer federal jurisdiction. Finally, we observed that, \"[n]o less an authority than the Supreme Court has made this clear. Unless a federal statute bestows a private right of action, courts ought to presume that Congress did not intend the statute to confer federal jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, <i>PCS 2000 LP</i> endorses the view espoused by appellee, but recognizes that when the interpretation of federal law is outcome-determinative, subject matter jurisdiction may be properly exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explored the same issue in <i>Almond v. Capital Properties, Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 20 (1st Cir.2000). There, the plaintiff's action was removed from state court on the ground that it came within the federal court's subject matter jurisdiction. We assumed for the purposes of the holding that the cause of action was not created under federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 23. We went on to explore an alternative basis for obtaining federal jurisdiction &#8212; that a substantial question of federal law was involved. <i>Id.</i> We characterized the claim as follows: \"[t]he central issue properly presented ... is whether [defendant's] promise to the [Federal Railroad Administration] includes an obligation to obtain the FRA's approval before implementing the increase in parking charges at issue in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> Because the Supreme Court has consistently held that the rights and obligations of the United States and its agencies are governed exclusively by federal law, we held subject matter jurisdiction existed. <i>Id.</i> at 24. Appellee argues that this case is inapposite. To the extent that the rights and obligations of the United States and its agencies will always be a matter of federal law, appellee is correct. However, we believe that this case also stands for the proposition that there is a discrete type of case where federal subject matter jurisdiction will lie notwithstanding the absence of a federal cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasoning in <i>Almond</i> relied on Judge Posner's opinion in <i>Price v. Pierce,</i> 823 F.2d 1114 (7th Cir.1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Price</i> involved a contract dispute filed by prospective tenants (designated by the court as third-party beneficiaries) against multiple defendants, including the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"), challenging the allocation of lower-income family housing. The contract in question was between private parties. However, in order to resolve the dispute the court would have to interpret a contract provision approved by a federal agency pursuant to a federal statutory scheme. The Seventh Circuit held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he issue is potentially so important to the success of the program &#8212; since on its resolution may turn the amount of lower-income housing actually provided &#8212; that we believe that Congress, had it thought about the matter, would have wanted the question to be decided by federal courts applying a uniform principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Price,</i> 823 F.2d at 1119-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seventh Circuit's observation is especially relevant: \"Section 1437f(b)(2) contemplates that HUD will enter directly or (as here) indirectly ... into contractual relations with developers all over the country....\" <i>Id.</i> at 1119. In Templeton's case, the EPA has not contracted on its behalf, and therefore Templeton (or anyone else for that matter), would not have standing to sue the agency or its contractors. However, the contract entered into in the instant appeal explicitly contemplated the application of federal grants, which in turn obligated the parties to abide by the EPA regulations. Our opinion in <i>Almond</i> embraces <i>Price</i> \"pending further enlightenment from the Supreme Court.\" <i>Almond,</i> 212 F.3d at 24. A subsequent Seventh Circuit case held that \"a federal rule of decision is necessary but not sufficient for federal jurisdiction. There must also be a right of action to enforce that rule.\" <i>Seinfeld v. Austen,</i> 39 F.3d 761, 764 (7th Cir.1994) (quoting <i>Dillon v. Combs,</i> 895 F.2d 1175, 1177 (7th Cir.1990)). <i>Seinfeld</i> failed to address the discrete class of cases where a substantial federal question may confer jurisdiction under &#167; 1331.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other Circuits reviewing the discrete issue of whether there is a substantial question of federal law have produced confusing (if not conflicting) opinions on the matter. In a case with facts similar to the instant appeal, the Fourth Circuit found that the Clean Air Act conferred jurisdiction under &#167; 1331, notwithstanding the absence of a private right of action under the federal act. <i>Ormet Corp. v. Ohio Power Co.,</i> 98 F.3d 799, 807 (4th Cir.1996). Plaintiff sued several defendants claiming that it was entitled to emission allowances issued to Ohio Power by the EPA, and seeking money damages. The court determined that Section 408(i) of the Clean Air Act did not create a private remedy. However, that did \"not fully resolve the question of whether Ormet's claim, alleging ownership of emission allowances ... arises under federal law....\" <i>Id.</i> at 806. Whether there was a \"question sufficiently substantial to arise under federal law,\" was another avenue for obtaining jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> After reviewing <i>Merrell Dow,</i> the Fourth Circuit held that federal jurisdiction did exist, because, \"to resolve that dispute, a court must interpret both the Act and the contract to decide whether Ormet is party to a `life-of-the-unit, firm power contractual arrangement,' as that phrase is defined in the Act.\" <i>Id.</i> at 807, 106 S.Ct. 3229. In addition, the Fourth Circuit considered Congress's explicit intent that the EPA not be burdened with \"resolving private disputes over a unit's allowances,\" <i>Ormet,</i> 98 F.3d at 805, and the fact that the system of freely transferable allowances was \"critical to the Acid Rain Program.\" <i>Id.</i> at 807 (citing the legislative history of the particular section of the Act). Finally, uniformity was considered imperative to the program's success. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, the Fourth Circuit held that there was a substantial federal interest and subject matter jurisdiction was proper under &#167; 1331. In doing so, the court endorsed the continuing validity of <i>Smith</i> and <i>Franchise Tax Board. Cf. Mulcahey v. Columbia Organic Chem. Co.,</i> 29 F.3d 148 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in this case relied on the Sixth Circuit case of <i>Board of Trustees of Painesville Township v. City of Painesville,</i> 200 F.3d 396 (6th Cir.1999). In <i>City of Painesville,</i> the City, in an effort to expand its wastewater treatment facilities, applied to the EPA for a grant. Although the grant suggested that the plaintiffs would have access to the new facilities, the City refused to provide it. Plaintiffs brought suit alleging violations of Section 204 of the CWA. The Sixth Circuit held that because the CWA provided no private right of action, the district court could not exercise jurisdiction over the claims. <i>Id.</i> at 400. The court made no mention of <i>Smith</i> or <i>Franchise Tax Board</i> in its opinion. The district court reasoned, on the basis of <i>Painesville,</i> that \"Templeton's claim under the CWA is, therefore, frivolous and insufficiently substantial to warrant the exercise of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.\" The opinion goes further still, assuming arguendo that even if Templeton's claim required the interpretation of the CWA, it</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">would still lack subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim because the congressional determination that there should be no federal remedy for violation of this federal statute [i.e. that there is no private right of action] is tantamount to a congressional conclusion that the presence of a claimed violation of the statute as an element of a state cause of action is insufficiently substantial to confer federal-question jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(quoting <i>Merrell Dow,</i> 478 U.S. at 814, 106 S.Ct. 3229 (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We arrive at the crux of our decision. We agree with the district court that under <i>Merrell Dow,</i> the plaintiff's cause of action cannot give rise to a federal cause of action as this is clearly foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>National Sea Clammers.</i> Nor do we think that plaintiff's argument can succeed under the <i>Smith/Franchise Tax Board</i> rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that merely because a court will have to interpret the federal regulations, it necessarily follows that federal jurisdiction exists. We agree with the Fourth Circuit that \"the determination of whether a federal issue is sufficiently substantial should be informed by a sensitive judgment about whether the existence of federal judicial power is both appropriate and pragmatic\" and that \"at bottom, we must determine whether the dispute is one that Congress intended federal courts to resolve.\" <i>Ormet,</i> 98 F.3d at 807. We see no indication, and appellant has pointed to none, that Congress intended the CWA and its regulations to confer federal question jurisdiction. <i>See J.A. Jones Constr. Comp. v. City of New York,</i> 753 F.Supp. 497 (S.D.N.Y.1990)(holding that the incorporation of EPA regulations under the CWA into a contract did not give rise to federal question jurisdiction when suing for breach of contract). The complaint before the district court did not present a substantial question of federal law. We agree with the district court's conclusion that this action is, at its core, a breach of contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, while it may be argued that resolution of Count I of appellant's third amended complaint may require some application and interpretation of the Clean Water Act and the EPA Guidelines, this cannot rise to a <i>substantial</i> question of federal law. The federal issue, assuming one exists, is tangential to the parties' contractual rights. In addition, the EPA's interest in effective enforcement will not be prejudiced by the absence of a federal court's review. In fact, the EPA delegates these matters to state agencies as a matter of course. The language of the complaint in this case reflects the collateral nature of appellant's claim. The statute cited, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1284, requires certain parameters to be met when the EPA issues grants. The grant was contemplated by the Waste Management contract entered into by the parties. If either party should break with the requirements of &#167; 1284 and its accompanying regulations, the EPA may choose to take action. However, the parties cannot create jurisdiction by reference to this section when the dispute arises from their contractual obligations. The federal question here is insubstantial because it does not define the rights of the parties or provide them with a remedy. <i>See Franchise Tax Bd.,</i> 463 U.S. at 20-21, 103 S.Ct. 2841 (stating that \"what is needed is ... a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside.\"). We can discern nothing more in this cause of action than a state law breach of contract claim over which the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's dismissal of appellant's third amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 (2000)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Motion to Dismiss was filed by defendant-appellee Nourollah Elghanayan.

The Supreme Court has stated that a litigant may not defeat the well-pleaded complaint rule by bringing a declaratory judgment action<i>See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,</i> 339 U.S. 667, 673-74, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950). The underlying coercive action in this complaint is a state breach of contract claim. Neither party disputes this conclusion. Templeton states that this case involves a substantial interpretation of federal law. Therefore, notwithstanding the form of the complaint, this court is under an obligation to determine whether the resolution of the breach of contract action involves a substantial question of federal law which gives rise to subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Two cases cited by appellant as relevant to the issue are clearly distinguishable. In<i>Arroyo-Torres v. Ponce Federal Bank, F.B.S.,</i> 918 F.2d 276, 278-79 (1st Cir.1990), we held that the plaintiff had no private right of action under the Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act. <i>Arroyo-Torres</i> did not analyze whether there was a substantial federal question and affirmed the district court's dismissal without reference to <i>Merrell Dow.</i> We concluded that the district court should have dismissed the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <i>Arroyo-Torres,</i> 918 F.2d at 280. The case is therefore not relevant to the question at hand. In <i>Nashoba Communications Ltd. Partnership No. 7 v. Danvers,</i> 893 F.2d 435 (1st Cir.1990), we engaged in the &#167; 1331 analysis. However, that case turned on the issue of whether federal jurisdiction was based on an anticipatory federal defense. Our analysis centered on that issue, and we held that the plaintiff ran afoul of the well-pleaded complaint rule.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The parties cite the First Circuit case of<i>Penobscot Nation v.

While that case engaged in some analysis of the issue of federal jurisdiction, we held that regardless of the jurisdictional issue, the district court was bound by the ruling of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. Therefore, the case was decided on issue preclusion grounds, not under &#167; 1331, and is irrelevant to the present issue. In any event, the opinion's discussion of &#167; 1331 merely reiterates the points made in <i>Almond</i> and <i>Price</i> and does not rely on <i>Smith.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In addition, it is pertinent that<i>Seinfeld</i> relies entirely on <i>Merrell Dow,</i> whereas <i>Price</i> engages in the jurisdictional analysis without mentioning <i>Merrell Dow.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(\"Baldwinville\") and its owner, Erving Industries, Inc. (\"Erving\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> by which Templeton agreed to build a wastewater treatment plant (\"the plant\") and make the plant available to Erving and Baldwinville for treatment of their wastewater. The contract provided, inter alia, that: (1) Templeton \"shall retain legal title to all wastewater facilities,\" (Waste Management Contract, Section XV); (2) Templeton shall pay ... One Dollar ($1.00) per year consideration for [defendants] to operate the [plant] (<i>id.,</i> Section XVI B.2); (3) Templeton would \"apply for Federal and/or State construction grants for its wastewater treatment facility.\" (<i>Id.,</i> Section VI). Finally, it provided that (4) Erving and Baldwinville would pay the net operating costs of the plant as well as 95.5% of the net capital costs of the plant. (<i>Id.,</i> Section XVI B.1(a) and (c)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Templeton applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") for a construction grant.

(\"ATM\"), purchased Baldwinville's operating assets. An Assignment and Assumption Agreement was executed, assigning Baldwinville's rights and liabilities under the Waste Management Contract to Northeast Waste Treatment Services, Inc. (\"Northeast\"), an ATM subsidiary. From 1991 until April 3, 2002, ATM and Northeast operated the plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1995, the EPA informed Templeton that the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1284(b)(1), required Templeton to implement a user charge system whereby each user of the plant must pay a proportionate share of the cost of operating and maintaining the entire wastewater treatment system based upon that user's contribution to the total waste flow. The EPA also advised Templeton that the user charge system specified by the Waste Management Contract was inconsistent with the user charge system required by the CWA. A subsequent EPA memorandum received by Templeton in September 1995 concluded that the contract user charge system must be revised in order to comply with the EPA's regulatory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Jurisdiction was premised upon 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, as the plaintiff was allegedly seeking relief under the CWA, and the remaining state law claims were entertained pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367.

The district court concluded that Templeton's interpretation of the federal requirements was correct, but denied the summary judgment motion because material facts were still in dispute. <i>Templeton Bd. of Sewer Comm'rs v. American Tissue Mills,</i> No. 96-40140(NMG) (D.Mass. Dec. 9, 1997).

Elaborating on that point, we held that the complaint at issue in <i>PCS 2000 LP</i> must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>PCS 2000 LP,</i> 148 F.3d at 34.

Unless a federal statute bestows a private right of action, courts ought to presume that Congress did not intend the statute to confer federal jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, <i>PCS 2000 LP</i> endorses the view espoused by appellee, but recognizes that when the interpretation of federal law is outcome-determinative, subject matter jurisdiction may be properly exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explored the same issue in <i>Almond v.

Appellee argues that this case is inapposite. To the extent that the rights and obligations of the United States and its agencies will always be a matter of federal law, appellee is correct.

In Templeton's case, the EPA has not contracted on its behalf, and therefore Templeton (or anyone else for that matter), would not have standing to sue the agency or its contractors. However, the contract entered into in the instant appeal explicitly contemplated the application of federal grants, which in turn obligated the parties to abide by the EPA regulations. Our opinion in <i>Almond</i> embraces <i>Price</i> \"pending further enlightenment from the Supreme Court.\" <i>Almond,</i> 212 F.3d at 24. A subsequent Seventh Circuit case held that \"a federal rule of decision is necessary but not sufficient for federal jurisdiction. There must also be a right of action to enforce that rule.\" <i>Seinfeld v. Austen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681639\"><a href=\"/opinion/681639/f-david-seinfeld-leatrice-seinfeld-frederick-seinfeld-v-k-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>, 764 (7th Cir.1994) (quoting <i>Dillon v.

In a case with facts similar to the instant appeal, the Fourth Circuit found that the Clean Air Act conferred jurisdiction under &#167; 1331, notwithstanding the absence of a private right of action under the federal act. <i>Ormet Corp. v. Ohio Power Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728098\"><a href=\"/opinion/728098/ormet-corporation-now-known-as-ormet-primary-aluminum-corporation-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span>, 807 (4th Cir.1996). Plaintiff sued several defendants claiming that it was entitled to emission allowances issued to Ohio Power by the EPA, and seeking money damages. The court determined that Section 408(i) of the Clean Air Act did not create a private remedy. However, that did \"not fully resolve the question of whether Ormet's claim, alleging ownership of emission allowances ... arises under federal law....\" <i>Id.</i> at 806. Whether there was a \"question sufficiently substantial to arise under federal law,\" was another avenue for obtaining jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> After reviewing <i>Merrell Dow,</i> the Fourth Circuit held that federal jurisdiction did exist, because, \"to resolve that dispute, a court must interpret both the Act and the contract to decide whether Ormet is party to a `life-of-the-unit, firm power contractual arrangement,' as that phrase is defined in the Act.\" <i>Id.</i> at 807, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111758\"><a href=\"/opinion/111758/merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3229</span></a></span>. In addition, the Fourth Circuit considered Congress's explicit intent that the EPA not be burdened with \"resolving private disputes over a unit's allowances,\" <i>Ormet,</i> 98 F.3d at 805, and the fact that the system of freely transferable allowances was \"critical to the Acid Rain Program.\" <i>Id.</i> at 807 (citing the legislative history of the particular section of the Act). Finally, uniformity was considered imperative to the program's success. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, the Fourth Circuit held that there was a substantial federal interest and subject matter jurisdiction was proper under &#167; 1331. In doing so, the court endorsed the continuing validity of <i>Smith</i> and <i>Franchise Tax Board. Cf. Mulcahey v. Columbia Organic Chem. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673862\"><a href=\"/opinion/673862/patrick-m-mulcahey-anna-mulcahey-albert-parsons-ruth-l-parsons/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in this case relied on the Sixth Circuit case of <i>Board of Trustees of Painesville Township v. City of Painesville,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767217\"><a href=\"/opinion/767217/board-of-trustees-of-painesville-township-mayridge-construction-company-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1999). In <i>City of Painesville,</i> the City, in an effort to expand its wastewater treatment facilities, applied to the EPA for a grant. Although the grant suggested that the plaintiffs would have access to the new facilities, the City refused to provide it. Plaintiffs brought suit alleging violations of Section 204 of the CWA. The Sixth Circuit held that because the CWA provided no private right of action, the district court could not exercise jurisdiction over the claims. <i>Id.</i> at 400. The court made no mention of <i>Smith</i> or <i>Franchise Tax Board</i> in its opinion. The district court reasoned, on the basis of <i>Painesville,</i> that \"Templeton's claim under the CWA is, therefore, frivolous and insufficiently substantial to warrant the exercise of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.\" The opinion goes further still, assuming arguendo that even if Templeton's claim required the interpretation of the CWA, it</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">would still lack subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim because the congressional determination that there should be no federal remedy for violation of this federal statute [i.e. that there is no private right of action] is tantamount to a congressional conclusion that the presence of a claimed violation of the statute as an element of a state cause of action is insufficiently substantial to confer federal-question jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(quoting <i>Merrell Dow,</i> 478 U.S. at 814, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111758\"><a href=\"/opinion/111758/merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We agree with the district court that under <i>Merrell Dow,</i> the plaintiff's cause of action cannot give rise to a federal cause of action as this is clearly foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>National Sea Clammers.</i> Nor do we think that plaintiff's argument can succeed under the <i>Smith/Franchise Tax Board</i> rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that merely because a court will have to interpret the federal regulations, it necessarily follows that federal jurisdiction exists. We agree with the Fourth Circuit that \"the determination of whether a federal issue is sufficiently substantial should be informed by a sensitive judgment about whether the existence of federal judicial power is both appropriate and pragmatic\" and that \"at bottom, we must determine whether the dispute is one that Congress intended federal courts to resolve.\" <i>Ormet,</i> 98 F.3d at 807. We see no indication, and appellant has pointed to none, that Congress intended the CWA and its regulations to confer federal question jurisdiction. <i>See J.A. Jones Constr. Comp. v. City of New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460234\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460234/ja-jones-const-co-v-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span> (S.D.N.Y.1990)(holding that the incorporation of EPA regulations under the CWA into a contract did not give rise to federal question jurisdiction when suing for breach of contract). The complaint before the district court did not present a substantial question of federal law. We agree with the district court's conclusion that this action is, at its core, a breach of contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, while it may be argued that resolution of Count I of appellant's third amended complaint may require some application and interpretation of the Clean Water Act and the EPA Guidelines, this cannot rise to a <i>substantial</i> question of federal law. The federal issue, assuming one exists, is tangential to the parties' contractual rights. In addition, the EPA's interest in effective enforcement will not be prejudiced by the absence of a federal court's review. In fact, the EPA delegates these matters to state agencies as a matter of course. The language of the complaint in this case reflects the collateral nature of appellant's claim. The statute cited, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1284, requires certain parameters to be met when the EPA issues grants. The grant was contemplated by the Waste Management contract entered into by the parties. If either party should break with the requirements of &#167; 1284 and its accompanying regulations, the EPA may choose to take action. However, the parties cannot create jurisdiction by reference to this section when the dispute arises from their contractual obligations. The federal question here is insubstantial because it does not define the rights of the parties or provide them with a remedy. <i>See Franchise Tax Bd.,</i> 463 U.S. at 20-21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110990\"><a href=\"/opinion/110990/franchise-tax-bd-of-cal-v-construction-laborers-vacation-trust-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2841</span></a></span> (stating that \"what is needed is ... a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside.\").

The Supreme Court has stated that a litigant may not defeat the well-pleaded complaint rule by bringing a declaratory judgment action<i>See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104808\"><a href=\"/opinion/104808/skelly-oil-co-v-phillips-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 673-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104808\"><a href=\"/opinion/104808/skelly-oil-co-v-phillips-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span> (1950). The underlying coercive action in this complaint is a state breach of contract claim. Neither party disputes this conclusion. Templeton states that this case involves a substantial interpretation of federal law. Therefore, notwithstanding the form of the complaint, this court is under an obligation to determine whether the resolution of the breach of contract action involves a substantial question of federal law which gives rise to subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Two cases cited by appellant as relevant to the issue are clearly distinguishable. In<i>Arroyo-Torres v. Ponce Federal Bank, F.B.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551277\"><a href=\"/opinion/551277/awilda-arroyo-torres-v-ponce-federal-bank-fbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span>, 278-79 (1st Cir.1990), we held that the plaintiff had no private right of action under the Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act. <i>Arroyo-Torres</i> did not analyze whether there was a substantial federal question and affirmed the district court's dismissal without reference to <i>Merrell Dow.</i> We concluded that the district court should have dismissed the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <i>Arroyo-Torres,</i> 918 F.2d at 280. The case is therefore not relevant to the question at hand. In <i>Nashoba Communications Ltd. Partnership No. 7 v. Danvers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534778\"><a href=\"/opinion/534778/nashoba-communications-limited-partnership-no-7-dba-nashoba-cable/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990), we engaged in the &#167; 1331 analysis. However, that case turned on the issue of whether federal jurisdiction was based on an anticipatory federal defense. Our analysis centered on that issue, and we held that the plaintiff ran afoul of the well-pleaded complaint rule.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The parties cite the First Circuit case of<i>Penobscot Nation v.

While that case engaged in some analysis of the issue of federal jurisdiction, we held that regardless of the jurisdictional issue, the district court was bound by the ruling of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. Therefore, the case was decided on issue preclusion grounds, not under &#167; 1331, and is irrelevant to the present issue. In any event, the opinion's discussion of &#167; 1331 merely reiterates the points made in <i>Almond</i> and <i>Price</i> and does not rely on <i>Smith.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In addition, it is pertinent that<i>Seinfeld</i> relies entirely on <i>Merrell Dow,</i> whereas <i>Price</i> engages in the jurisdictional analysis without mentioning <i>Merrell Dow.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
