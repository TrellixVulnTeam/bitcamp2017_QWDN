Roldan's Claims\n\n            Roldan raises six claims on appeal: (1) the district\n\ncourt's denial of his continuance motion denied him the opportunity\n\nfor a fair trial; (2) the evidence upon which he was convicted was\n\ninsufficient and submitted to the jury upon an incorrect mens rea\n\ninstruction; (3) the court should have severed his trial from his\n\nco-defendants'; (4) he deserves a new trial because of newly-\n\ndiscovered evidence and the government's Brady violation; (5) the\n\ncourt violated Apprendi and Blakely; and (6) the sentencing court\n\nfailed to understand its authority to grant a downward departure.\n\nWe consider each of these claims in turn.\n\n1.   Denial of the Continuance Motion\n\n            Claiming that the fifty-six day time span between his\n\narraignment and the start of the trial did not give his attorney\n\nadequate time to review the evidence and to prepare a defense,\n\nRoldan claims that the district court's denial of his motion for a\n\nthirty    day   continuance    deprived    him    of   due   process      and   the\n\neffective assistance of counsel.           He argues that this difficulty\n\nwas exacerbated by the government's decision to seek the death\n\npenalty    until   the   day   before     the    trial.      We   grant    \"broad\n\ndiscretion\" to a trial court to decide a continuance motion and\n\nwill only find abuse of that discretion with a showing that the\n\ncourt exhibited an \"unreasonable and arbitrary insistence upon\n\nexpeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.\"\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\fUnited States v. Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d 532, 545 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).              \"In deciding whether\n\ndenial of a continuance constitutes an abuse of discretion, we\n\ncannot apply a mechanical test, but must evaluate each case on its\n\nown facts.\"    United States v. Torres, 793 F.2d 436, 440 (1st Cir.\n\n1986).     Among the factors we evaluate in reviewing such a denial\n\nare \"the defendant's diligence, the inconvenience to the court and\n\nother parties, the likely utility of a continuance, and any unfair\n\nprejudice     caused    by   the     denial.\"          United     States   v.\n\nOrlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Roldan greatly increased the potential burden on the\n\ncourt and the government by failing to file a timely request for a\n\ncontinuance. In fact, having received the court's warning that the\n\ndistrict     court's   backlog     did   not   allow    it   to   grant    any\n\ncontinuances, Roldan did not file his motion for a thirty day\n\ncontinuance until the day before the trial was scheduled to begin.\n\nSee United States v. Jones, 730 F.2d 593, 596 (10th Cir. 1984)\n\n(holding that the district court properly denied the motion for\n\ncontinuance because, inter alia, the defendant waited until six\n\ndays before trial to file the motion); United States v. Lee, 729\n\nF.2d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir. 1984) (per curiam) (the defendant's\n\ndiligence in requesting a continuance in timely fashion is a factor\n\nin determining whether denial was appropriate); United States v.\n\nBollin, 729 F.2d 1083 (6th Cir. 1984) (per curiam) (holding that\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fthere was no error in the district court's denial of a motion for\n\na continuance filed on the first day of a trial).            There is no\n\ngainsaying the poor timing of Roldan's motion.\n\n             Importantly,   with   one    exception   that   we   discuss\n\nseparately, Roldan fails to identify any specific ways in which the\n\ncourt's denial of his continuance motion unfairly prejudiced him.10\n\nA defendant is generally not entitled to a new trial unless he or\n\nshe can identify specific ways in which the court's erroneous\n\ndenial of a continuance prejudiced his or her defense.             United\n\nStates v. Flecha-Maldonado, 373 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(affirming trial court's denial of a continuance after observing\n\nthat \"counsel has identified no concrete ways in which the unusual\n\ntrial schedule in this case prejudiced [the defendant]\"). Although\n\nhe states that the government produced twenty thousand pages of\n\ndocuments and tape recordings relating to thirty-five individuals,\n\nhe fails to identify (with the one exception already noted) any\n\nmaterial document that he was unable to review due to the time\n\n\n\n     10\n          For example, Roldan argues in his brief as follows:\n\n     Defendant absolutely needed more time. Time to identify,\n     locate and produce witnesses. Time to importune their\n     cooperation, and secure their testimony. Time to review\n     their words and follow-up with further investigation.\n     Time to accomplish all of this while scrutinizing 20,000\n     pages of discovery accumulated over a 2 1/2 year period,\n     reviewing voluminous taped evidence; within the shadow of\n     the death penalty and all of its ramifications.\n\nThese are fervent claims, but they are also generalities.\n\n                                   -43-\n\fpressures.    Furthermore, Roldan's complaint about twenty thousand\n\npages of discovery is misleading.11      The government provided a\n\ncontents page with each discovery package that it sent to the\n\ndefendants.     Roldan could have used these indices to focus his\n\nevaluation of the evidence on the issues and witnesses that were\n\nrelevant to his defense without having to sift through all of the\n\npages in the documents.      The three murder-related charges were\n\nparticularly suited to such a targeted approach.   They concerned a\n\nfew individuals involved in a discrete set of events over a limited\n\ntime period.\n\n             When Roldan finally filed the continuance motion,12 it\n\nstated generally that \"Mr. Roldan-Cortes is being charged in the\n\nsecond superseding [sic] returned July 16, 2000.        Defendant's\n\nattorney has not complied [sic] due to the reason that it is\n\nimpossible with so many documents to analyze and the evidence that\n\nhas been submitted to us by the government.\"     The arguments that\n\nRoldan presented orally at trial were similarly general.     On the\n\nfirst day of trial, his attorney, Efren Irizarry, announced:\n\n             We would like to state our position that we\n             are   not  ready   for  trial,   our  client\n             voluntarily surrendered less than two months\n             ago, and some of the things that co-counsel\n\n\n     11\n      Roldan did not respond to the claim in the government's brief\nthat the discovery provided was only approximately 4,500 pages.\n     12\n       Roldan did not include his motion as part of the record on\nappeal; however, we requested and received a copy from the district\ncourt.\n\n                                 -44-\n\f          are mentioning here are totally new to me, due\n          to the reason that it's impossible for\n          ourselves   to  be   reading   the   extensive\n          thousands of documents that the US attorney\n          has forwarded us, and we haven't been able to\n          hear only about half of the tape recordings\n          they have given us, and we were going to make\n          an opening statement regarding -- we don't\n          even know the totality of the discovery that\n          we asked the government, and what it related\n          to our client, and what doesn't, in a matter\n          that imposes a capital crime.\n\nLater that day, Irizarry interjected: \"Your Honor, for the record,\n\nI would just like to reproduce my motion that I haven't been able\n\nto review all of the evidence.\"    This statement prompted the court\n\nto respond: \"There is no need to further -- there is no need to\n\nrepeat the fact that you're not prepared a thousand times on this\n\nrecord.   You made your point.\"    The court and Irizarry then had a\n\nshort exchange:\n\n           COURT:      By the way, don't forget about the\n                       fact, Ms. [sic] Irizarry, that you\n                       had a conversation with me before\n                       this trial started, in which you\n                       wanted me to relieve you from\n                       further     representing      this\n                       individual because he had only\n                       paid you $25,000.\n           IRIZARRY:   No, Your Honor, $6,500. I filed a\n                       motion to it.\n           COURT:      Because it was too little money\n                       for you to sit in trial for two\n                       months.13\n\n           Despite his repeated complaints that the attorneys of the\n\nco-defendants had more time to prepare cases for their clients,\n\n\n     13\n      As this exchange indicates, Roldan chose to have Irizzary\nrepresent him; the attorney was not appointed by the court.\n\n                                  -45-\n\fIrizarry's       performance      was   comparable          to     that   of    the   other\n\nattorneys.        Only   one     of   the    defendants          presented     an    opening\n\nstatement to the jury, and only one witness, a pathologist who\n\nprovided expert testimony regarding Llaurador's remains, appeared\n\nfor any of the defendants.            Irizzary was able to cross-examine the\n\ngovernment's       chief     witnesses,       Soto    and        Ramos,   with       earlier\n\nstatements that they provided to the federal investigators and co-\n\nconspirators.        Further, although Roldan hired a new attorney to\n\nprosecute this appeal, the brief filed on appeal does not identify\n\nany specific deficiencies in Irizarry's performance or, as already\n\nstated, specific examples of prejudice (save one) caused by the\n\ndenial of the continuance.14            See United States v. Moore, 362 F.3d\n\n129,    136   (1st    Cir.     2004)    (observing          that    there      was    \"ample\n\nopportunity\" between the sentencing hearing and the appeal for the\n\ndefendant to have reflected and identified specific prejudice from\n\nthe court's denial of his continuance motion).\n\n              As a specific example of prejudice resulting from the\n\ndenial of the continuance, Roldan cites his late discovery of a one\n\npage    report    from     the   Aguadilla         Police    Department        discussing\n\ninformation from a confidential informant who implicated people\n\n\n\n\n       14\n      The attorney, Linda George, was actually hired after the\ntrial but before sentencing.  She made her first appearance on\nMarch 22, 2002.\n\n                                            -46-\n\fother than him in the shooting of Martin.15               Even though the\n\ngovernment provided that one page report to him during discovery,\n\nhe says that he failed to discover it in the mountain of produced\n\ndocuments.    Furthermore, he claims that his inability to find this\n\ndocument prevented him from contacting the Aguadilla police to try\n\nto obtain the supporting documentation for this one page report\n\nthat may have been contained in their investigative file.\n\n             Roldan makes a Brady claim about this police report which\n\nwe discuss in a later section of this opinion.           It is sufficient\n\nfor our purposes here to note Roldan's lack of diligence in not\n\nlocating   this   one   page   police   report   prior   to   trial   in   the\n\ndiscovery provided to him.         If he had simply glanced at the\n\ncontents pages that accompanied the discovery packets, he would\n\nhave seen a heading marked \"Documents Relating to Murder of James\n\nMartin Rodriguez on May 20, 1993, are Listed as Numbers 195 to 215\n\nBelow,\" and then he would have seen an entry marked \"208.             Copy of\n\na report regarding confidential information received concerning\n\n'Muerte occurrida en Res.' (1 p.).\"          Moreover, even the timely\n\ndiscovery of this document by Roldan probably would not have\n\nproduced anything helpful at trial.         Roldan's attorney noted at\n\noral argument that even though she had been actively trying to\n\nobtain a copy of the investigative file from the Aguadilla Police\n\n\n     15\n      The confidential informant named four individuals involved\nin the shooting of Martin, none of whom were mentioned by Ramos in\nhis account of the murder.\n\n                                   -47-\n\fDepartment for the past two years, she has been unable to do so.\n\nThis history underscores the absence of any prejudice in the denial\n\nof Roldan's motion for a thirty day continuance.16             It confirms,\n\nalong with the other reasons cited, that the court's denial of\n\nRoldan's continuance motion did not amount to a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d at 41 (\"While the trial\n\njudge held defendants to a tough schedule, in the absence of a\n\nshowing of unfair prejudice to defendants, there was no manifest\n\nabuse of discretion.\").\n\n2.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n               Roldan claims that the government did not introduce\n\nsufficient evidence to convict him of aiding and abetting the\n\nmurder of a government informant based on his role in assisting\n\nwith Martin's murder.         More specifically, he claims that the\n\ngovernment failed to demonstrate that he knew that he was aiding\n\nand abetting the murder of a federal government informant.                  His\n\nargument proceeds in two parts: (1) the government did not prove\n\nthat he knew that Pagan and Ramos were going to kill Martin; and\n\n(2) even if he did, he did not know that Martin was going to\n\ncooperate with federal authorities.\n\n               Roldan claims that the government proved that Pagan was\n\ngoing     to   communicate   with   Martin   and   that   \"[a]ny   number    of\n\n\n     16\n      Roldan raises a further claim of prejudice concerning his\ninability to locate some exculpatory witnesses. We discuss that\nclaim when we evaluate Roldan's claim for a new trial.\n\n                                     -48-\n\fcommunicative efforts were possible . . . from a slap on the wrist,\n\nto menacing, to the infliction of various wavelengths of pain or\n\ninjury from a broad spectrum of possibilities, to murder.\"    This\n\nargument is specious.   Roldan was an active and experienced member\n\nof a drug smuggling ring when he helped to arrange Martin's murder\n\nbecause Martin had become a government informant.   Ramos testified\n\nthat Santodomingo told him that Roldan would instruct him regarding\n\nwhat he was supposed to do when he arrived at the Ducos housing\n\nproject, and that Roldan identified Martin as the man whom Ramos\n\nand Pagan were supposed to murder. Ramos also testified that Pagan\n\ntold him that Roldan gave him one-half of a kilo of cocaine as\n\npayment for the murder.   The argument that no rational jury could\n\nhave concluded that Roldan knew that Pagan was going to kill Martin\n\nafter reviewing this evidence is untenable.\n\n          Roldan's claim that the government failed to establish\n\nthe requisite federal nexus under the Witness Protection Act also\n\nlacks merit.   He argues that the government failed to prove that\n\nRoldan aided and abetted Martin's murder with the belief that\n\nMartin might communicate with federal officials regarding the drug\n\nconspiracy. However, as we have already noted in our discussion of\n\nRodriguez's similar claim, the Witness Protection Act explicitly\n\nrelieves the government of having to prove that the defendant\n\nbelieved that the witness might contact federal officials regarding\n\nthe federal crime.   See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(g) (stating that \"[i]n a\n\n\n                                -49-\n\fprosecution for an offense under this section, no state of mind\n\nneed be proved with respect to the circumstance . . . that the law\n\nenforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal\n\nGovernment\"); United States v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 680-81 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (\"We also want to dispel any notion that the defendant's\n\nintent to hinder communication must include an awareness of the\n\npossible        involvement      of    federal   officials.\").           The   evidence\n\ndemonstrates that Roldan aided and abetted Martin's murder because\n\nhe   was        concerned       that    Martin    might       \"snitch\"      about   the\n\norganization's smuggling activities.               As it turns out, Martin had,\n\nin fact, begun cooperating with the federal authorities.                            This\n\nevidence was sufficient to establish the federal nexus. See United\n\nStates     v.    Bell,    113    F.3d   1345,    1349   (3d    Cir.    1997)    (\"[T]he\n\ngovernment         must     prove        that     at      least       one      of    the\n\nlaw-enforcement-officer communications which the defendant sought\n\nto prevent would have been with a federal officer, but . . . is not\n\nobligated to prove that the defendant knew or intended anything\n\nwith respect to this federal involvement.\").\n\n                Furthermore, we reject Roldan's claim that the court's\n\ninstruction regarding the state of mind requirement for conviction\n\nunder section 1512 was inconsistent or confusing. While failure to\n\nraise a timely objection to a jury instruction limits our review to\n\nplain error (there was no such objection here), see United States\n\nv. Sabetta, 373 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004), there was no error at\n\n\n                                          -50-\n\fall in the jury instruction.          The court properly explained the\n\nrequirements outlined by section 1512.\n\n3.   Severance\n\n           Citing the prejudicial impact of the gruesome details\n\nthat were presented to the jury about the Caballo and Llaurador\n\nmurders and the relatively minor role he played in the charged\n\nconspiracy, Roldan claims that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis motion to sever his trial from that of his co-defendants.          \"The\n\ndecision to grant or deny a motion for severance is committed to\n\nthe sound discretion of the trial court and we will reverse its\n\nrefusal   to   sever   only   upon   a   finding   of   manifest   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.\" United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 440 (1st Cir.\n\n1994); see also United States v. Searing, 984 F.2d 960, 965 (8th\n\nCir. 1993) (\"In the context of conspiracy, severance will rarely,\n\nif ever, be required.\").\n\n           While Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b) allows the government to\n\ncharge multiple defendants in the same indictment \"if they are\n\nalleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in\n\nthe same series of acts or transactions constituting an offense or\n\noffenses,\" a companion rule allows a court to order separate trials\n\nor to \"provide any other relief that justice requires\" if such\n\njoinder appears to prejudice a defendant or the government.

P. 14(a).      \"Prejudice from joinder can come in various\n\nforms, including jury confusion, the impact of evidence that is\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\fadmissible against only some defendants, and 'spillover' effects\n\nwhere the crimes of some defendants are more horrific or better\n\ndocumented than the crimes of others.\"          United States v.\n\nInnamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 469 (1st Cir. 1993).

These overt acts were\n\nall relevant to the jury's consideration of Roldan's criminal\n\nculpability for the drug conspiracy.           See Casas, 356 F.3d at 112\n\n(affirming trial court's denial of a severance motion by concluding\n\n\n                                  -52-\n\fthat testimony that did not directly implicate the defendant would\n\nhave been admissible to show the scope of the conspiracy in which\n\nhe   knowingly    participated);       Brandon,    17    F.3d        at    440        (\"The\n\ngovernment      presented    sufficient       evidence    to     show          that     all\n\ndefendants were involved in a single interdependent conspiracy\n\n. . . and most of the evidence at trial was related to the\n\ndevelopment and operation of that conspiracy.\").\n\n             Even if the evidence about the Caballo and Llaurador\n\nmurders was relevant to the drug conspiracy charge, Roldan argues\n\nthat the gruesome details of these murders unfairly prejudiced him\n\nat trial. This argument overlooks the sordid details of the murder\n\nin which Roldan was directly implicated.               Although Roldan did not\n\nactually pull the trigger, he aided and abetted the vicious murder\n\nof Martin, whose body was riddled with seventeen bullet wounds.\n\nGiven this      graphic    evidence,    we    cannot    say    that       the    graphic\n\nevidence relating to the Caballo and Llaurador murders was so\n\nprejudicial     that   the   case    against    Roldan    had    to       be    severed.\n\nHoulihan, 92 F.3d at 1295 (noting that all of the defendants used\n\nviolence   to    further     the    charged    conspiracy       as    part       of    its\n\njustification for rejecting a claim that co-conspirators' trials\n\nshould have been severed because of prejudicial impact of testimony\n\nregarding murders in which some defendants were not implicated).\n\n             As we have previously held, the prime factor that a court\n\nmust consider in evaluating a severance motion \"is whether the\n\n\n                                       -53-\n\fcourt may reasonably expect the jury to collate and appraise the\n\nindependent evidence against each defendant.\" Perkins, 926 F.2d at\n\n1281 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States v.\n\nDi Pasquale, 740 F.2d 1282, 1294 (3d Cir. 1984) (\"We must determine\n\nwhether the jury could reasonably be expected to compartmentalize\n\nthe evidence against the various defendants and to consider it for\n\nits proper purposes.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Despite\n\nthe length of the trial and the number of witnesses called, this\n\nwas not a particularly complex case.                          There were only three\n\ndefendants and they each bore comparable degrees of culpability.\n\nCf. Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 535 (noting that \"[w]hen many defendants\n\nare tried together in a complex case and they have markedly\n\ndifferent degrees of culpability, th[e] risk of prejudice is\n\nheightened\").          The    district      court    instructed        the       jury   that,\n\nalthough the defendants were joined for trial, it \"must decide the\n\ncase   of   each      defendant    and      each    crime      charged       against     that\n\ndefendant separately.\"            Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 469 (citing the\n\ncourt's issuance of this customary instruction in concluding that\n\nit was unlikely that the jury was confused).\n\n            In     arguing     that    he    suffered     greater       prejudice       from\n\nspillover than the other defendants, Roldan observes that \"of the\n\n28 overt acts and numerous allegations of serious criminal activity\n\n[identified      in     the    first     count      of   the        second       superseding\n\nindictment]      only    four     paragraphs        1,   3,    7,    and     8    set   forth\n\n\n                                            -54-\n\fallegations that include [Roldan].\" That argument is misleading in\n\ntwo respects.      First, the overt actions cited in those paragraphs\n\nallege    that    Roldan    helped   to   plan   and    execute   multi-hundred\n\nkilogram    shipments      of   cocaine   into   Puerto    Rico    and   that   he\n\nparticipated in the murder of a suspected informant, Martin.                    Far\n\nfrom suggesting that he was a minor player, these allegations\n\npresent Roldan as a key figure in this conspiracy.                  Second, the\n\nevidence     at     trial       demonstrated     that     Roldan     had    many\n\nresponsibilities within the drug organization that went beyond the\n\novert acts cited in the indictment, e.g., providing security during\n\ndrug shipments.        Therefore, the allegations in the indictment\n\nappear to understate his actual involvement.               For this reason as\n\nwell as the other reasons cited, the court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Roldan's severance motion.17\n\n4.   Brady and a Rule 33 Violation\n\n            Roldan also raises a Rule 33 claim, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court should have granted him a new trial based on newly-\n\n\n\n     17\n      We reject Roldan's related claim of prejudice directed at the\ncourt's failure to provide a special limiting instruction to the\njury regarding the evidence of the Caballo and Llaurador murders,\napart from the customary instruction regarding the responsibility\nto conduct individualized analyses of the evidence for each\ndefendant. Although Roldan requested such an instruction in the\nmiddle of the trial, he failed to remind the court to issue the\ninstruction at the end of the trial. Faced with the defendant's\nfailure to raise a timely objection to the court's omission, we\nreview the proffered instruction for plain error. United States v.\nBarrett, 539 F.2d 244, 249 (1st Cir. 1976). As can be deduced from\nour severance discussion, there was no plain error here.\n\n                                      -55-\n\fdiscovered exculpatory evidence.   He fuels his argument by drawing\n\non Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), in which the Supreme\n\nCourt held that \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence\n\nfavorable to an accused . . . violates due process where the\n\nevidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective\n\nof the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\"\n\n          As noted above in our discussion of Rodriguez's Rule 33\n\nmotion, if a defendant seeks a new trial on the basis of newly-\n\ndiscovered evidence without making a Brady claim, the defendant\n\nmust show that: \"(1) the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the\n\ndefendant at the time of trial; (2) failure to learn of the\n\nevidence was not due to lack of diligence by the defendant; (3) the\n\nevidence is material, and not merely cumulative or impeaching; and\n\n(4) [a new trial] will probably result in an acquittal upon retrial\n\nof the defendant.\"   Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019.   \"However, if the new\n\ntrial motion is based on an alleged Brady violation, the tests for\n\nthe third and fourth prongs of the Wright framework differ from\n\nthose applied to an ordinary Rule 33 motion.\"      United States. v.\n\nColon-Munoz, 318 F.3d 348, 358 (1st Cir. 2003).      In the ordinary\n\nRule 33 newly-discovered evidence context, \"the evidence must\n\ncreate an actual probability that an acquittal would have resulted\n\nif the evidence had been available.\"    Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1220.\n\n\"However, if the government possessed and failed to disclose Brady\n\nevidence, a new trial is warranted if the evidence is 'material' in\n\n\n                                -56-\n\fthat there is a 'reasonable probability . . . sufficient to\n\nundermine confidence in the outcome' that the evidence would have\n\nchanged the result.\" Colon-Munoz, 318 F.3d at 358 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985)).          See also Kyles v.\n\nWhitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995) (\"The question [as defined by\n\nBagley] is not whether the defendant would more likely than not\n\nhave received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in\n\nits absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial\n\nresulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\").\n\na.   Roldan's First Motion for a New Trial\n\n            Roldan presented two written motions and one oral motion\n\nfor a new trial in the district court.        He filed his first written\n\nmotion on April 23, 2001, claiming that the discovery of three\n\nallegedly new pieces of evidence warranted a new trial: (1) a\n\nstatement    purportedly   made   by   Santodomingo   at    a   government\n\ndebriefing session in which he exculpated Roldan from involvement\n\nin the drug conspiracy and Martin's murder; (2) the one page police\n\nreport    citing   statements   from   a   confidential    informant   that\n\nsupposedly cast doubt on Roldan's participation in the Martin\n\nmurder;18 and (3) a letter allegedly written by Pagan denying\n\nRoldan's involvement in Martin's murder.         On May 22, 2001, in a\n\n\n\n\n     18\n      This is the same document that we described in our earlier\ndiscussion of Roldan's claim of prejudice from the denial of his\nmotion for a continuance. See supra Part II.C.1.\n\n                                  -57-\n\flengthy and well-reasoned ruling, the district court denied each\n\nclaim in the written motion.\n\ni.    Santodomingo's Statement\n\n            On   April   18,   2001,    after   the   trial   in   this    case,\n\nSantodomingo participated in a telephone conference call with his\n\nattorney, his case manager, and Roldan's attorney, in which he\n\ninsisted that Roldan was not involved in the drug conspiracy and\n\nthat Roldan did not participate in Martin's murder.            He claimed to\n\nhave given this information to a local prosecutor and federal\n\nagents during an interview that was held after he decided to plead\n\nguilty.19 Santodomingo also told the participants in the conference\n\ncall that he would be willing to testify to Roldan's innocence.\n\n            The district court held that Santodomingo's statements\n\nwere insufficient to justify a new trial on Brady grounds.                Noting\n\nthat there was no support in the record for his claim that he was\n\ndebriefed by federal agents, and that the government denied that\n\nany such interview occurred, the court held that the government did\n\nnot    possess   exculpatory     statements      from   Santodomingo        and,\n\nconsequently, there was no Brady violation.\n\n\n\n\n      19\n      Simply stating that this alleged debriefing meeting occurred\n\"[a]fter he pled guilty pursuant to plea negotiations,\"\nSantodomingo does not state whether this meeting occurred before or\nafter Roldan's trial. For the purposes of our Brady analysis, we\nwill assume that Santodomingo alleges that this debriefing meeting\noccurred prior to Roldan's trial.\n\n                                       -58-\n\f            The court then evaluated Santodomingo's statements under\n\nthe Wright factors to determine whether Roldan was entitled to a\n\nnew trial under Rule 33. Concluding that Roldan failed to exercise\n\ndue diligence to obtain exculpatory evidence from Santodomingo\n\nprior to trial and that, as a convicted drug-dealing kingpin,\n\nSantodomingo would have little credibility with jurors, the court\n\nrejected Roldan's claim.          More specifically, the court stated that\n\n\"we dismiss his claim that the belated, self-serving statements\n\ngiven by the ringleader of a drug-smuggling organization denying\n\nparticipation in a murder merits a new trial or even an evidentiary\n\nhearing pursuant to Rule 33.\"20         There was no error in this ruling.\n\nii.   The Police Report\n\n            The police report, the one page investigative document\n\nfilled     out   by   a   local    police     officer   in   Aguadilla,   cited\n\ninformation obtained from a confidential informant who said that\n\nMartin was murdered by individuals named Atan, Malecon, Roman, and\n\nManteca.     Significantly, according to Roldan, the report did not\n\nidentify Roldan, Pagan or Ramos as having participated in the\n\nmurder.\n\n\n\n\n      20\n      The government observed in its appellate brief that\nSantodomingo's assertion that Roldan was not involved in any drug\nsmuggling activity contradicted the statement of facts in his plea\nagreement as well as a United States Customs Service investigative\nreport, in which Roldan admitted that he operated a drug point with\nValle-Lassalle   and   that  he   had   \"performed   several   drug\ntransactions.\"\n\n                                       -59-\n\f            Noting that the government provided a copy of this report\n\nto the defendants in one of its pretrial discovery packages, the\n\ndistrict court stated that Roldan \"is apparently claiming that the\n\ngovernment committed a Brady violation by failing to draw [Roldan's\n\nattorney's] attention to the potentially exculpatory documents\n\nbefore or at trial.\"          The court quickly dismissed that claim,\n\nstating: \"Defendant has not cited any case law in support of this\n\nproposition, and our own thorough research has not revealed any\n\nsuch authority.\"     Moreover, Roldan's receipt of the report during\n\ndiscovery precluded his claim that it constituted newly-discovered\n\nevidence.     The court observed: \"Had defense counsel thoroughly\n\nexamined    the   discovery    materials     provided    by   the   government,\n\nDefendant could have learned of the police report and investigated\n\nthe matter accordingly. Defense counsel had the evidence available\n\nto him at the time of trial.\"         We agree.\n\niii.    Pagan's Letter\n\n            Finally,   the    court   turned    to   a   letter     that   Roldan\n\nallegedly received from his co-conspirator Pagan, in which Pagan\n\nsaid that he killed Martin during a mugging and that Roldan was not\n\ninvolved with the death.       Pagan was a fugitive from justice at the\n\ntime.    After noting that the letter \"utterly fails to meet the\n\nWright standard\" because it was inadmissible hearsay, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 804(b)(3) (\"A statement tending to expose the declarant to\n\ncriminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\fadmissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the\n\ntrustworthiness of the statement.\"), the court stated that it found\n\nit \"highly troubling\" that Roldan was able to contact Pagan to give\n\nhim his mailing address while Pagan was a fugitive from justice.\n\nThe court observed that an arrest warrant had been issued for Pagan\n\non July 16, 2000, but that he had not yet been brought into\n\ncustody.    Again, we find no error in the court's denial of the\n\nmotion for a new trial.\n\nb.   The Oral Motion at the Sentencing Hearing\n\n            Roldan attempted to reopen the motion for a new trial at\n\nhis sentencing hearing on May 2, 2002.      Citing three allegedly new\n\nsources of exculpatory information, he stated that: (1) Pagan had\n\nnow been arrested and was willing to testify on Roldan's behalf;\n\n(2) his private investigator identified three new witnesses who\n\ncould testify as to his whereabouts at the time that Martin was\n\nmurdered; and (3) his private investigator had discovered that the\n\none page police report that he obtained during discovery was part\n\nof   a   larger   investigative   file   stored   at   the   local   police\n\ndepartment in Aguadilla. After Roldan completed his arguments, the\n\ngovernment gave the court a sealed report from the United States\n\nCustoms Service pertaining to Pagan's arrest.\n\n            The court summarily dismissed Roldan's claims, again\n\nconcluding that the new evidence would not have altered the result\n\nof the trial and that it was not going to reconsider its denial of\n\n\n                                  -61-\n\fthe new trial motion.       Although the court did not cite lack of\n\ndiligence in its ruling, we note that there is no evidence that\n\nRoldan tried to locate any of these exculpatory witnesses, one of\n\nwhom was his sister, prior to or during the trial.          Nor was there\n\nevidence that he tried to obtain the larger police investigative\n\nfile from the local police department.       On this ground as well, the\n\nmaterial cited by Roldan at the sentencing hearing did not meet the\n\nrequirements of the Wright test.\n\n            Roldan's effort to raise a Brady claim on the basis of\n\nthe police investigative file is also unpersuasive.          He claimed,\n\nwithout authority, that once the government saw the one page\n\ninvestigative report, it had a duty under Brady to contact the\n\nlocal     police   investigators,   obtain   a   complete   copy   of   the\n\ninvestigative file, and turn any exculpatory        material over to the\n\ndefense. There is no evidence that the government was working with\n\nthe local police on this case, cf. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437 (stating\n\nthat individual prosecutors have the duty to learn about evidence\n\nknown to others acting on the government's behalf), and there is no\n\nsupport for such a dramatic expansion of the Brady doctrine. Since\n\nthere is no evidence that the government possessed a copy of the\n\nfile prior to trial, there was no Brady violation here.21\n\n\n     21\n      The record indicates that Roldan has continued to try to\nobtain a copy from the Aguadilla Police Department of this\ninvestigative report on grounds, and under circumstances, that are\nless than clear.    These continuing efforts do not affect our\nanalysis of the court's disposition of Roldan's oral motion for a\n\n                                    -62-\n\f             Finally, the court stated that the sealed statement from\n\nthe Customs Service regarding Pagan's arrest did not exculpate or\n\notherwise aid Roldan.    We reviewed the document and agree with the\n\ndistrict court's assessment.\n\nc.   Roldan's Third Motion for a New Trial\n\n             Roldan filed a renewed motion for a new trial on March\n\n12, 2003, while this appeal was pending.      Once again, he claimed\n\nthat Pagan was willing to testify that Roldan had nothing to do\n\nwith Martin's murder.     He submitted a two page unsworn statement\n\nsigned by Pagan on October 10, 2002, in which Pagan stated: \"Luis\n\nRoldan-Cortes A.K.A. Wisi had nothing to do with the murder of\n\nJames Martin Rodriguz and I told this to the US Attorney who came\n\nto see me in February of 2002.\"         The district court was again\n\nunimpressed:\n\n             Pagan-Cerezo is a recently-captured fugitive\n             who has admitted to, and more recently pled\n             guilty to, the murder at issue here.   Given\n             our grave familiarity with the witnesses and\n             participants in this case, we find Pagan-\n             Cerezo to be an individual with very limited\n             credibility.\n\nNoting that part of Pagan's letter was inconsistent with the\n\nearlier letter that he sent, the court concluded that \"[w]e see\n\nlittle reason to believe that a jury would credit Pagan-Cerezo's\n\ntestimony over that of the government's informants.\"    The district\n\ncourt was in the best situation to make this judgment.      There was\n\n\nnew trial.\n\n                                 -63-\n\fno    error   in   the   ruling.       Moreover,    Roldan's     claim   that   the\n\ngovernment withheld exculpatory statements made by Pagan when he\n\nwas arrested in violation of Brady is misplaced because Pagan was\n\nnot arrested until after the trial and because the sealed document\n\ndoes not contain any exculpatory material.\n\n5.    Apprendi and Blakely\n\n              Roldan claims that the court violated his rights under\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and Blakely v.\n\nWashington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), by not requiring the jury to\n\ndetermine the quantity of drugs that should be attributed to him.22\n\nApprendi held that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,\n\nany   fact    that   increases     the    penalty   for   a    crime   beyond   the\n\nprescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"              530 U.S. at 490.       Blakely, in\n\nturn, clarified that \"the 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes\n\nis the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of\n\nthe   facts    reflected    in   the     jury   verdict   or    admitted   by   the\n\ndefendant.\"        124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original).                While\n\nBlakely itself \"express[ed] no opinion\" on the constitutionality of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines, id. at 2538 n.9, we would be remiss to\n\nignore it completely, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's\n\nwidely anticipated clarification of how (if at all) Blakely applies\n\n\n       22\n      Blakely was decided three months after oral argument in this\ncase. Roldan subsequently filed a notice of supplemental authority\nunder Fed. R. App. P. 28(j).\n\n                                         -64-\n\fto the federal Sentencing Guidelines.             See, e.g., United States v.\n\nBooker, 375 F.3d 508 (7th Cir. 2004) (holding Sentencing Guidelines\n\nunconstitutional      to     the    extent    that     they    require    judicial\n\nfactfinding), cert. granted, 73 U.S.L.W. 3074 (Aug. 2, 2004).\n\n           Roldan's        Apprendi/Blakely       argument      focuses    on    his\n\nconviction and sentence under count one of the second superseding\n\nindictment,   which    charged       him   with   conspiracy     to   \"unlawfully\n\npossess with the intent to distribute multi-kilogram quantities of\n\ncocaine . . . in excess of five (5) kilograms and multi-hundred\n\npound quantities of marijuana.\"              Section 841, the provision that\n\ncontains   the   relevant          sentencing     range   for     this    offense,\n\nestablishes that the range for such a violation \"may not be less\n\nthan 10 years or more than life.\"             21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).          The\n\njury was specifically asked with regard to each defendant if \"this\n\nconspiracy involve[d] at least 5 kilograms of cocaine,\" and it\n\nanswered \"Yes\" with regard to Roldan.\n\n           The jury's finding that Roldan conspired to possess with\n\nintent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine exposed him\n\nto a life sentence under the relevant sentencing statute.                       Under\n\npost-Apprendi,     pre-Blakely         law,     this    fact    would     end    the\n\nconstitutional analysis because Roldan's life sentence did not\n\n\"increase[] the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum\" as the term \"statutory maximum\" was then understood.\n\nApprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.          But Blakely casts doubt on that logic.\n\n\n                                       -65-\n\fIf the district court had calculated the conspiracy sentence solely\n\non   the   basis   of     judicial   findings   of   the   quantity   of   drugs\n\ninvolved, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b) & 3B1.1, there might have\n\nbeen a Blakely issue here.\n\n            On these facts, however, there is no Blakely issue.              The\n\ndistrict court recognized that Roldan was involved in a murder\n\nrelating to his drug activity, and applied the murder cross-\n\nreference    in    the    drug   conspiracy   guideline.      See U.S.S.G.     §\n\n2D1.1(d)(1) (cross-referencing to first degree murder guideline\n\n\"[i]f a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute\n\nmurder . . . had such killing taken place within the territorial or\n\nmaritime jurisdiction of the United States\").               The first degree\n\nmurder guideline, in turn, mandates a life sentence.                  See id. §\n\n2A1.1 (setting base offense level of forty-three for first degree\n\nmurder); id. Ch. 5 Pt. A (mandating life sentence for offense level\n\nof forty-three).         The jury had already decided that, in the course\n\nof the conspiracy, a victim (Martin) was killed under circumstances\n\nthat would constitute murder had the killing occurred within the\n\nfederal criminal jurisdiction. In fact, though it is not necessary\n\nto the analysis, the jury convicted Roldan (in three different\n\nways) of personally aiding and abetting in that murder.\n\n            In sum, application of the murder cross-reference was\n\nbased on a factual issue decided by the jury, not the judge.\n\nConsequently, there was no violation of either Apprendi or Blakely.\n\n\n                                       -66-\n\f6.   Downward Departure\n\n           Finally, Roldan argues that the district court denied his\n\napplication for a downward departure at sentencing based on an\n\nerroneous understanding of its authority to grant such a departure.\n\nHe does not support this claim with any evidence of the court's\n\nmisapprehension; he simply notes that the court did not explicitly\n\nrule on his request for a downward departure.   After reviewing the\n\nrecord of the sentencing hearing, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt understood its authority to grant a departure and that it\n\nexercised its discretion to refuse to do so.    Accordingly, we lack\n\njurisdiction to review the court's refusal to depart.    See United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 327 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                III.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Genao's convictions\n\non counts two and three of the second superseding indictment and\n\nREMAND to the district court for a new trial on those charges if\n\nthe government wishes to so proceed, and for resentencing.

Roldan's Claims\n\n            Roldan raises six claims on appeal: (1) the district\n\ncourt's denial of his continuance motion denied him the opportunity\n\nfor a fair trial; (2) the evidence upon which he was convicted was\n\ninsufficient and submitted to the jury upon an incorrect mens rea\n\ninstruction; (3) the court should have severed his trial from his\n\nco-defendants'; (4) he deserves a new trial because of newly-\n\ndiscovered evidence and the government's Brady violation; (5) the\n\ncourt violated Apprendi and Blakely; and (6) the sentencing court\n\nfailed to understand its authority to grant a downward departure.\n\nWe consider each of these claims in turn.\n\n1.   Denial of the Continuance Motion\n\n            Claiming that the fifty-six day time span between his\n\narraignment and the start of the trial did not give his attorney\n\nadequate time to review the evidence and to prepare a defense,\n\nRoldan claims that the district court's denial of his motion for a\n\nthirty    day   continuance    deprived    him    of   due   process      and   the\n\neffective assistance of counsel.           He argues that this difficulty\n\nwas exacerbated by the government's decision to seek the death\n\npenalty    until   the   day   before     the    trial.      We   grant    \"broad\n\ndiscretion\" to a trial court to decide a continuance motion and\n\nwill only find abuse of that discretion with a showing that the\n\ncourt exhibited an \"unreasonable and arbitrary insistence upon\n\nexpeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.\"\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\fUnited States v.

In fact, having received the court's warning that the\n\ndistrict     court's   backlog     did   not   allow    it   to   grant    any\n\ncontinuances, Roldan did not file his motion for a thirty day\n\ncontinuance until the day before the trial was scheduled to begin.\n\nSee United States v.

There is no\n\ngainsaying the poor timing of Roldan's motion.\n\n             Importantly,   with   one    exception   that   we   discuss\n\nseparately, Roldan fails to identify any specific ways in which the\n\ncourt's denial of his continuance motion unfairly prejudiced him.10\n\nA defendant is generally not entitled to a new trial unless he or\n\nshe can identify specific ways in which the court's erroneous\n\ndenial of a continuance prejudiced his or her defense.

Flecha-Maldonado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786699\"><a href=\"/opinion/786699/united-states-v-miguel-a-flecha-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(affirming trial court's denial of a continuance after observing\n\nthat \"counsel has identified no concrete ways in which the unusual\n\ntrial schedule in this case prejudiced [the defendant]\"). Although\n\nhe states that the government produced twenty thousand pages of\n\ndocuments and tape recordings relating to thirty-five individuals,\n\nhe fails to identify (with the one exception already noted) any\n\nmaterial document that he was unable to review due to the time\n\n\n\n     10\n          For example, Roldan argues in his brief as follows:\n\n     Defendant absolutely needed more time. Time to identify,\n     locate and produce witnesses. Time to importune their\n     cooperation, and secure their testimony. Time to review\n     their words and follow-up with further investigation.\n     Time to accomplish all of this while scrutinizing 20,000\n     pages of discovery accumulated over a 2 1/2 year period,\n     reviewing voluminous taped evidence; within the shadow of\n     the death penalty and all of its ramifications.\n\nThese are fervent claims, but they are also generalities.\n\n                                   -43-\n\fpressures.    Furthermore, Roldan's complaint about twenty thousand\n\npages of discovery is misleading.11      The government provided a\n\ncontents page with each discovery package that it sent to the\n\ndefendants.     Roldan could have used these indices to focus his\n\nevaluation of the evidence on the issues and witnesses that were\n\nrelevant to his defense without having to sift through all of the\n\npages in the documents.      The three murder-related charges were\n\nparticularly suited to such a targeted approach.   They concerned a\n\nfew individuals involved in a discrete set of events over a limited\n\ntime period.\n\n             When Roldan finally filed the continuance motion,12 it\n\nstated generally that \"Mr. Roldan-Cortes is being charged in the\n\nsecond superseding [sic] returned July 16, 2000.        Defendant's\n\nattorney has not complied [sic] due to the reason that it is\n\nimpossible with so many documents to analyze and the evidence that\n\nhas been submitted to us by the government.\"     The arguments that\n\nRoldan presented orally at trial were similarly general.     On the\n\nfirst day of trial, his attorney, Efren Irizarry, announced:\n\n             We would like to state our position that we\n             are   not  ready   for  trial,   our  client\n             voluntarily surrendered less than two months\n             ago, and some of the things that co-counsel\n\n\n     11\n      Roldan did not respond to the claim in the government's brief\nthat the discovery provided was only approximately 4,500 pages.\n     12\n       Roldan did not include his motion as part of the record on\nappeal; however, we requested and received a copy from the district\ncourt.\n\n                                 -44-\n\f          are mentioning here are totally new to me, due\n          to the reason that it's impossible for\n          ourselves   to  be   reading   the   extensive\n          thousands of documents that the US attorney\n          has forwarded us, and we haven't been able to\n          hear only about half of the tape recordings\n          they have given us, and we were going to make\n          an opening statement regarding -- we don't\n          even know the totality of the discovery that\n          we asked the government, and what it related\n          to our client, and what doesn't, in a matter\n          that imposes a capital crime.\n\nLater that day, Irizarry interjected: \"Your Honor, for the record,\n\nI would just like to reproduce my motion that I haven't been able\n\nto review all of the evidence.\"    This statement prompted the court\n\nto respond: \"There is no need to further -- there is no need to\n\nrepeat the fact that you're not prepared a thousand times on this\n\nrecord.   You made your point.\"    The court and Irizarry then had a\n\nshort exchange:\n\n           COURT:      By the way, don't forget about the\n                       fact, Ms. [sic] Irizarry, that you\n                       had a conversation with me before\n                       this trial started, in which you\n                       wanted me to relieve you from\n                       further     representing      this\n                       individual because he had only\n                       paid you $25,000.\n           IRIZARRY:   No, Your Honor, $6,500. I filed a\n                       motion to it.\n           COURT:      Because it was too little money\n                       for you to sit in trial for two\n                       months.13\n\n           Despite his repeated complaints that the attorneys of the\n\nco-defendants had more time to prepare cases for their clients,\n\n\n     13\n      As this exchange indicates, Roldan chose to have Irizzary\nrepresent him; the attorney was not appointed by the court.\n\n                                  -45-\n\fIrizarry's       performance      was   comparable          to     that   of    the   other\n\nattorneys.        Only   one     of   the    defendants          presented     an    opening\n\nstatement to the jury, and only one witness, a pathologist who\n\nprovided expert testimony regarding Llaurador's remains, appeared\n\nfor any of the defendants.            Irizzary was able to cross-examine the\n\ngovernment's       chief     witnesses,       Soto    and        Ramos,   with       earlier\n\nstatements that they provided to the federal investigators and co-\n\nconspirators.        Further, although Roldan hired a new attorney to\n\nprosecute this appeal, the brief filed on appeal does not identify\n\nany specific deficiencies in Irizarry's performance or, as already\n\nstated, specific examples of prejudice (save one) caused by the\n\ndenial of the continuance.14            See United States v. Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200932\"><a href=\"/opinion/200932/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    136   (1st    Cir.     2004)    (observing          that    there      was    \"ample\n\nopportunity\" between the sentencing hearing and the appeal for the\n\ndefendant to have reflected and identified specific prejudice from\n\nthe court's denial of his continuance motion).\n\n              As a specific example of prejudice resulting from the\n\ndenial of the continuance, Roldan cites his late discovery of a one\n\npage    report    from     the   Aguadilla         Police    Department        discussing\n\ninformation from a confidential informant who implicated people\n\n\n\n\n       14\n      The attorney, Linda George, was actually hired after the\ntrial but before sentencing.  She made her first appearance on\nMarch 22, 2002.\n\n                                            -46-\n\fother than him in the shooting of Martin.15               Even though the\n\ngovernment provided that one page report to him during discovery,\n\nhe says that he failed to discover it in the mountain of produced\n\ndocuments.    Furthermore, he claims that his inability to find this\n\ndocument prevented him from contacting the Aguadilla police to try\n\nto obtain the supporting documentation for this one page report\n\nthat may have been contained in their investigative file.\n\n             Roldan makes a Brady claim about this police report which\n\nwe discuss in a later section of this opinion.           It is sufficient\n\nfor our purposes here to note Roldan's lack of diligence in not\n\nlocating   this   one   page   police   report   prior   to   trial   in   the\n\ndiscovery provided to him.         If he had simply glanced at the\n\ncontents pages that accompanied the discovery packets, he would\n\nhave seen a heading marked \"Documents Relating to Murder of James\n\nMartin Rodriguez on May 20, 1993, are Listed as Numbers 195 to 215\n\nBelow,\" and then he would have seen an entry marked \"208.             Copy of\n\na report regarding confidential information received concerning\n\n'Muerte occurrida en Res.' (1 p.).\"          Moreover, even the timely\n\ndiscovery of this document by Roldan probably would not have\n\nproduced anything helpful at trial.         Roldan's attorney noted at\n\noral argument that even though she had been actively trying to\n\nobtain a copy of the investigative file from the Aguadilla Police\n\n\n     15\n      The confidential informant named four individuals involved\nin the shooting of Martin, none of whom were mentioned by Ramos in\nhis account of the murder.\n\n                                   -47-\n\fDepartment for the past two years, she has been unable to do so.\n\nThis history underscores the absence of any prejudice in the denial\n\nof Roldan's motion for a thirty day continuance.16             It confirms,\n\nalong with the other reasons cited, that the court's denial of\n\nRoldan's continuance motion did not amount to a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d at 41 (\"While the trial\n\njudge held defendants to a tough schedule, in the absence of a\n\nshowing of unfair prejudice to defendants, there was no manifest\n\nabuse of discretion.\").\n\n2.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n               Roldan claims that the government did not introduce\n\nsufficient evidence to convict him of aiding and abetting the\n\nmurder of a government informant based on his role in assisting\n\nwith Martin's murder.         More specifically, he claims that the\n\ngovernment failed to demonstrate that he knew that he was aiding\n\nand abetting the murder of a federal government informant.                  His\n\nargument proceeds in two parts: (1) the government did not prove\n\nthat he knew that Pagan and Ramos were going to kill Martin; and\n\n(2) even if he did, he did not know that Martin was going to\n\ncooperate with federal authorities.\n\n               Roldan claims that the government proved that Pagan was\n\ngoing     to   communicate   with   Martin   and   that   \"[a]ny   number    of\n\n\n     16\n      Roldan raises a further claim of prejudice concerning his\ninability to locate some exculpatory witnesses. We discuss that\nclaim when we evaluate Roldan's claim for a new trial.\n\n                                     -48-\n\fcommunicative efforts were possible . . . from a slap on the wrist,\n\nto menacing, to the infliction of various wavelengths of pain or\n\ninjury from a broad spectrum of possibilities, to murder.\"    This\n\nargument is specious.   Roldan was an active and experienced member\n\nof a drug smuggling ring when he helped to arrange Martin's murder\n\nbecause Martin had become a government informant.   Ramos testified\n\nthat Santodomingo told him that Roldan would instruct him regarding\n\nwhat he was supposed to do when he arrived at the Ducos housing\n\nproject, and that Roldan identified Martin as the man whom Ramos\n\nand Pagan were supposed to murder. Ramos also testified that Pagan\n\ntold him that Roldan gave him one-half of a kilo of cocaine as\n\npayment for the murder.   The argument that no rational jury could\n\nhave concluded that Roldan knew that Pagan was going to kill Martin\n\nafter reviewing this evidence is untenable.\n\n          Roldan's claim that the government failed to establish\n\nthe requisite federal nexus under the Witness Protection Act also\n\nlacks merit.   He argues that the government failed to prove that\n\nRoldan aided and abetted Martin's murder with the belief that\n\nMartin might communicate with federal officials regarding the drug\n\nconspiracy. However, as we have already noted in our discussion of\n\nRodriguez's similar claim, the Witness Protection Act explicitly\n\nrelieves the government of having to prove that the defendant\n\nbelieved that the witness might contact federal officials regarding\n\nthe federal crime.   See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(g) (stating that \"[i]n a\n\n\n                                -49-\n\fprosecution for an offense under this section, no state of mind\n\nneed be proved with respect to the circumstance . . . that the law\n\nenforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal\n\nGovernment\"); United States v.

The   evidence\n\ndemonstrates that Roldan aided and abetted Martin's murder because\n\nhe   was        concerned       that    Martin    might       \"snitch\"      about   the\n\norganization's smuggling activities.               As it turns out, Martin had,\n\nin fact, begun cooperating with the federal authorities.                            This\n\nevidence was sufficient to establish the federal nexus.

Despite\n\nthe length of the trial and the number of witnesses called, this\n\nwas not a particularly complex case.

The    district      court    instructed        the       jury   that,\n\nalthough the defendants were joined for trial, it \"must decide the\n\ncase   of   each      defendant    and      each    crime      charged       against     that\n\ndefendant separately.\"            Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 469 (citing the\n\ncourt's issuance of this customary instruction in concluding that\n\nit was unlikely that the jury was confused).\n\n            In     arguing     that    he    suffered     greater       prejudice       from\n\nspillover than the other defendants, Roldan observes that \"of the\n\n28 overt acts and numerous allegations of serious criminal activity\n\n[identified      in     the    first     count      of   the        second       superseding\n\nindictment]      only    four     paragraphs        1,   3,    7,    and     8    set   forth\n\n\n                                            -54-\n\fallegations that include [Roldan].\" That argument is misleading in\n\ntwo respects.      First, the overt actions cited in those paragraphs\n\nallege    that    Roldan    helped   to   plan   and    execute   multi-hundred\n\nkilogram    shipments      of   cocaine   into   Puerto    Rico    and   that   he\n\nparticipated in the murder of a suspected informant, Martin.                    Far\n\nfrom suggesting that he was a minor player, these allegations\n\npresent Roldan as a key figure in this conspiracy.                  Second, the\n\nevidence     at     trial       demonstrated     that     Roldan     had    many\n\nresponsibilities within the drug organization that went beyond the\n\novert acts cited in the indictment, e.g., providing security during\n\ndrug shipments.        Therefore, the allegations in the indictment\n\nappear to understate his actual involvement.               For this reason as\n\nwell as the other reasons cited, the court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Roldan's severance motion.17\n\n4.

Although Roldan requested such an instruction in the\nmiddle of the trial, he failed to remind the court to issue the\ninstruction at the end of the trial.

Roldan's First Motion for a New Trial\n\n            Roldan presented two written motions and one oral motion\n\nfor a new trial in the district court.        He filed his first written\n\nmotion on April 23, 2001, claiming that the discovery of three\n\nallegedly new pieces of evidence warranted a new trial: (1) a\n\nstatement    purportedly   made   by   Santodomingo   at    a   government\n\ndebriefing session in which he exculpated Roldan from involvement\n\nin the drug conspiracy and Martin's murder; (2) the one page police\n\nreport    citing   statements   from   a   confidential    informant   that\n\nsupposedly cast doubt on Roldan's participation in the Martin\n\nmurder;18 and (3) a letter allegedly written by Pagan denying\n\nRoldan's involvement in Martin's murder.         On May 22, 2001, in a\n\n\n\n\n     18\n      This is the same document that we described in our earlier\ndiscussion of Roldan's claim of prejudice from the denial of his\nmotion for a continuance. See supra Part II.C.1.\n\n                                  -57-\n\flengthy and well-reasoned ruling, the district court denied each\n\nclaim in the written motion.\n\ni.    Santodomingo's Statement\n\n            On   April   18,   2001,    after   the   trial   in   this    case,\n\nSantodomingo participated in a telephone conference call with his\n\nattorney, his case manager, and Roldan's attorney, in which he\n\ninsisted that Roldan was not involved in the drug conspiracy and\n\nthat Roldan did not participate in Martin's murder.            He claimed to\n\nhave given this information to a local prosecutor and federal\n\nagents during an interview that was held after he decided to plead\n\nguilty.19 Santodomingo also told the participants in the conference\n\ncall that he would be willing to testify to Roldan's innocence.\n\n            The district court held that Santodomingo's statements\n\nwere insufficient to justify a new trial on Brady grounds.                Noting\n\nthat there was no support in the record for his claim that he was\n\ndebriefed by federal agents, and that the government denied that\n\nany such interview occurred, the court held that the government did\n\nnot    possess   exculpatory     statements      from   Santodomingo        and,\n\nconsequently, there was no Brady violation.\n\n\n\n\n      19\n      Simply stating that this alleged debriefing meeting occurred\n\"[a]fter he pled guilty pursuant to plea negotiations,\"\nSantodomingo does not state whether this meeting occurred before or\nafter Roldan's trial. For the purposes of our Brady analysis, we\nwill assume that Santodomingo alleges that this debriefing meeting\noccurred prior to Roldan's trial.\n\n                                       -58-\n\f            The court then evaluated Santodomingo's statements under\n\nthe Wright factors to determine whether Roldan was entitled to a\n\nnew trial under Rule 33. Concluding that Roldan failed to exercise\n\ndue diligence to obtain exculpatory evidence from Santodomingo\n\nprior to trial and that, as a convicted drug-dealing kingpin,\n\nSantodomingo would have little credibility with jurors, the court\n\nrejected Roldan's claim.          More specifically, the court stated that\n\n\"we dismiss his claim that the belated, self-serving statements\n\ngiven by the ringleader of a drug-smuggling organization denying\n\nparticipation in a murder merits a new trial or even an evidentiary\n\nhearing pursuant to Rule 33.\"20         There was no error in this ruling.\n\nii.   The Police Report\n\n            The police report, the one page investigative document\n\nfilled     out   by   a   local    police     officer   in   Aguadilla,   cited\n\ninformation obtained from a confidential informant who said that\n\nMartin was murdered by individuals named Atan, Malecon, Roman, and\n\nManteca.     Significantly, according to Roldan, the report did not\n\nidentify Roldan, Pagan or Ramos as having participated in the\n\nmurder.\n\n\n\n\n      20\n      The government observed in its appellate brief that\nSantodomingo's assertion that Roldan was not involved in any drug\nsmuggling activity contradicted the statement of facts in his plea\nagreement as well as a United States Customs Service investigative\nreport, in which Roldan admitted that he operated a drug point with\nValle-Lassalle   and   that  he   had   \"performed   several   drug\ntransactions.\"\n\n                                       -59-\n\f            Noting that the government provided a copy of this report\n\nto the defendants in one of its pretrial discovery packages, the\n\ndistrict court stated that Roldan \"is apparently claiming that the\n\ngovernment committed a Brady violation by failing to draw [Roldan's\n\nattorney's] attention to the potentially exculpatory documents\n\nbefore or at trial.\"          The court quickly dismissed that claim,\n\nstating: \"Defendant has not cited any case law in support of this\n\nproposition, and our own thorough research has not revealed any\n\nsuch authority.\"     Moreover, Roldan's receipt of the report during\n\ndiscovery precluded his claim that it constituted newly-discovered\n\nevidence.     The court observed: \"Had defense counsel thoroughly\n\nexamined    the   discovery    materials     provided    by   the   government,\n\nDefendant could have learned of the police report and investigated\n\nthe matter accordingly. Defense counsel had the evidence available\n\nto him at the time of trial.\"         We agree.\n\niii.    Pagan's Letter\n\n            Finally,   the    court   turned    to   a   letter     that   Roldan\n\nallegedly received from his co-conspirator Pagan, in which Pagan\n\nsaid that he killed Martin during a mugging and that Roldan was not\n\ninvolved with the death.       Pagan was a fugitive from justice at the\n\ntime.    After noting that the letter \"utterly fails to meet the\n\nWright standard\" because it was inadmissible hearsay, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 804(b)(3) (\"A statement tending to expose the declarant to\n\ncriminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\fadmissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the\n\ntrustworthiness of the statement.\"), the court stated that it found\n\nit \"highly troubling\" that Roldan was able to contact Pagan to give\n\nhim his mailing address while Pagan was a fugitive from justice.\n\nThe court observed that an arrest warrant had been issued for Pagan\n\non July 16, 2000, but that he had not yet been brought into\n\ncustody.    Again, we find no error in the court's denial of the\n\nmotion for a new trial.\n\nb.   The Oral Motion at the Sentencing Hearing\n\n            Roldan attempted to reopen the motion for a new trial at\n\nhis sentencing hearing on May 2, 2002.      Citing three allegedly new\n\nsources of exculpatory information, he stated that: (1) Pagan had\n\nnow been arrested and was willing to testify on Roldan's behalf;\n\n(2) his private investigator identified three new witnesses who\n\ncould testify as to his whereabouts at the time that Martin was\n\nmurdered; and (3) his private investigator had discovered that the\n\none page police report that he obtained during discovery was part\n\nof   a   larger   investigative   file   stored   at   the   local   police\n\ndepartment in Aguadilla. After Roldan completed his arguments, the\n\ngovernment gave the court a sealed report from the United States\n\nCustoms Service pertaining to Pagan's arrest.\n\n            The court summarily dismissed Roldan's claims, again\n\nconcluding that the new evidence would not have altered the result\n\nof the trial and that it was not going to reconsider its denial of\n\n\n                                  -61-\n\fthe new trial motion.       Although the court did not cite lack of\n\ndiligence in its ruling, we note that there is no evidence that\n\nRoldan tried to locate any of these exculpatory witnesses, one of\n\nwhom was his sister, prior to or during the trial.          Nor was there\n\nevidence that he tried to obtain the larger police investigative\n\nfile from the local police department.       On this ground as well, the\n\nmaterial cited by Roldan at the sentencing hearing did not meet the\n\nrequirements of the Wright test.\n\n            Roldan's effort to raise a Brady claim on the basis of\n\nthe police investigative file is also unpersuasive.          He claimed,\n\nwithout authority, that once the government saw the one page\n\ninvestigative report, it had a duty under Brady to contact the\n\nlocal     police   investigators,   obtain   a   complete   copy   of   the\n\ninvestigative file, and turn any exculpatory        material over to the\n\ndefense. There is no evidence that the government was working with\n\nthe local police on this case, cf. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437 (stating\n\nthat individual prosecutors have the duty to learn about evidence\n\nknown to others acting on the government's behalf), and there is no\n\nsupport for such a dramatic expansion of the Brady doctrine. Since\n\nthere is no evidence that the government possessed a copy of the\n\nfile prior to trial, there was no Brady violation here.21\n\n\n     21\n      The record indicates that Roldan has continued to try to\nobtain a copy from the Aguadilla Police Department of this\ninvestigative report on grounds, and under circumstances, that are\nless than clear.    These continuing efforts do not affect our\nanalysis of the court's disposition of Roldan's oral motion for a\n\n                                    -62-\n\f             Finally, the court stated that the sealed statement from\n\nthe Customs Service regarding Pagan's arrest did not exculpate or\n\notherwise aid Roldan.    We reviewed the document and agree with the\n\ndistrict court's assessment.\n\nc.   Roldan's Third Motion for a New Trial\n\n             Roldan filed a renewed motion for a new trial on March\n\n12, 2003, while this appeal was pending.      Once again, he claimed\n\nthat Pagan was willing to testify that Roldan had nothing to do\n\nwith Martin's murder.     He submitted a two page unsworn statement\n\nsigned by Pagan on October 10, 2002, in which Pagan stated: \"Luis\n\nRoldan-Cortes A.K.A. Wisi had nothing to do with the murder of\n\nJames Martin Rodriguz and I told this to the US Attorney who came\n\nto see me in February of 2002.\"         The district court was again\n\nunimpressed:\n\n             Pagan-Cerezo is a recently-captured fugitive\n             who has admitted to, and more recently pled\n             guilty to, the murder at issue here.   Given\n             our grave familiarity with the witnesses and\n             participants in this case, we find Pagan-\n             Cerezo to be an individual with very limited\n             credibility.\n\nNoting that part of Pagan's letter was inconsistent with the\n\nearlier letter that he sent, the court concluded that \"[w]e see\n\nlittle reason to believe that a jury would credit Pagan-Cerezo's\n\ntestimony over that of the government's informants.\"    The district\n\ncourt was in the best situation to make this judgment.      There was\n\n\nnew trial.\n\n                                 -63-\n\fno    error   in   the   ruling.       Moreover,    Roldan's     claim   that   the\n\ngovernment withheld exculpatory statements made by Pagan when he\n\nwas arrested in violation of Brady is misplaced because Pagan was\n\nnot arrested until after the trial and because the sealed document\n\ndoes not contain any exculpatory material.\n\n5.

Blakely, in\n\nturn, clarified that \"the 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes\n\nis the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of\n\nthe   facts    reflected    in   the     jury   verdict   or    admitted   by   the\n\ndefendant.\"        124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original).                While\n\nBlakely itself \"express[ed] no opinion\" on the constitutionality of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines, id. at 2538 n.9, we would be remiss to\n\nignore it completely, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's\n\nwidely anticipated clarification of how (if at all) Blakely applies\n\n\n       22\n      Blakely was decided three months after oral argument in this\ncase.

The\n\njury was specifically asked with regard to each defendant if \"this\n\nconspiracy involve[d] at least 5 kilograms of cocaine,\" and it\n\nanswered \"Yes\" with regard to Roldan.\n\n           The jury's finding that Roldan conspired to possess with\n\nintent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine exposed him\n\nto a life sentence under the relevant sentencing statute.                       Under\n\npost-Apprendi,     pre-Blakely         law,     this    fact    would     end    the\n\nconstitutional analysis because Roldan's life sentence did not\n\n\"increase[] the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum\" as the term \"statutory maximum\" was then understood.\n\nApprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.          But Blakely casts doubt on that logic.\n\n\n                                       -65-\n\fIf the district court had calculated the conspiracy sentence solely\n\non   the   basis   of     judicial   findings   of   the   quantity   of   drugs\n\ninvolved, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b) & 3B1.1, there might have\n\nbeen a Blakely issue here.\n\n            On these facts, however, there is no Blakely issue.              The\n\ndistrict court recognized that Roldan was involved in a murder\n\nrelating to his drug activity, and applied the murder cross-\n\nreference    in    the    drug   conspiracy   guideline.      See U.S.S.G.     §\n\n2D1.1(d)(1) (cross-referencing to first degree murder guideline\n\n\"[i]f a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute\n\nmurder . . . had such killing taken place within the territorial or\n\nmaritime jurisdiction of the United States\").               The first degree\n\nmurder guideline, in turn, mandates a life sentence.                  See id. §\n\n2A1.1 (setting base offense level of forty-three for first degree\n\nmurder); id. Ch. 5 Pt. A (mandating life sentence for offense level\n\nof forty-three).         The jury had already decided that, in the course\n\nof the conspiracy, a victim (Martin) was killed under circumstances\n\nthat would constitute murder had the killing occurred within the\n\nfederal criminal jurisdiction. In fact, though it is not necessary\n\nto the analysis, the jury convicted Roldan (in three different\n\nways) of personally aiding and abetting in that murder.\n\n            In sum, application of the murder cross-reference was\n\nbased on a factual issue decided by the jury, not the judge.\n\nConsequently, there was no violation of either Apprendi or Blakely.\n\n\n                                       -66-\n\f6.   Downward Departure\n\n           Finally, Roldan argues that the district court denied his\n\napplication for a downward departure at sentencing based on an\n\nerroneous understanding of its authority to grant such a departure.\n\nHe does not support this claim with any evidence of the court's\n\nmisapprehension; he simply notes that the court did not explicitly\n\nrule on his request for a downward departure.   After reviewing the\n\nrecord of the sentencing hearing, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt understood its authority to grant a departure and that it\n\nexercised its discretion to refuse to do so.
