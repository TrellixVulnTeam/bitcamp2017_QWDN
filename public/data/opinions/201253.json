Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Bruce P. Gladstein on brief for appellants.\n     Marc DeSisto, Kathleen M. Daniels and DeSisto Law on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                        September 22, 2004\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge. Plaintiff-appellant Casilda Acosta\n\ninvites us to vacate a summary judgment order terminating her suit\n\nfor false arrest under, inter alia, 42 U.S.C. § 1983.1   Discerning\n\nno error in the district court's disposition of the matter, we\n\ndecline Acosta's invitation.\n\n          The facts are uncomplicated.     Glenn Powers worked as a\n\nstore detective for Ames Department Stores, Inc. (Ames).         On\n\nOctober 18, 1999, he called the Middletown, Rhode Island, police\n\ndepartment to report a shoplifting at a local Ames emporium.\n\nOfficer Kelly Mitchell responded to the call and Powers informed\n\nher that the appellant, her sons, and a group of other persons had\n\nentered the shop that evening.    He watched the appellant take two\n\njackets, emblazoned with the logo of the New England Patriots, from\n\na rack and outfit her sons with them.    He then surveilled the trio\n\nas they walked around the store and proceeded through the checkout\n\nline without making any attempt to pay for the jackets.\n\n          Powers stopped the suspected shoplifters as soon as they\n\nleft the premises.    When he confronted them with the alleged\n\nlarceny, one of the boys admitted that he had donned the jacket in\n\nthe store.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Casilda Acosta's sons, Kenny and Kevin, are also parties.\nTheir claims are largely derivative, however, and for ease in\nreference we treat Casilda as if she were the sole plaintiff and\nappellant. Our opinion is, of course, binding on all three.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            Once she had interviewed Powers, Officer Mitchell talked\n\nwith the appellant.     She found communication difficult because of\n\na language barrier; Mitchell spoke no Spanish and the appellant\n\nlacked fluency in English. Nonetheless, Mitchell was able to glean\n\nthe essence of the appellant's claim:         that she had purchased the\n\njackets on an earlier shopping trip.          To bolster that claim, the\n\nappellant gave Mitchell a layaway receipt dated October 5, 1999.\n\nThis receipt indicated that ten items had been rung up (including\n\ntwo labeled \"PATRIOTS OUT\" at a sale price of $22.41 each); that\n\n$49.94 had been paid toward a previous balance; and that the\n\nlayaway was complete.     The receipt did not indicate what \"PATRIOTS\n\nOUT\" meant.\n\n            Officer   Mitchell    then    inspected   the   jackets.     She\n\nobserved a wet spot on one of them, consistent with what might\n\nappear if soda or juice had just been spilled on it.               She also\n\nfound a used tissue in a jacket pocket.          At that point, Mitchell\n\ntook the appellant into custody and charged her with shoplifting.\n\nAlthough at least one other officer had by then responded to the\n\nscene, the police did not converse with any other Ames personnel\n\nbefore effectuating the arrest.          By the same token, they did not\n\ninterview     other   customers   (not    even   those   persons   who   had\n\noriginally accompanied the appellant to the store).\n\n            For reasons that need not concern us, the criminal\n\ncharges were subsequently dropped.        The incident, however, was not\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fforgotten.    The appellant brought suit in a Rhode Island state\n\ncourt alleging seventeen different causes of action against a\n\nmyriad of defendants.      The complaint, as amended, named Ames,\n\nPowers, the Town of Middletown, the Middletown police department,\n\nthe town's finance director, and several police officers (among\n\nthem, Officer Mitchell) as defendants.2     The municipal defendants\n\nremoved the case to the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island.    See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441(b).\n\n            In due course, the municipal defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.      The district court found\n\nprobable cause for the arrest and, accordingly, granted the motion.\n\nThis appeal ensued.\n\n            The summary judgment device enables a court \"to pierce\n\nthe boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in\n\norder to determine whether trial is actually required.\"     Wynne v.\n\nTufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992).    That\n\ndevice functions successfully when \"the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\n\nthe affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\n\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\n\n\n     2\n      Ames and Powers made only cameo appearances — Ames went into\nbankruptcy and Powers was never served — so we eschew any further\nreference to them, instead treating the municipal defendants as if\nthey were the sole targets of the suit. See, e.g., Sunview Condo.\nAss'n v. Flexel Int'l, Ltd., 116 F.3d 962, 963 n.1 (1st Cir. 1997)\n(taking a similar approach in analogous circumstances).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fas a matter of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).    Faced with a properly\n\ndocumented summary judgment motion, the nonmovant can thwart the\n\nmotion only by showing through materials of evidentiary quality\n\nthat a genuine dispute exists about some material fact.         Anderson\n\nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986); Medina-Munoz\n\nv. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st       Cir. 1990).   This\n\nevidence \"must have substance in the sense that it limns differing\n\nversions of the truth which a factfinder must resolve at an ensuing\n\ntrial.\"   Mack v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 181 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).\n\n           In assessing such a proffer, an inquiring court must\n\nresolve   all   evidentiary   conflicts   and   draw    all   reasonable\n\ninferences in the nonmovant's favor.      Id.   If the proffer, viewed\n\nthrough this prism, \"is merely colorable, or is not significantly\n\nprobative, summary judgment may be granted.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at\n\n249-50 (internal citations omitted).       In an ensuing appeal, we\n\nafford plenary review, Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822\n\n(1st Cir. 1991); Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st\n\nCir. 1990), utilizing the same criteria as the trial court, Perez\n\nv. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 310 (1st Cir. 2001); Werme v.\n\nMerrill, 84 F.3d 479, 482 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           We turn now from the general to the particular.       Before\n\nus, the appellant mounts a four-pronged attack on the district\n\ncourt's probable cause determination.      She contends (i) that the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fexistence vel non of probable cause is always for the jury (and,\n\nthus, not susceptible to summary judgment); (ii) that genuine\n\nissues   of    material     fact   preclude          judicial    resolution      of   the\n\nprobable cause      question       here;   (iii)       that     even    absent   such    a\n\ndispute, the facts of record do not support the lower court's\n\nprobable cause determination; and (iv) that, in all events, the\n\ndetermination was infirm because further investigation would have\n\ndispelled     the   basis    for    it.         We    discuss     these    contentions\n\nsequentially.\n\n              With respect to her first asseveration, the appellant\n\nrelies upon our decision in B.C.R. Transport Co. v. Fontaine, 727\n\nF.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1984).            That reliance is mislaid.                 In B.C.R.\n\nTransport, the defendant argued that probable cause necessarily\n\nexisted because a warrant, based upon information supplied by an\n\nalleged victim, had been obtained.               Id. at 9-10.          We rejected that\n\nbroad    proposition,     describing       the       probable     cause     inquiry     as\n\nsituation-specific. See id. at 10 (explaining that \"whether or not\n\nprobable cause exists . . . invariably depends on the particular\n\nfacts and circumstances of [each] case\").                 We went on to note that\n\nthe alleged victim was disoriented and ranting, and, accordingly,\n\nthe arresting officers needed to engage in further inquiry before\n\nrelying on that account to find probable cause.                    See id. at 10-11.\n\n              The appellant tries to ride this horse well past the\n\nboundary that we staked out in B.C.R. Transport. Although we ruled\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fthere that the issue of probable cause was for the jury, that\n\nruling was    not,   as   the   appellant   suggests,    intended    to   have\n\nuniversal    applicability.        The    outcome   in   B.C.R.     Transport\n\nrepresented the exception, not the rule. More relevant here is our\n\nrecent observation that \"it is pointless to submit . . . [a]\n\nprobable cause question[] to the jury at all unless the facts are\n\ndisputed.\"    Bolton v. Taylor, 367 F.3d 5, 8 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nsee also Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696 (1996)\n\n(explaining that when the relevant facts leading to the officer's\n\ninvolvement are established, probable cause is a \"mixed question of\n\nlaw and fact\" suitable for determination by the court); Bell v.\n\nIrwin, 321 F.3d 637, 640 (7th Cir.) (holding that the existence of\n\nprobable cause is ordinarily for the court, not for the jury),\n\ncert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 84 (2003).\n\n            In the case at hand, the material facts — what the police\n\nknew at the moment of the arrest, the source of their knowledge,\n\nand the leads that they pursued or eschewed — are not in dispute.\n\nWhen that is so, the existence vel non of probable cause ordinarily\n\nis amenable to summary judgment.         See, e.g., Roche v. John Hancock\n\nMut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 254-56 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming\n\nthe entry of summary judgment in such a situation).          The question,\n\nthen, is whether brevis disposition was appropriate on the facts of\n\nthis case.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          The appellant's second argument begins the dialogue on\n\nthat question. She hangs her hat primarily on the layaway receipt.\n\nThis need not detain us.      The dispute over the meaning of the\n\nlayaway receipt is, at bottom, merely whether the receipt fairly\n\nindicated to a reasonable officer that the appellant purchased two\n\nPatriots jackets on October 5.            Even were we to resolve this\n\nquestion in the appellant's favor, the fact that she bought two\n\njackets on October 5 would not change the outcome of the probable\n\ncause inquiry.\n\n          There are at least two conflicting inferences that could\n\nbe drawn from such a fact.    One possibility is that the appellant\n\nbought the coats in question and did not steal them.              Another is\n\nthat she bought two other coats on October 5, and was using the\n\nreceipt as a cover for a theft on October 18.        To resolve the issue\n\nof probable cause, it does not matter which inference is correct.\n\nIt is sufficient that a reasonable officer in possession of this\n\ninformation   might   nonetheless    find    it   likely   that   the   store\n\ndetective's eyewitness account was true and that the appellant had\n\ncommitted a crime.    See United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020,\n\n1023-24 (1st Cir. 1987).    In light of Powers's insistence that he\n\npersonally witnessed the theft, the exculpatory value of the\n\nreceipt is simply insufficient for us to conclude that Mitchell\n\ncould not reasonably have found probable cause.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f            The appellant's third line of attack directly challenges\n\nthe adequacy of the evidence on which the district court's probable\n\ncause determination was based.    That challenge requires us to limn\n\nthe analytic framework for probable cause determinations and then\n\nto apply that framework.\n\n            When there is probable cause for an arrest, the Fourth\n\nAmendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures\n\nis not offended.    Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 354 (2001);\n\nRoche, 81 F.3d at 254.     Probable cause for an arrest exists when\n\nthe   arresting    officer,   acting   upon   apparently   trustworthy\n\ninformation, reasonably concludes that a crime has been (or is\n\nabout to be) committed and that the putative arrestee likely is one\n\nof the perpetrators.     See Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964);\n\nFigueroa, 818 F.2d at 1023.    Courts use an objective standard when\n\ndetermining the existence of probable cause.      Valente v. Wallace,\n\n332 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 2003); Roche, 81 F.3d at 254.      The focus\n\nis not on certitude, but, rather, on the likelihood of criminal\n\nactivity.     See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 235 (1983);\n\nSpinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 419 (1969); United States\n\nv. Winchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 555 (1st Cir. 1999). Finally, courts\n\nmust apply these principles fluidly to the totality of the extant\n\ncircumstances. Gates, 462 U.S. at 232 & n.7; Winchenbach, 197 F.3d\n\nat 555.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            Here, the existence of probable cause depends, in the\n\nfirst instance, upon the cogency of the account given by the store\n\ndetective (Powers).     Taken at face value, Powers's tale certainly\n\ngave Officer Mitchell reason to believe that a crime had been\n\ncommitted and that the appellant had committed it.             The appellant\n\nnonetheless    argues   that   Mitchell     should    have   deemed   Powers's\n\nstatements unreliable (or, at least, suspect) because she had never\n\nmet   him   before   and,   thus,   could    not     accurately   assess   his\n\ncredibility.    That sets the bar too high.\n\n            Victims' complaints are a prime source of investigatory\n\ninformation for police officers.       In the absence of circumstances\n\nthat would raise a reasonably prudent officer's antennae, there is\n\nno requirement that the officer corroborate every aspect of every\n\ncomplaint with extrinsic information. The uncorroborated testimony\n\nof a victim or other percipient witness, standing alone, ordinarily\n\ncan support a finding of probable cause.               See, e.g., Forest v.\n\nPawtucket Police Dep't, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 03-\n\n2652, slip op. at 10] (stating that information furnished by a\n\nvictim is generally considered sufficiently reliable to support a\n\nfinding of probable cause); B.C.R. Transport, 727 F.2d at 10\n\n(same).     Although the victim here is a corporation communicating\n\nthrough its agent, the agent held himself out to be an eyewitness\n\nto the pilferage and rendered a coherent, facially plausible\n\naccount.    Consequently, we see no reason to treat Ames's complaint\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fof a crime, related through Powers, differently from any other\n\ncomplaint by a victim.\n\n            This conclusion is reinforced by Powers's status as a\n\nstore detective.     At least one respected court has gone so far as\n\nto recognize that, in the retail context, private security officers\n\nare inherently reliable. See Gramemos v. Jewel Cos., 797 F.2d 432,\n\n439 (7th Cir. 1986) (noting that several disincentives stemming\n\nfrom false crime reports collectively provide reason to infer that\n\nstore detectives are reliable).        While we hesitate to indulge in\n\nsweeping generalizations, we think that in this case Officer\n\nMitchell had every reason to believe that the store's security\n\nofficer was being truthful.\n\n            In an effort to undermine the credibility of Powers's\n\nstatements, the appellant points to three facts:               the layaway\n\nreceipt, the absence of any evidence of empty coat hangers or price\n\ntags for the jackets, and the \"used\" appearance of one of the\n\njackets.    In our estimation, none of these facts is telling.             As\n\nnoted above, the layaway receipt is at best equivocal.             As for the\n\nhangers and price tags, Mitchell never thought to ask for them —\n\nand it is therefore speculative whether or not they could have been\n\nfound. And, finally, the appearance of the spotted jacket actually\n\nmay   cut   the   other   way:   the   fact   that   the   spots    were   wet\n\ncontradicts the appellant's suggestion that they were old.                 The\n\nused kleenex in the pocket tells us nothing.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f              To cinch matters, the totality of the circumstances\n\nincludes far more than these isolated tidbits.                      Officer Mitchell\n\nspoke    first-hand     with       the    complaining     witness,    who    plausibly\n\nclaimed to have observed the entire incident.                        Mitchell had no\n\nreason to doubt that claim.                She then was told that one of the\n\njacket-wearers had admitted to having donned the jacket inside the\n\nstore.       Mitchell proceeded to speak to the appellant and got the\n\ngist    of    her   story:         that   she     previously   had    purchased     the\n\nmerchandise.         But the layaway receipt that she proffered was\n\nambiguous and gave the officer no reason to question Powers's\n\nveracity:      he was a percipient witness whose job responsibilities\n\ninvolved the very sort of observations that he was undertaking.\n\nHence, there was no reason for Mitchell not to rely on his\n\neyewitness version of events.               When an arresting officer has the\n\nbenefit of an apparently credible eyewitness account, the amount of\n\narguably exculpatory evidence must be substantial before further\n\ninvestigation can be required as a constitutional matter.                           The\n\nevidence here, if exculpatory at all, was far from substantial.\n\n              The   test     for    probable      cause   \"does   not   require     the\n\nofficers' conclusion to be ironclad, or even highly probable.\n\nTheir    conclusion        that     probable      cause    exists     need   only    be\n\nreasonable.\"        Winchenbach, 197 F.3d at 555-56.              In this case, the\n\nofficer passed that test with flying colors.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f          The appellant's last argument depends on a three-part\n\nalgorithm. She asserts that even if the investigation that Officer\n\nMitchell actually conducted created an aura of probable cause, the\n\ndistrict court's determination cannot stand because (i) the police\n\nhad a responsibility to continue investigating the matter; (ii)\n\nthey failed to do so; and (iii) had they not foregone this duty,\n\nthey would have dispelled the aura and learned that there was no\n\nprobable cause for an arrest.      In particular, the appellant posits\n\nthat the police should have interviewed the other Spanish-speaking\n\npersons who had accompanied her to the store, spoken with the store\n\nmanager, probed further into the significance (if any) of the\n\nlayaway receipt, and hunted for the hangers and price tags.\n\n             Probable    cause   determinations   are,    virtually     by\n\ndefinition, preliminary and tentative.       See, e.g., Barber v. Page,\n\n390 U.S. 719, 725 (1968).        Not surprisingly, then, the Supreme\n\nCourt has flatly rejected the idea that the police have a standing\n\nobligation    to   investigate   potential   defenses    before    finding\n\nprobable cause.         See Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 145-46\n\n(1979). Following this lead, we too have disclaimed any unflagging\n\nduty on the part of law enforcement officers to investigate fully\n\nbefore making a probable cause determination. See, e.g., Franco-de\n\nJerez v. Burgos, 876 F.2d 1038, 1042 (1st Cir. 1989).             While we\n\nhave recognized that such a duty may arise in highly idiosyncratic\n\ncircumstances, see, e.g., B.C.R. Transport, 727 F.2d at 10-11, we\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fhave made it clear that an officer normally may terminate her\n\ninvestigation   when   she   accumulates   facts     that    demonstrate\n\nsufficient probable cause.     See, e.g., Forest, ___ F.3d at ___\n\n[slip op. at 12]; Palhava de Varella-Cid v. Boston Five Cents\n\nSavings Bank, 787 F.2d 676, 680-81 (1st Cir. 1986).         The case law\n\nin other circuits is to the same effect.     See, e.g., Hodgkins v.\n\nPeterson, 355 F.3d 1048, 1061 (7th Cir. 2004); Brodnicki v. City of\n\nOmaha, 75 F.3d 1261, 1264 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\n          The rule, then, applicable in the wide mine-run of cases,\n\nis that once a law enforcement officer unearths sufficient facts to\n\nestablish probable cause, she has no constitutional duty either to\n\nexplore the possibility that exculpatory evidence may exist or to\n\nconduct any further investigation in the hope of finding such\n\nevidence. Because this case is well within the mine-run, we reject\n\nthe appellant's asseveration that the absence of a more complete\n\ninvestigation somehow undercuts the district court's acknowledgment\n\nof probable cause.\n\n          This disposes of the appellant's four-pronged attack on\n\nthe lower court's probable cause determination.         Looking at the\n\ntotality of the circumstances known to the police at the time of\n\nthe instant arrest, we find no fault with the district court's\n\nconclusion that probable cause existed.\n\n          Withal, our odyssey must continue.       The court below went\n\non to rule that the absence of probable cause doomed all the\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fappellant's claims.         The appellant assigns error to the breadth of\n\nthis ukase.\n\n              This assignment of error requires us first to parse the\n\namended complaint.          Eight of the counts are directed only at Ames\n\nand Powers, and, thus, need not concern us.             See supra note 2.        The\n\nremaining nine counts allege the following causes of action against\n\nsome or all of the municipal defendants:               four counts based on 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983,3 one count based on false arrest, one count based on\n\ngeneral negligence, two counts charging inflicting of emotional\n\ndistress, and one count based on vicarious liability. The two main\n\nsection 1983 claims were premised on alleged Fourth Amendment\n\nviolations, and so the district court's disposition of those counts\n\nwas    clearly       correct.     Given     probable    cause,     there   was      no\n\nconstitutional        violation   —   and    without   the    deprivation      of    a\n\nconstitutional right, those claims cannot proceed.                  See Roche, 81\n\nF.3d at 254.       The false arrest count also fails because a necessary\n\nelement of that claim is an illegal arrest.               See Mann v. Cannon,\n\n731 F.2d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 1984) (construing Rhode Island law).                      In\n\nthis case, the existence of probable cause rendered the arrest\n\nlegal.        By     like    token,   in    the   absence     of    a   false       or\n\nunconstitutional arrest, the two other section 1983 counts — both\n\nof    which    are    failure-to-train      counts,     see   supra     note    3   —\n\n\n\n      3\n      Two of these are \"deliberate indifference\" counts based on\nalleged failures properly to train police officers.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fnecessarily founder.    See Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1040 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (holding that a municipality cannot be liable for\n\nfailure to train under § 1983 absent an underlying constitutional\n\nviolation by one of its police officers).\n\n          That leaves only a motley of state-law tort counts.     A\n\ngeneral negligence count requires a plaintiff to show, at a bare\n\nminimum, a legally cognizable duty and a breach of that duty.   See\n\nMills v. State Sales, Inc., 824 A.2d 461, 467 (R.I. 2003); see also\n\nWelsh Mfg., Div. of Textron, Inc. v. Pinkerton's, Inc., 474 A.2d\n\n436, 440-41 (R.I. 1984).    Because the police acted reasonably in\n\nmaking their probable cause determination and had no duty to\n\ninvestigate further before arresting the appellant, see text supra,\n\nthe appellant has failed to establish the essential elements of her\n\ngeneral negligence claim.\n\n          The emotional distress counts fare no better.   There has\n\nbeen no demonstration of the \"extreme and outrageous conduct\"\n\nnecessary to prevail on a claim for intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress.    Jalowy v. Friendly Home, Inc., 818 A.2d 698,\n\n707 (R.I. 2003).       There has been no showing of the physical\n\nsymptomatology necessary to support a claim of negligent infliction\n\nof emotional distress.    See Reilly v. United States, 547 A.2d 894,\n\n899 (R.I. 1988).   And as the substantive state-law counts topple,\n\nso too does the count alleging vicarious liability.   See Boland v.\n\nTown of Tiverton, 670 A.2d 1245, 1248 (R.I. 1996).\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f            We need go no further.    While we do not minimize the\n\nunfortunate nature of the appellant's experience, there is no\n\nprincipled way on these facts to hold the municipal defendants\n\nliable in damages.    Consequently, the district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment merits our approbation.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f",

Glenn Powers worked as a store detective for Ames Department Stores, Inc. (Ames). On October 18, 1999, he called the Middletown, Rhode Island, police department to report a shoplifting at a local Ames emporium. Officer Kelly Mitchell responded to the call and Powers informed her that the appellant, her sons, and a group of other persons had entered the shop that evening. He watched the appellant take two jackets, emblazoned with the logo of the New England Patriots, from a rack and outfit her sons with them. He then surveilled the trio as they walked around the store and proceeded through the checkout line without making any attempt to pay for the jackets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Powers stopped the suspected shoplifters as soon as they left the premises. When he confronted them with the alleged larceny, one of the boys admitted that he had donned the jacket in the store.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once she had interviewed Powers, Officer Mitchell talked with the appellant. She found communication difficult because of a language barrier; Mitchell spoke no Spanish and the appellant lacked fluency in English. Nonetheless, Mitchell was able to glean the essence of the appellant's claim: that she had purchased the jackets on an earlier shopping trip. To bolster that claim, the appellant gave Mitchell a layaway receipt dated October 5, 1999. This receipt indicated that ten items had been rung up (including two labeled \"PATRIOTS OUT\" at a sale price of $22.41 each); that $49.94 had been paid toward a previous balance; and that the layaway was complete. The receipt did not indicate what \"PATRIOTS OUT\" meant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Mitchell then inspected the jackets. She observed a wet spot on one of them, consistent with what might appear if soda or juice had just been spilled on it. She also found a used tissue in a jacket pocket. At that point, Mitchell took the appellant into custody and charged her with shoplifting. Although at least one other officer had by then responded to the scene, the police did not converse with any other Ames personnel before effectuating the arrest. By the same token, they did not interview other customers (not even those persons who had originally accompanied the appellant to the store).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that need not concern us, the criminal charges were subsequently dropped. The incident, however, was not forgotten. The appellant brought suit in a Rhode Island state court alleging seventeen different causes of action against a myriad of defendants. The complaint, as amended, named Ames, Powers, the Town of Middletown, the Middletown police department, the town's finance director, and several police officers (among them, Officer Mitchell) as defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The municipal defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331, 1441(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the municipal defendants moved for summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The district court found probable cause for the arrest and, accordingly, granted the motion. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summary judgment device enables a court \"to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.\" <i>Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med.,</i> 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir.1992). That device functions successfully when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Faced with a properly documented summary judgment motion, the nonmovant can thwart the motion only by showing through materials of evidentiary quality that a genuine dispute exists about some material fact. <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <i>Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990).

In an ensuing appeal, we afford plenary review, <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.1991); <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990), utilizing the same criteria as the trial court, <i>Perez v. Volvo Car Corp.,</i> 247 F.3d 303, 310 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Werme v. Merrill,</i> 84 F.3d 479, 482 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now from the general to the particular. Before us, the appellant mounts a four-pronged attack on the district court's probable cause determination. She contends (i) that the existence vel non of probable cause is always for the jury (and, thus, not susceptible to summary judgment); (ii) that genuine issues of material fact preclude judicial resolution of the probable cause question here; (iii) that even absent such a dispute, the facts of record do not support the lower court's probable cause determination; and (iv) that, in all events, the determination was infirm because further investigation would have dispelled the basis for it. We discuss these contentions sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to her first asseveration, the appellant relies upon our decision in <i>B.C.R. Transport Co. v. Fontaine,</i> 727 F.2d 7 (1st Cir.1984). That reliance is mislaid. In <i>B.C.R. Transport,</i> the defendant argued that probable cause necessarily existed because a warrant, based upon information supplied by an alleged victim, had been obtained. <i>Id.</i> at 9-10. We rejected that broad proposition, describing the probable cause inquiry as situation-specific. <i>See id.</i> at 10 (explaining that \"whether or not probable cause exists ... invariably depends on the particular facts and circumstances of [each] case\"). We went on to note that the alleged victim was disoriented and ranting, and, accordingly, the arresting officers needed to engage in further inquiry before relying on that account to find probable cause. <i>See id.</i> at 10-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tries to ride this horse well past the boundary that we staked out in <i>B.C.R. Transport.</i> Although we ruled there that the issue of probable cause was for the jury, that ruling was not, as the appellant suggests, intended to have universal applicability. The outcome in <i>B.C.R. Transport</i> represented the exception, not the rule. More relevant here is our recent observation that \"it is pointless to submit ... [a] probable cause question[ ] to the jury at all unless the facts are disputed.\" <i>Bolton v. Taylor,</i> 367 F.3d 5, 8 n. 2 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (explaining that when the relevant facts leading to the officer's involvement are established, probable cause is a \"mixed question of law and fact\" suitable for determination by the court); <i>Bell v. Irwin,</i> 321 F.3d 637, 640 (7th Cir.) (holding that the existence of probable cause is ordinarily for the court, not for the jury), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 84, 157 L.Ed.2d 36 (2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the <i>material</i> facts &#8212; what the police knew at the moment of the arrest, the source of their knowledge, and the leads that they pursued or eschewed &#8212; are not in dispute. When that is so, the existence vel non of probable cause ordinarily is amenable to summary judgment. <i>See, e.g., Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 81 F.3d 249, 254-56 (1st Cir.1996) (affirming the entry of summary judgment in such a situation). The question, then, is whether brevis disposition was appropriate on the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second argument begins the dialogue on that question. She hangs her hat primarily on the layaway receipt. This need not detain us. The dispute over the meaning of the layaway receipt is, at bottom, merely whether the receipt fairly indicated to a reasonable officer that the appellant purchased two Patriots jackets on October 5. Even were we to resolve this question in the appellant's favor, the fact that she bought two jackets on October 5 would not change the outcome of the probable cause inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least two conflicting inferences that could be drawn from such a fact. One possibility is that the appellant bought the coats in question and did not steal them. Another is that she bought two other coats on October 5, and was using the receipt as a cover for a theft on October 18. To resolve the issue of probable cause, it does not matter which inference is correct. It is sufficient that a reasonable officer in possession of this information might nonetheless find it likely that the store detective's eyewitness account was true and that the appellant had committed a crime. <i>See United States v. Figueroa,</i> 818 F.2d 1020, 1023-24 (1st Cir.1987). In light of Powers's insistence that he personally witnessed the theft, the exculpatory value of the receipt is simply insufficient for us to conclude that Mitchell could not reasonably have found probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's third line of attack directly challenges the adequacy of the evidence on which the district court's probable cause determination was based. That challenge requires us to limn the analytic framework for probable cause determinations and then to apply that framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When there is probable cause for an arrest, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is not offended. <i>Atwater v. Lago Vista,</i> 532 U.S. 318, 354, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001); <i>Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254. Probable cause for an arrest exists when the arresting officer, acting upon apparently trustworthy information, reasonably concludes that a crime has been (or is about to be) committed and that the putative arrestee likely is one of the perpetrators. <i>See Beck v. Ohio,</i> 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964); <i>Figueroa,</i> 818 F.2d at 1023. Courts use an objective standard when determining the existence of probable cause. <i>Valente v. Wallace,</i> 332 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254. The focus is not on certitude, but, rather, on the likelihood of criminal activity. <i>See Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 235, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <i>Spinelli v. United States,</i> 393 U.S. 410, 419, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969); <i>United States v. Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d 548, 555 (1st Cir.1999). Finally, courts must apply these principles fluidly to the totality of the extant circumstances. <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 232 &amp; n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 2317; <i>Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d at 555.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the existence of probable cause depends, in the first instance, upon the cogency of the account given by the store detective (Powers). Taken at face value, Powers's tale certainly gave Officer Mitchell reason to believe that a crime had been committed and that the appellant had committed it. The appellant nonetheless argues that Mitchell should have deemed Powers's statements unreliable (or, at least, suspect) because she had never met him before and, thus, could not accurately assess his credibility. That sets the bar too high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Victims' complaints are a prime source of investigatory information for police officers. In the absence of circumstances that would raise a reasonably prudent officer's antennae, there is no requirement that the officer corroborate every aspect of every complaint with extrinsic information. The uncorroborated testimony of a victim or other percipient witness, standing alone, ordinarily can support a finding of probable cause. <i>See, e.g., Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep't,</i> 377 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir.2004) [No. 03-2652, slip op. at 10] (stating that information furnished by a victim is generally considered sufficiently reliable to support a finding of probable cause); <i>B.C.R. Transport,</i> 727 F.2d at 10 (same). Although the victim here is a corporation communicating through its agent, the agent held himself out to be an eyewitness to the pilferage and rendered a coherent, facially plausible account. Consequently, we see no reason to treat Ames's complaint of a crime, related through Powers, differently from any other complaint by a victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by Powers's status as a store detective. At least one respected court has gone so far as to recognize that, in the retail context, private security officers are inherently reliable. <i>See Gramenos v. Jewel Cos.,</i> 797 F.2d 432, 439 (7th Cir.1986) (noting that several disincentives stemming from false crime reports collectively provide reason to infer that store detectives are reliable). While we hesitate to indulge in sweeping generalizations, we think that in this case Officer Mitchell had every reason to believe that the store's security officer was being truthful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to undermine the credibility of Powers's statements, the appellant points to three facts: the layaway receipt, the absence of any evidence of empty coat hangers or price tags for the jackets, and the \"used\" appearance of one of the jackets. In our estimation, none of these facts is telling. As noted above, the layaway receipt is at best equivocal. As for the hangers and price tags, Mitchell never thought to ask for them &#8212; and it is therefore speculative whether or not they could have been found. And, finally, the appearance of the spotted jacket actually may cut the other way: the fact that the spots were wet contradicts the appellant's suggestion that they were old. The used kleenex in the pocket tells us nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the totality of the circumstances includes far more than these isolated tidbits. Officer Mitchell spoke first-hand with the complaining witness, who plausibly claimed to have observed the entire incident. Mitchell had no reason to doubt that claim. She then was told that one of the jacket-wearers had admitted to having donned the jacket inside the store. Mitchell proceeded to speak to the appellant and got the gist of her story: that she previously had purchased the merchandise. But the layaway receipt that she proffered was ambiguous and gave the officer no reason to question Powers's veracity: he was a percipient witness whose job responsibilities involved the very sort of observations that he was undertaking. Hence, there was no reason for Mitchell not to rely on his eyewitness version of events. When an arresting officer has the benefit of an apparently credible eyewitness account, the amount of arguably exculpatory evidence must be substantial before further investigation can be required as a constitutional matter. The evidence here, if exculpatory at all, was far from substantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test for probable cause \"does not require the officers' conclusion to be ironclad, or even highly probable. Their conclusion that probable cause exists need only be reasonable.\" <i>Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d at 555-56. In this case, the officer passed that test with flying colors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's last argument depends on a three-part algorithm. She asserts that even if the investigation that Officer Mitchell actually conducted created an aura of probable cause, the district court's determination cannot stand because (i) the police had a responsibility to continue investigating the matter; (ii) they failed to do so; and (iii) had they not foregone this duty, they would have dispelled the aura and learned that there was no probable cause for an arrest. In particular, the appellant posits that the police should have interviewed the other Spanish-speaking persons who had accompanied her to the store, spoken with the store manager, probed further into the significance (if any) of the layaway receipt, and hunted for the hangers and price tags.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause determinations are, virtually by definition, preliminary and tentative. <i>See, e.g., Barber v. Page,</i> 390 U.S. 719, 725, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968). Not surprisingly, then, the Supreme Court has flatly rejected the idea that the police have a standing obligation to investigate potential defenses before finding probable cause. <i>See Baker v. McCollan,</i> 443 U.S. 137, 145-46, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). Following this lead, we too have disclaimed any unflagging duty on the part of law enforcement officers to investigate fully before making a probable cause determination. <i>See, e.g., Franco-de Jerez v. Burgos,</i> 876 F.2d 1038, 1042 (1st Cir.1989). While we have recognized that such a duty may arise in highly idiosyncratic circumstances, <i>see, e.g., B.C.R. Transport,</i> 727 F.2d at 10-11, we have made it clear that an officer normally may terminate her investigation when she accumulates facts that demonstrate sufficient probable cause. <i>See, e.g., Forest,</i> 377 F.3d at 57 [slip op. at 12]; <i>Palhava de Varella-Cid v. Boston Five Cents Savings Bank,</i> 787 F.2d 676, 680-81 (1st Cir.1986). The case law in other circuits is to the same effect. <i>See, e.g., Hodgkins v. Peterson,</i> 355 F.3d 1048, 1061 (7th Cir.2004); <i>Brodnicki v. City of Omaha,</i> 75 F.3d 1261, 1264 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule, then, applicable in the wide mine-run of cases, is that once a law enforcement officer unearths sufficient facts to establish probable cause, she has no constitutional duty either to explore the possibility that exculpatory evidence may exist or to conduct any further investigation in the hope of finding such evidence. Because this case is well within the mine-run, we reject the appellant's asseveration that the absence of a more complete investigation somehow undercuts the district court's acknowledgment of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This disposes of the appellant's four-pronged attack on the lower court's probable cause determination. Looking at the totality of the circumstances known to the police at the time of the instant arrest, we find no fault with the district court's conclusion that probable cause existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withal, our odyssey must continue. The court below went on to rule that the absence of probable cause doomed <i>all</i> the appellant's claims. The appellant assigns error to the breadth of this ukase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assignment of error requires us first to parse the amended complaint. Eight of the counts are directed only at Ames and Powers, and, thus, need not concern us. <i>See supra</i> note 2. The remaining nine counts allege the following causes of action against some or all of the municipal defendants: four counts based on 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> one count based on false arrest, one count based on general negligence, two counts charging inflicting of emotional distress, and one count based on vicarious liability. The two main section 1983 claims were premised on alleged Fourth Amendment violations, and so the district court's disposition of those counts was clearly correct. Given probable cause, there was no constitutional violation &#8212; and without the deprivation of a constitutional right, those claims cannot proceed. <i>See Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254. The false arrest count also fails because a necessary element of that claim is an illegal arrest. <i>See Mann v. Cannon,</i> 731 F.2d 54, 62 (1st Cir.1984) (construing Rhode Island law). In this case, the existence of probable cause rendered the arrest legal. By like token, in the absence of a false or unconstitutional arrest, the two other section 1983 counts &#8212; both of which are failure-to-train counts, <i>see supra</i> note 3 &#8212; necessarily founder. <i>See Evans v. Avery,</i> 100 F.3d 1033, 1040 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that a municipality cannot be liable for failure to train under &#167; 1983 absent an underlying constitutional violation by one of its police officers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves only a motley of state-law tort counts. A general negligence count requires a plaintiff to show, at a bare minimum, a legally cognizable duty and a breach of that duty. <i>See Mills v. State Sales, Inc.,</i> 824 A.2d 461, 467 (R.I.2003); <i>see also Welsh Mfg., Div. of Textron, Inc. v. Pinkerton's, Inc.,</i> 474 A.2d 436, 440-41 (R.I.1984). Because the police acted reasonably in making their probable cause determination and had no duty to investigate further before arresting the appellant, <i>see</i> text <i>supra,</i> the appellant has failed to establish the essential elements of her general negligence claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The emotional distress counts fare no better. There has been no demonstration of the \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" necessary to prevail on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <i>Jalowy v. Friendly Home, Inc.,</i> 818 A.2d 698, 707 (R.I.2003). There has been no showing of the physical symptomatology necessary to support a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress. <i>See Reilly v. United States,</i> 547 A.2d 894, 899 (R.I.1988). And as the substantive state-law counts topple, so too does the count alleging vicarious liability. <i>See Boland v. Town of Tiverton,</i> 670 A.2d 1245, 1248 (R.I.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. While we do not minimize the unfortunate nature of the appellant's experience, there is no principled way on these facts to hold the municipal defendants liable in damages.

Glenn Powers worked as a store detective for Ames Department Stores, Inc. (Ames). On October 18, 1999, he called the Middletown, Rhode Island, police department to report a shoplifting at a local Ames emporium. Officer Kelly Mitchell responded to the call and Powers informed her that the appellant, her sons, and a group of other persons had entered the shop that evening. He watched the appellant take two jackets, emblazoned with the logo of the New England Patriots, from a rack and outfit her sons with them. He then surveilled the trio as they walked around the store and proceeded through the checkout line without making any attempt to pay for the jackets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Powers stopped the suspected shoplifters as soon as they left the premises. When he confronted them with the alleged larceny, one of the boys admitted that he had donned the jacket in the store.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once she had interviewed Powers, Officer Mitchell talked with the appellant. She found communication difficult because of a language barrier; Mitchell spoke no Spanish and the appellant lacked fluency in English. Nonetheless, Mitchell was able to glean the essence of the appellant's claim: that she had purchased the jackets on an earlier shopping trip. To bolster that claim, the appellant gave Mitchell a layaway receipt dated October 5, 1999. This receipt indicated that ten items had been rung up (including two labeled \"PATRIOTS OUT\" at a sale price of $22.41 each); that $49.94 had been paid toward a previous balance; and that the layaway was complete. The receipt did not indicate what \"PATRIOTS OUT\" meant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Mitchell then inspected the jackets. She observed a wet spot on one of them, consistent with what might appear if soda or juice had just been spilled on it. She also found a used tissue in a jacket pocket. At that point, Mitchell took the appellant into custody and charged her with shoplifting. Although at least one other officer had by then responded to the scene, the police did not converse with any other Ames personnel before effectuating the arrest. By the same token, they did not interview other customers (not even those persons who had originally accompanied the appellant to the store).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that need not concern us, the criminal charges were subsequently dropped. The incident, however, was not forgotten. The appellant brought suit in a Rhode Island state court alleging seventeen different causes of action against a myriad of defendants. The complaint, as amended, named Ames, Powers, the Town of Middletown, the Middletown police department, the town's finance director, and several police officers (among them, Officer Mitchell) as defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The municipal defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331, 1441(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the municipal defendants moved for summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.

Before us, the appellant mounts a four-pronged attack on the district court's probable cause determination. She contends (i) that the existence vel non of probable cause is always for the jury (and, thus, not susceptible to summary judgment); (ii) that genuine issues of material fact preclude judicial resolution of the probable cause question here; (iii) that even absent such a dispute, the facts of record do not support the lower court's probable cause determination; and (iv) that, in all events, the determination was infirm because further investigation would have dispelled the basis for it. We discuss these contentions sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to her first asseveration, the appellant relies upon our decision in <i>B.C.R. Transport Co. v. Fontaine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430971\"><a href=\"/opinion/430971/bcr-transport-co-inc-v-norman-fontaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1984). That reliance is mislaid. In <i>B.C.R. Transport,</i> the defendant argued that probable cause necessarily existed because a warrant, based upon information supplied by an alleged victim, had been obtained. <i>Id.</i> at 9-10. We rejected that broad proposition, describing the probable cause inquiry as situation-specific. <i>See id.</i> at 10 (explaining that \"whether or not probable cause exists ... invariably depends on the particular facts and circumstances of [each] case\"). We went on to note that the alleged victim was disoriented and ranting, and, accordingly, the arresting officers needed to engage in further inquiry before relying on that account to find probable cause. <i>See id.</i> at 10-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tries to ride this horse well past the boundary that we staked out in <i>B.C.R. Transport.</i> Although we ruled there that the issue of probable cause was for the jury, that ruling was not, as the appellant suggests, intended to have universal applicability. The outcome in <i>B.C.R. Transport</i> represented the exception, not the rule. More relevant here is our recent observation that \"it is pointless to submit ...

When that is so, the existence vel non of probable cause ordinarily is amenable to summary judgment. <i>See, e.g., Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716599\"><a href=\"/opinion/716599/daniel-j-roche-et-ux-valerie-roche-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 254-56 (1st Cir.1996) (affirming the entry of summary judgment in such a situation). The question, then, is whether brevis disposition was appropriate on the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second argument begins the dialogue on that question. She hangs her hat primarily on the layaway receipt. This need not detain us. The dispute over the meaning of the layaway receipt is, at bottom, merely whether the receipt fairly indicated to a reasonable officer that the appellant purchased two Patriots jackets on October 5. Even were we to resolve this question in the appellant's favor, the fact that she bought two jackets on October 5 would not change the outcome of the probable cause inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least two conflicting inferences that could be drawn from such a fact. One possibility is that the appellant bought the coats in question and did not steal them. Another is that she bought two other coats on October 5, and was using the receipt as a cover for a theft on October 18. To resolve the issue of probable cause, it does not matter which inference is correct.

Taken at face value, Powers's tale certainly gave Officer Mitchell reason to believe that a crime had been committed and that the appellant had committed it. The appellant nonetheless argues that Mitchell should have deemed Powers's statements unreliable (or, at least, suspect) because she had never met him before and, thus, could not accurately assess his credibility. That sets the bar too high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Victims' complaints are a prime source of investigatory information for police officers. In the absence of circumstances that would raise a reasonably prudent officer's antennae, there is no requirement that the officer corroborate every aspect of every complaint with extrinsic information. The uncorroborated testimony of a victim or other percipient witness, standing alone, ordinarily can support a finding of probable cause. <i>See, e.g., Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201160\"><a href=\"/opinion/201160/forest-v-pawtucket-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2004) [No. 03-2652, slip op. at 10] (stating that information furnished by a victim is generally considered sufficiently reliable to support a finding of probable cause); <i>B.C.R. Transport,</i> 727 F.2d at 10 (same). Although the victim here is a corporation communicating through its agent, the agent held himself out to be an eyewitness to the pilferage and rendered a coherent, facially plausible account. Consequently, we see no reason to treat Ames's complaint of a crime, related through Powers, differently from any other complaint by a victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by Powers's status as a store detective. At least one respected court has gone so far as to recognize that, in the retail context, private security officers are inherently reliable. <i>See Gramenos v. Jewel Cos.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474259\"><a href=\"/opinion/474259/james-n-gramenos-v-jewel-companies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 439 (7th Cir.1986) (noting that several disincentives stemming from false crime reports collectively provide reason to infer that store detectives are reliable). While we hesitate to indulge in sweeping generalizations, we think that in this case Officer Mitchell had every reason to believe that the store's security officer was being truthful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to undermine the credibility of Powers's statements, the appellant points to three facts: the layaway receipt, the absence of any evidence of empty coat hangers or price tags for the jackets, and the \"used\" appearance of one of the jackets. In our estimation, none of these facts is telling. As noted above, the layaway receipt is at best equivocal. As for the hangers and price tags, Mitchell never thought to ask for them &#8212; and it is therefore speculative whether or not they could have been found. And, finally, the appearance of the spotted jacket actually may cut the other way: the fact that the spots were wet contradicts the appellant's suggestion that they were old. The used kleenex in the pocket tells us nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the totality of the circumstances includes far more than these isolated tidbits. Officer Mitchell spoke first-hand with the complaining witness, who plausibly claimed to have observed the entire incident. Mitchell had no reason to doubt that claim. She then was told that one of the jacket-wearers had admitted to having donned the jacket inside the store. Mitchell proceeded to speak to the appellant and got the gist of her story: that she previously had purchased the merchandise. But the layaway receipt that she proffered was ambiguous and gave the officer no reason to question Powers's veracity: he was a percipient witness whose job responsibilities involved the very sort of observations that he was undertaking. Hence, there was no reason for Mitchell not to rely on his eyewitness version of events. When an arresting officer has the benefit of an apparently credible eyewitness account, the amount of arguably exculpatory evidence must be substantial before further investigation can be required as a constitutional matter. The evidence here, if exculpatory at all, was far from substantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test for probable cause \"does not require the officers' conclusion to be ironclad, or even highly probable. Their conclusion that probable cause exists need only be reasonable.\" <i>Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d at 555-56. In this case, the officer passed that test with flying colors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's last argument depends on a three-part algorithm. She asserts that even if the investigation that Officer Mitchell actually conducted created an aura of probable cause, the district court's determination cannot stand because (i) the police had a responsibility to continue investigating the matter; (ii) they failed to do so; and (iii) had they not foregone this duty, they would have dispelled the aura and learned that there was no probable cause for an arrest. In particular, the appellant posits that the police should have interviewed the other Spanish-speaking persons who had accompanied her to the store, spoken with the store manager, probed further into the significance (if any) of the layaway receipt, and hunted for the hangers and price tags.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause determinations are, virtually by definition, preliminary and tentative. <i>See, e.g., Barber v. Page,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107668\"><a href=\"/opinion/107668/barber-v-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 725, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107668\"><a href=\"/opinion/107668/barber-v-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span> (1968). Not surprisingly, then, the Supreme Court has flatly rejected the idea that the police have a standing obligation to investigate potential defenses before finding probable cause. <i>See Baker v. McCollan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110132\"><a href=\"/opinion/110132/baker-v-mccollan/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 145-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110132\"><a href=\"/opinion/110132/baker-v-mccollan/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span> (1979). Following this lead, we too have disclaimed any unflagging duty on the part of law enforcement officers to investigate fully before making a probable cause determination. <i>See, e.g., Franco-de Jerez v. Burgos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524622\"><a href=\"/opinion/524622/lillian-j-del-carmen-franco-de-jerez-v-filomeno-burgos/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1038</span></a></span>, 1042 (1st Cir.1989). While we have recognized that such a duty may arise in highly idiosyncratic circumstances, <i>see, e.g., B.C.R. Transport,</i> 727 F.2d at 10-11, we have made it clear that an officer normally may terminate her investigation when she accumulates facts that demonstrate sufficient probable cause. <i>See, e.g., Forest,</i> 377 F.3d at 57 [slip op. at 12]; <i>Palhava de Varella-Cid v. Boston Five Cents Savings Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468091\"><a href=\"/opinion/468091/ana-maria-caeiro-palhava-de-varella-cid-v-the-boston-five-cents-savings/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 680-81 (1st Cir.1986). The case law in other circuits is to the same effect. <i>See, e.g., Hodgkins v. Peterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784830\"><a href=\"/opinion/784830/nancy-hodgkins-colin-hodgkins-and-caroline-hodgkins-by-their-next-friend/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span>, 1061 (7th Cir.2004); <i>Brodnicki v.

Because this case is well within the mine-run, we reject the appellant's asseveration that the absence of a more complete investigation somehow undercuts the district court's acknowledgment of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This disposes of the appellant's four-pronged attack on the lower court's probable cause determination. Looking at the totality of the circumstances known to the police at the time of the instant arrest, we find no fault with the district court's conclusion that probable cause existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withal, our odyssey must continue. The court below went on to rule that the absence of probable cause doomed <i>all</i> the appellant's claims. The appellant assigns error to the breadth of this ukase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assignment of error requires us first to parse the amended complaint. Eight of the counts are directed only at Ames and Powers, and, thus, need not concern us. <i>See supra</i> note 2. The remaining nine counts allege the following causes of action against some or all of the municipal defendants: four counts based on 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> one count based on false arrest, one count based on general negligence, two counts charging inflicting of emotional distress, and one count based on vicarious liability. The two main section 1983 claims were premised on alleged Fourth Amendment violations, and so the district court's disposition of those counts was clearly correct. Given probable cause, there was no constitutional violation &#8212; and without the deprivation of a constitutional right, those claims cannot proceed. <i>See Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254. The false arrest count also fails because a necessary element of that claim is an illegal arrest. <i>See Mann v. Cannon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433519\"><a href=\"/opinion/433519/lewis-mann-do-v-joseph-e-cannon-md-lewis-mann-do-v-joseph-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.1984) (construing Rhode Island law). In this case, the existence of probable cause rendered the arrest legal. By like token, in the absence of a false or unconstitutional arrest, the two other section 1983 counts &#8212; both of which are failure-to-train counts, <i>see supra</i> note 3 &#8212; necessarily founder. <i>See Evans v. Avery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197095\"><a href=\"/opinion/197095/evans-v-avery/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1033</span></a></span>, 1040 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that a municipality cannot be liable for failure to train under &#167; 1983 absent an underlying constitutional violation by one of its police officers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves only a motley of state-law tort counts. A general negligence count requires a plaintiff to show, at a bare minimum, a legally cognizable duty and a breach of that duty. <i>See Mills v. State Sales, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1892985\"><a href=\"/opinion/1892985/mills-v-state-sales-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 467 (R.I.2003); <i>see also Welsh Mfg., Div. of Textron, Inc. v.

Because the police acted reasonably in making their probable cause determination and had no duty to investigate further before arresting the appellant, <i>see</i> text <i>supra,</i> the appellant has failed to establish the essential elements of her general negligence claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The emotional distress counts fare no better.
