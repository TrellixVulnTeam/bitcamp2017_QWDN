Richard G.

Appellant, a prison inmate acting pro se,\n\nchallenges the district court's denial of his motion for leave to\n\nfile a late notice of appeal from the judgment entered in favor of\n\ndefendants in his civil rights action filed under 42 U.S.C. 1983.\n\nWe review the denial of a motion for leave to file a late notice of\n\nappeal for abuse of discretion.   See Mirpuri v. Act Mfg., Inc., 212\n\nF.3d 624, 627 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Appellant argues that he was unable to file a timely\n\nappeal because he did not receive notice of the final judgment\n\nentered April 1, 2003, until August 2005.     Where a party has not\n\nreceived notice of the entry of a judgment, the thirty-day appeal\n\nperiod provided in Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) may be re-opened for\n\na fourteen-day period, but only when the motion to reopen \"is filed\n\nwithin 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7\n\ndays after the moving party receives notice . . . [of entry],\n\nwhichever is earlier; and . . . the court finds that no party would\n\nbe prejudiced.\" Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). Since appellant's motion\n\nwas filed well beyond the 180-day period in which a motion to\n\nreopen would have been permitted, this exception is of no help to\n\nhim.\n\n          To the extent appellant suggests that the district\n\ncourt should have entered his motion to reopen nunc pro tunc, his\n\nargument is unavailing because, even assuming, arguendo, that the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdistrict court had authority to follow such a procedure, it did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in declining to do so given its finding\n\nthat appellant had failed to fulfill his duty to diligently\n\nmonitor the docket.    See Mirpuri, 212 F.3d at 631; Witty v.\n\nDukakis, 3 F.3d 517, 520 (1st Cir. 1993).   See also Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 77(d) (\"[l]ack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not\n\naffect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to\n\nrelieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed\").\n\n          Affirmed.
