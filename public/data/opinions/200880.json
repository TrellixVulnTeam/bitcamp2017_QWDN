Two conservation groups challenge\n\nadverse summary judgment rulings in an action alleging violations\n\nof the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act\n\n(the Magnuson-Stevens Act), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1851, 1853, 1854, and the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (the “APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 706.\n\nConservation Law Foundation (“CLF”) and Oceana (f/k/a American\n\nOceans Campaign) allege that in implementing Framework Adjustment\n\n14 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan (“Framework\n\n14\"), the National Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”) and other\n\nfederal defendants1 failed to meet their procedural and substantive\n\nobligations under governing law.     The district court found that\n\nFramework 14 was lawful.   We affirm.\n\n             I.    Factual and Procedural Background\n\n          On May 31, 2001, the plaintiffs initiated an action\n\nchallenging Framework 14, a rule that adjusted certain restrictions\n\non sea scallop fishing in the Atlantic coastal waters.2        The\n\n\n     1\n      The plaintiffs also sued Donald Evans, in his official\ncapacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce,\nand the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”).\nThe Secretary of Commerce is the chief officer charged with\nmanaging the marine fisheries of the United States. NOAA is an\nagency within the Department of Commerce, and NMFS is a part of\nNOAA. Except where otherwise indicated, the federal defendants are\nreferred to collectively as “NMFS.”\n     2\n      In 1976, in effort to prevent overfishing, the Magnuson-\nStevens Act created eight regional councils charged with developing\nfishery management plans to regulate commercial fishing of local\nfish stocks. See Associated Fisheries of Maine v. Daley, 127 F.3d\n104, 106 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing 16 U.S.C. § 1852).         The New\nEngland Fishery Management Council (the “Council”) manages the\n\n                               -3-\n\fplaintiffs      challenged   Framework    14   on   both   substantive   and\n\nprocedural grounds.      First, they alleged that NMFS failed to meet\n\nits substantive management obligations under the Magnuson-Stevens\n\nAct, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1851(a)(9), 1853(a)(7) & (a)(11), and the APA.3\n\nSecond, they claimed that NMFS’s failure to provide a 15-day public\n\ncomment period violated the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. §\n\n1854(b), and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 706(2)(D).            The plaintiffs\n\nasked the district court to declare Framework 14 in violation of\n\nthe governing statutes and to “remand” it with the requirement that\n\nNMFS remedy the alleged deficiencies. They also sought their fees,\n\ncosts, and expenses.\n\n              In September 2001, the parties submitted to the district\n\ncourt a joint proposal for briefing and discovery.          See Local Rule\n\n16.1.       In the proposal, the plaintiffs requested that the court\n\n\n\n\nAtlantic sea scallop fishery, which extends from Maine to North\nCarolina. The Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan was\ncreated in 1982, and since has been amended several times.      In\n1993, Amendment 4 to the scallop FMP established a procedure\nwhereby management measures could be altered through so-called\n“framework adjustments” to respond to the changing needs of the\nfishery. This procedure allowed the Council to develop, over the\ncourse of two public Council meetings, a framework adjustment that\nis submitted to the Regional Administrator of NMFS for review.\nUpon approval of the Regional Administrator, the framework\nadjustment becomes a final rule. See 50 C.F.R. § 648.55 (setting\nforth framework adjustment procedures).\n        3\n      The plaintiffs also alleged violations of the National\nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-4347.\nThe district court rejected these claims, and the plaintiffs have\nnot pursued them on appeal.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fexpedite the case pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 1855(f)(4).4               Over the\n\nnext few months, the parties filed cross motions for summary\n\njudgment.5      The district court heard argument on the motions in May\n\n2002.      By    September   2002,   no   decision   had   issued,   and   the\n\nplaintiffs renewed their request to expedite the case, alerting the\n\ncourt to the fact that Framework 14 would expire by its own terms\n\nin March 2003.\n\n             On October 31, 2002, the district court denied the\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants’\n\nmotions.     See Conservation Law Found. v. United States Dep’t of\n\nCommerce, 229 F. Supp. 2d 29 (D. Mass. 2002).         The court found that\n\nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act did not mandate public comment for a rule\n\nsuch as Framework 14 and that the public comment period required\n\nunder the APA had been waived for good cause.          See id. at 34 n.10.\n\nThe court also concluded that NMFS had considered the substantive\n\nissues raised by the plaintiffs and did not act arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously in implementing Framework 14.            See id. at 34.       The\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Section 1855(f)(4) provides: “Upon a motion by the person who\nfiles a petition under this subsection, the appropriate court shall\nassign the matter for hearing at the earliest possible date and\nshall expedite the matter in every possible way.”\n     5\n      Appellant Fisheries Survival Fund (“FSF”) intervened as a\ndefendant in the underlying action on September 10, 2001. FSF is\nan organization of Atlantic sea scallop fishermen.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fplaintiffs appealed.          On March 1, 2003, while this appeal was\n\npending, Framework 14 was superseded by Framework 15.6\n\n                                II.     Analysis\n\nA.          Mootness\n\n            We turn first to the question of mootness.                   See Roe v.\n\nWade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973) (“The usual rule in federal cases is\n\nthat an actual controversy must exist at stages of appellate or\n\ncertiorari review, and not simply at the date the action is\n\ninitiated.”).       The defendants contend that the expiration of\n\nFramework    14    rendered    this     case   moot.       See    Gulf    of   Maine\n\nFishermen’s Alliance v. Daley, 292 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2002).                  As\n\nthe parties invoking the mootness doctrine, the defendants bear a\n\n“heavy”   burden    in     attempting    to    establish    its   applicability.\n\nMangual v. Rotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45, 61 (1st Cir. 2003).                       And\n\nshould    they    merely    cease   voluntarily     the    conduct       originally\n\nchallenged, they must demonstrate that it is “absolutely clear that\n\nthe allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to\n\nrecur.” Id. (citing United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export\n\nAss’n, Inc., 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)).\n\n            The defendants attempt to carry this burden with respect\n\nto both of the plaintiffs’ claims by citing to Gulf of Maine, a\n\ncase in which we affirmed the district court’s finding of mootness\n\n\n\n     6\n      Framework 15 expires on March 1, 2004.                 See 68 Fed. Reg.\n9580, 9581 (Feb. 28, 2003).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fwhere a challenged framework affecting groundfish was superseded\n\nwhile cross motions for summary judgment were pending.                        See 292\n\nF.3d at 87.    In that case, an organization of commercial fishermen\n\nalleged that a framework was both procedurally deficient for lack\n\nof adequate notice and comment and substantively unlawful because\n\nof its closure of inshore fishing areas.                  See id.    The appellant\n\nurged us to find that the alleged harms continued, despite the\n\npromulgation      of   subsequent     frameworks,         and   that    the    issues\n\ntherefore were not moot.             See id. at 88.             We rejected that\n\nargument, concluding that the promulgation of a new framework in\n\ncompliance    with     procedural    guidelines       and    based     on   new   data\n\nrendered the challenges to the superseded framework moot.                      See id.\n\n           CLF and Oceana respond with arguments similar to those\n\nmade by the appellant in Gulf of Maine.               As to their substantive\n\nchallenge to Framework 14, they contend that the harms caused by\n\nNMFS’s failure to close the four fishing areas were perpetuated\n\nthrough Framework 15. This, they say, means that their substantive\n\nclaim   remains      live,   and    for    support    they      rely    heavily    on\n\nNortheastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors\n\nof America v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656 (1993).                      There, a\n\nchallenged    ordinance      that    accorded      preferential        treatment   to\n\nminority businesses for city contracts was repealed and replaced\n\nwith a modified version weeks after the Supreme Court had granted\n\ncertiorari.       See id.     at    660-61      (noting   three     alterations    in\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fordinance,       including   adoption   of   five-   to    sixteen-percent\n\n“participation goals” in place of ten percent “set-aside” of city\n\ncontracts earmarked for minority businesses).        These modifications\n\nwere not enough to render the controversy moot.           The Supreme Court\n\nconcluded that “[t]here is no mere risk that [the city] will repeat\n\nits allegedly wrongful conduct; it has already done so.”            Id. at\n\n662.       The analogy to Northeastern Florida is useful here.\n\n               On its face, Framework 15 is largely an extension of\n\nFramework 14.       See Fed. Reg. 9580, 9581 (Feb. 28, 2003) (noting\n\nthat Framework 15's only modification of the management measures\n\nthat previously had been in effect was an increase in certain\n\nlimits on the amount of scallops that could be held on board a\n\nfishing vessel).        And as a practical matter, it appears that\n\nFramework 15 was designed merely to maintain the status quo until\n\nNMFS could complete a more comprehensive overhaul of its management\n\nmeasures through an amendment to the scallop FMP.7             NMFS states\n\nthat Framework 15 is based on entirely new data about the condition\n\n\n\n       7\n           Framework 15's scope was described in the Federal Register:\n\n               Framework 15 was developed during the later\n               stages of development of Amendment 10 to the\n               FMP . . . because it was clear that Amendment\n               10 would not be implemented by the start of\n               the   2003   fishing  year   and,   therefore,\n               Framework 15 is considered to be an action of\n               limited scope, which is intended to be a stop-\n               gap measure until Amendment 10 is implemented.\n\n68 Fed. Reg. 9580, 9581 (Feb. 28, 2003).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fof the scallop resource, NMFS Br. at 23, 27-28; cf. Gulf of Maine,\n\n292 F.3d at 88, but it identifies no portion of the record to\n\nsupport this assertion.    See Mulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co., 335\n\nF.3d 15, 28 (1st Cir. 2003) (declining to consider argument where\n\nlitigant “ma[de] no attempt either to marshal the pertinent facts\n\nor to engage in reasoned analysis”); see also United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (“[I]ssues adverted to in\n\na perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.”). In any event, we have studied\n\nthe record with care and cannot tell whether and to what extent\n\nFramework 15 was developed with new underlying data. Consequently,\n\nwe cannot say that the challenged conduct will not recur or has not\n\nalready recurred.   See Northeastern Florida, 508 U.S. at 662.\n\n          Whether we characterize the expiration of Framework 14 as\n\na “voluntary cessation” of conduct by NMFS subject to the same\n\nstandards as in Northeastern Florida, the core question Article III\n\ncompels us to ask is whether our adjudication of the issue can\n\ngrant meaningful relief.   Cf. Gulf of Maine, 292 F.3d at 88.   Here,\n\nit appears that the same allegedly harmful scheme continues.      No\n\nmatter how the issue is framed, we have no difficulty concluding\n\nthat, where a challenged regulation continues to the extent that it\n\nis only superficially altered by a subsequent regulation, we are\n\ncapable of meaningful review.   See Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253,\n\n257 n.2 (1984) (concluding that changes in general statutory scheme\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fdid not moot challenge where contested provision remained the\n\nsame); Brockington v. Rhodes, 396 U.S. 41, 43 (1969) (per curiam)\n\n(finding that suit attacking requirement that nominating petitions\n\nbe signed by seven percent of voters on ground that no more than\n\none percent could be required was not mooted by new statute\n\nreducing signature requirement to four percent); Keyishian v. Board\n\nof Regents of the University of the State of New York, 385 U.S.\n\n589, 596 (1967) (noting that abandonment of requirement that\n\nemployees disclaim membership in Communist party did not render\n\nchallenge to constitutionality of procedure moot where underlying\n\nstatutes and regulations remained).          The plaintiffs’ challenge to\n\nthe substance of Framework 14 is not moot.\n\n           As to their procedural challenge to Framework 14, CLF and\n\nOceana   begin   their   response   to     NMFS’s   mootness   arguments   by\n\nacknowledging that Framework 15 was promulgated in a procedurally\n\nproper manner.    Yet, the plaintiffs argue, their challenge remains\n\nlive because NMFS’s conduct is “capable of repetition, yet evading\n\nreview.”   See Gulf of Maine, 292 F.3d at 88-89 (quoting Weinstein\n\nv. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975)). The defendants again point\n\nto Gulf of Maine, in which we rejected the application of this\n\nexception and found the issue moot.          See id. at 89.\n\n           Although the parties present compelling arguments on both\n\nsides of the debate, we find that a more straightforward resolution\n\nof the issue is readily available on the facts of this case.           NMFS\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fhas not shown, as it must, that the alleged procedural deficiency\n\nwill not recur.   See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.\n\nServs., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (requiring, in cases involving\n\nvoluntary cessation of challenged conduct, that party claiming\n\nmootness satisfy heavy burden of demonstrating that allegedly\n\nwrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur).           To\n\nthe contrary, NMFS maintains that the Magnuson-Stevens Act does not\n\nrequire notice and comment for framework adjustments.            Likewise,\n\nNMFS argues that its routine waivers of notice and comment under\n\nthe APA have been wholly proper.8       The fact that NMFS voluntarily\n\nprovided a public notice period in promulgating Framework 15\n\ntherefore does not suggest a change of heart as to whether the\n\nprocess   was   legally   required.      Rather,   as   NMFS’s     counsel\n\nacknowledged at oral argument, the public notice period preceding\n\n\n     8\n      NMFS has waived notice and comment for “good cause” in\npromulgating all but two of the first fourteen framework\nadjustments.   See 66 Fed. Reg. 24,052, 24,055 (May 11, 2001)\n(Framework 14); 65 Fed. Reg. 37,903, 37,909-10 (June 19, 2000)\n(Framework 13); 65 Fed. Reg. 11,478, 11,479 (Mar. 3, 2000)\n(Framework 12); 64 Fed. Reg. 31,144, 31,148 (June 10, 1999)\n(Framework 11); 63 Fed. Reg. 45,939, 45,940 (Aug. 28, 1998)\n(Framework 10); 62 Fed. Reg. 43,469, 43,470 (Aug. 14, 1997)\n(Framework 9); 61 Fed. Reg. 38,404, 38,405 (July 24, 1996)\n(Framework 8); 61 Fed. Reg. 8490, 8491-92 (Mar. 5, 1996) (Framework\n7); 60 Fed. Reg. 35,513, 35,514 (July 10, 1995) (Framework 6); 60\nFed. Reg. 33,757, 33,758 (June 29, 1995) (Framework 5); 59 Fed.\nReg. 59,967, 59,968 (Nov. 21, 1994) (Framework 2); 59 Fed. Reg.\n36,720, 36,722 (July 19, 1994) (Framework 1).        The framework\nadjustment procedure, as set forth in Amendment 4 to the scallop\nFMP, contemplates that the Secretary of Commerce will “waive for\ngood cause the requirement for a proposed rule and opportunity for\npublic comment in the Federal Register” because “the Council\nprocess will adequately satisfy that requirement.”\n\n                                 -11-\n\fthe enactment of Framework 15 was provided “out of an abundance of\n\ncaution” in light of this appeal.          Under these circumstances,\n\nNMFS’s voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct does not\n\nrender the challenge moot.    See Adams v. Bowater, Inc., 313 F.3d\n\n611, 613-15 (1st Cir. 2002) (issue not moot where a recurrence of\n\nthe challenged conduct is highly likely).\n\nB.        Merits\n\n          Concluding as we do that the issues before the district\n\ncourt continue to present a live controversy on appeal, we turn to\n\nthe merits of the case.      The district court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment is subject to de novo review.      See Associated Fisheries,\n\n127 F.3d at 109.   In the administrative law context, however, this\n\nreview is limited, even at the summary judgment stage.        See id.\n\nThis is because the Magnuson-Stevens Act adopts the APA standard of\n\nreview, which permits a court to upset an agency action only if it\n\nis arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law.       See id.\n\n(citing 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D)).         Therefore, our task is to\n\ndetermine whether the action “was consonant with [the agency’s]\n\nstatutory powers, reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence\n\nin the record.”    Id.\n\n          1.       Substantive challenge\n\n          CLF and Oceana contend that Framework 14 is arbitrary and\n\ncapricious in failing to mandate the closure of scallop-harvesting\n\nin four areas.     To succeed on this claim, they must demonstrate\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fthat NMFS lacked a rational basis for adopting the framework.            See\n\nAssociated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).   That showing may be made where “the agency relied\n\non improper factors, failed to consider pertinent aspects of the\n\nproblem, offered a rationale contradicting the evidence before it,\n\nor reached a conclusion so implausible that it cannot be attributed\n\nto a difference of opinion or the application of agency expertise.”\n\nId.\n\n            Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS has a duty to\n\nminimize to the extent practicable (1) adverse effects on essential\n\nfish habitat (“EFH”),9 16 U.S.C. § 1853(a)(7); and (2) bycatch\n\n(fish that are caught but not sold or kept for personal use) and\n\nbycatch mortality, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1851(a)(9), 1853(a)(11).                 The\n\nplaintiffs argue that NMFS violated these statutory obligations in\n\nrejecting the closure of the four fishing areas.            As they see it,\n\nNMFS’s decision was irreconcilable with record evidence that the\n\nclosures would be beneficial with respect to EFH and bycatch.            The\n\nplaintiffs also fault NMFS’s analysis, claiming that the agency\n\nignored relevant factors they should have considered and failed to\n\narticulate   a   rational   basis    for   declining   to    implement   the\n\nclosures.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n      EFH refers to “those waters and substrate necessary to fish\nfor spawning, breeding, feeding or growth to maturity.” 16 U.S.C.\n§ 1802(10).\n\n                                    -13-\n\f             These arguments are flawed to the extent that they\n\nconsider the closure alternative in isolation, discounting numerous\n\nother restrictions on scallop fishing imposed by Framework 14. See\n\nCLF, 229 F. Supp. 2d at 34 (noting that Framework 14 maintained\n\nclosures     of    three   large   scallop   fishing   areas,    as    well   as\n\n“restrictions on days at sea, catch and mesh sizes, and seasonal\n\naccess to sensitive areas”).        Moreover, the plaintiffs essentially\n\ncall   for    an     interpretation     of   the   statute      that   equates\n\n“practicability” with “possibility,” requiring NMFS to implement\n\nvirtually any measure that addresses EFH and bycatch concerns so\n\nlong as it is feasible.        Although the distinction between the two\n\nmay sometimes be fine, there is indeed a distinction.              The closer\n\none gets to the plaintiffs' interpretation, the less weighing and\n\nbalancing is permitted.        We think by using the term \"practicable\"\n\nCongress intended rather to allow for the application of agency\n\nexpertise and discretion in determining how best to manage fishery\n\nresources.\n\n             We also note that CLF's and Oceana's characterization of\n\nthe record is somewhat faulty. NMFS in fact considered the closure\n\nalternative and other potential management measures in a Final\n\nSupplemental Environmental Impact Statement (“FSEIS”) that analyzed\n\nthe probable effects of Framework 14.          The FSEIS concluded, inter\n\nalia, that the closures would provide only limited, short-term\n\nbenefits to habitat.        These benefits would be “mitigated to some\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fdegree” because other (non-scallop) fishing would continue in the\n\nclosed areas.        The FSEIS also found that (1) implementing no new\n\nclosures would have a greater economic benefit for the fishing\n\nseasons Framework 14 was intended to address than would the closure\n\nalternative, and (2) any long-term benefits that might accrue as a\n\nresult of closures were uncertain and might not outweigh the\n\nbenefits of forgoing new closures.            It is not our role to second\n\nguess these determinations.           See Associated Fisheries, 127 F.3d at\n\n109 (“Even      if   a    reviewing   court   disagrees   with   the   agency’s\n\nconclusions, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the\n\nagency.”). On this record, the plaintiffs have not shown that NMFS\n\nacted irrationally in implementing Framework 14 without imposing\n\nadditional closures.\n\n           2.            Procedural challenge\n\n                         a.   The Magnuson-Stevens Act\n\n           The plaintiffs argue that NMFS’s failure to provide a\n\npublic comment period in developing Framework 14 violated the\n\nMagnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1854(b)(1)(A).             Section 1854(b)\n\nrequires notice and comment for regulations prepared under 16\n\nU.S.C. § 1853(c), namely regulations that are deemed necessary to\n\n“implementing a fishery management plan or fishery management plan\n\namendment,” or to modifying such regulations.               See 16 U.S.C. §\n\n1853(c).   The district court distinguished § 1853(c) “regulations”\n\nfrom framework adjustments, looking to neighboring § 1855(f) for\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\finterpretive guidance.            See CLF, 229 F. Supp. 2d at 33.    There,\n\nCongress drew a distinction between “regulations promulgated by the\n\nSecretary” and “actions that are taken by the Secretary under\n\nregulations which implement a fishery management plan.”              See 16\n\nU.S.C. § 1855(f)(2).\n\n            Recognizing that a framework adjustment such as Framework\n\n14 was implemented through an action of the Secretary of Commerce\n\n(by his designee) after a finding by the Council that a formal\n\nregulation was “neither necessary [n]or appropriate,” the district\n\ncourt     concluded        that    framework   adjustments   are    properly\n\ncharacterized as “actions,” not regulations.          CLF, 229 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 33.    The court found, therefore, that framework adjustments are\n\nnot subject to the public comment requirements of § 1854(b).            See\n\nid. at 33-34.    The plaintiffs have not presented us with any basis\n\nfor doubting the correctness of the court’s analysis, so we affirm\n\nits ruling on the basis of its sound reasoning.10\n\n                      b.     The APA\n\n            In the alternative, the plaintiffs allege procedural harm\n\nunder the APA because NMFS failed to demonstrate “good cause” for\n\n\n\n     10\n      Because we find that the statute distinguishes between\nregulations and actions, and the framework adjustment process\neasily fits into the latter category, we look no further. We are\nnot persuaded that, as the plaintiffs contend, the legislative\nhistory of § 1853(c) suggests an intent that framework adjustments\nundergo public comment. See CLF/Oceana Br. at 38-39 (citing S.\nRep. No. 194-276, at 18-19 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n4073, 4091).\n\n                                       -16-\n\fwaiving notice and comment.           See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B).       They\n\ncharacterize Framework 14's statement of the grounds for waiver as\n\nmere “boilerplate.”11       See n.8, above; Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\nInc. v. Evans, 316 F.3d 904, 912 (9th Cir. 2003).           Even if we were\n\nto agree with the plaintiffs on this point, however, any error on\n\nNMFS’s part was harmless.        See Riverbend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan,\n\n958 F.2d 1479, 1487 (9th Cir. 1992) (“The APA requires that we take\n\n‘due account’ of the harmless error rule.”); see also Save Our\n\nHeritage, Inc. v. FAA, 269 F.3d 49, 61 (1st Cir. 2001)(“The\n\ndoctrine of harmless error is as much a part of judicial review of\n\nadministrative     action   as   of    appellate   review   of   trial   court\n\njudgments”).      We reach such a conclusion because, based on this\n\nrecord, the omission of a formal public comment period “clearly had\n\nno bearing on the procedure used or the substance of [the] decision\n\nreached.”      Riverbend Farms, 958 F.2d at 1487 (quoting Sagebrush\n\n\n\n     11\n          Framework 14's waiver of notice and comment stated:\n\n             [B]ecause public meetings held by the Council\n             to discuss the management measures implemented\n             by this final rule provided adequate prior\n             notice and opportunity for public comment,\n             further notice and opportunity to comment on\n             this final rule is unnecessary.     Therefore,\n             the [Assistant Administrator for Fisheries],\n             under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)[3](B) finds good cause\n             exists to waive prior notice and additional\n             opportunity for public comment.\n\n66 Fed. Reg. 24,052, 24,055 (May 11, 2001).      Waivers in eleven\nprior frameworks used similar, though not identical, language. See\nn.8, above.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fRebellion, Inc. v. Hodel, 790 F.2d 760, 764-65 (9th Cir. 1986));\n\nsee also Little Bay Lobster Co, Inc. v. Evans, 352 F.3d 462, 468\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             Here, the development of Framework 14 generated fourteen\n\npublic meetings.      See 66 Fed. Reg. 24,052, 24,054 (May 11, 2001).\n\nNMFS followed its procedures for framework adjustments as set forth\n\nat 50 C.F.R. § 648.55, a process with which the plaintiffs were\n\nfamiliar.      See Riverbend Farms, 958 F.2d at 1487-88 (finding\n\ntechnical noncompliance with notice requirements under Federal Land\n\nPolicy Management Act constituted harmless error where “all parties\n\nbefore [the court] knew the ground rules” of the agency’s weekly\n\nprocedures).      The preparation of a supplemental environmental\n\nimpact statement      afforded   additional   opportunities     for   public\n\nparticipation usually unavailable during the framework adjustment\n\nprocess.12    The plaintiffs took advantage of these opportunities,\n\nsubmitting written and oral comments prior to and during Council\n\nmeetings.13     The   plaintiffs   contend    that   their   comments   were\n\n\n     12\n      See Notice of Availability of Draft EIS for Framework 14, 65\nFed. Reg. 77,025, 77,026 (Dec. 8, 2000) (accepting comments until\nJan. 24, 2001); Notice of Intent to prepare a Supplemental\nEnvironmental Impact Statement; request for comments, 65 Fed. Reg.\n60,396, 60397 (Oct. 11, 2000) (accepting comments until November\n13, 2000).\n     13\n      See J.A. at 178-186 (Nov. 13, 2000 letter from Oceana\nrepresentative); 189-192 (participation of CLF and Oceana\nrepresentatives at November 14, 2000 Council meeting); 217-222\n(Jan. 22, 2001 letter from Oceana representative); 443-49 (Jan. 23,\n2001   letter   from   CLF   and   Oceana   representatives);   268\n(participation of Oceana representative at Jan. 25, 2001 Council\n\n                                   -18-\n\fignored, and that, had formal notice and comment occurred, NMFS\n\nmight     have    decided   to   explore    their   suggested   alternatives\n\nfurther.14       CLF/Oceana Br. at 44 (“Had NMFS taken public comment,\n\nNMFS might have overruled the council and adopted more protective\n\nmeasures.”).        The administrative record does not bear this out,\n\nhowever.     For example, two March 2001 decision memoranda from\n\nNMFS’s     Regional     Administrator       to   NOAA’s   Acting   Assistant\n\nAdministrator for Fisheries analyze the concerns raised by the\n\nplaintiffs.        These analyses occurred before Framework 14 was\n\nfinalized.        The plaintiffs disregard the significance of this\n\nagency-level consideration of their concerns, choosing to emphasize\n\nthe ways that the Council may have slighted them procedurally.15\n\nFurther, the plaintiffs fail to identify any comment that they were\n\nprevented from making because of this alleged procedural defect\n\nthat would have made a difference in the result.             See Little Bay\n\nLobster, 352 F.3d at 468.         The plaintiffs have demonstrated that\n\n\n\nmeeting).\n     14\n      The plaintiffs also rely heavily on Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 316 F.3d at 912, in which the Ninth Circuit found\nthat NMFS made an insufficient showing of good cause to waive the\nAPA public comment period. In that case, however, neither party\nbriefed the issue of harmless error. See id. at 912 n.10. The\ncourt interpreted this silence as an admission by NMFS that some\nprejudice resulted.    See id.    NMFS has not made a comparable\nadmission here.\n     15\n      The plaintiffs alleged that, because public comment periods\nclosed the day before Council meetings, the Council was not giving\ndue consideration to their concerns.\n\n                                     -19-\n\fsome of their suggestions were rejected, but not that they were\n\nignored. In this context, the difference is important.   We find no\n\nprejudice.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -20-\n\f",

First, they alleged that NMFS failed to meet its substantive management obligations under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1851(a)(9), 1853(a)(7) &amp; (a)(11), and the APA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Second, they claimed that NMFS's failure to provide a 15-day public comment period violated the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1854(b), and the APA, 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 553, 706(2)(D).

The defendants contend that the expiration of Framework 14 rendered this case moot. <i>See Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance v. Daley,</i> 292 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir.2002). As the parties invoking the mootness doctrine, the defendants bear a \"heavy\" burden in attempting to establish its applicability. <i>Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat,</i> 317 F.3d 45, 61 (1st Cir.2003). And should they merely cease voluntarily the conduct originally challenged, they must demonstrate that it is \"absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v.

In that case, an organization of commercial fishermen alleged that a framework was both procedurally deficient for lack of adequate notice and comment and substantively unlawful because of its closure of inshore fishing areas. <i>See id.</i> The appellant urged us to find that the alleged harms continued, despite the promulgation of subsequent frameworks, and that the issues therefore were not moot. <i>See id.</i> at 88. We rejected that argument, concluding that the promulgation of a new framework in compliance with procedural guidelines and based on new data rendered the challenges to the superseded framework moot. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CLF and Oceana respond with arguments similar to those made by the appellant in <i>Gulf of Maine.</i> As to their substantive challenge to Framework 14, they contend that the harms caused by NMFS's failure to close the four fishing areas were perpetuated through Framework 15. This, they say, means that their substantive claim remains live, and for support they rely heavily on <i>Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America v. City of Jacksonville,</i> 508 U.S. 656, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993). There, a challenged ordinance that accorded preferential treatment to minority businesses for city contracts was repealed and replaced with a modified version weeks after the Supreme Court had granted certiorari. <i>See id.</i> at 660-61, 113 S.Ct. 2297 (noting three alterations in ordinance, including adoption of five- to sixteen-percent \"participation goals\" in place of ten percent \"set-aside\" of city contracts earmarked for minority businesses). These modifications were not enough to render the controversy moot. The Supreme Court concluded that \"[t]here is no mere risk that [the city] will repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct; it has already done so.\" <i>Id.</i> at 662, 113 S.Ct. 2297.

And as a practical matter, it appears that Framework 15 was designed merely to maintain the status quo until NMFS could complete a more comprehensive overhaul of its management measures through an amendment to the scallop FMP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> NMFS states that Framework 15 is based on entirely new data about the condition of the scallop resource, NMFS Br. at 23, 27-28; <i>cf. Gulf of Maine,</i> 292 F.3d at 88, but it identifies no portion of the record to support this assertion. <i>See Mulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co.,</i> 335 F.3d 15, 28 (1st Cir. 2003) (declining to consider argument where litigant \"ma[de] no attempt either to marshal the pertinent facts or to engage in reasoned analysis\"); <i>see also United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). In any event, we have studied the record with care and cannot tell whether and to what extent Framework 15 was developed with new underlying data. Consequently, we cannot say that the challenged conduct will not recur or has not already recurred. <i>See Northeastern Florida,</i> 508 U.S. at 662, 113 S.Ct. 2297.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether we characterize the expiration of Framework 14 as a \"voluntary cessation\" of conduct by NMFS subject to the same standards as in <i>Northeastern Florida,</i> the core question Article III compels us to ask is whether our adjudication of the issue can grant meaningful relief. <i>Cf. Gulf of Maine,</i> 292 F.3d at 88. Here, it appears that the same allegedly harmful scheme continues. No matter how the issue is framed, we have no difficulty concluding that, where a challenged regulation continues to the extent that it is only superficially altered by a subsequent regulation, we are capable of meaningful review. <i>See Schall v. Martin,</i> 467 U.S. 253, 257 n. 2, 104 S.Ct. 2403, 81 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984) (concluding that changes in general statutory scheme did not moot challenge where contested provision remained the same); <i>Brockington v. Rhodes,</i> 396 U.S. 41, 43, 90 S.Ct. 206, 24 L.Ed.2d 209 (1969) (per curiam) (finding that suit attacking requirement that nominating petitions be signed by seven percent of voters on ground that no more than one percent could be required was not mooted by new statute reducing signature requirement to four percent); <i>Keyishian v. Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York,</i> 385 U.S. 589, 596, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967) (noting that abandonment of requirement that employees disclaim membership in Communist party did not render challenge to constitutionality of procedure moot where underlying statutes and regulations remained). The plaintiffs' challenge to the substance of Framework 14 is not moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to their procedural challenge to Framework 14, CLF and Oceana begin their response to NMFS's mootness arguments by acknowledging that Framework 15 was promulgated in a procedurally proper manner. Yet, the plaintiffs argue, their challenge remains live because NMFS's conduct is \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <i>See Gulf of Maine,</i> 292 F.3d at 88-89 (quoting <i>Weinstein v. Bradford,</i> 423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S.Ct. 347, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975)). The defendants again point to <i>Gulf of Maine,</i> in which we rejected the application of this exception and found the issue moot. <i>See id.</i> at 89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties present compelling arguments on both sides of the debate, we find that a more straightforward resolution of the issue is readily available on the facts of this case. NMFS has not shown, as it must, that the alleged procedural deficiency will not recur. <i>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 189, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (requiring, in cases involving voluntary cessation of challenged conduct, that party claiming mootness satisfy heavy burden of demonstrating that allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur). To the contrary, NMFS maintains that the Magnuson-Stevens Act does not require notice and comment for framework adjustments. Likewise, NMFS argues that its routine waivers of notice and comment under the APA have been wholly proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The fact that NMFS voluntarily provided a public notice period in promulgating Framework 15 therefore does not suggest a change of heart as to whether the process was legally required. Rather, as NMFS's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, the public notice period preceding the enactment of Framework 15 was provided \"out of an abundance of caution\" in light of this appeal. Under these circumstances, NMFS's voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct does not render the challenge moot. <i>See Adams v. Bowater, Inc.,</i> 313 F.3d 611, 613-15 (1st Cir.2002) (issue not moot where a recurrence of the challenged conduct is highly likely).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Merits</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concluding as we do that the issues before the district court continue to present a live controversy on appeal, we turn to the merits of the case. The district court's entry of summary judgment is subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See Associated Fisheries,</i> 127 F.3d at 109. In the administrative law context, however, this review is limited, even at the summary judgment stage. <i>See id.</i> This is because the Magnuson-Stevens Act adopts the APA standard of review, which permits a court to upset an agency action only if it is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law. <i>See id.</i> (citing 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A)-(D)). Therefore, our task is to determine whether the action \"was consonant with [the agency's] statutory powers, reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Substantive challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CLF and Oceana contend that Framework 14 is arbitrary and capricious in failing to mandate the closure of scallop-harvesting in four areas. To succeed on this claim, they must demonstrate that NMFS lacked a rational basis for adopting the framework. <i>See Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley,</i> 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.1997). That showing may be made where \"the agency relied on improper factors, failed to consider pertinent aspects of the problem, offered a rationale contradicting the evidence before it, or reached a conclusion so implausible that it cannot be attributed to a difference of opinion or the application of agency expertise.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS has a duty to minimize to the extent practicable (1) adverse effects on essential fish habitat (\"EFH\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1853(a)(7); and (2) bycatch (fish that are caught but not sold or kept for personal use) and bycatch mortality, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1851(a)(9), 1853(a)(11). The plaintiffs argue that NMFS violated these statutory obligations in rejecting the closure of the four fishing areas. As they see it, NMFS's decision was irreconcilable with record evidence that the closures would be beneficial with respect to EFH and bycatch. The plaintiffs also fault NMFS's analysis, claiming that the agency ignored relevant factors they should have considered and failed to articulate a rational basis for declining to implement the closures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments are flawed to the extent that they consider the closure alternative in isolation, discounting numerous other restrictions on scallop fishing imposed by Framework 14. <i>See CLF,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 34 (noting that Framework 14 maintained closures of three large scallop fishing areas, as well as \"restrictions on days at sea, catch and mesh sizes, and seasonal access to sensitive areas\"). Moreover, the plaintiffs essentially call for an interpretation of the statute that equates \"practicability\" with \"possibility,\" requiring NMFS to implement virtually any measure that addresses EFH and bycatch concerns so long as it is feasible. Although the distinction between the two may sometimes be fine, there is indeed a distinction. The closer one gets to the plaintiffs' interpretation, the less weighing and balancing is permitted. We think by using the term \"practicable\" Congress intended rather to allow for the application of agency expertise and discretion in determining how best to manage fishery resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that CLF's and Oceana's characterization of the record is somewhat faulty. NMFS in fact considered the closure alternative and other potential management measures in a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (\"FSEIS\") that analyzed the probable effects of Framework 14. The FSEIS concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that the closures would provide only limited, short-term benefits to habitat. These benefits would be \"mitigated to some degree\" because other (non-scallop) fishing would continue in the closed areas. The FSEIS also found that (1) implementing no new closures would have a greater economic benefit for the fishing seasons Framework 14 was intended to address than would the closure alternative, and (2) any long-term benefits that might accrue as a result of closures were uncertain and might not outweigh the benefits of forgoing new closures. It is not our role to second guess these determinations. <i>See Associated Fisheries,</i> 127 F.3d at 109 (\"Even if a reviewing court disagrees with the agency's conclusions, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\"). On this record, the plaintiffs have not shown that NMFS acted irrationally in implementing Framework 14 without imposing additional closures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Section 1854(b) requires notice and comment for regulations prepared under 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1853(c), namely regulations that are deemed necessary to \"implementing a fishery management plan or fishery management plan amendment,\" or to modifying such regulations. <i>See</i> 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1853(c). The district court distinguished &#167; 1853(c) \"regulations\" from framework adjustments, looking to neighboring &#167; 1855(f) for interpretive guidance. <i>See CLF,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 33. There, Congress drew a distinction between \"regulations promulgated by the Secretary\" and \"actions that are taken by the Secretary under regulations which implement a fishery management plan.\" <i>See</i> 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1855(f)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that a framework adjustment such as Framework 14 was implemented through an action of the Secretary of Commerce (by his designee) after a finding by the Council that a formal regulation was \"neither necessary [n]or appropriate,\" the district court concluded that framework adjustments are properly characterized as \"actions,\" not regulations. <i>CLF,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 33. The court found, therefore, that framework adjustments are not subject to the public comment requirements of &#167; 1854(b). <i>See id.</i> at 33-34.

Council, Inc. v. Evans,</i> 316 F.3d 904, 912 (9th Cir.2003). Even if we were to agree with the plaintiffs on this point, however, any error on NMFS's part was harmless. <i>See Riverbend Farms, Inc. v. Madigan,</i> 958 F.2d 1479, 1487 (9th Cir. 1992) (\"The APA requires that we take `due account' of the harmless error rule.\"); <i>see also Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. FAA,</i> 269 F.3d 49, 61 (1st Cir.2001)(\"The doctrine of harmless error is as much a part of judicial review of administrative action as of appellate review of trial court judgments\"). We reach such a conclusion because, based on this record, the omission of a formal public comment period \"clearly had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of [the] decision reached.\" <i>Riverbend Farms,</i> 958 F.2d at 1487 (quoting <i>Sagebrush Rebellion, Inc. v.

NMFS followed its procedures for framework adjustments as set forth at 50 C.F.R. &#167; 648.55, a process with which the plaintiffs were familiar. <i>See Riverbend Farms,</i> 958 F.2d at 1487-88 (finding technical noncompliance with notice requirements under Federal Land Policy Management Act constituted harmless error where \"all parties before [the court] knew the ground rules\" of the agency's weekly procedures). The preparation of a supplemental environmental impact statement afforded additional opportunities for public participation usually unavailable during the framework adjustment process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The plaintiffs took advantage of these opportunities, submitting written and oral comments prior to and during Council meetings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The plaintiffs contend that their comments were ignored, and that, had formal notice and comment occurred, NMFS might have decided to explore their suggested alternatives further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> CLF/Oceana Br. at 44 (\"Had NMFS taken public comment, NMFS might have overruled the council and adopted more protective measures.\"). The administrative record does not bear this out, however. For example, two March 2001 decision memoranda from NMFS's Regional Administrator to NOAA's Acting Assistant Administrator for Fisheries analyze the concerns raised by the plaintiffs. These analyses occurred before Framework 14 was finalized. The plaintiffs disregard the significance of this agency-level consideration of their concerns, choosing to emphasize the ways that the Council may have slighted them procedurally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Further, the plaintiffs fail to identify any comment that they were prevented from making because of this alleged procedural defect that would have made a difference in the result. <i>See Little Bay Lobster,</i> 352 F.3d at 468. The plaintiffs have demonstrated that some of their suggestions were rejected, but not that they were ignored. In this context, the difference is important.

The New England Fishery Management Council (the \"Council\") manages the Atlantic sea scallop fishery, which extends from Maine to North Carolina. The Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan was created in 1982, and since has been amended several times. In 1993, Amendment 4 to the scallop FMP established a procedure whereby management measures could be altered through so-called \"framework adjustments\" to respond to the changing needs of the fishery. This procedure allowed the Council to develop, over the course of two public Council meetings, a framework adjustment that is submitted to the Regional Administrator of NMFS for review.

The district court found that Framework 14 was lawful. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 31, 2001, the plaintiffs initiated an action challenging Framework 14, a rule that adjusted certain restrictions on sea scallop fishing in the Atlantic coastal waters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The plaintiffs challenged Framework 14 on both substantive and procedural grounds. First, they alleged that NMFS failed to meet its substantive management obligations under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1851(a)(9), 1853(a)(7) &amp; (a)(11), and the APA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Second, they claimed that NMFS's failure to provide a 15-day public comment period violated the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1854(b), and the APA, 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 553, 706(2)(D). The plaintiffs asked the district court to declare Framework 14 in violation of the governing statutes and to \"remand\" it with the requirement that NMFS remedy the alleged deficiencies. They also sought their fees, costs, and expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2001, the parties submitted to the district court a joint proposal for briefing and discovery. <i>See</i> Local Rule 16.1. In the proposal, the plaintiffs requested that the court expedite the case pursuant to 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1855(f)(4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Over the next few months, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court heard argument on the motions in May 2002. By September 2002, no decision had issued, and the plaintiffs renewed their request to expedite the case, alerting the court to the fact that Framework 14 would expire by its own terms in March 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2002, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants' motions. <i>See Conservation Law Found. v.

The court found that the Magnuson-Stevens Act did not mandate public comment for a rule such as Framework 14 and that the public comment period required under the APA had been waived for good cause. <i>See id.</i> at 34 n. 10. The court also concluded that NMFS had considered the substantive issues raised by the plaintiffs and did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in implementing Framework 14. <i>See id.</i> at 34. The plaintiffs appealed.

In that case, an organization of commercial fishermen alleged that a framework was both procedurally deficient for lack of adequate notice and comment and substantively unlawful because of its closure of inshore fishing areas. <i>See id.</i> The appellant urged us to find that the alleged harms continued, despite the promulgation of subsequent frameworks, and that the issues therefore were not moot. <i>See id.</i> at 88. We rejected that argument, concluding that the promulgation of a new framework in compliance with procedural guidelines and based on new data rendered the challenges to the superseded framework moot. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CLF and Oceana respond with arguments similar to those made by the appellant in <i>Gulf of Maine.</i> As to their substantive challenge to Framework 14, they contend that the harms caused by NMFS's failure to close the four fishing areas were perpetuated through Framework 15. This, they say, means that their substantive claim remains live, and for support they rely heavily on <i>Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America v.

And as a practical matter, it appears that Framework 15 was designed merely to maintain the status quo until NMFS could complete a more comprehensive overhaul of its management measures through an amendment to the scallop FMP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> NMFS states that Framework 15 is based on entirely new data about the condition of the scallop resource, NMFS Br. at 23, 27-28; <i>cf. Gulf of Maine,</i> 292 F.3d at 88, but it identifies no portion of the record to support this assertion. <i>See Mulvihill v.

In any event, we have studied the record with care and cannot tell whether and to what extent Framework 15 was developed with new underlying data. Consequently, we cannot say that the challenged conduct will not recur or has not already recurred. <i>See Northeastern Florida,</i> 508 U.S. at 662, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

NMFS has not shown, as it must, that the alleged procedural deficiency will not recur. <i>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.

To the contrary, NMFS maintains that the Magnuson-Stevens Act does not require notice and comment for framework adjustments. Likewise, NMFS argues that its routine waivers of notice and comment under the APA have been wholly proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The fact that NMFS voluntarily provided a public notice period in promulgating Framework 15 therefore does not suggest a change of heart as to whether the process was legally required. Rather, as NMFS's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, the public notice period preceding the enactment of Framework 15 was provided \"out of an abundance of caution\" in light of this appeal. Under these circumstances, NMFS's voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct does not render the challenge moot. <i>See Adams v.

The district court's entry of summary judgment is subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See Associated Fisheries,</i> 127 F.3d at 109. In the administrative law context, however, this review is limited, even at the summary judgment stage. <i>See id.</i> This is because the Magnuson-Stevens Act adopts the APA standard of review, which permits a court to upset an agency action only if it is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law. <i>See id.</i> (citing 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A)-(D)). Therefore, our task is to determine whether the action \"was consonant with [the agency's] statutory powers, reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Substantive challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CLF and Oceana contend that Framework 14 is arbitrary and capricious in failing to mandate the closure of scallop-harvesting in four areas. To succeed on this claim, they must demonstrate that NMFS lacked a rational basis for adopting the framework. <i>See Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197563\"><a href=\"/opinion/197563/associated-fisheries-v-us-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1997). That showing may be made where \"the agency relied on improper factors, failed to consider pertinent aspects of the problem, offered a rationale contradicting the evidence before it, or reached a conclusion so implausible that it cannot be attributed to a difference of opinion or the application of agency expertise.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS has a duty to minimize to the extent practicable (1) adverse effects on essential fish habitat (\"EFH\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1853(a)(7); and (2) bycatch (fish that are caught but not sold or kept for personal use) and bycatch mortality, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1851(a)(9), 1853(a)(11). The plaintiffs argue that NMFS violated these statutory obligations in rejecting the closure of the four fishing areas. As they see it, NMFS's decision was irreconcilable with record evidence that the closures would be beneficial with respect to EFH and bycatch. The plaintiffs also fault NMFS's analysis, claiming that the agency ignored relevant factors they should have considered and failed to articulate a rational basis for declining to implement the closures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments are flawed to the extent that they consider the closure alternative in isolation, discounting numerous other restrictions on scallop fishing imposed by Framework 14. <i>See CLF,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 34 (noting that Framework 14 maintained closures of three large scallop fishing areas, as well as \"restrictions on days at sea, catch and mesh sizes, and seasonal access to sensitive areas\"). Moreover, the plaintiffs essentially call for an interpretation of the statute that equates \"practicability\" with \"possibility,\" requiring NMFS to implement virtually any measure that addresses EFH and bycatch concerns so long as it is feasible. Although the distinction between the two may sometimes be fine, there is indeed a distinction. The closer one gets to the plaintiffs' interpretation, the less weighing and balancing is permitted. We think by using the term \"practicable\" Congress intended rather to allow for the application of agency expertise and discretion in determining how best to manage fishery resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that CLF's and Oceana's characterization of the record is somewhat faulty. NMFS in fact considered the closure alternative and other potential management measures in a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (\"FSEIS\") that analyzed the probable effects of Framework 14. The FSEIS concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that the closures would provide only limited, short-term benefits to habitat. These benefits would be \"mitigated to some degree\" because other (non-scallop) fishing would continue in the closed areas. The FSEIS also found that (1) implementing no new closures would have a greater economic benefit for the fishing seasons Framework 14 was intended to address than would the closure alternative, and (2) any long-term benefits that might accrue as a result of closures were uncertain and might not outweigh the benefits of forgoing new closures. It is not our role to second guess these determinations. <i>See Associated Fisheries,</i> 127 F.3d at 109 (\"Even if a reviewing court disagrees with the agency's conclusions, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\"). On this record, the plaintiffs have not shown that NMFS acted irrationally in implementing Framework 14 without imposing additional closures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Section 1854(b) requires notice and comment for regulations prepared under 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1853(c), namely regulations that are deemed necessary to \"implementing a fishery management plan or fishery management plan amendment,\" or to modifying such regulations. <i>See</i> 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1853(c). The district court distinguished &#167; 1853(c) \"regulations\" from framework adjustments, looking to neighboring &#167; 1855(f) for interpretive guidance. <i>See CLF,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 33. There, Congress drew a distinction between \"regulations promulgated by the Secretary\" and \"actions that are taken by the Secretary under regulations which implement a fishery management plan.\" <i>See</i> 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1855(f)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that a framework adjustment such as Framework 14 was implemented through an action of the Secretary of Commerce (by his designee) after a finding by the Council that a formal regulation was \"neither necessary [n]or appropriate,\" the district court concluded that framework adjustments are properly characterized as \"actions,\" not regulations. <i>CLF,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 33. The court found, therefore, that framework adjustments are not subject to the public comment requirements of &#167; 1854(b). <i>See id.</i> at 33-34.

NMFS followed its procedures for framework adjustments as set forth at 50 C.F.R. &#167; 648.55, a process with which the plaintiffs were familiar. <i>See Riverbend Farms,</i> 958 F.2d at 1487-88 (finding technical noncompliance with notice requirements under Federal Land Policy Management Act constituted harmless error where \"all parties before [the court] knew the ground rules\" of the agency's weekly procedures). The preparation of a supplemental environmental impact statement afforded additional opportunities for public participation usually unavailable during the framework adjustment process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The plaintiffs took advantage of these opportunities, submitting written and oral comments prior to and during Council meetings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The plaintiffs contend that their comments were ignored, and that, had formal notice and comment occurred, NMFS might have decided to explore their suggested alternatives further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> CLF/Oceana Br. at 44 (\"Had NMFS taken public comment, NMFS might have overruled the council and adopted more protective measures.\"). The administrative record does not bear this out, however. For example, two March 2001 decision memoranda from NMFS's Regional Administrator to NOAA's Acting Assistant Administrator for Fisheries analyze the concerns raised by the plaintiffs. These analyses occurred before Framework 14 was finalized. The plaintiffs disregard the significance of this agency-level consideration of their concerns, choosing to emphasize the ways that the Council may have slighted them procedurally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Further, the plaintiffs fail to identify any comment that they were prevented from making because of this alleged procedural defect that would have made a difference in the result. <i>See Little Bay Lobster,</i> 352 F.3d at 468. The plaintiffs have demonstrated that some of their suggestions were rejected, but not that they were ignored. In this context, the difference is important.

The New England Fishery Management Council (the \"Council\") manages the Atlantic sea scallop fishery, which extends from Maine to North Carolina. The Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan was created in 1982, and since has been amended several times. In 1993, Amendment 4 to the scallop FMP established a procedure whereby management measures could be altered through so-called \"framework adjustments\" to respond to the changing needs of the fishery. This procedure allowed the Council to develop, over the course of two public Council meetings, a framework adjustment that is submitted to the Regional Administrator of NMFS for review. Upon approval of the Regional Administrator, the framework adjustment becomes a final rule. <i>See</i> 50 C.F.R. &#167; 648.55 (setting forth framework adjustment procedures).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs also alleged violations of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4321-4347.
