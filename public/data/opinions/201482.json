Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Peter L. Duffy on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Barbara Healy\nSmith, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Memorandum in Support of Motion\nfor Summary Disposition.\n\n\n\n                               March 11, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam.   Peter L. Duffy, pro se, appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of his complaint brought under the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, on\n\nstatute of limitations grounds.        We have held that in cases where,\n\nas here, an ADEA claimant elects to bypass the administrative\n\nprocess   and   goes   directly   to   federal   court,    the   applicable\n\nlimitations period is two years from the date of the allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory act or practice.        Rossiter v. Potter, 357 F.3d 26,\n\n34 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             Duffy's claims are based on his removal from his position\n\nas Department Head and reassignment to a newly-created position\n\nwhich was \"meaningless.\"     He also maintains that he was improperly\n\ndenied the opportunity to compete for an advertised higher grade-\n\nlevel position.     Duffy asserts that the decision to replace and\n\nreassign him was made on June 8, 2000, that defendant \"dissuaded\"\n\nhim from applying for the advertised position on June 15, 2000, and\n\nthat   the    effective    date   of   his   removal,     replacement   and\n\nreassignment was January 7, 2001. Duffy did not file his complaint\n\nuntil March 1, 2004, well over two years after the acts of which he\n\ncomplains.    However, he argues that his claim did not accrue until\n\nDecember 9, 2003, when he discovered a transcript of an interview\n\nconducted years earlier which indicated that age discrimination was\n\nthe impetus\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\ffor   the   challenged      employment    decisions.        This      argument   is\n\nunavailing.\n\n            \"Under     federal   law     the    accrual     of   an    employment\n\ndiscrimination claim 'commences when a plaintiff knows, or has\n\nreason to know, of the discriminatory act,'\" Melendez-Arroyo v.\n\nCutler-Hammer de P.R.

Bank of Puerto Rico, 27 F.3d 746, 750 (1st\n\nCir. 1994)), not when he or she first learns that the act was based\n\non discriminatory factors or motives.            Chapman v. Homco, Inc., 886\n\nF.2d 756, 758 (5th Cir. 1989); see Thelan v. Marc's Big Boy Corp.,\n\n64 F.3d 264, 267 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"A plaintiff's action accrues\n\nwhen he discovers that he has been injured, not when he determines\n\nthat the injury was unlawful\"); Pacheco v. Rice, 966 F.2d 904, 906\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (applying same rule in Title VII case).                    \"[T]he\n\nplaintiff need not know all the facts that support his claim in\n\norder for countdown to commence.\"              Morris, 27 F.3d at 750; see\n\nPacheco, 966 F.2d at 907 (\"It is to be expected that some relevant\n\nfacts   will   come    to   light   after      the   date   of   an    employee's\n\ntermination--one purpose of filing an administrative complaint is\n\nto uncover them\").\n\n            Further,     although   Duffy      attempted    to     argue   in    the\n\ndistrict court that the statute of limitations should be equitably\n\ntolled, he appears to have abandoned that argument on appeal and he\n\nmakes no allegation that defendant affirmatively misled him or took\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fany action that lulled him into inaction.      There is therefore no\n\nbasis for equitable tolling.
